{"title": "Bayesian_(yacht)", "content": "\nDesign and construction\nBayesian was a flybridge sloop designed by Ron Holland [1] and built by Perini Navi with a 56 m (184 ft) long aluminium hull and superstructure and a single-masted cutter rig One of the world's largest sailing yachts, it was one of a number of similar vessels from this designer and shipyard, though the only one of their ten 56-metre series that, at the initial client's request, was not a two-masted [14] ketch The mast of 72 m (237 ft), as measured from the design waterline (DWL), was at the time of construction the world's tallest yacht mast and continues to be the world's tallest aluminium one The yacht had a retracting keel, allowing its draught to be reduced from 10 m (33 ft) to 4 m (13 ft) [7] It had a traditional aft cockpit and an additional 60 m2 (650 sq ft) fully-encloseable cockpit forward The interior was outfitted in Japanese style by the French company Rémi Tessier Design [15] The yacht won best interior at the International Superyacht Society Awards 2008, and best sailing yacht over 45 m (148 ft) at the 2009 World Superyacht Awards [16]\n\n\nHistory\nThe yacht, allocated IMO Number 9503392, was ordered by Dutch entrepreneur Eric Albada Jelgersma  [nl] (1939–2018), but in 2005 he was paralysed in a yachting accident; on completion it was sold in 2008 to Dutch property developer John Groenewoud and named Salute [1] [17] [18] In November 2014, it was sold to Revtom Ltd., an Isle of Man company owned by Angela Bacares, wife of the technology entrepreneur Mike Lynch, and renamed Bayesian, [1] [18] a reference to Bayesian inference, which was used in statistical machine learning by Lynch's company Autonomy Corporation [2] From then, the yacht was registered in the United Kingdom, with London as port of registry It was refitted in 2016 and again in 2020 and was managed since 2022 by Camper & Nicholsons International [1] [18] [19] The yacht had been put up for sale in the spring of 2024 but was withdrawn from the market in July for the summer [20]\n\n\nSinking and aftermath\nLynch was celebrating his acquittal for fraud in his trial in San Francisco and had invited lawyers, friends and associates to join him, his wife and their daughter, to visit the Aeolian Islands, off the northern coast of Sicily [21] Bayesian sank shortly before daybreak  on 19 August 2024 during a storm when anchored 300 metres (980 ft) off the port of Porticello, a small fishing village about 15 km (9.3 mi) east of Palermo, Sicily [21] [22] Admiral Raffaele Macauda of the Palermo coastguard said there was no storm alert for that evening and the weather forecast was of isolated thunderstorms but not of any extreme weather systems [23] [24] Karsten Borner, captain of Sir Robert Baden Powell anchored nearby said that, in the event, the wind was \"violent, very violent\" and thought it reached force 12 on the Beaufort scale — hurricane strength He said: \"It was tonnes of water coming down I never saw that before, there was a water tornado\" [24] Although early eyewitness accounts led to reports that the yacht had been struck by a waterspout, the Italian authorities said a downburst was more likely [25]\n\n\nSinking\nLynch was celebrating his acquittal for fraud in his trial in San Francisco and had invited lawyers, friends and associates to join him, his wife

tornado\" [24] Although early eyewitness accounts led to reports that the yacht had been struck by a waterspout, the Italian authorities said a downburst was more likely [25]\n\n\nRescue and recovery\nThe yacht had been carrying 10 crew and 12 passengers The 15 survivors were rescued from their inflatable life raft by Borner and his crew One body was recovered from the sea, while six people remained missing [29] [21] Divers from the fire and rescue service immediately began searching the wreck The task was challenging on account of the depth, which limited divers to eight minutes to work on the wreck They also found access to the cabins was blocked by furniture [21] Six bodies were eventually recovered from the interior of the yacht on 21, 22 and 23 August [30] [31] The yacht was lying on its right side on the sea-floor, and the bodies of the passengers were found in cabins on the left side where, investigators suggested, they had been taking refuge [32] Post-mortem examinations revealed that four of the deceased had no water in their lungs, suggesting they had died of asphyxiation, in an air pocket, some time after the sinking [33]\n\n\nSurvivors\nThe 15 survivors were Angela Bacares and five guests, captain James Cutfield, and eight other members of the crew [34] [35]\n\n\nDead\nOn 25 August, a special mass and candle-lit vigil were held for the victims in Porticello and wreaths were laid on the sea [38]\n\n\nSpeculation about causes\nIn the immediate aftermath of the sinking, there was media speculation about how Bayesian could have sunk so quickly, especially as a nearby yacht was undamaged in the storm [39] The editor of Sailing Today suggested that the exceptionally tall mast might have affected the yacht's stability, while the chair of the Maritime Search and Rescue Council described the sinking as a potential black swan event [39] A former captain of Bayesian said that ventilation ducts on the yacht were vulnerable to downflooding over 40-45 degrees of heel [8] A naval architect interviewed by a yachting magazine opined that the low positioning of the cockpits and a heavy salon door that could slide open were also possible ingress points for downflooding [40] Turkish TV interviewed a yacht builder who suggested that a hatch might have been open or that a door might have been open between watertight compartments, and an oceanographer who suggested that the wide beam might have contributed to the wind pinning the yacht and that the height of the mast might have prevented turtling after it capsized [41] A photograph that was taken from the Sir Robert Baden Powell, 14 minutes before the sinking, however, shows the large door on the port side of the hull was closed [42]\n\n\nJudicial investigation and salvage\nThe chief prosecutor of nearby Termini Imerese, Ambrogio Cartosio, initiated a judicial investigation into the sinking [30] On 26 August, the captain of the yacht was placed under investigation [45] On 28 August, two British crew members were also put under investigation [46] As Bayesian was a UK-registered vessel, the Marine Accident Investigation Branch also opened an investigation into the causes of the sinking and sent a team of four inspectors to Italy [47] [48] Cartosio said that there were plans to salvage Bayesian Under Italian law, the owner is responsible for the cost of salvage and the yacht would then be handed to the investigating authorities [49] The recovery cost will be covered by insurance while total claims related to the shipwreck could reach $150m, according to initial estimates by industry experts [50]\n\n\nSee also\n^a  From the site's technical data and plans section and downloadable brochure respectively [4]\n\n\nNotes\n^a  From the

designed by Ron Holland and built by Perini Navi. It was one of the world's largest sailing yachts, known for its exceptional design and innovative features. The yacht had a retracting keel, a traditional aft cockpit, and a fully-encloseable cockpit forward. Its interior was outfitted in Japanese style by the French company Rémi Tessier Design.\n\n**Design and Construction**\n\nThe Bayesian was designed to be a high-performance sailing yacht, with a focus on comfort and luxury. The yacht had a single-masted cutter rig, with a mast that stood at 72 meters (237 feet) tall, making it the world's tallest yacht mast at the time of construction. The mast was designed to be retractable, allowing the yacht to navigate through shallow waters. The yacht had a traditional aft cockpit and an additional 60 square meters (650 square feet) of fully-encloseable cockpit forward.\n\nThe interior of the yacht was designed to be luxurious and comfortable, with high-quality materials and finishes throughout. The interior was outfitted in Japanese style, with a focus on clean lines, minimal ornamentation, and a emphasis on natural materials such as wood and stone.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Bayesian was originally ordered by Dutch entrepreneur Eric Albada Jelgersma in 2005. However, in 2008, Jelgersma was paralyzed in a yachting accident, and the yacht was sold to Dutch property developer John Groenewoud. Groenewoud renamed the yacht Salute and used it for several years before selling it in 2014 to Revtom Ltd., an Isle of Man company owned by Angela Bacares, wife of technology entrepreneur Mike Lynch. The yacht was renamed Bayesian, a reference to Bayesian inference, which was used in statistical machine learning by Lynch's company Autonomy Corporation.\n\n**Sinking and Aftermath**\n\nOn August 19, 2024, the Bayesian sank during a storm while anchored off the port of Porticello, a small fishing village about 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) east of Palermo, Sicily. The yacht was carrying 10 crew and 12 passengers, and 15 survivors were rescued from their inflatable life raft by the crew of the nearby yacht Sir Robert Baden Powell. One body was recovered from the sea, while six people remained missing.\n\nThe investigation into the sinking of the Bayesian is ongoing, with the Italian authorities and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) conducting separate investigations. The MAIB has sent a team of four inspectors to Italy to investigate the causes of the sinking, and the recovery cost will be covered by insurance. Total claims related to the shipwreck could reach $150 million, according to initial estimates by industry experts.\n\n**Rescue and Recovery**\n\nThe 15 survivors were rescued from their inflatable life raft by the crew of the Sir Robert Baden Powell, who were alerted to the distress by the yacht's emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB). The survivors were taken aboard the Sir Robert Baden Powell and provided with medical attention and food.\n\nThe recovery of the bodies of the six missing passengers was a complex and challenging operation, with divers from the fire and rescue service searching the wreck of the Bayesian. The task was complicated by the depth of the water, which limited divers to eight minutes to work on the wreck. Access to the cabins was also blocked by furniture, making it difficult for the divers to recover the bodies.\n\n**Survivors**\n\nThe 15 survivors of the sinking of the Bayesian were rescued by the crew of the Sir Robert Baden Powell and taken aboard the yacht. They were provided with medical attention and food, and were later taken to a hospital in Palermo for further treatment. The survivors included Angela Bacares, wife of Mike Lynch, and five guests, as well as captain James Cutfield and eight other members of the crew.\n\n**Dead**\n\nThe six missing passengers of the Bayesian were presumed dead, and their bodies were later recovered from the wreckage of the yacht. A special mass and candle-lit vigil were held in Porticello for the victims, and wreaths were laid on the sea.\n\n**Speculation about Causes**\n\nThere is ongoing speculation about the causes of the sinking of the Bayesian, with several factors being considered. The exceptionally tall mast of the yacht may have affected its stability, and the low positioning of the cockpits and a heavy salon door that could slide open may have contributed to the ingress of water into the yacht. The wide beam of the yacht may have also contributed to the wind pinning the yacht, and the height of the mast may have prevented turtling after it capsized.\n\n**Judicial Investigation and Salvage**\n\nThe chief prosecutor of nearby Termini Imerese, Ambrogio Cartosio, initiated a judicial investigation into the sinking of the Bayesian. The captain of the yacht and two British crew members were placed under investigation, and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch also opened an investigation into the causes of the sinking.\n\nThe recovery of the Bayesian is ongoing, with plans to salvage the yacht. Under Italian law, the owner is responsible for the cost of salvage, and the yacht will be handed to the investigating authorities after the recovery is complete. The recovery cost will be covered by insurance, and total claims related to the shipwreck could reach $150 million, according to initial estimates by industry experts.\n\n**See also**\n\nThe sinking of the Bayesian is a significant maritime incident, and there are several other incidents and accidents that are related to the story.

aluminium hull and superstructure and a single-masted cutter rig One of the world's largest sailing yachts, it was one of a number of similar vessels from this designer and shipyard, though the only one of their ten 56-metre series that, at the initial client's request, was not a two-masted [14] ketch The mast of 72 m (237 ft), as measured from the design waterline (DWL), was at the time of construction the world's tallest yacht mast and continues to be the world's tallest aluminium one The yacht had a retracting keel, allowing its draught to be reduced from 10 m (33 ft) to 4 m (13 ft) [7] It had a traditional aft cockpit and an additional 60 m2 (650 sq ft) fully-encloseable cockpit forward The interior was outfitted in Japanese style by the French company Rémi Tessier Design [15]

and renamed Bayesian, [1] [18] a reference to Bayesian inference, which was used in statistical machine learning by Lynch's company Autonomy Corporation [2] From then, the yacht was registered in the United Kingdom, with London as port of registry It was refitted in 2016 and again in 2020 and was managed since 2022 by Camper & Nicholsons International [1] [18] [19] The yacht had been put up for sale in the spring of 2024 but was withdrawn from the market in July for the summer [20]\n\n\nSinking and aftermath\nLynch was celebrating his acquittal for fraud in his trial in San Francisco and had

restaurant/bar/pool hall/liquor store, the Sanitary Cafe [20] [21] His family is of Scots-Irish descent [22] [23] After graduating from D W Daniel High School, Graham became the first member of his family to attend college, and joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps When he was 21, his mother died of Hodgkin's lymphoma, aged 52, and his father died 15 months later of a heart attack, aged 69 [22] Because his then-13-year-old sister was left orphaned, the service allowed Graham to attend the University of South Carolina in Columbia so he could remain near home as his sister's legal guardian [13] During his studies, he became a member of the Pi Kappa Phi social fraternity [24]\n\n\nMilitary service\nUpon graduating from the University of South Carolina School of Law, Graham was commissioned as an officer in the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG Corps) in the United States Air Force in 1982 and began active duty that year His duty began with a stint as an Air Force defense attorney, after which he was transferred to Rhein-Main Air Base in Frankfurt, Germany, where from 1984 to 1988 he was the Air Force's chief prosecutor in Europe In 1984, as he was defending an Air Force pilot accused of using marijuana, he was featured in an episode of 60 Minutes that exposed the Air Force's defective drug-testing procedures [22] [26] After his service in Europe, he returned to South Carolina, leaving active duty in 1989 [27] and entering private practice as a lawyer [22] He served as assistant county attorney for Oconee County from 1988 to 1992 and city attorney for Central

2014, Graham was considered one of the most vulnerable to a primary challenge, largely due to his low approval ratings and reputation for working with and compromising with Democrats [55] [56] He expected a primary challenge from conservative activists, including the Tea Party movement, [57] and Chris Chocola, President of the Club for Growth, indicated that his organization would support a primary challenge if an acceptable standard-bearer emerged [58]\n\n\n2020\nDemocrat Jaime Harrison challenged Graham in the 2020 Senate election [63] The race was unexpectedly competitive, with many

called Donald Trump, then another presidential candidate, a \"jackass\" for saying that Graham's close friend, Senator John McCain, was \"not a war hero.\" Trump reacted by calling Graham an \"idiot\" and revealing Graham's personal cellphone number at a campaign rally, asking people to call Graham [70]\n\n\nReaction to 2020 presidential election results\nEven after all major news networks projected that Joe Biden had won the 2020 United States presidential election, Graham said that Trump \"should not concede\" because \"if Republicans don't challenge and change the U.S election system, there will never be another Republican president elected again\" [93] Graham said he donated $500,000 to Trump's election lawsuits in various states, [94] and that the option should be \"on the table\" for Republican state legislators to invalidate election results due to alleged \"corruption\" by appointing presidential electors who would vote for Trump [95]\n\n\n2024 election\nGraham appeared at Trump's first prime-time 2024 campaign rally on January 28, 2023, and told Fox News host Sean Hannity that he would support Trump \"because I know what I'm going to get\", mostly regarding perceived international threats [106]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nTea Party opponents have called Graham a \"moderate Republican.\" [10] [11] He calls himself a \"Reagan-style Republican\", and has been called a fairly conservative Republican with \"a twang of moderation\" and \"an independent streak.\" [7] [22] [26]\n\n\nSupreme Court nominations\nIn 2016, after Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died, Republican senators boycotted Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland Graham said that Supreme Court vacancies should never be filled in a presidential election year [110] and that \" [w]e are setting a precedent today, Republicans are.\" [111] He said that if a similar situation arose, \"you can use my words against me and you'd be absolutely right.\" [112] In an October 2018 interview, Graham said specifically that \" [i]f an opening comes in the last year of President Trump's term, and the primary process has started, we'll wait till the next election.\" [113]\n\n\nFree speech\nDuring an April 3, 2011, appearance on Face the Nation, [124] Graham \"suggested that Congress take unspecified though formal action against the Koran-burning by Florida preacher Terry Jones\", in light of an attack on United Nations personnel triggered by Jones's actions [125] Asserting that \"Congress might need to explore the need to limit some forms of freedom of speech\", [126] Graham argued, \"Free speech is a great idea, but we're in a war,\" and claimed that \"during World War II, we had limits on what you could say if it would inspire the enemy.\" [125] [127]\n\n\nGang of 14\nOn May 23, 2005, Graham was one of the so-called Gang of 14 senators forging a compromise that brought a halt to the continued blockage of an up-or-down vote on judicial nominees This compromise negated both the Democrats' use of a filibuster and the Republican \"nuclear option\" Under the agreement, the Democrats retained the power to filibuster a Bush judicial nominee only in an \"extraordinary circumstance\", and subsequently, three conservative Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William H Pryor Jr.) received a vote by the full Senate [128] [129]\n\n\nNational Security Agency surveillance\nIn response to the 2013 disclosures about the United States National Security Agency and its international partners' global surveillance of foreign nationals and U.S citizens, Graham said he was \"glad\" the NSA was collecting phone records He said, \"I'm a Verizon customer I don't mind Verizon turning over records to the government if the government is going to make sure that they try to match up a known terrorist phone with somebody in the United States I don't think you're talking to the terrorists I know you're not I know I'm not So we don't have anything to worry about.\" [130] [131]\n\n\nDetainee interrogations\nIn July 2005, Graham secured the declassification and release of memoranda outlining concerns made by senior military lawyers as early as 2003 about the legality of the interrogations of prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay [136]\n\n\nImmigration reform\nGraham was a supporter of \"comprehensive immigration reform\", of S 2611, the McCain-Kennedy Immigration Reform Bill of 2006, and of S 1348, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 His positions on immigration, and in particular collaborating with Senator Ted Kennedy, earned Graham the ire of conservative activists [145] The controversy prompted conservative activists to support a primary challenge in 2008 by longtime Republican national committeeman Buddy Witherspoon, [146] [147] but Graham won the nomination by a large margin [148]　\n\n\nInternet and technology\nIn May 2018, Graham voted against legislation that would have overturned the FCC's ruling [clarification needed] and restored net neutrality [157]\n\n\nGun rights\nGraham opposes extending background checks [161] He has said, \"universal background checks are going to require universal  [gun] registration.\" [162] He has called current gun laws \"broken\", citing an example of a woman who pleaded guilty by reason of insanity to attempting to kill President George W Bush, but was later able to pass a background check and buy a gun [163] To this end, in March 2013, he joined senators Jeff Flake, Mark Begich, and Mark Pryor in introducing a bill that would close a loophole by flagging people who attempt to buy guns who have used an insanity defense, were ruled dangerous by a court or had been committed by a court to mental health treatment It did not address the gun show loophole [164]\n\n\nHealth care\nGraham opposed President Obama's health reform legislation; he voted against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in December 2009, [166] and against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 [167] He played a leading role in efforts to repeal Obamacare, authoring the Graham–Cassidy amendment to Republicans' 2017 repeal efforts The amendment would have given states permission to remove protections for individuals with preexisting conditions, such as allowing insurers to charge them higher prices for insurance [168]\n\n\nVaccines\nGraham criticized Senator Rand Paul after Paul said, \"I've heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.\" Graham said that Paul was \"creating anxiety for no good reason\" and \"looking at this issue through a libertarian's eyes, not a physician's eyes\" [169]\n\n\nAbortion\nIn 2015, Graham sponsored the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in the Senate, which bans abortion after 20 weeks of gestation on a national basis, with some exceptions (to save the life of the mother, or when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest) [170] In 2018, Graham was anti-abortion, but said that Roe v Wade is precedent that should not be overturned without good reason [171] In 2020, he was one of 13 Republican senators who declined to sign an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to overturn Roe [172] [173]\n\n\nLGBTQ+ rights\nIn 1996, Graham voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, [181]

the Defense of Marriage Act in 2022 [183]\n\n\nClimate change\nOn December 10, 2009, Graham and senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman co-sponsored a letter to President Obama announcing their commitment to passing a climate change bill and outlining its framework [187] [188] Graham was identified as a potential Republican supporter of a climate change bill and thought to be a likely sponsor of the final bill, [189] but he pulled his support, saying that he disapproved of Senate Democrats moving forward with legislation to deal with immigration issues, a reaction to Arizona's passage of an illegal immigration law Graham's withdrawal of support left passage of the climate change bill in doubt [190]\n\n\nForeign policy\nGraham supports an interventionist foreign policy [197] In 2002, he voted for the Iraq Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq [198] He also supported the invasion of Iraq [199] Graham and senators John McCain and Joe Lieberman, who were frequently dubbed \"the three amigos\", traveled widely, pushing for American military intervention, particularly after the September 11 attacks Their influence reached its zenith in 2007 as President Bush advocated for his surge strategy in Iraq, declining shortly before Lieberman retired from the Senate in 2013 [200] [201] Kelly Ayotte, who joined the Senate in 2011, was considered Lieberman's replacement in the group [202] [203]\n\n\nWar in Afghanistan\nGraham suggested that the U.S stay in Afghanistan permanently, claiming that this would benefit both nations, as the U.S would have a clear idea of what was happening in the region on a daily basis, and Afghan security forces would have an edge militarily to ensure that Afghanistan never fell back into the hands of the Taliban [210] He further claimed that Afghan leaders accept this long-term U.S military presence since it benefits them, but Iran and some of its allies oppose it, a debatable claim [211]\n\n\nIran\nOn November 6, 2010, Graham called for a preemptive military strike to weaken the Iranian regime [215] In 2011, he supported a continuing U.S military presence in Iraq, saying, \"If we're not smart enough to work with the Iraqis to have 10,000 to 15,000 American troops in Iraq in 2012, Iraq could go to hell.\" [216]\n\n\nRussia\nIn December 2010, Graham was one of 26 senators to vote against the ratification of New Start, [222] a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S and the Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads or 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years [223]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nOn March 3, 2022, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Graham tweeted, \"The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out\", referring to Vladimir Putin The tweet, which was viewed as suggesting that a Russian resident should assassinate Putin, drew backlash from American politicians, who condemned the idea and proposed heavier sanctions instead [225]\n\n\nLibya\nGraham supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya [239] On January 29, 2013, Graham said that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \"got away with murder\" after her testimony about the 2012 Benghazi attack, [240] but the next year he said that the House Intelligence Committee report on Benghazi was \"full of crap\" and that the Obama administration had been cleared of many of the charges therein [241] [242] [243]\n\n\nIsrael/Palestine\nOn January 5, 2017, Graham condemned Obama for abstaining from UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem as a violation of international law [244]\n\n\nVenezuela\nIn May 2019, Graham called for a military invasion of Venezuela to overthrow Nicolás Maduro amid the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis [279]\n\n\nNiger\nIn October 2017, in the wake of the Tongo Tongo ambush, which killed four U.S soldiers, Graham said, \"I didn't know there was a thousand troops in Niger.\" [280] A few days later, he called for an expanded role of the U.S military in Niger: \"You're going to see more actions in Africa, not less; you're going to see more aggression by the United States toward our enemies, not less; you're going to have decisions being made not in the White House but out in the field.\" [281]\n\n\nSyria\nIn July 2018, Graham and Senator Jeanne Shaheen visited Manbij in Syria and met the Manbij Military Council, which led an offensive to liberate the city from ISIS in 2016 with help from the US-led coalition [282]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\nIn March 2015, Graham supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, [283] saying, \"We want to have a relationship with Saudi Arabia They're a strategic partner They're a mortal enemy of the Iranians.\" [284] In June 2019, he was one of seven Republicans to vote to block Trump's Saudi arms deal providing weapons to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Jordan, and one of five Republicans to vote against an additional 20 arms sales [285] In late 2019, Graham took a warmer approach toward Saudi Arabia He praised the Trump administration for sending thousands of additional troops to Saudi Arabia to counter Iran's threat [286] He also praised Saudi Arabia for opening its airspace to Israeli flights [287]\n\n\nArmenian genocide\nIn November 2019, Graham blocked a Senate resolution to officially recognize the Armenian genocide [289] In December 2019, he voted for the resolution, which passed the Senate unanimously [290]\n\n\nRobert Mueller's investigation\nIn January 2018, and in the first known congressional criminal referral in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Graham and Chuck Grassley recommended charges against ex-MI6 officer Christopher Steele, named as author of the Steele dossier [291] Grassley and Graham said that they had reason to believe that Steele had lied to federal authorities [291] According to The New York Times, \"It was not clear why, if a crime is apparent in the F.B.I reports that were reviewed by the Judiciary Committee, the Justice Department had not moved to charge Mr Steele already The circumstances under which Mr Steele is alleged to have lied were unclear, as much of the referral was classified.\" [291]\n\n\nTaxation\nAlthough Graham signed Grover Norquist's Taxpayer Protection Pledge in June 2012, he went on record supporting the closure of tax loopholes without compensating decreases in other tax revenue, saying, \"We're so far in debt that if you don't give up some ideological ground, the country sinks.\" [296]\n\n\nTrade\nThe Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies identifies Graham, during his U.S House and U.S Senate tenure, as having a mostly protectionist and pro-subsidies voting record [297] [298]\n\n\n2015 Charleston church shooting and Confederate flag issue\nAfter a mass shooting at a historic African American church in Charleston on June 17, 2015, Graham canceled all campaign events to return to South Carolina In response to questions from the press regarding the calls from some to remove the Confederate flag at a war memorial on the South Carolina State Capitol grounds, Graham said, \"Well, at the end of the day it's time for people in South Carolina to revisit that decision  [That] would be fine with me, but this is part of who we are.\" He continued, \"The flag represents to some people a civil war, and that was the symbol of one side To others it's a racist symbol, and it's been used by people—it's been used in a racist way.\" [299] Of the shooter responsible for the incident, Graham said, \"We're not going to give this a guy an excuse about a book he might have read, or a movie he watched, or a song he listened to, or a symbol out anywhere It's him .. not the flag.\" [300]\n\n\nFiscal Responsibility Act of 2023\nGraham was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 [302]\n\n\nCampaign contributions\nIn 2016, The Boston Globe reported that Graham was \"the only Republican recipient of money from a major Democratic donor now facing scrutiny for some questionable campaign donation habits.\" [303] The Thornton Law Firm is nationally known for its expertise in asbestos-related litigation Over a ten-year period, Graham received $62,800 in campaign contributions from the firm's partners The Boston Globe found that the firm, in almost every case, would reimburse partners' political contributions—in the exact amount [303]—within 10 days of the contributions being made Between 2010 and 2014, the firm's partners and one of their wives contributed $1.6 million to politicians; $1.4 million was given back to the partners from the firm The firm told reporters that according to outside consultants the practice was not unlawful because the checks are not bonuses, instead coming out of the partners' firm equity accounts [303]\n\n\nPresidential politics\nGraham supported John McCain for president in 2000 and served as national co-chair of McCain's 2008 presidential campaign [12] [304]\n\n\nElectoral history\n*Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 1994, write-ins received 13 votes  In 2000, Natural Law candidate LeRoy J Klein received 1,122 votes and write-ins received 33 votes  George Brightharp

Graham is an American politician serving as the senior United States Senator for South Carolina, a seat he has held since 2003. He is a member of the Republican Party and has been a prominent figure in the party's leadership.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGraham was born in Central, South Carolina, where his parents, Millie (Walters) and Florence James \"F.J.\" Graham, ran a restaurant/bar/pool hall/liquor store, the Sanitary Cafe. His family is of Scots-Irish descent. After graduating from D W Daniel High School, Graham became the first member of his family to attend college, and joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. When he was 21, his mother died of Hodgkin's lymphoma, aged 52, and his father died 15 months later of a heart attack, aged 69. Because his then-13-year-old sister was left orphaned, the service allowed Graham to attend the University of South Carolina in Columbia so he could remain near home as his sister's legal guardian. During his studies, he became a member of the Pi Kappa Phi social fraternity.\n\n**Military Service**\n\nUpon graduating from the University of South Carolina School of Law, Graham was commissioned as an officer in the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG Corps) in the United States Air Force in 1982 and began active duty that year. His duty began with a stint as an Air Force defense attorney, after which he was transferred to Rhein-Main Air Base in Frankfurt, Germany, where from 1984 to 1988 he was the Air Force's chief prosecutor in Europe. In 1984, as he was defending an Air Force pilot accused of using marijuana, he was featured in an episode of 60 Minutes that exposed the Air Force's defective drug-testing procedures. After his service in Europe, he returned to South Carolina, leaving active duty in 1989 and entering private practice as a lawyer. He served as assistant county attorney for Oconee County from 1988 to 1992 and city attorney for Central from 1990 to 1994.\n\n**South Carolina House of Representatives**\n\nIn 1992, Graham was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives from the 2nd district, in Oconee County.

Graham thus became South Carolina's first new U.S senator since Fritz Hollings in 1966.\n\nIn 2008, Graham was challenged in the Republican primary by National Executive Committeeman of the South Carolina Republican Party, Buddy Witherspoon. Graham defeated him by 186,398 votes (66.82%) to 92,547 (33.18%), winning all but one of South Carolina's 46 counties.

up for reelection in 2014, Graham was considered one of the most vulnerable to a primary challenge, largely due to his low approval ratings and reputation for working with and compromising with Democrats [55] [56] He expected a primary challenge from conservative activists, including the Tea Party movement, [57] and Chris Chocola, President of the Club for Growth, indicated that his organization would support a primary challenge if an acceptable standard-bearer emerged [58]\n\n\n2020\nDemocrat Jaime Harrison challenged Graham in the 2020 Senate election [63] The race was

results\nEven after all major news networks projected that Joe Biden had won the 2020 United States presidential election, Graham said that Trump \"should not concede\" because \"if Republicans don't challenge and change the U.S election system, there will never be another Republican president elected again\" [93] Graham said he donated $500,000 to Trump's election lawsuits in various states, [94] and that the option should be \"on the table\" for Republican state legislators to invalidate election results due to alleged \"corruption\" by appointing presidential electors who would vote for Trump [95]\n\n\n2024 election\nGraham appeared at Trump's first prime-time 2024 campaign rally on January 28, 2023, and told Fox News host Sean Hannity that he would support Trump \"because I know what I'm going to get\", mostly regarding perceived international threats [106]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nTea Party opponents have called Graham a \"moderate Republican.\" [10] [11] He calls himself a \"Reagan-style Republican\", and has been called a fairly conservative Republican with \"a twang of moderation\" and \"an independent streak.\" [7] [22] [26]\n\n\nSupreme Court nominations\nIn 2016, after Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died, Republican senators boycotted Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland Graham said that Supreme Court vacancies should never be filled in a presidential election year [110] and that \" [w]e are setting a precedent today, Republicans are.\" [111] He said that if a similar situation arose, \"you can use my words against me and you'd be absolutely right.\" [112] In an October 2018 interview, Graham said specifically that \" [i]f an opening comes in the last year of President Trump's term, and the primary process has started, we'll wait till the next election.\" [113]\n\n\nFree speech\nDuring an April 3, 2011, appearance on Face the Nation, [124] Graham \"suggested that Congress take unspecified though formal action against the Koran-burning by Florida preacher Terry Jones\", in light of an attack on United Nations personnel triggered by Jones's actions [125] Asserting that \"Congress might need to explore the need to limit some forms of freedom of speech\", [126] Graham argued, \"Free speech is a great idea, but we're in a war,\" and claimed that \"during World War II, we had limits on what you could say if it would inspire the enemy.\" [125] [127]\n\n\nGang of 14\nOn May 23, 2005, Graham was one of the so-called Gang of 14 senators forging a compromise that brought a halt to the continued blockage of an up-or-down vote on judicial nominees This compromise negated both the Democrats' use of a filibuster and the Republican \"nuclear option\" Under the agreement, the Democrats retained the power to filibuster a Bush judicial nominee only in an \"extraordinary circumstance\", and subsequently, three conservative Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William H Pryor Jr.) received a vote by the full Senate [128] [129]\n\n\nNational Security Agency surveillance\nIn response to the 2013 disclosures about the United States National Security Agency and its international partners' global surveillance of foreign nationals and U.S citizens, Graham said he was \"glad\" the NSA was collecting phone records He said, \"I'm a Verizon customer I don't mind Verizon turning over records to the government if the government is going to make sure that they try to match up a known terrorist phone with somebody in the United States I don't think you're talking to the terrorists I know you're not I know I'm not So we don't have anything to worry about.\" [130] [131]\n\n\nDetainee interrogations\nIn July 2005, Graham secured the declassification and release of memoranda outlining concerns made by senior military lawyers as early as 2003 about the legality of the interrogations of prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay [136]\n\n\nImmigration reform\nGraham was a supporter of \"comprehensive immigration reform\", of S 2611, the McCain-Kennedy Immigration Reform Bill of 2006, and of S 1348, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 His positions on immigration, and in particular collaborating with Senator Ted Kennedy, earned Graham the ire of conservative activists [145] The controversy prompted conservative activists to support a primary challenge in 2008 by longtime Republican national committeeman Buddy Witherspoon, [146] [147] but Graham won the nomination by a large margin [148]　\n\n\nInternet and technology\nIn May 2018, Graham voted against legislation that would have overturned the FCC's ruling [clarification needed] and restored net neutrality [157]\n\n\nGun rights\nGraham opposes extending background checks [161] He has said, \"universal background checks are going to require universal  [gun] registration.\" [162] He has called current gun laws \"broken\", citing an example of a woman who pleaded guilty by reason of insanity to attempting to kill President George W Bush, but was later able to pass a background check and buy a gun [163] To this end, in March 2013, he joined senators Jeff Flake, Mark Begich, and Mark Pryor in introducing a bill that would close a loophole by flagging people who attempt to buy guns who have used an insanity defense, were ruled dangerous by a court or had been committed by a court to mental health treatment It did not address the gun show loophole [164]\n\n\nHealth care\nGraham opposed President Obama's health reform legislation; he voted against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in December 2009, [166] and against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 [167] He played a leading role in efforts to repeal Obamacare, authoring the Graham–Cassidy amendment to Republicans' 2017 repeal efforts The amendment would have given states permission to remove protections for individuals with preexisting conditions, such as allowing insurers to charge them higher prices for insurance [168]\n\n\nVaccines\nGraham criticized Senator Rand Paul after Paul said, \"I've heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.\" Graham said that Paul was \"creating anxiety for no good reason\" and \"looking at this issue through a libertarian's eyes, not a physician's eyes\" [169]\n\n\nAbortion\nIn 2015, Graham sponsored the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in the Senate, which bans abortion after 20 weeks of gestation on a national basis, with some exceptions (to save the life of the mother, or when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest) [170] In 2018, Graham was anti-abortion, but said that Roe v Wade is precedent that should not be overturned without good reason [171] In 2020, he was one of 13 Republican senators who declined to sign an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to overturn Roe [172] [173]\n\n\nLGBTQ+ rights\nIn 1996, Graham voted for

President Obama announcing their commitment to passing a climate change bill and outlining its framework [187] [188] Graham was identified as a potential Republican supporter of a climate change bill and thought to be a likely sponsor of the final bill, [189] but he pulled his support, saying that he disapproved of Senate Democrats moving forward with legislation to deal with immigration issues, a reaction to Arizona's passage of an illegal immigration law Graham's withdrawal of support left passage of the climate change bill in doubt [190]\n\n\nForeign policy\nGraham supports an interventionist foreign policy [197] In 2002, he voted for the Iraq Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq [198] He also supported the invasion of Iraq [199] Graham and senators John McCain and Joe Lieberman, who were frequently dubbed \"the three amigos\", traveled widely, pushing for American military intervention, particularly after the September 11 attacks Their influence reached its zenith in 2007 as President Bush advocated for his surge strategy in Iraq, declining shortly before Lieberman retired from the Senate in 2013 [200] [201] Kelly Ayotte, who joined the Senate in 2011, was considered Lieberman's replacement in the group [202] [203]\n\n\nWar in Afghanistan\nGraham suggested that the U.S stay in Afghanistan permanently, claiming that this would benefit both nations, as the U.S would have a clear idea of what was happening in the region on a daily basis, and Afghan security forces would have an edge militarily to ensure that Afghanistan never fell back into the hands of the Taliban [210] He further claimed that Afghan leaders accept this long-term U.S military presence since it benefits them, but Iran and some of its allies oppose it, a debatable claim [211]\n\n\nIran\nOn November 6, 2010, Graham called for a preemptive military strike to weaken the Iranian regime [215] In 2011, he supported a continuing U.S military presence in

arms treaty with Russia in eight years [223]\n\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nOn March 3, 2022, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Graham tweeted, \"The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out\", referring to Vladimir Putin The tweet, which was viewed as suggesting that a Russian resident should assassinate Putin, drew backlash from American politicians, who condemned the idea and proposed heavier sanctions instead [225]\n\n\nLibya\nGraham supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya [239] On January 29, 2013, Graham said that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \"got away with murder\" after her testimony about the 2012 Benghazi attack, [240] but the next year he said that the House Intelligence Committee report on Benghazi was \"full of crap\" and that the Obama administration had been cleared of many of the charges therein [241] [242] [243]\n\n\nIsrael/Palestine\nOn January 5, 2017, Graham condemned Obama for abstaining from UN

called for a military invasion of Venezuela to overthrow Nicolás Maduro amid the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis [279]\n\n\nNiger\nIn October 2017, in the wake of the Tongo Tongo ambush, which killed four U.S soldiers, Graham said, \"I didn't know there was a thousand troops in Niger.\" [280] A few days later, he called for an expanded role of the U.S military in Niger: \"You're going to see more actions in Africa, not less; you're going to see more aggression by the United States toward our enemies, not less; you're going to have decisions being made not in the White House but out in the field.\" [281]\n\n\nSyria\nIn July 2018, Graham and Senator Jeanne Shaheen visited Manbij in Syria and met the Manbij Military Council, which led an offensive to liberate the city from ISIS in 2016 with help from the US-led coalition [282]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\nIn March 2015, Graham supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, [283] saying, \"We want to have a relationship with Saudi Arabia They're a strategic partner They're a mortal enemy of the Iranians.\" [284] In June 2019, he was one of seven Republicans to vote to block Trump's Saudi arms deal providing weapons to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Jordan, and one of five Republicans to vote against an additional 20 arms sales [285] In late 2019, Graham took a warmer approach toward Saudi Arabia He praised the Trump administration for sending thousands of additional troops to Saudi Arabia to counter Iran's threat [286] He also praised Saudi Arabia for opening its airspace to Israeli flights [287]\n\n\nArmenian genocide\nIn November 2019, Graham blocked a Senate resolution to officially recognize the Armenian genocide [289] In December 2019, he voted for the resolution, which passed the Senate unanimously [290]\n\n\nRobert Mueller's investigation\nIn January 2018, and in the first known congressional criminal referral in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Graham and Chuck Grassley recommended charges against ex-MI6 officer Christopher Steele, named as author of the Steele dossier [291] Grassley and Graham said that they had reason to believe that Steele had lied to federal authorities [291] According to The New York Times, \"It was not clear why, if a crime is apparent in the F.B.I reports that were reviewed by the Judiciary Committee, the Justice Department had not moved to charge Mr Steele already The circumstances under which Mr Steele is alleged to have lied were unclear, as much of the referral was classified.\" [291]\n\n\nTaxation\nAlthough Graham signed Grover Norquist's Taxpayer Protection Pledge in June 2012, he went on record supporting the closure of tax loopholes without compensating decreases in other tax revenue, saying, \"We're so far in debt that if you don't give up some ideological ground, the country sinks.\" [296]\n\n\nTrade\nThe Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies identifies Graham, during his U.S House and U.S Senate tenure, as having a mostly protectionist and pro-subsidies voting record [297] [298]\n\n\n2015 Charleston church shooting and Confederate flag issue\nAfter a mass shooting at a historic African American church in Charleston on June 17, 2015, Graham canceled all campaign events to return to South Carolina In response to questions from the press regarding the calls from some to remove the Confederate flag at a war memorial on the South Carolina State Capitol grounds, Graham said, \"Well, at the end of the day it's time for people in South Carolina to revisit that decision  [That] would be fine with me, but this is part of who we are.\" He continued, \"The flag represents to some people a civil war, and that was the symbol of one side To others it's a racist symbol, and it's been used by people—it's been used in a racist way.\" [299] Of the shooter responsible for the incident, Graham said, \"We're not going to give this a guy an excuse about a book he might have read, or a movie he watched, or a song he listened to, or a symbol out anywhere It's him .. not the flag.\" [300]\n\n\nFiscal Responsibility Act of 2023\nGraham was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 [302]\n\n\nCampaign contributions\nIn 2016, The Boston Globe reported that Graham was \"the only Republican recipient of money from a major Democratic donor now facing scrutiny for some questionable campaign donation habits.\" [303] The Thornton Law Firm is nationally known for its expertise in asbestos-related litigation Over a ten-year period, Graham received $62,800 in campaign contributions from the firm's partners The Boston Globe found that the firm, in almost every case, would reimburse partners' political contributions—in the exact amount [303]—within 10 days of the contributions being made Between 2010 and 2014, the firm's partners and one of their wives contributed $1.6 million to politicians; $1.4 million was given back to the partners from the firm The firm told reporters that according to outside consultants the practice was not unlawful because the checks are not bonuses, instead coming out of the partners' firm equity accounts [303]\n\n\nPresidential politics\nGraham supported John McCain for president in 2000 and served as national co-chair of McCain's 2008 presidential campaign [12] [304]\n\n\nElectoral history\n*Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 1994, write-ins received 13 votes  In 2000, Natural Law candidate LeRoy J Klein received 1,122 votes

It was the residence of Elvis Presley, the King of Rock and Roll, from 1957 until his death in 1977.\n\n**History**\n\nGraceland Farms was originally owned by Stephen C Toof, founder of S.C Toof & Co., the oldest commercial printing firm in Memphis. He worked previously as the pressroom foreman of the Memphis newspaper, the Memphis Daily Appeal. The site (before the mansion was built in 1939) was named after Toof's daughter, Grace. She inherited the property from her father in 1894. After her death, the property passed to her niece Ruth Moore, a Memphis socialite. Together with her husband, Thomas Moore, Ruth Moore commissioned construction of a 10,266-square-foot (953.7 m2) Colonial Revival style mansion in 1939. The house was designed by architects Furbringer and Ehrman.\n\n**Attempted Foreclosure**\n\nIn 2024, the property was slated for a foreclosure sale. A company alleged that Lisa Marie Presley put the home up as security on a $3.8 million loan in 2018. Riley Keough claimed the documents underlying the foreclosure are fraudulent and sued to stop the sale. Elvis Presley Enterprises, which manages the rest of the Presley estate, concurred with Keough's claims. In a hearing on May 22, JoeDae Jenkins of the Shelby County Chancery Court declared the lender's claims as invalid. The lender subsequently dropped plans to go ahead with the foreclosure without addressing Chancellor Jenkins' allegations.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nConstructed at the top of a hill and surrounded by rolling pastures and a grove of oak trees, Graceland was designed by the Memphis architectural firm, Furbringer and Erhman. It's a two-story, five-bay residence in the Colonial Revival style, with a side-facing gabled roof covered in asphalt shingles, a central two-story projecting pedimented portico, and two one-story wings on the north and south sides. Attached to the wing is an additional one-story stuccoed wing, which was originally a garage that houses up to four cars. The mansion has two chimneys; one on the north side's exterior wall, the second rising through the south side's roof ridge. The central block's front and side facades are veneered with tan Tishomingo limestone from Mississippi and its rear wall is stuccoed, as are the one-story wings.\n\n**Exterior**\n\nThe exterior of Graceland is a striking example of Colonial Revival architecture. The mansion's facade is symmetrical, with a central portico and two one-story wings on either side. The roof is covered in asphalt shingles, and the chimney on the north side's exterior wall adds a touch of elegance. The surrounding gardens and pastures add to the peaceful atmosphere of the estate.\n\n**Interior**\n\nGraceland is 17,552 square feet (1,630.6 m2) and has a total of 23 rooms, including eight bedrooms and bathrooms. To the right of the Entrance Hall, through an elliptical-arched opening with classical details, is the Living Room. The Living Room contains a 15-foot-long (4.6 m) white couch against the wall overlooking the front yard. To the left are two white sofas, a china cabinet and a fireplace with a mirrored wall. The painting that hangs in the room was Elvis's last Christmas present from his father, Vernon, and also displayed are photographs of Elvis's parents Vernon and Gladys, Elvis and Lisa Marie.\n\n**First Floor**\n\nThe first floor of Graceland is home to the Living Room, Dining Room, and Kitchen. The Living Room is a spacious room with a 15-foot-long (4.6 m) white couch and two white sofas. The Dining Room is a formal room with a large table and chairs. The Kitchen is a modern kitchen with all the necessary appliances and amenities.\n\n**Second Floor**\n\nThe second floor of Graceland is home to the bedrooms and bathrooms. The Entrance Hall contains a white staircase leading to the house's second floor with a wall of mirrors. Elvis's bedroom is located at the southwest corner of the second floor, and his daughter Lisa Marie's bedroom is in the northeast corner.\n\n**Basement**\n\nDownstairs in the basement is the TV room, where Elvis often watched three television sets at once. The room is equipped with a wet bar and a stereo system. The three TV sets are built into the room's south wall, and there's a stereo, and cabinets for Elvis's record collection.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nGraceland has been criticized for its gaudy and over-the-top decor. Critics such as Albert Goldman write: \"Though it cost a lot of money to fill up Graceland with the things that appealed to Elvis Presley, nothing in the house is worth a dime.\" In chapter 1 of his book, Elvis (1981), the author describes Graceland as looking like a brothel: \"it appears to have been lifted from some turn-of-the-century bordello down in the French Quarter of New Orleans Lulu White or the Countess Willie Piazza might have contrived this plushy parlor for the entertainment of Gyp the Blood The room is a gaudy mélange of red velour and gilded tassels, Louis XV furniture and porcelain bric-a-brac...\"\n\n**Estate**\n\nAfter purchasing the property, Elvis spent in excess of $500,000 carrying out extensive modifications to suit his needs. Designed and built by Abe Sauer is the wrought-iron front gate shaped like a book of sheet music, along with green colored musical notes and two mirrored silhouettes of Elvis playing his guitar. Sauer also installed a kidney-shaped swimming pool and a racquetball court, which is reminiscent of an old country club, furnished in dark leather and a functional bar.\n\n**Tourist Destination**\n\nAfter Elvis Presley's death in 1977, Vernon Presley served as executor of his estate. Upon his death in 1979, he chose Priscilla to serve as the estate executor for Elvis's only child, Lisa Marie, who was only 11. Graceland was opened to the public on June 7, 1982. Priscilla's gamble paid off; after only a month of opening Graceland's doors the estate made back all the money it had invested. Priscilla Presley became the chairwoman and president of Elvis Presley Enterprises, or EPE, stating at that time she would do so until Lisa Marie reached 21 years of age.\n\n**Notable Visitors**\n\nAccording to Elvis Presley's Enterprises, staff at Graceland informally kept a list of celebrities who had visited in the first years following Elvis's death. Muhammad Ali, who was a friend of Elvis, was an early celebrity visitor in 1978, as was singer Paul Simon. He toured Graceland in the early 80s and afterward wrote a song of the same name; it was the title track of his Grammy-winning album Graceland.\n\n**Gallery**\n\nA gallery of images of Graceland can be found on the Elvis Presley Enterprises website.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of Elvis Presley's homes\n* Elvis Presley's death\n* Elvis Presley Enterprises\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n**Citations**\n\nThis article does not include any citations.\n\n**Works Cited**\n\nThis article does not include any works cited.\n\n**Further Reading**\n\nFor further reading on Graceland, see the Elvis Presley Enterprises website.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Elvis Presley Enterprises website\n* Graceland official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Graceland\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nGraceland Farms was originally owned by Stephen C Toof, founder of S.C Toof & Co., the oldest commercial printing firm in Memphis He worked previously as the pressroom foreman of the Memphis newspaper, the Memphis Daily Appeal The site (before the mansion was built in 1939) was named after Toof's daughter, Grace She inherited the property from her father in 1894 After her death, the property passed to her niece Ruth Moore, a Memphis socialite Together with her husband, Thomas Moore, Ruth Moore commissioned construction of a 10,266-square-foot (953.7 m2) Colonial Revival style mansion in 1939 [8] The house was designed by architects Furbringer and Ehrman [9]\n\n\nAttempted foreclosure\nThe property was slated for a foreclosure sale in May 2024 A company alleged that Lisa Marie Presley put the home up as security on a $3.8 million loan in 2018 Riley Keough claimed the documents underlying the foreclosure are fraudulent and sued to stop the sale Elvis Presley Enterprises, which manages the rest of the Presley estate, concurred with Keough's claims [27] In a hearing on May 22, JoeDae Jenkins of the Shelby County Chancery Court declared the lender's claims as invalid No representative for the lender appeared at the hearing [28] The lender subsequently dropped plans to go ahead with the foreclosure without addressing Chancellor Jenkins' allegations [29] NBC News tried to find Naussany Investments & Private Lending and its representative, Gregory E Naussany, in public records but was unable [30] A real estate professor at the University of Memphis has said, \" [I]f this had been someone else's inheritance, someone else's home, it would just be another example  [of real estate fraud] that the public never hears about.\" [30]\n\n\nArchitecture\nConstructed at the top of a hill and surrounded by rolling pastures and a grove of oak trees, Graceland was designed by the Memphis architectural firm, Furbringer and Erhmanis It's a two-story, five-bay residence in the Colonial Revival style, with a side-facing gabled roof covered in asphalt shingles, a central two-story projecting pedimented portico, and two one-story wings on the north and south sides Attached to the wing is an additional one-story stuccoed wing, which was originally a garage that houses up to four cars The mansion has two chimneys;

behind present characteristics that are shared with those found in Estonia, Russia, and Norway [22] The earliest people were hunter-gatherers, using stone tools [23]\n\n\nSwedish era\nThe 12th and 13th centuries were a violent time in the northern Baltic Sea The Livonian Crusade was ongoing and the Finnish tribes such as the Tavastians and Karelians were in frequent conflicts with Novgorod and with each other Also, during the 12th and 13th centuries several crusades from the Catholic realms of the Baltic Sea area were made against the Finnish tribes Danes waged at least three crusades to Finland, in 1187 or slightly earlier, [37] in 1191 and in 1202, [38] and Swedes, possibly the so-called second crusade to Finland, in 1249 against Tavastians and the third crusade to Finland in 1293 against the Karelians The so-called first crusade to Finland, possibly in 1155, most likely never occurred [39]\n\n\nGrand Duchy of Finland\nThe Swedish era ended with the Finnish War of 1809 On 29 March 1809, after being conquered by the armies of Alexander I of Russia, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy within the Russian Empire, as recognised by the Diet of Porvoo [54] This situation continued until the end of 1917 [52] In 1812, Alexander I incorporated the Russian province of Vyborg into the Grand Duchy of Finland In 1854, Finland became involved in Russia's involvement in the Crimean War when the British and French navies bombed the Finnish coast and Åland during the so-called Åland War [55]\n\n\nCivil war and early independence\nAfter the February Revolution of 1917, Finland's position as a Grand Duchy under the rule of the Russian Empire was questioned The Finnish parliament, controlled by the Social Democrats, passed the so-called Power Act to give the parliament supreme authority This was rejected by the Russian Provisional Government, which decided to dissolve the parliament [63] New elections were held in which the right-wing parties won by a small majority Some social democrats refused to accept the result, claiming that the dissolution of parliament and the subsequent elections were extra-legal The two almost equally powerful political blocs, the right-wing parties and the Social Democratic Party, were deeply divided.\n\n\nWorld War II\nThe Soviet Union launched the Winter War on 30 November 1939 to annex Finland in accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany to divide Europe into spheres of influence between the two dictatorships [77] [78] The Finnish Democratic Republic was set up by Joseph Stalin at the beginning of the war to govern Finland after Soviet conquest [79] There was widespread international condemnation of the unprovoked attack and it led to the Soviet Union being expelled from the League of Nations [80] The Red Army was defeated in numerous battles, most notably the Battle of Suomussalmi After two months of negligible progress on the battlefield, as well as heavy losses in men and material, [81] Soviet forces began to advance in February and reached Vyborg (Finnish: Viipuri) in March The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed on 12 March 1940, and the war ended the following day Finland had defended its independence, but ceded 9% of its territory to the Soviet Union.\n\n\nAfter the war\nThe development of trade with the Western powers, such as the United Kingdom, and the payment of reparations to the Soviet Union led to Finland's transformation from a primarily agrarian society to an industrialised one Valmet, originally a shipyard and then several metal workshops, was established to produce materials for war reparations After the reparations were paid, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union as part of bilateral trade.\n\n\n21st century\nThe Finnish people elected Tarja Halonen in the 2000 Presidential election, making her the first female President of Finland [89] Her predecessor, President Martti Ahtisaari, later won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008 Financial crises paralysed  Finland's exports in 2008, leading to weaker economic growth throughout the decade [90] [91] Sauli Niinistö was elected President of Finland from 2012 until 2024, when Alexander Stubb took over [92] [93]\n\n\nGeography\nLying approximately between latitudes 60° and 70° N, and longitudes 20° and 32° E, Finland is one of the world's northernmost countries Of world capitals, only Reykjavík lies more to the north than Helsinki The distance from the southernmost point – Hanko in Uusimaa – to the northernmost – Nuorgam in Lapland – is 1,160 kilometres (720 mi).\n\n\nBiodiversity\nPhytogeographically, Finland is shared between the Arctic, central European, and northern European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom According to the WWF, the territory of Finland can be subdivided into three ecoregions: the Scandinavian and Russian taiga, Sarmatic mixed forests, and Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands [109] Taiga covers most of Finland from northern regions of southern provinces to the north of Lapland On the southwestern coast, south of the Helsinki-Rauma line, forests are characterized by mixed forests, that are more typical in the Baltic region In the extreme north of Finland, near the tree line and Arctic Ocean, Montane Birch forests are common Finland had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.08/10, ranking it 109th globally out of 172 countries [110]\n\n\nClimate\nThe main factor influencing Finland's climate is the country's geographical position between the 60th and 70th northern parallels in the Eurasian continent's coastal zone In the Köppen climate classification, the whole of Finland lies in the boreal zone, characterized by warm summers and freezing winters Within the country, the temperateness varies considerably between the southern coastal regions and the extreme north, showing characteristics of both a maritime and a continental climate Finland is near enough to the Atlantic Ocean to be continuously warmed by the Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream combines with the moderating effects of the Baltic Sea and numerous inland lakes to explain the unusually warm climate compared with other regions that share the same latitude, such as Alaska, Siberia, and southern Greenland [117]\n\n\nRegions\nFinland consists of 19 regions (maakunta) The counties are governed by regional councils which serve as forums of cooperation for the municipalities of a county The main tasks of the counties are regional planning and development of enterprise and education In addition, the public health services are usually organized based on counties Regional councils are elected by municipal councils, each municipality sending representatives in proportion to its population In addition to inter-municipal cooperation, which is the responsibility of regional councils, each county has a state Employment and Economic Development Centre which is responsible for the local administration of labour, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and entrepreneurial affairs Historically, counties are divisions of historical provinces of Finland, areas that represent local dialects and culture more accurately.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe fundamental administrative divisions of the country are the municipalities, which may also call themselves towns or cities They account for half of the public spending Spending is financed by municipal income tax, state subsidies, and other revenue As of 2021 [update], there are 309 municipalities, [126] and most have fewer than 6,000 residents.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe Constitution of Finland defines the political system; Finland is a parliamentary republic within the framework of a

Republic Finland had, for most of its independence a semi-presidential system of government, but in the last few decades the powers of the president have become more circumscribed, and consequently the country is now considered a parliamentary republic [2] A new constitution, enacted in 2000, made the presidency primarily a ceremonial office The president appoints the prime minister as elected by Parliament, appoints and dismisses the other ministers of the Finnish Government on the recommendation of the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, and confers state honors Nevertheless, the president remains responsible for Finland's foreign relations, including the making of war and peace, but excluding matters related to the European Union [citation needed] Moreover, the president exercises supreme command over the Finnish Defence Forces as commander-in-chief In the exercise of his or her foreign and defense powers, the president is required to consult the Finnish government, but the government's advice is not binding In addition, the president has several domestic reserve powers, including the authority to veto legislation, to grant pardons, and to appoint several public officials [citation needed] The president is also required by the Constitution to dismiss individual ministers or the entire government upon a parliamentary vote of no confidence [128]\n\n\nParliament\nThe 200-member unicameral Parliament of Finland (Finnish: Eduskunta) exercises supreme legislative authority in the country It may alter the constitution and ordinary laws, dismiss the cabinet, and override presidential vetoes Its acts are not subject to judicial review; the constitutionality of new laws is assessed by the parliament's constitutional law committee The parliament is elected for a term of four years using the proportional D'Hondt method within several multi-seat constituencies through the most open list multi-member districts Various parliament committees listen to experts and prepare legislation.\n\n\nCabinet\nAfter parliamentary elections, the parties negotiate among themselves on forming a new cabinet (the Finnish Government), which then has to be approved by a simple majority vote in the parliament The cabinet can be dismissed by a parliamentary vote of no confidence, although this rarely happens, as the parties represented in the cabinet usually make up a majority in the parliament.\n\n\nLaw\nThe judicial system of Finland is a civil law system divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration Finnish law is codified and based on Swedish law and in a wider sense, civil law or Roman law The court system for civil and criminal jurisdiction consists of local courts, regional appellate courts, and the Supreme Court The administrative branch of justice consists of administrative courts and the Supreme Administrative Court In addition to the regular courts, there are a few special courts in certain branches of administration There is also a High Court of Impeachment for criminal charges against certain high-ranking officeholders.\n\n\nForeign relations\nAccording to the 2012 constitution, the president leads foreign policy in cooperation with the government, except that the president has no role in EU affairs [132] In 2008, president Martti Ahtisaari was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize [133]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Finnish Defence Forces consist of a cadre of professional soldiers (mainly officers and technical personnel), currently serving conscripts, and a large reserve The standard readiness strength is 34,700 people in uniform, of which 25% are professional soldiers A universal male conscription is in place, under which all male Finnish nationals above 18 years of age serve for 6 to 12 months of armed service or 12 months of civilian (non-armed) service.\nVoluntary post-conscription overseas peacekeeping service is popular, and troops serve around the world in UN, NATO, and EU missions Women are allowed to serve in all combat arms In 2022, 1211 women entered voluntary military service [137] The army consists of a highly mobile field army backed up by local defence units With a high capability of military personnel, [138] arsenal [139] and homeland defence willingness, Finland is one of Europe's militarily strongest countries [140]\n\n\nHuman rights\nFinland has one of the world's most extensive welfare systems, one that guarantees decent living conditions for all residents The welfare system was created almost entirely during the first three decades after World War II [149]\n\n\nEconomy\nAs of 2022 [update], Finland ranks 16th globally in nominal GDP per capita according to the IMF Additionally, Finland boasts a well-developed welfare system that encompasses free education and universal healthcare, contributing to its reputation as one of the wealthiest nations.\n\n\nEnergy\nThe free and largely privately owned financial and physical Nordic energy markets traded in NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe and Nord Pool Spot exchanges, have provided competitive prices compared with other EU countries As of 2022 [update], Finland has the lowest non-household electricity prices in the EU [173]\n\n\nTransport\nFinland's road system is utilized by most internal cargo and passenger traffic The annual state operated road network expenditure of around €1 billion is paid for with vehicle and fuel taxes which amount to around €1.5 billion and €1 billion, respectively Among the Finnish highways, the most significant and busiest main roads include the Turku Highway (E18), the Tampere Highway (E12), the Lahti Highway (E75), and the ring roads (Ring I and Ring III) of the Helsinki metropolitan area and the Tampere Ring Road of the Tampere urban area [180]\n\n\nIndustry\nFinland rapidly industrialized after World War II, achieving GDP per capita levels comparable to that of Japan or the UK at the beginning of the 1970s Initially, most of the economic development was based on two broad groups of export-led industries, the \"metal industry\" (metalliteollisuus) and \"forest industry\" (metsäteollisuus) The \"metal industry\" includes shipbuilding, metalworking, the automotive industry, engineered products such as motors and electronics, and production of metals and alloys including steel, copper and chromium Many of the world's biggest cruise ships, including MS Freedom of the Seas and the Oasis of the Seas have been built in Finnish shipyards [187] [188] The \"forest industry\" includes forestry, timber, pulp and paper, and is often considered a logical development based on Finland's extensive forest resources, as 73% of the area is covered by forest In the pulp and paper industry, many major companies are based in Finland; Ahlstrom-Munksjö, Metsä Board, and UPM are all Finnish forest-based companies with revenues exceeding €1 billion However, in recent decades, the Finnish economy has diversified, with companies expanding into fields such as electronics (Nokia), metrology (Vaisala), petroleum (Neste), and video games (Rovio Entertainment), and is no longer dominated by the two sectors of metal and forest industry Likewise, the structure has changed, with the service sector growing Despite this, production for export is still more prominent than in Western Europe, thus making Finland possibly more vulnerable to global economic trends.\n\n\nPublic policy\nFinnish politicians have often emulated the Nordic model [190] Nordics have been free-trading for over a century The level of protection in commodity trade has been low, except for agricultural products [190] Finland is ranked 16th in the 2008 global Index of Economic Freedom and ninth in Europe [191] According to the OECD, only four EU-15 countries have less regulated product markets and only one has less regulated financial markets [190] The 2007 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Finland 17th most competitive [192] The World Economic Forum 2008 index ranked Finland the sixth most competitive [193]\n\n\nTourism\nIn 2017, tourism in Finland grossed approximately €15.0 billion Of this, €4.6 billion (30%) came from foreign tourism [197] In 2017, there were 15.2 million overnight stays of domestic tourists and 6.7 million overnight stays of foreign tourists [198] Tourism contributes roughly 2.7% to Finland's GDP [199]\n\n\nDemographics\nPopulation by continent of origin (2023) [1] [207]\n\n\nLanguage\nFinnish and Swedish are the official languages of Finland Finnish predominates nationwide while Swedish is spoken in some coastal areas in the west and south (with towns such as Ekenäs, [220] Pargas, [221] Närpes, [221] Kristinestad, [222] Jakobstad [223] and Nykarleby [224]) and in the autonomous region of Åland, which is the only monolingual Swedish-speaking region in Finland [225] As of 2023 [update], the native language of 84.9% of the population was Finnish, [1] which is part of the Finnic subgroup of the Uralic language The language is one of only four official EU languages not of Indo-European origin, and has no relation through descent to the other national languages of the Nordics Conversely, Finnish is closely related to Estonian and Karelian, and more distantly to Hungarian and the Sami languages.\n\n\nLargest cities\nRegistered members of religions groups in Finland by the Statistics Finland (2023) [1]\n\n\nReligion\nRegistered members of religions groups in Finland by the Statistics Finland (2023) [1]\n\n\nHealth\nLife expectancy was 79 years for men and 84 years for women in 2017 [252] The under-five mortality rate was 2.3 per 1,000 live births in 2017, ranking Finland's rate among the lowest in the world [253] The fertility rate in 2014 stood at 1.71 children born/per woman and has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 since 1969 [254] With a low birth rate women also become mothers at a later age, the mean age at first live birth being 28.6 in 2014 [254] A 2011 study published in The Lancet medical journal found that Finland had the lowest stillbirth rate out of 193 countries [255]\n\n\nEducation and science\nMost pre-tertiary education is arranged at the municipal level Around 3 percent of students are enrolled in private schools (mostly specialist language and international schools) [267] Formal education is usually started at the age of 7 Primary school takes normally six years and lower secondary school three years.\n\n\nCulture\nWritten Finnish could be said to have existed since Mikael Agricola translated the New Testament into Finnish during the Protestant Reformation, but few notable works of literature were written until the 19th century and the beginning of a Finnish national Romantic Movement This prompted Elias Lönnrot to collect Finnish and Karelian folk poetry and arrange and publish them as the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic The era saw a rise of poets and novelists who wrote in Finnish, notably the national writer of Finland, Aleksis Kivi (The Seven Brothers), and Minna Canth, Eino Leino, and Juhani Aho Many writers of the national awakening wrote in Swedish, such as the national poet J L Runeberg (The Tales of Ensign Stål) and Zachris Topelius.\n\n\nLiterature\nWritten Finnish could be said to have existed since Mikael Agricola translated the New Testament into Finnish during the Protestant Reformation, but few notable works of

design, and architecture\nThe visual arts in Finland started to form their characteristics in the 19th century when Romantic nationalism was rising in autonomic Finland The best known Finnish painters, Akseli Gallen-Kallela, started painting in a naturalist style but moved to national romanticism Other notable painters of the era include Pekka Halonen, Eero Järnefelt, Helene Schjerfbeck and Hugo Simberg In the late 20th century, the homoerotic art of Touko Laaksonen, pseudonym Tom of Finland, found a worldwide audience [282] [283]\n\n\nMusic\nFinnish folk music can be divided into Nordic dance music and the older tradition of poem singing, poems from which the national epic, the Kalevala, was created.\nMuch of Finland's classical music is influenced by traditional Finnish and Karelian melodies and lyrics, as comprised in the Kalevala In the historical region of Finnish Karelia, as well as other parts of Eastern Finland, the old poem singing traditions were preserved better than in the western parts of the country, thus Karelian culture is perceived as less influenced by Germanic influence than the Nordic folk dance music that largely replaced the kalevaic tradition Finnish folk music has undergone a roots revival and has become a part of popular music The people of northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway, the Sami, are known primarily for highly spiritual songs called joik.\n\n\nCinema and television\nIn the film industry, notable modern directors include brothers Mika and Aki Kaurismäki, Dome Karukoski, Antti Jokinen, Jalmari Helander, and Renny Harlin Some Finnish drama series are internationally known, such as Bordertown [300]\n\n\nMedia and communications\nToday, there are around 200 newspapers, 320 popular magazines, 2,100 professional magazines, and 67 commercial radio stations The largest newspaper is Helsingin Sanomat, its circulation being 339,437 as of 2019 [update] [309] Yle, the Finnish Broadcasting Company, operates five television channels and thirteen radio channels Each year, around 12,000 book titles are published [310]\n\n\nSauna\nThe Finns' love for saunas is generally associated with Finnish cultural tradition in the world Sauna is a type of dry steam bath practiced widely in Finland, which is especially evident in the strong tradition around Midsummer and Christmas The word sauna is of Proto-Finnish origin (found in Finnic and Sami languages) dating back 7,000 years [314] Steam baths have been part of European tradition elsewhere as well, but the sauna has survived best in Finland, in addition to Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Russia, Norway, and parts of the United States and Canada Moreover, nearly all Finnish houses have either their own sauna or in multi-story apartment houses, a timeshare sauna Municipal swimming halls and hotels have often their own saunas The Finnish sauna culture is inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists [315] [316]\n\n\nCuisine\nFinnish cuisine generally combines traditional country fare and contemporary style cooking Potato, meat and fish play a prominent role in traditional Finnish dishes Finnish foods often use wholemeal products (rye, barley, oats) and berries (such as bilberries, lingonberries, cloudberries, and sea buckthorn) Milk and its derivatives like buttermilk are commonly used as food and drink The most popular fish food in Finland is salmon [318] [319]\n\n\nPublic holidays\nThere are several holidays in Finland, of which perhaps the most characteristic of Finnish culture include Christmas (joulu), Midsummer (juhannus), May Day (vappu) and Independence Day (itsenäisyyspäivä) Of these, Christmas and Midsummer are special in Finland because the actual festivities take place on eves, such as Christmas Eve [323] [324] and Midsummer's Eve, [325] [326] while Christmas Day and Midsummer's Day are more consecrated to rest Other public holidays in Finland are New Year's Day, Epiphany, Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday, Ascension Day, All Saints' Day and Saint Stephen's Day All official holidays in Finland are established by Acts of Parliament [327]\n\n\nSports\nVarious sporting events are popular in Finland Pesäpallo, the Finnish equivalent of American baseball, is the national sport of Finland, [330] [331] although the most popular sport in terms of spectators is ice hockey [332] Other popular sports include athletics, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, football, volleyball, and basketball [333] Association football is the most played team sport in terms of the number of players in the country [334] [335] Finland's national basketball team has received widespread public attention [336]\n\n\nSee also\n64°N 26°E﻿ / ﻿64°N 26°E﻿ / 64; 26\n\n\nNotes\n64°N 26°E﻿ / ﻿64°N

in the northernmost part of Europe. It is bordered by Sweden to the west, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Finland has a population of approximately 5.5 million people and a total area of 338,000 square kilometers.\n\nHistory\n\nThe area that is now Finland was settled in, at the latest, around 8,500 BC during the Stone Age towards the end of the last glacial period. The artefacts the first settlers left behind present characteristics that are shared with those found in Estonia, Russia, and Norway. The earliest people were hunter-gatherers, using stone tools.\n\nPrehistory\n\nThe area that is now Finland was settled in, at the latest, around 8,500 BC during the Stone Age towards the end of the last glacial period. The artefacts the first settlers left behind present characteristics that are shared with those found in Estonia, Russia, and Norway. The earliest people were hunter-gatherers, using stone tools.\n\nSwedish era\n\nThe 12th and 13th centuries were a violent time in the northern Baltic Sea. The Livonian Crusade was ongoing and the Finnish tribes such as the Tavastians and Karelians were in frequent conflicts with Novgorod and with each other. Also, during the 12th and 13th centuries several crusades from the Catholic realms of the Baltic Sea area were made against the Finnish tribes. Danes waged at least three crusades to Finland, in 1187 or slightly earlier, in 1191 and in 1202, and Swedes, possibly the so-called second crusade to Finland, in 1249 against Tavastians and the third crusade to Finland in 1293 against the Karelians. The so-called first crusade to Finland, possibly in 1155, most likely never occurred.\n\nGrand Duchy of Finland\n\nThe Swedish era ended with the Finnish War of 1809. On 29 March 1809, after being conquered by the armies of Alexander I of Russia, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy within the Russian Empire, as recognized by the Diet of Porvoo. This situation continued until the end of 1917. In 1812, Alexander I incorporated the Russian province of Vyborg into the Grand Duchy of Finland. In 1854, Finland became involved in Russia's involvement in the Crimean War when the British and French navies bombed the Finnish coast and Åland during the so-called Åland War.\n\nCivil war and early independence\n\nAfter the February Revolution of 1917, Finland's position as a Grand Duchy under the rule of the Russian Empire was questioned. The Finnish parliament, controlled by the Social Democrats, passed the so-called Power Act to give the parliament supreme authority. This was rejected by the Russian Provisional Government, which decided to dissolve the parliament. New elections were held in which the right-wing parties won by a small majority. Some social democrats refused to accept the result, claiming that the dissolution of parliament and the subsequent elections were extra-legal. The two almost equally powerful political blocs, the right-wing parties and the Social Democratic Party, were deeply divided.\n\nWorld War II\n\nThe Soviet Union launched the Winter War on 30 November 1939 to annex Finland in accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany to divide Europe into spheres of influence between the two dictatorships. The Finnish Democratic Republic was set up by Joseph Stalin at the beginning of the war to govern Finland after Soviet conquest. There was widespread international condemnation of the unprovoked attack and it led to the Soviet Union being expelled from the League of Nations. The Red Army was defeated in numerous battles, most notably the Battle of Suomussalmi. After two months of negligible progress on the battlefield, as well as heavy losses in men and material, Soviet forces began to advance in February and reached Vyborg (Finnish: Viipuri) in March. The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed on 12 March 1940, and the war ended the following day. Finland had defended its independence, but ceded 9% of its territory to the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the war\n\nThe development of trade with the Western powers, such as the United Kingdom, and the payment of reparations to the Soviet Union led to Finland's transformation from a primarily agrarian society to an industrialized one. Valmet, originally a shipyard and then several metal workshops, was established to produce materials for war reparations. After the reparations were paid, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union as part of bilateral trade.\n\n21st century\n\nThe Finnish people elected Tarja Halonen in the 2000 Presidential election, making her the first female President of Finland. Her predecessor, President Martti Ahtisaari, later won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008. Financial crises paralyzed Finland's exports in 2008, leading to weaker economic growth throughout the decade. Sauli Niinistö was elected President of Finland from 2012 until 2024, when Alexander Stubb took over.\n\nGeography\n\nLying approximately between latitudes 60° and 70° N, and longitudes 20° and 32° E, Finland is one of the world's northernmost countries.

The main tasks of the counties are regional planning and development of enterprise and education. In addition, the public health services are usually organized based on counties. Regional councils are elected by municipal councils, each municipality sending representatives in proportion to its population. In addition to inter-municipal cooperation, which is the responsibility of regional councils, each county has a state Employment and Economic Development Centre which is responsible for the local administration of labour, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and entrepreneurial affairs.

With a high capability of military personnel, arsenal, and homeland defence willingness, Finland is one of Europe's militarily strongest countries.\n\nHuman rights\n\nFinland has one of the world's most extensive welfare systems, one that guarantees decent living conditions for all residents. The welfare system was created almost entirely during the first three decades after World War II.\n\nEconomy\n\nAs of 2022, Finland ranks 16th globally in nominal GDP per capita according to the IMF. Additionally, Finland boasts a well-developed welfare system that encompasses free education and universal healthcare, contributing to its reputation as one of the wealthiest nations.\n\nEnergy\n\nThe free and largely privately owned financial and physical Nordic energy markets traded in NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe and Nord Pool Spot exchanges have provided competitive prices compared with other EU countries. As of 2022, Finland has the lowest non-household electricity prices in the EU.\n\nTransport\n\nFinland's road system is utilized by most internal cargo and passenger traffic. The annual state-operated road network expenditure of around €1 billion is paid for with vehicle and fuel taxes which amount to around €1.5 billion and €1 billion, respectively. Among the Finnish highways, the most significant and busiest main roads include the Turku Highway (E18), the Tampere Highway (E12), the Lahti Highway (E75), and the ring roads (Ring I and Ring III) of the Helsinki metropolitan area and the Tampere Ring Road of the Tampere urban area.\n\nIndustry\n\nFinland rapidly industrialized after World War II, achieving GDP per capita levels comparable to that of Japan or the UK at the beginning of the 1970s. Initially, most of the economic development was based on two broad groups of export-led industries, the \"metal industry\" (metalliteollisuus) and \"forest industry\" (metsäteollisuus). The \"metal industry\" includes shipbuilding, metalworking, the automotive industry, engineered products such as motors and electronics, and production of metals and alloys including steel, copper and chromium. Many of the world's biggest cruise ships, including MS Freedom of the Seas and the Oasis of the Seas have been built in Finnish shipyards. The \"forest industry\" includes forestry, timber, pulp and paper, and is often considered a logical development based on Finland's extensive forest resources, as 73% of the area is covered by forest. In the pulp and paper industry, many major companies are based in Finland; Ahlstrom-Munksjö, Metsä Board, and UPM are all Finnish forest-based companies with revenues exceeding €1 billion. However, in recent decades, the Finnish economy has diversified, with companies expanding into fields such as electronics (Nokia), metrology (Vaisala), petroleum (Neste), and video games (Rovio Entertainment), and is no longer dominated by the two sectors of metal and forest industry. Likewise, the structure has changed, with the service sector growing. Despite this, production for export is still more prominent than in Western Europe, thus making Finland possibly more vulnerable to global economic trends.\n\nPublic policy\n\nFinnish politicians have often emulated the Nordic model. Nordics have been free-trading for over a century. The level of protection in commodity trade has been low, except for agricultural products. Finland is ranked 16th in the 2008 global Index of Economic Freedom and ninth in Europe. According to the OECD, only four EU-15 countries have less regulated product markets and only one has less regulated financial markets. The 2007 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Finland 17th most competitive. The World Economic Forum 2008 index ranked Finland the sixth most competitive.\n\nTourism\n\nIn 2017, tourism in Finland grossed approximately €15.0 billion. Of this, €4.6 billion (30%) came from foreign tourism. In 2017, there were 15.2 million overnight stays of domestic tourists and 6.7 million overnight stays of foreign tourists. Tourism contributes roughly 2.7% to Finland's GDP.\n\nDemographics\n\nPopulation by continent of origin (2023): \n• Europe: 83.6% \n• Asia: 6.4% \n• Africa: 2.6% \n• Americas: 2.2% \n• Oceania: 1.2% \n• Other: 4%\n\nLanguage\n\nFinnish and Swedish are the official languages of Finland. Finnish predominates nationwide while Swedish is spoken in some coastal areas in the west and south (with towns such as Ekenäs, Pargas, Närpes, Kristinestad, Jakobstad, and Nykarleby) and in the autonomous region of Åland, which is the only monolingual Swedish-speaking region in Finland. As of 2023, the native language of 84.9% of the population was Finnish, which is part of the Finnic subgroup of the Uralic language. The language is one of only four official EU languages not of Indo-European origin, and has no relation through descent to the other national languages of the Nordics. Conversely, Finnish is closely related to Estonian and Karelian, and more distantly to Hungarian and the Sami languages.\n\nLargest cities\n\n1. Helsinki (1,540,000) \n2. Espoo (319,000) \n3. Vantaa (245,000) \n4. Turku (314,000) \n5. Oulu (202,000)\n\nReligion\n\nRegistered members of religions groups in Finland by the Statistics Finland (2023): \n• Lutheran Church of Finland: 65.8% \n• Orthodox Church of Finland: 6.5% \n• Other Christian denominations: 5.7% \n• Non-religious: 16.4% \n• Other religions: 5.6%\n\nHealth\n\nLife expectancy was 79 years for men and 84 years for women in 2017. The under-five mortality rate was 2.3 per 1,000 live births in 2017, ranking Finland's rate among the lowest in the world. The fertility rate in 2014 stood at 1.71 children born/per woman and has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 since 1969. With a low birth rate women also become mothers at a later age, the mean age at first live birth being 28.6 in 2014. A 2011 study published in The Lancet medical journal found that Finland had the lowest stillbirth rate out of 193 countries.\n\nEducation and science\n\nMost pre-tertiary education is arranged at the municipal level. Around 3 percent of students are enrolled in private schools (mostly specialist language and international schools). Formal education is usually started at the age of 7. Primary school takes normally six years and lower secondary school three years.\n\nCulture\n\nWritten Finnish could be said to have existed since Mikael Agricola translated the New Testament into Finnish during the Protestant Reformation, but few notable works of literature were written until the 19th century and the beginning of a Finnish national Romantic Movement. This prompted Elias Lönnrot to collect Finnish and Karelian folk poetry and arrange and publish them as the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic. The era saw a rise of poets and novelists who wrote in Finnish, notably the national writer of Finland, Aleksis Kivi (The Seven", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Finland\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe area that is now Finland was settled in, at the latest, around 8,500 BC during the Stone Age towards the end of the last glacial period The artefacts the first settlers left behind present characteristics that are shared with those found in Estonia, Russia, and Norway [22] The earliest people were hunter-gatherers, using stone tools [23]\n\n\nPrehistory\nThe area that is now Finland was settled in, at the latest, around 8,500 BC during the Stone Age towards the end of the last glacial period The artefacts the first settlers left behind present characteristics that are shared with those found in Estonia, Russia, and Norway [22] The earliest people were hunter-gatherers, using stone tools [23]\n\n\nSwedish era\nThe 12th and 13th centuries were a violent time in the northern Baltic Sea The Livonian Crusade was ongoing and the Finnish tribes such as the Tavastians and Karelians were in frequent conflicts with Novgorod and with each other Also, during the 12th and 13th centuries several crusades from the Catholic realms of the Baltic Sea area were made against the Finnish tribes Danes waged at least three crusades to Finland, in 1187 or slightly earlier, [37] in 1191 and in 1202, [38] and Swedes, possibly the so-called second crusade to Finland, in 1249 against Tavastians and the third crusade to Finland in 1293 against the Karelians The so-called first crusade to Finland, possibly in 1155, most likely never occurred [39]\n\n\nGrand Duchy of Finland\nThe Swedish era ended with the Finnish War of 1809 On 29 March 1809, after being conquered by the armies of Alexander I of Russia, Finland became an autonomous grand duchy within the Russian Empire, as recognised by the Diet of Porvoo [54] This situation continued until the end of 1917 [52] In 1812, Alexander I incorporated the Russian province of Vyborg into the Grand Duchy of Finland In 1854, Finland became involved in Russia's involvement in the Crimean War when the British and French navies bombed the Finnish coast and Åland during the so-called Åland War [55]\n\n\nCivil war and early independence\nAfter the February Revolution of 1917, Finland's position as a Grand Duchy under the rule of the Russian Empire was questioned The Finnish parliament, controlled by the Social Democrats, passed the so-called Power Act to give the parliament supreme authority This was rejected by the Russian Provisional Government, which decided to dissolve the parliament [63] New elections were held in which the right-wing parties won by a small majority Some social democrats refused to accept the result, claiming that the dissolution of parliament and the subsequent elections were extra-legal The two almost equally powerful political blocs, the right-wing parties and the Social Democratic Party, were deeply divided.\n\n\nWorld War II\nThe Soviet Union launched the Winter War on 30 November 1939 to annex Finland in accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany to divide Europe into spheres of influence between the two dictatorships [77] [78] The Finnish Democratic Republic was set up by Joseph Stalin at the beginning of the war to govern Finland after Soviet conquest [79] There was widespread international condemnation of the unprovoked attack and it led to the Soviet Union being expelled from the League of Nations [80] The Red Army was defeated in numerous battles, most notably the Battle of Suomussalmi After two months of negligible progress on the battlefield, as well as heavy losses in men and material, [81] Soviet forces began to advance in February and reached Vyborg (Finnish: Viipuri) in March The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed on 12 March 1940, and the war ended the following day Finland had defended its independence, but ceded 9% of its territory to the Soviet Union.\n\n\nAfter the war\nThe development of trade with the Western powers, such as the United Kingdom, and the payment of reparations to the Soviet Union led to Finland's transformation from a primarily agrarian society to an industrialised one Valmet, originally a shipyard and then several metal workshops, was established to produce materials for war reparations After the reparations were paid, Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union as part of bilateral trade.\n\n\n21st century\nThe Finnish people elected Tarja Halonen in the 2000 Presidential election, making her the first female President of Finland [89] Her predecessor, President Martti Ahtisaari, later won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008 Financial crises paralysed  Finland's exports in 2008, leading to weaker economic growth throughout the decade [90] [91] Sauli Niinistö was elected President of Finland from 2012 until 2024, when Alexander Stubb took over [92] [93]\n\n\nGeography\nLying approximately between latitudes 60° and 70° N, and longitudes 20° and 32° E, Finland is one of the world's northernmost countries Of world capitals, only Reykjavík lies more to the north than Helsinki The distance from the southernmost point – Hanko in Uusimaa – to the northernmost – Nuorgam in Lapland – is 1,160 kilometres (720 mi).\n\n\nBiodiversity\nPhytogeographically, Finland is shared between the Arctic, central European, and northern European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom According to the WWF, the territory of Finland can be subdivided into three ecoregions: the Scandinavian and Russian taiga, Sarmatic mixed forests, and Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands [109] Taiga covers most of Finland from northern regions of southern provinces to the north of Lapland On the southwestern coast, south of the Helsinki-Rauma line, forests are characterized by mixed forests, that are more typical in the Baltic region In the extreme north of Finland, near the tree line and Arctic Ocean, Montane Birch forests are common Finland had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.08/10, ranking it 109th globally out of 172 countries [110]\n\n\nClimate\nThe main factor influencing Finland's climate is the country's geographical position between the 60th and 70th northern parallels in the Eurasian continent's coastal zone In the Köppen climate classification, the whole of Finland lies in the boreal zone, characterized by warm summers and freezing winters Within the country, the temperateness varies considerably between the southern coastal regions and the extreme north, showing characteristics of both a maritime and a continental climate Finland is near enough to the Atlantic Ocean to be continuously warmed by the Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream combines with the moderating effects of the Baltic Sea and numerous inland lakes to explain the unusually warm climate compared with other regions that share the same latitude, such as Alaska, Siberia, and southern Greenland [117]\n\n\nRegions\nFinland consists of 19 regions (maakunta) The counties are governed by regional councils which serve as forums of cooperation for the municipalities of a county The main tasks of the counties are regional planning and development of enterprise and education In addition, the public health services are usually organized based on counties Regional councils are elected by municipal councils, each municipality sending representatives in proportion to its population In addition to inter-municipal cooperation, which is the responsibility of regional councils, each county has a state Employment and Economic Development Centre which is responsible for the local administration of labour, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and entrepreneurial affairs Historically, counties are divisions of historical provinces of Finland, areas that represent local dialects and culture more accurately.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe fundamental administrative divisions of the country are the municipalities, which may also call themselves towns or cities They account for half of the public spending Spending is financed by municipal income tax, state subsidies, and other revenue As of 2021 [update], there are 309 municipalities, [126] and most have fewer than 6,000 residents.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe Constitution of Finland defines the political system; Finland is a parliamentary republic within the framework of a representative democracy The Prime Minister is the country's most powerful person Citizens can run and vote in parliamentary, municipal, presidential, and European Union elections.\n\n\nConstitution\nThe Constitution of Finland defines the political system; Finland is a parliamentary republic within the framework of a representative democracy The Prime Minister is the country's most powerful person Citizens can run and vote in parliamentary, municipal, presidential, and European Union elections.\n\n\nPresident\nFinland's head of state is the President of the Republic Finland had, for most of its independence a semi-presidential system of government, but in the last few decades the powers of the president have become more circumscribed, and consequently the country is now considered a parliamentary republic [2] A new constitution, enacted in 2000, made the presidency primarily a ceremonial office The president appoints the prime minister as elected by Parliament, appoints and dismisses the other ministers of the Finnish Government on the recommendation of the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, and confers state honors Nevertheless, the president remains responsible for Finland's foreign relations, including the making of war and peace, but excluding matters related to the European Union [citation needed] Moreover, the president exercises supreme command over the Finnish Defence Forces as commander-in-chief In the exercise of his or her foreign and defense powers, the president is required to consult the Finnish government, but the government's advice is not binding In addition, the president has several domestic reserve powers, including the authority to veto legislation, to grant pardons, and to appoint several public officials [citation needed] The president is also required by the Constitution to dismiss individual ministers or the entire government upon a parliamentary vote of no confidence [128]\n\n\nParliament\nThe 200-member unicameral Parliament of Finland (Finnish: Eduskunta) exercises supreme legislative authority in the country It may alter the constitution and ordinary laws, dismiss the cabinet, and override presidential vetoes Its acts are not subject to judicial review; the constitutionality of new laws is assessed by the parliament's constitutional law committee The parliament is elected for a term of four years using the proportional D'Hondt method within several multi-seat constituencies through the most open list multi-member districts Various parliament committees listen to experts and prepare legislation.\n\n\nCabinet\nAfter parliamentary elections, the parties negotiate among themselves on forming a new cabinet (the Finnish Government), which then has to be approved by a simple majority vote in the parliament The cabinet can be dismissed by a parliamentary vote of no confidence, although this rarely happens, as the parties represented in the cabinet usually make up a majority in the parliament.\n\n\nLaw\nThe judicial system of Finland is a civil law system divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration Finnish law is codified and based on Swedish law and in a wider sense, civil law or Roman law The court system for civil and criminal jurisdiction consists of local courts, regional appellate courts, and the Supreme Court The administrative branch of justice consists of administrative courts and the Supreme Administrative Court In addition to the regular courts, there are a few special courts in certain branches of administration There is also a High Court of Impeachment for criminal charges against certain high-ranking officeholders.\n\n\nForeign relations\nAccording to the 2012 constitution, the president leads foreign policy in cooperation with the government, except that the president has no role in EU affairs [132] In 2008, president Martti Ahtisaari was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize [133]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Finnish Defence Forces consist of a cadre of professional soldiers (mainly officers and technical personnel), currently serving conscripts, and a large reserve The standard readiness strength is 34,700 people in uniform, of which 25% are professional soldiers A universal male conscription is in place, under which all male Finnish nationals above 18 years of age serve for 6 to 12 months of armed service or 12 months of civilian (non-armed) service.\nVoluntary post-conscription overseas peacekeeping service is popular, and troops serve around the world in UN, NATO, and EU missions Women are allowed to serve in all combat arms In 2022, 1211 women entered voluntary military service [137] The army consists of a highly mobile field army backed up by local defence units With a high capability of military personnel, [138] arsenal [139] and homeland defence willingness, Finland is one of Europe's militarily strongest countries [140]\n\n\nHuman rights\nFinland has one of the world's most extensive welfare systems, one that guarantees decent living conditions for all residents The welfare system was created almost entirely during the first three decades after World War II [149]\n\n\nEconomy\nAs of 2022 [update], Finland ranks 16th globally in nominal GDP per capita according to the IMF Additionally, Finland boasts a well-developed welfare system that encompasses free education and universal healthcare, contributing to its reputation as one of the wealthiest nations.\n\n\nEnergy\nThe free and largely privately owned financial and physical Nordic energy markets traded in NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe and Nord Pool Spot exchanges, have provided competitive prices compared with other EU countries As of 2022 [update], Finland has the lowest non-household electricity prices in the EU [173]\n\n\nTransport\nFinland's road

design, and architecture\nThe visual arts in Finland started to form their characteristics in the 19th century when Romantic nationalism was rising in autonomic Finland The best known Finnish painters, Akseli Gallen-Kallela, started painting in a naturalist style but moved to national romanticism Other notable painters of the era include Pekka Halonen, Eero Järnefelt, Helene Schjerfbeck and Hugo Simberg In the late 20th century, the homoerotic art of Touko Laaksonen, pseudonym Tom of Finland, found a worldwide audience [282] [283]\n\n\nMusic\nFinnish folk music can be divided into Nordic dance music and the older tradition of poem singing, poems from which the national epic, the Kalevala, was created.\nMuch of Finland's classical music is influenced by traditional Finnish and Karelian melodies and lyrics, as comprised in the Kalevala In the historical region of Finnish Karelia, as well as other parts of Eastern Finland, the old poem singing traditions were preserved better than in the western parts of the country, thus Karelian culture is perceived as less influenced by Germanic influence than the Nordic folk dance music that largely replaced the kalevaic tradition Finnish folk music has undergone a roots revival and has become a part of popular music The people of northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway, the Sami, are known primarily for highly spiritual songs called joik.\n\n\nCinema and television\nIn the film industry, notable modern directors include brothers Mika and Aki Kaurismäki, Dome Karukoski, Antti Jokinen, Jalmari Helander, and Renny Harlin Some Finnish drama series are internationally known, such as Bordertown [300]\n\n\nMedia and communications\nToday, there are around 200 newspapers, 320 popular magazines, 2,100 professional magazines, and 67 commercial radio stations The largest newspaper is Helsingin Sanomat, its circulation being 339,437 as of 2019 [update] [309] Yle, the Finnish Broadcasting Company, operates five television channels and thirteen radio channels Each year, around 12,000 book titles are published [310]\n\n\nSauna\nThe Finns' love for saunas is generally associated with Finnish cultural tradition in the world Sauna is a type of dry steam bath practiced widely in Finland, which is especially evident in the strong tradition around Midsummer and Christmas The word sauna is of Proto-Finnish origin (found in Finnic and Sami languages) dating back 7,000 years [314] Steam baths have been part of European tradition elsewhere as well, but the sauna has survived best in Finland, in addition to Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Russia, Norway, and parts of the United States and Canada Moreover, nearly all Finnish houses have either their own sauna or in multi-story apartment houses, a timeshare sauna Municipal swimming halls and hotels have often their own saunas The Finnish sauna culture is inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists [315] [316]\n\n\nCuisine\nFinnish cuisine generally combines traditional country fare and contemporary style cooking Potato, meat and fish play a prominent role in traditional Finnish dishes Finnish foods often use wholemeal products (rye, barley, oats) and berries (such as bilberries, lingonberries, cloudberries, and sea buckthorn) Milk and its derivatives like buttermilk are commonly used as food and drink The most popular fish food in Finland is salmon [318] [319]\n\n\nPublic holidays\nThere are several holidays in Finland, of which perhaps the most characteristic of Finnish culture include Christmas (joulu), Midsummer (juhannus), May Day (vappu) and Independence Day (itsenäisyyspäivä) Of these, Christmas and Midsummer are special in Finland because the actual festivities take place on eves, such as Christmas Eve [323] [324] and Midsummer's Eve, [325] [326] while Christmas Day and Midsummer's Day are more consecrated to rest Other public holidays in Finland are New Year's Day, Epiphany, Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday, Ascension Day, All Saints' Day and Saint Stephen's Day All official holidays in Finland are established by Acts of Parliament [327]\n\n\nSports\nVarious sporting events are popular in Finland Pesäpallo, the Finnish equivalent of American baseball, is the national sport of Finland, [330] [331] although the most popular sport in terms of spectators is ice hockey [332] Other popular sports include athletics, cross-country skiing, ski jumping, football, volleyball, and basketball [333] Association football is the most played team sport in terms of the number of players in the country [334] [335] Finland's national basketball team has received widespread public attention [336]\n\n\nSee also\n64°N 26°E﻿ / ﻿64°N 26°E﻿ / 64; 26\n\n\nNotes\n64°N 26°E﻿ / ﻿64°N

The Krays were thorough Eastenders – Charles from Shoreditch and Violet from Bethnal Green – and were apparently of mixed Irish, Austrian Jewish and Romanichal descent, [4] [5] [6] although this has been disputed [7] The brothers were identical twins, with Reggie born 10 minutes before Ronnie [8] Their parents already had a six-year-old son, Charles James (1927–2000) [8] A sister, Violet (born 1929), died in infancy [8] The twins contracted diphtheria when they were three years old.\n\n\nMilitary service\nThe Kray twins were called up to do National Service in the British Army in March 1952 Although the pair reported to the depot of the Royal Fusiliers at the Tower of London, they attempted to leave after only a few minutes When the corporal in charge tried to stop them, he was seriously injured by Ronnie when he punched him on the jaw The Krays walked back to their East End home where they were arrested the next morning by police and turned over to the army [19]\n\n\nCriminal careers\nThe Krays twins' criminal records and dishonourable discharges ended their boxing careers, and the brothers turned to crime full-time They bought a run-down snooker club in Mile End where they started several protection rackets By the end of the 1950s, the Krays were working for Jay Murray from Liverpool and were involved in truck hijacking, armed robbery, and arson, through which they acquired other clubs and properties In 1960, Ronnie was imprisoned for 18 months for running a protection racket While he was in prison, Peter Rachman, head of a landlord operation, sold Reggie a nightclub called Esmeralda's Barn to ward off threats of further extortion The location is where the Berkeley Hotel now stands [23]\n\n\nNightclub owners\nThe Krays twins' criminal records and

Ronnie was imprisoned for 18 months for running a protection racket While he was in prison, Peter Rachman, head of a landlord operation, sold Reggie a nightclub called Esmeralda's Barn to ward off threats of further extortion The location is where the Berkeley Hotel now stands [23]\n\n\nCelebrity status\nIn the 1960s, the Kray twins were widely seen as prosperous and charming celebrity nightclub owners and were part of the Swinging London scene A large part of their fame was due to their non-criminal activities as popular figures on the celebrity circuit, being photographed by David Bailey on more than one occasion and socialising with lords, MPs, socialites and show business characters, including Frank Sinatra, Peter Sellers, Joan Collins, Judy Garland, Diana Dors, George Raft, Sammy Davis Jr., Shirley Bassey, Liza Minnelli, Cliff Richard, Dusty Springfield, Jayne Mansfield, Richard Harris, Danny La Rue, and Barbara Windsor [27] [28]\n\n\nLord Boothby and Tom Driberg\nTom Driberg, a Labour MP and gossip columnist for the Daily Express, was well acquainted with the Conservative peer Lord Boothby through dinner parties hosted by Lord Beaverbrook, the proprietor of the newspaper [48] Through his friend, the theatre director Joan Littlewood, Driberg had met Reginald Kray, who in turn introduced Boothby to Ronnie [48] Ronnie and Boothby entered into a homosexual relationship, in which the masochistic Boothby enjoyed being dominated by Ronnie, a sexual sadist [49] This aspect of Boothby's life was unknown to the general public, who knew him as a celebrity peer who frequently represented the Conservative Party on talk shows [50] For the purposes of blackmail and the sense of power that came from associating with powerful men, Ronnie hosted parties for Boothby and other upper-class gay men where working class \"rent boys\" were made available for sex [51]\n\n\nAlliance with the American Mafia\nDuring the 1960s, the Kray twins formed an alliance with the Commission, the governing body of the American Mafia The brothers were in contact with Meyer Lansky and Angelo Bruno, two New York mafiosi who were looking to invest in London's nightclubs and casinos to engage in money laundering [59] Similar establishments in Havana had long served that purpose, but after the Cuban Revolution in 1959 led to their closure, the Mafia considered London as an alternative [59] The belief that the Krays were able to influence the British government by blackmailing political figures such as Boothby made them attractive as prospective partners [60] Both Lansky and Bruno were considered to be diplomatic figures by the standards of American organised crime, and were felt to be the most qualified to negotiate with the mercurial and irascible Krays.\n\n\nGeorge Cornell\nRonnie shot and killed George Cornell, a member of the Richardson Gang, at the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel on 9 March 1966 The day before, there had been a shoot-out at Mr Smith's, a nightclub in Catford, involving the Richardsons and Richard Hart, an associate of \"the Firm\" who was shot dead The shooting led to the arrest of nearly all the Richardson Gang Cornell, by chance, was not present at Mr Smith's and was not arrested.\n\n\nFrank Mitchell\nOn 12 December 1966, the Krays helped Frank Mitchell, \"the Mad Axeman\", [25] to escape from Dartmoor Prison Ronnie had befriended Mitchell while they served time together in Wandsworth Prison Mitchell felt that the authorities should review his case for parole, so Ronnie thought that he would be doing him a favour by getting him out of Dartmoor, highlighting his case in the media and forcing the authorities to act [71]  Once Mitchell had escaped, the Krays held him at a friend's flat in Barking Road, East Ham He was a large man with a mental disorder, and he was difficult to control He disappeared, but the Krays were acquitted of his murder [25] Freddie Foreman, a friend of the Krays, claimed in his autobiography Respect that he shot Mitchell dead as a favour to the twins and disposed of his body at sea [72]\n\n\nJack \"the Hat\" McVitie\nIn October 1967, four months after the suicide of his wife Frances, Reggie was allegedly encouraged by his brother to kill Jack \"the Hat\" McVitie, a minor member of the Kray gang who had failed to fulfill a £1,000 contract, £500 of which had been paid to him in advance, to kill their former financial adviser, Leslie Payne [73]: 546  [74] McVitie was lured to a basement flat in Evering Road, Stoke Newington, on the pretence of a party Upon entering the premises, he saw Ronnie seated in the front room Ronnie approached, letting loose a barrage of verbal abuse and cutting McVitie below his eye with a piece of broken glass It is believed that an argument then broke out between the twins and McVitie As the argument got more heated, Reggie pointed a handgun at McVitie's head and pulled the trigger twice, but the gun failed to discharge [73]: 547 \n\n\nArrest, prosecution and imprisonment\nDetective Chief Superintendent Leonard \"Nipper\" Read of Scotland Yard was promoted to the Murder Squad and his first assignment was to bring down the Kray twins During the first half of 1964, Read had been investigating their activities but publicity and official denials of Ron's relationship with Boothby made the evidence that he collected useless Read went after the twins again in 1967 but frequently came up against the East End \"wall of silence\" which discouraged anyone from providing information to the police [77] They were represented in court by Nemone Lethbridge [78]\n\n\nLater years\nRonnie and Reggie Kray were allowed, under a large police guard, to attend the funeral service of their mother Violet on 11 August 1982, following her death from cancer a week earlier They were not allowed to attend her burial in the Kray family plot at Chingford Mount Cemetery The funeral was attended by celebrities including Diana Dors and underworld figures known to the Krays [85] To avoid the publicity that had surrounded their mother's funeral, the twins did not ask for permission to attend their father's funeral in March 1983.\n\n\nPersonal lives\nIn his autobiography My Story (1993) and a comment to writer Robin McGibbon on The Kray Tapes, Ronnie stated: \"I'm bisexual, not gay Bisexual.\" In the 1960s, he also planned to marry a woman named Monica whom he had dated for nearly three years He called her \"the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.\"  This is mentioned in Reggie's book Born Fighter Also, extracts are mentioned in Ronnie's own book My Story and in Kate Kray's books Sorted; Murder, Madness and Marriage, and Free at Last.\n\n\nRonnie\nIn his autobiography My Story (1993) and a comment to writer Robin McGibbon on The Kray Tapes, Ronnie stated: \"I'm bisexual, not gay Bisexual.\" In the 1960s, he also planned to marry a woman named Monica whom he had dated for nearly three years He called her \"the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.\"  This is mentioned in Reggie's book Born Fighter Also, extracts are mentioned in Ronnie's own book My Story and in Kate Kray's books Sorted; Murder, Madness and Marriage, and Free at Last.\n\n\nReggie\nReggie married Frances Shea in 1965 It was thought she took her own life in 1967, but only two days after her death Ronnie confessed to Reggie that he had murdered her Reggie only told this to a few people, one of whom was a fellow inmate, Bradley Allardyce [95]  In 1997 Reggie married Roberta Jones, [92] whom he met while still in prison She was helping to publicise a film she was making about Ronnie, who had died in the hospital two years earlier [96]\n\n\nControversies\nThere was a long-running campaign, with some minor celebrity support, to have the twins released from prison, but successive Home Secretaries vetoed the idea, largely on the grounds that both Krays' prison records were marred by violence toward other inmates The campaign gathered momentum after the release of a film based on their lives called The Krays (1990) Produced by Ray Burdis, it starred Spandau Ballet brothers Martin and Gary Kemp, who played the roles of Reggie and Ronnie respectively Ronnie, Reggie and Charlie Kray received £255,000 for the film [92]\n\n\nThe Kray legend\nJenks and Lorentzen argued that the Krays have entered the realm of a popular myth [42] The definition of 'myth' used by Jenks and Lorentzen is that formulated by Peter Burke in a 1989 essay \"History as a Social Memory\", where he defined a 'myth' as follows: \"I am incidentally, using that slippery term 'myth' not in the positivist sense of 'inaccurate history', but in the richer, more positive sense of a story with symbolic meanings, made up of stereotyped incidents and involving characters who are larger than life, whether they are heroes or villains\" [104] Jenks and Lorentzen argued the Krays have become the embodiment of \"a particular version of East End history\" and as a symbol of a \"dark criminal past\" associated with the East End [105]\n\n\nDeaths\nRonnie suffered a heart attack at Broadmoor Hospital on 15 March 1995, and died two days later at the age of 61 at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, Berkshire [112] Reggie was allowed out of prison in handcuffs to attend the funeral [113]\n\n\nMedia\nThe Kray twins have seeded an extensive bibliography leading to many autobiographical accounts, biographical reconstructions, commentaries, analysis, fiction and speculation [83]\n\n\nFilm\nIn addition to films explicitly about the twins, James Fox met Ronnie whilst the twins were held at HM Prison Brixton as part of his research for his role in the 1970 film Performance, and Richard Burton visited Ronnie at Broadmoor as part of his preparation for his role as a violent gangster in the 1971 film Villain [92]\n\n\nLiterature\nTwo plays were produced in the 1970s that were based on thinly-veiled versions of the

A large part of their fame was due to their non-criminal activities as popular figures on the celebrity circuit, being photographed by David Bailey on more than one occasion and socialising with lords, MPs, socialites and show business characters, including Frank Sinatra, Peter Sellers, Joan Collins, Judy Garland, Diana Dors, George Raft, Sammy Davis Jr., Shirley Bassey, Liza Minnelli, Cliff Richard, Dusty Springfield, Jayne Mansfield, Richard Harris, Danny La Rue, and Barbara Windsor [27] [28]\n\n\nLord Boothby and Tom Driberg\nTom Driberg, a Labour MP and gossip columnist for the Daily Express, was well acquainted with the Conservative peer Lord Boothby through dinner parties hosted by Lord Beaverbrook, the proprietor of the newspaper [48] Through his friend, the theatre director Joan Littlewood, Driberg had met Reginald Kray, who in turn introduced Boothby to Ronnie [48] Ronnie and Boothby entered into a homosexual relationship, in which the masochistic Boothby enjoyed being dominated by Ronnie, a sexual sadist [49] This aspect of Boothby's life was unknown to the general public, who knew him as a celebrity peer who frequently represented the Conservative Party on talk shows [50] For the purposes of blackmail and the sense of power that came from associating with powerful men, Ronnie hosted parties for Boothby and other upper-class gay men where working class \"rent boys\" were made available for sex [51]\n\n\nAlliance with the American Mafia\nDuring the 1960s, the Kray twins formed an alliance with the Commission, the governing body of the American Mafia The brothers were in contact with Meyer Lansky and Angelo Bruno, two New York mafiosi who were looking to invest in London's nightclubs and casinos to engage in money laundering [59] Similar establishments in Havana had long served that purpose, but after the Cuban Revolution in 1959 led to their closure, the Mafia considered London as an alternative [59] The belief that the Krays were able to influence the British government by blackmailing political figures such as Boothby made them attractive as prospective partners [60] Both Lansky and Bruno were considered to be diplomatic figures by the standards of American organised crime, and were felt to be the most qualified to negotiate with the mercurial and irascible Krays.\n\n\nGeorge Cornell\nRonnie shot and killed George Cornell, a member of the Richardson Gang, at the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel on 9 March 1966 The day before, there had been a shoot-out at Mr Smith's, a nightclub in Catford, involving the Richardsons and Richard Hart, an associate of \"the Firm\" who was shot dead The shooting led to the arrest of nearly all the Richardson Gang Cornell, by chance, was not present at Mr Smith's and was not arrested.\n\n\nFrank Mitchell\nOn 12 December 1966, the Krays helped Frank Mitchell, \"the Mad Axeman\", [25] to escape from Dartmoor Prison Ronnie had befriended Mitchell while they served time together in Wandsworth Prison Mitchell felt that the authorities should review his case for parole, so Ronnie thought that he would be doing him a favour by getting him out of Dartmoor, highlighting his case in the media and forcing the authorities to act [71]  Once Mitchell had escaped, the Krays held him at a friend's flat in Barking Road, East Ham He was a large man with a mental disorder, and he was difficult to control He disappeared, but the Krays were acquitted of his murder [25] Freddie Foreman, a friend of the Krays, claimed in his autobiography Respect that he shot Mitchell dead as a favour to the twins and disposed of his body at sea [72]\n\n\nJack \"the Hat\" McVitie\nIn October 1967, four months after the suicide of his wife Frances, Reggie was allegedly encouraged by his brother to kill Jack \"the Hat\" McVitie, a minor member of the Kray gang who had failed to fulfill a £1,000 contract, £500 of which had been paid to him in advance, to kill their former financial adviser, Leslie Payne [73]: 546  [74] McVitie was lured to a basement flat in Evering Road, Stoke Newington, on the pretence of a party Upon entering the premises, he saw Ronnie seated in the front room Ronnie approached, letting loose a barrage of verbal abuse and cutting McVitie below his eye with a piece of broken glass It is believed that an argument then broke out between the twins and McVitie As the argument got more heated, Reggie pointed a handgun at McVitie's head and pulled the trigger twice, but the gun failed to discharge [73]: 547 \n\n\nArrest, prosecution and imprisonment\nDetective Chief Superintendent Leonard \"Nipper\" Read of Scotland Yard was promoted to the Murder Squad and his first assignment was to bring down the Kray twins During the first half of 1964, Read had been investigating their activities but publicity and official denials of Ron's relationship with Boothby made the evidence that he collected useless Read went after the twins again in 1967 but frequently came up against the East End \"wall of silence\" which discouraged anyone from providing information to the police [77] They were represented in court by Nemone Lethbridge [78]\n\n\nLater years\nRonnie and Reggie Kray were allowed, under a large police guard, to attend the funeral service of their mother Violet on 11 August 1982, following her death from cancer a week earlier They were not allowed to attend her burial in the Kray family plot at Chingford Mount Cemetery The funeral was attended by celebrities including Diana Dors and underworld figures known to the Krays [85] To avoid the publicity that had surrounded their mother's funeral, the twins did not ask for permission to attend their father's funeral in March 1983.\n\n\nPersonal lives\nIn his autobiography My Story (1993) and a comment to writer Robin McGibbon on The Kray Tapes, Ronnie stated: \"I'm bisexual, not gay Bisexual.\" In the 1960s, he also planned to marry a woman named Monica whom he had dated for nearly three years He called her \"the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.\"  This is mentioned in Reggie's book Born Fighter Also, extracts are mentioned in Ronnie's own book My Story and in Kate Kray's books Sorted; Murder, Madness and Marriage, and Free at Last.\n\n\nRonnie\nIn his autobiography My Story (1993) and a comment to writer Robin McGibbon on The Kray Tapes, Ronnie stated: \"I'm bisexual, not gay Bisexual.\" In the 1960s, he also planned to marry a woman named Monica whom he had dated for nearly three years He called her \"the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.\"  This is mentioned in Reggie's book Born Fighter Also, extracts are mentioned in Ronnie's own book My Story and in Kate Kray's books Sorted; Murder, Madness and Marriage, and Free at Last.\n\n\nReggie\nReggie married Frances Shea in 1965 It was thought she took her own life in 1967, but only two days after her death Ronnie confessed to Reggie that he had murdered her Reggie only told this to a few people, one of whom was a fellow inmate, Bradley Allardyce [95]  In 1997 Reggie married Roberta Jones, [92] whom he met while still in prison She was helping to publicise a film she was making about Ronnie, who had died in the hospital two years earlier [96]\n\n\nControversies\nThere was a long-running campaign, with some minor celebrity support, to have the twins released from prison, but successive Home Secretaries vetoed the idea, largely on the grounds that both Krays' prison records were marred by violence toward other inmates The campaign gathered momentum after the release of a film based on their lives called The Krays (1990) Produced by Ray Burdis, it starred Spandau Ballet brothers Martin and Gary Kemp, who played the roles of Reggie and Ronnie respectively Ronnie, Reggie and Charlie Kray received £255,000 for the film [92]\n\n\nThe Kray legend\nJenks and Lorentzen argued that the Krays have entered the realm of a popular myth [42] The definition of 'myth' used by Jenks and Lorentzen is that formulated by Peter Burke in a 1989 essay \"History as a Social Memory\", where he defined a 'myth' as follows: \"I am incidentally, using that slippery term 'myth' not in the positivist sense of 'inaccurate history', but in the richer, more positive sense of a story with symbolic meanings, made up of stereotyped incidents and involving characters who are larger than life, whether they are heroes or villains\" [104] Jenks and Lorentzen argued the Krays have become the embodiment of \"a particular version of East End history\" and as a symbol of a \"dark criminal past\" associated with the East End [105]\n\n\nDeaths\nRonnie suffered a heart attack at Broadmoor Hospital on 15 March 1995, and died two days later at the age of 61 at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, Berkshire [112] Reggie was allowed out of prison in handcuffs to attend the funeral [113]\n\n\nMedia\nThe Kray twins have seeded an extensive bibliography leading to many autobiographical accounts, biographical reconstructions, commentaries, analysis, fiction and speculation [83]\n\n\nFilm\nIn addition to films explicitly about the twins, James Fox met Ronnie whilst the twins were held at HM Prison Brixton as part of his research for his role in the 1970 film Performance, and Richard Burton visited Ronnie at Broadmoor as part of his preparation for his role as a violent gangster in the 1971 film Villain [92]\n\n\nLiterature\nTwo plays were produced in the 1970s that were based on thinly-veiled versions of the Krays:\n\n\nTheatre\nTwo plays were produced in

The game received mixed reviews from critics and has been nominated for several awards.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe Suicide of Rachel Foster is a mystery-thriller adventure game played from a first-person perspective. The player takes control of Nicole Wilson as she explores the Timberline Hotel, owned by her family. Nicole's only means of communication is a radiotelephone she can use to talk to FEMA agent Irving; the player can choose from a dialogue tree how they reply during conversations with him. During the course of the game, Nicole will have to solve \"very light environmental puzzles\" to progress with the story, such as acquiring a screwdriver or finding a generator switch. Nicole also has a map to help her navigate through the Timberline; objectives to progress with the game's story are marked on it.\n\nAs the game progresses, Nicole also acquires a polaroid camera, a mechanically powered flashlight, and a parabolic microphone, which are needed to solve certain puzzles. At one point during a blackout in the Timberline, Nicole has to use the flash from the polaroid camera as a light source.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe game takes place in December 1993, and Nicole Wilson reads a letter from her dead mother Claire. Nicole's father, Leonard McGrath, was the owner of the Timberline Hotel, a mountain hotel in Lewis and Clark County, Montana. In 1983, Leonard groomed and molested Nicole's 16-year-old classmate Rachel Foster. Once their relationship was discovered, Rachel seemingly killed herself nine weeks into her pregnancy, and Claire left town with Nicole. In the letter, Claire instructs Nicole to inspect the hotel and sell it.\n\n**Development and Release**\n\nThe Suicide of Rachel Foster was revealed during Gamescom 2018.

The game was made available on the Nintendo Switch on October 31, 2021.\n\n**Setting**\n\nLead programmer Lorenzo Bellincampi stated that The Suicide of Rachel Foster was not a horror game but a video game geared towards \"nostalgia and mystery rather than fear or terror\". The studio wished to create a psychological horror game evoking \"unease and fear\" without having to resort to traditional monsters or tropes. From the start of the game's development, rather than finishing the story and only then choosing an appropriate gameplay style, the studio intended for the narrative and gameplay to complement each other. The Suicide of Rachel Foster was made as a walking simulator due to the genre's high emphasis on narrative, allowing for the exploration of real-life topics.\n\n**Story and Themes**\n\nAzara stated that the developers were challenged with portraying and discussing topics such as child sexual abuse, grief, and suicide without becoming overly morbid and depressing. To achieve this and portray these topics with sensitivity, they sought advice from partners and professionals. Regarding Rachel and Leonard's relationship, One-O-One stated they were interested in exploring the moral implications of such a situation.

With a career spanning over three decades, Elwes has established himself as a versatile and accomplished actor, appearing in a wide range of films, television shows, and stage productions.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nIvan Simon Cary Elwes was born on October 26, 1962, in Westminster, London. He is the youngest of three sons of portrait painter Dominick Elwes and Tessa Kennedy, an interior designer and socialite. Cary's brother, Damian Elwes, is a well-known artist, and his brother, Cassian Elwes, is a film producer. His stepfather, Elliott Kastner, was an American film producer who was the first American to set up independent film production in the United Kingdom. Cary's paternal grandfather was the portrait painter Simon Elwes, whose own father was the diplomat and tenor Gervase Elwes (1866–1921).\n\nElwes's early life was marked by a strong interest in the arts. He attended the prestigious Dragon School in Oxford, where he developed a passion for acting and the performing arts. After completing his education, Elwes began to pursue a career in acting, eventually making his film debut in 1984.\n\n**Career**\n\nElwes made his acting debut in 1984 in Marek Kanievska's film _Another Country_, which was loosely based on the English boarding school exploits of British spies Burgess, Philby, and MacLean. He played the role of James Harcourt, a gay student. This was followed by his portrayal of Guilford Dudley in the British historical drama film _Lady Jane_, opposite Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nHowever, it was his iconic role as Westley in Rob Reiner's fantasy-comedy _The Princess Bride_ (1987) that catapulted Elwes to international fame. Based on the novel of the same name by William Goldman, the film was a modest box office success but received critical acclaim. As a result of years of reviews, it earned a score of 97% on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. Since being released on home video and television, the film has become a cult classic.\n\nOver the years, Elwes has appeared in a wide range of films, including _The Cat's Meow_ (2001), _The X-Files_ (2001-2002), _The Exonerated_ (2003), _Saw 3D_ (2010), and _New Year's Eve_ (2011). He has also reprised his role as Dr. Lawrence Gordon in the _Saw_ franchise and appeared in the TV series _Psych_.\n\n**2000-2009**\n\nIn 2001, Elwes co-starred in Peter Bogdanovich's ensemble film _The Cat's Meow_, portraying film mogul Thomas Ince, who died mysteriously while vacationing with William Randolph Hearst on his yacht. Shortly afterward, Elwes received another Golden Satellite Award nomination for his work on the ensemble NBC Television film _Uprising_ opposite Jon Voight, directed by Jon Avnet.\n\nElwes had a recurring role in the final season (from 2001 to 2002) of Chris Carter's hit series _The X-Files_ as FBI Assistant Director Brad Follmer. In 2003, Elwes portrayed Kerry Max Cook in the off-Broadway play _The Exonerated_ in New York, directed by Bob Balaban (18-23 March 2003).\n\n**2010-Present**\n\nIn 2010, Elwes returned to the _Saw_ franchise in _Saw 3D_ (2010), the seventh film in the series, as Dr. Lawrence Gordon. He also reprised his role in the TV series _Psych_, appearing in the second half of the fifth season, again in the show's sixth season, and again in the show's eighth season premiere.\n\nIn 2011, Elwes was selected by Ivan Reitman to star alongside Natalie Portman in _No Strings Attached_. That same year, Elwes and Garry Marshall teamed up again in the ensemble romantic comedy _New Year's Eve_ opposite Robert de Niro and Halle Berry.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nElwes met photographer Lisa Marie Kurbikoff in 1991 at a chili cook-off in Malibu, California; they were engaged in 1997. They married in 2000 and have one daughter.\n\n**Saw Lawsuit**\n\nIn August 2005, Elwes filed a lawsuit against Evolution Entertainment, his management firm and producer of _Saw_. Elwes said he was promised a minimum of 1% of the producers' net profits and did not receive the full amount. The case was settled out of court. Elwes returned to the series in 2010 reprising his role in _Saw 3D_.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* _Another Country_ (1984)\n* _Lady Jane_ (1986)\n* _The Princess Bride_ (1987)\n* _The Cat's Meow_ (2001)\n* _The X-Files_ (2001-2002)\n* _The Exonerated_ (2003)\n* _Saw 3D_ (2010)\n* _New Year's Eve_ (2011)\n* _Psych_ (2010-2014)\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\n* Golden Satellite Award nomination for _The Cat's Meow_ (2001)\n* Golden Satellite Award nomination for _Uprising_ (2001)\n\n**Works**\n\n* _The Princess Bride_ (novel) by William Goldman\n* _The Cat's Meow_ (novel) by Steven Perelman\n\n**References**\n\n* _The Princess Bride_ (Wikipedia article)\n* _The Cat's Meow_ (Wikipedia article)\n* _The X-Files_ (Wikipedia article)\n* _The Exonerated_ (Wikipedia article)\n* _Saw 3D_ (Wikipedia article)\n* _New Year's Eve_ (Wikipedia article)\n* _Psych_ (Wikipedia article)\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Cary Elwes official website\n* Cary Elwes on IMDb\n* Cary Elwes on Twitter", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cary_Elwes\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nIvan Simon Cary Elwes was born on 26 October 1962 in Westminster, London He is the youngest of three sons of portrait painter Dominick Elwes [10] and Tessa Kennedy, an interior designer and socialite Cary is the brother of artist Damian Elwes [11] and film producers Cassian Elwes and Milica Kastner Cary's stepfather, Elliott Kastner, was an American film producer and the first American to set up independent film production in the United Kingdom [10] Cary's paternal grandfather was the portrait painter Simon Elwes, [11] whose own father was the diplomat and tenor Gervase Elwes (1866–1921) [12]\n\n\nCareer\nElwes made his acting debut in 1984 in Marek Kanievska's film Another Country, which was loosely based on the English boarding school exploits of British spies Burgess, Philby and MacLean He played James Harcourt, a gay student [11] He then played Guilford Dudley in the British historical drama film Lady Jane, opposite Helena Bonham Carter He was cast as stable-boy-turned-swashbuckler Westley in Rob Reiner's fantasy-comedy The Princess Bride (1987), which was based on the novel of the same name by William Goldman It was a modest box office success, [22] but received critical acclaim As a result of years of reviews, it earned a score of 97% on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes [23] Since being released on home video and television, the film has become a cult classic [22]\n\n\n1984–1999\nElwes made his acting debut in 1984 in Marek Kanievska's film Another Country, which was loosely based on the English boarding school exploits of British spies Burgess, Philby and MacLean He played James Harcourt, a gay student [11] He then played Guilford Dudley in the British historical drama film Lady Jane, opposite Helena Bonham Carter He was cast as stable-boy-turned-swashbuckler Westley in Rob Reiner's fantasy-comedy The Princess Bride (1987), which was based on the novel of the same name by William Goldman It was a modest box office success, [22] but received critical acclaim As a result of years of reviews, it earned a score of 97% on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes [23] Since being released on home video and television, the film has become a cult classic [22]\n\n\n2000–2009\nIn 2001, he co-starred in Peter Bogdanovich's ensemble film The Cat's Meow portraying film mogul Thomas Ince, who died mysteriously while vacationing with William Randolph Hearst on his yacht Shortly afterward Elwes received another Golden Satellite Award nomination for his work on the ensemble NBC Television film Uprising opposite Jon Voight directed by Jon Avnet Elwes had a recurring role in the final season (from 2001 to 2002) of Chris Carter's hit series The X-Files as FBI Assistant Director Brad Follmer In 2003 Elwes portrayed Kerry Max Cook in the off-Broadway play The Exonerated in New York, directed by Bob Balaban (18–23 March 2003) [25]\n\n\n2010–present\nIn 2010, he returned to the Saw franchise in Saw 3D (2010), the seventh film in the series, as Dr Lawrence Gordon [32] In 2010, he returned to Psych, reprising his role in the second half of the fifth season, again in the show's sixth season, and again in the show's eighth season premiere [33] In 2014, Elwes played Hugh Ashmeade, Director of the CIA, in the second season of the BYUtv series Granite Flats In 2011, he was selected by Ivan Reitman to star alongside Natalie Portman in No Strings Attached That same year, Elwes and Garry Marshall teamed up again in the ensemble romantic comedy New Year's Eve opposite Robert de Niro and Halle Berry.\n\n\nPersonal life\nElwes met photographer Lisa Marie Kurbikoff in 1991 at a chili cook-off in Malibu, California;

come out of Arizona by the time he is done here.\" Iguodala was named to the Pac-10 All-Freshmen team for 2002–03 In his freshman year, Iguodala quickly established himself as one of the best

three-point line He's not going to be able to play.\" [15] Iguodala used this as motivation in what proved to be a very productive rookie season [16] He was thrust into the starting lineup immediately

permanent fixture in the 76ers' starting rotation, Iguodala was the only Sixer to play in and start all 82 games in his second season On February 17, 2006, at the Rookie Challenge, Iguodala won MVP honors for his 30-point performance in the Sophomores win [20] The next day, he participated in the Slam Dunk Contest Iguodala's first dunk was a simple windmill Next, he received a pass from Allen Iverson off the back side of the backboard, leapt beneath the board, and reverse dunked on the other side, earning a perfect score of 50 points In the final round, Iguodala did a behind-the-back dunk and followed with a reverse However, in a controversial decision, [21] [22] [23] the award was given to Nate Robinson [24] (who had missed 14 straight dunk attempts before succeeding on his last) [25] Iguodala averaged 12.3 points and 5.9 rebounds on the season.\n\n\n2006–07 season: Leadership role\nAfter Allen Iverson was traded to the Denver Nuggets and Chris Webber was released, Iguodala emerged as a team leader on the 76ers At the time of Webber's release, the 76ers were 9–26 (Iverson only played 15 games before he was traded) Averaging 40.3 minutes per game during a late-season run, he paced the team to a 26–21 finish, just shy of the #8-seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, albeit a record padded by other teams \"tanking\" to secure a higher draft pick [26] Iguodala went on to finish the season with averages of 18.2 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 5.7 assists, combined tallies matched or bettered only by LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Tracy McGrady.\n\n\n2007–08 season: Career high in scoring\nIguodala got off to a slow start to the season, even to a point where he was leading the league in turnovers Iguodala began to step up his game as the season went on, leading Philadelphia to a playoff berth The 76ers finished the season at 40–42, winning 22 of their last 29 games and earning a playoff spot with a victory over the Atlanta Hawks on April 4 Iguodala averaged a career-high 19.9 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 4.8 assists per game through the 82 games Philadelphia was set to face the No 2 seed Detroit In the playoffs, the 76ers lost in the first round to the Pistons in six games despite a 2–1 lead Iguodala had a poor postseason series, averaging 13 points per game.\n\n\n2008–09 season: Leading the NBA in minutes\nOn August 17, 2008, Iguodala signed a six-year, $80 million contract extension with the 76ers [27] The contract had $5 million in bonuses and a player option for the sixth year.\n\n\n2009–10 season: Reunion with Allen Iverson\nIn the preseason, Philadelphia drafted point guard Jrue Holiday out of UCLA to take over the void left at point guard after the departure of veteran point guard Andre Miller, who had joined the Portland Trail Blazers The Sixers hired coach Eddie Jordan to take over for Tony DiLeo Iguodala averaged career-highs in rebounds, assists, and blocks, and a career-low in personal fouls He finished the season averaging 17.1 points, 6.5 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 1.7 steals However, the 76ers were a big disappointment, going only 27–55 during the regular season and missing the playoffs after two straight playoff berths During the season, the 76ers brought Iguodala's old friend Allen Iverson back in what would be his final season in the NBA before going to play overseas for Beşiktaş.\n\n\n2010–11 season: All-Defensive Second Team\nComing into the 2010–11 NBA season, the 76ers were expected to rebound from their poor season They fired head coach Eddie Jordan and brought in Doug Collins Philadelphia also traded veteran big man Samuel Dalembert to the Sacramento Kings for a younger center Spencer Hawes; the 76ers also acquired Andrés Nocioni in the deal With the second overall pick in the draft, the Sixers made a big splash by drafting Evan Turner Philadelphia started the season poorly but were one of the best teams down the stretch During the season, Iguodala was hampered by an Achilles injury, leading to career lows in games played and started, field-goal percentage, free-throw percentage, and steals per game as the 76ers finished with a 41–41 record However, Iguodala also had his career-best season in assists with 6.3 assists per game and helped the 76ers make the playoffs with the #7-seed in the Eastern Conference During the year, Iguodala was the subject of multiple trade rumors that had him being traded to either the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers or Los Angeles Lakers In the playoffs, Iguodala had the assignment of guarding James and Dwyane Wade in

archetypal \"wise old man\" characters Dumbledore acts much like Merlin from The Sword in the Stone, in the manner of an \"absent-minded professor\"; [34] both Merlin and Dumbledore educate a story's main character in a castle As writer Evelyn Perry notes, \"Dumbledore resembles Merlin both personally and physically; he is an avid lover of books and wisdom who wears flowing robes and a long, white beard.\" [35] Dumbledore has also been compared with Gandalf from J R R Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings [36] Dave Kopel draws comparisons between Rowling's writing and John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress and states that, among the Christian symbols that Rowling has used in her books, Dumbledore acts like \"the bearded God the Father\" figure in which Harry puts his faith to be saved from Voldemort and his servants [37] IGN also listed Dumbledore as their fifth favourite Harry Potter character, saying that \" [f]or a character that was introduced into popular culture a mere twelve years ago, it speaks volumes that Professor Dumbledore has already taken his place among the great mentor figures in literature and film\" [38] IGN's Joe Utichi called Dumbledore his third favourite Harry Potter character, calling the revelation that he wasn't so \"infallible\" one of the most heartbreaking themes of the final book [39] Actor Michael Gambon received some criticism for his louder, more aggressive, portrayal of the character, who is depicted as exhibiting a more subdued, unflappable calm in the books This has been attributed to Gambon's policy of not reading the source material from which his films are adapted [40]\n\n\nSexuality\nIn October 2007, while answering reader questions during a book reading at Carnegie Hall, Rowling was asked if Dumbledore had ever been in love She answered, \"I always thought Dumbledore is gay\" She discussed for the first time his romantic relationship with his rival Gellert Grindelwald, describing it as a \"great tragedy\" She said she had informed David Yates, the director of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, of Dumbledore's sexuality by writing a note in the screenplay She had crossed out a section where Dumbledore describes his attraction to a woman, and had written \"Dumbledore is gay.\" [45] When Yates learned about Dumbledore's sexuality, he recalled thinking it was \"pretty cool\" [46] Michael Gambon, who portrays Dumbledore in six of the eight Harry Potter films, was reportedly amused by the revelation Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry in the film series, found the news \"hilarious\"

Rowling. He is the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and one of the most powerful wizards of all time.\n\n## Creation and Development\n\nJ.K. Rowling has described Dumbledore as \"the epitome of goodness.\" She said that he speaks for her, as he \"knows pretty much everything\" about the Harry Potter universe. Rowling mentioned that Dumbledore regrets \"that he has always had to be the one who knew, and who had the burden of knowing.\" He would rather not know. Dumbledore is a very wise man who knows that Harry is going to have to learn a few hard lessons to prepare him for what may be coming in his life. He allows Harry to get into what he would not allow another pupil to do, and he also unwillingly permits Harry to confront things he'd rather protect him from.\n\n## Appearances in Novels\n\nDumbledore is introduced in the opening chapter of the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Under cover of night, he brings the infant Harry Potter to the home of Harry's uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley. Harry's parents were killed by the Dark wizard Voldemort, and Dumbledore hopes he will be safe with the Dursleys. He leaves Harry on the doorstep with a letter explaining the situation. When Harry arrives at Hogwarts ten years later, Dumbledore tells him about the Mirror of Erised, a magical object that protects the Philosopher's Stone. Dumbledore is summoned to the Ministry of Magic by a false message on the night when Harry, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Professor Quirinus Quirrell enter the dungeons to retrieve the Stone. He realises during the trip that he is needed at Hogwarts, and returns in time to rescue Harry from Quirrell and Voldemort.\n\n## Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n\nDumbledore returns in the second novel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Through a magical diary, Harry sees a younger Dumbledore in a series of flashbacks. The diary once belonged to Tom Riddle, who eventually became Voldemort. In one flashback, Harry sees Dumbledore questioning Riddle about a series of attacks on Muggle-born students. In the present, a basilisk emerges from the Chamber of Secrets and begins attacking people in Hogwarts. Following the attacks, Lucius Malfoy convinces the governors of Hogwarts to suspend Dumbledore from his position as Headmaster. Dumbledore is reinstated when it is revealed that Lucius coerced the governors into suspending him.\n\n## Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\nAt the beginning of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Dumbledore is forced to accept the presence of Dementors at Hogwarts. The Dementors have been sent to protect the students from Sirius Black, a supposed murderer who escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban. When Black breaches Hogwarts, Dumbledore closes every entrance to the school and grounds. After the Dementors cause Harry to fall off his broom during a Quidditch match, Dumbledore becomes angry and uses his wand to help Harry return safely to the ground. Later, Dumbledore suggests that Hermione use her Time-Turner to save Black and Buckbeak the hippogriff from execution.\n\n## Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n\nIn Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Dumbledore brings the Triwizard Tournament to Hogwarts. He also serves as a judge throughout the event. After the final task of the tournament, Harry returns from an encounter with Voldemort. Professor Mad-Eye Moody escorts Harry into the castle, and Dumbledore becomes suspicious. He discovers that Moody is actually Barty Crouch Jr., and that the real Moody is being held prisoner by Crouch. Later, Dumbledore listens to Harry's account of Voldemort's return.\n\n## Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\nDumbledore appears in the fifth novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. He is removed from his position as Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards, and is almost stripped of his Order of Merlin First Class due to his speeches regarding the return of Voldemort. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Magic attempts to discredit him and Harry, often through the Daily Prophet. Dumbledore enrages Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge when he intercedes at a hearing to prevent Harry from being expelled from Hogwarts.\n\n## Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\nIn Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore brings Harry along as he attempts to persuade Horace Slughorn to rejoin the Hogwarts faculty. Harry notices that Dumbledore's right hand is shrivelled and blackened. During the school year, Dumbledore uses the Pensieve to teach Harry about Voldemort's life and his rise to power. In one of the Pensieve visions, Harry witnesses Dumbledore's first encounter with the young Tom Riddle. Dumbledore had known from the beginning that Riddle was dangerous, but believed that Hogwarts would change him.\n\n## Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\n\nDetails of Dumbledore's earlier life are revealed in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The novel introduces his parents, Percival and Kendra Dumbledore, and his younger sister, Ariana. At the age of six, Ariana was attacked by three Muggle boys who witnessed her performing magic. She was deeply traumatised and was never able to control her magic again. Enraged, Percival attacked the boys and was given a life sentence in Azkaban. Kendra subsequently moved the family to the village of Godric's Hollow. Around the time that Albus completed his education, Ariana accidentally killed their mother. Albus became the head of the family and remained in their house with Ariana while Aberforth finished school.\n\n## Portrayal in Films\n\nIn the film adaptations of Philosopher's Stone (2001) and Chamber of Secrets (2002), Dumbledore is portrayed by Richard Harris. Before Harris was cast, Patrick McGoohan reportedly had an interest in the role, but could not commit due to health issues. Sean Connery was approached, but declined due to the film's subject matter. Harris turned down the role three times but eventually accepted it because his 11-year-old granddaughter threatened to never speak to him again if he did not take it. Harris was determined to portray Dumbledore again in Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), despite having been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, and asked David Heyman not to recast the role. However, his death in October 2002 necessitated recasting.\n\n## Characterisation\n\nIn the novels, Dumbledore is described as tall, thin and elderly. His hair and beard are long and silver. He has a long and crooked nose, long fingers and bright blue eyes. He wears half-moon spectacles and a colourful array of robes.

He was born on February 24, 1948, in Lanark, Scotland, and grew up in the Carmyle district in the East End of Glasgow. Smith was a boyhood fan of Rangers and went on to play for several clubs, including Dundee United and Rangers, before embarking on a successful managerial career.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nSmith was born in Lanark, but grew up in the Carmyle district in the East End of Glasgow. He was a boyhood fan of Rangers and was heavily influenced by the club's success during the 1960s. Smith's early life was marked by a strong passion for football, and he began playing for local clubs as a young boy. He was employed by the South of Scotland Electricity Board, and played youth football for Drumchapel Amateurs, before launching his football career in the 1960s with Junior League team Ashfield.\n\n**Playing Career**\n\nSmith was one of three Ashfield players signed by Dundee United manager Jerry Kerr in 1966, joining the club in November shortly after teammates Jim Cameron and Gerry Hernon. A versatile player, Smith appeared for the reserve team in a number of positions, initially as a right-half. He made his first team debut in a Scottish Football League match against Kilmarnock on 20 March 1967. Smith continued to play regularly for the reserves, but made only a handful of first-team appearances for Dundee United over the next four years until establishing himself in the latter part of the 1970–71 season. He also played for the Dallas Tornado in the United Soccer Association in 1967, when their roster was supplemented with Dundee United players.\n\n**Dundee United**\n\nSmith was one of three Ashfield players signed by Dundee United manager Jerry Kerr in 1966, joining the club in November shortly after teammates Jim Cameron and Gerry Hernon.

He also played for the Dallas Tornado in the United Soccer Association in 1967, when their roster was supplemented with Dundee United players.\n\n**Dumbarton and Return to Dundee United**\n\nSmith was brought to Dumbarton for a fee of £8,000 by the management team of Alex Wright and former Rangers player Davie Wilson, who was one of Smith's heroes as a teenage supporter. Wilson worked alongside Smith's father at a local steelworks in the village of Westburn, Cambuslang, and was a senior teammate at Dundee United. During his spell with Dumbarton, the club made a rare appearance at the semi-final stage of the Scottish Cup in 1976, losing to Hearts after a replay, with Smith scoring an early own goal.\n\n**Managerial Career**\n\nSmith developed his coaching skills as assistant manager to Jim McLean, at a time when Dundee United were Scottish champions and European Cup semi-finalists. While working with McLean, a notoriously hard-bitten manager, Smith developed a reputation for being a strict disciplinarian. According to Kevin Gallacher, who was an apprentice of the club at the time in the early 1980s, Smith could become ferociously angry and was known to deal out punches to enforce discipline. He joined Dundee United's board of directors in 1986.\n\n**Coaching Dundee United and Scotland**\n\nSmith developed his coaching skills as assistant manager to Jim McLean, at a time when Dundee United were Scottish champions and European Cup semi-finalists.

Smith accepted the offer and within a few weeks Rangers made an official approach to Dundee United, who demanded £50,000 in compensation. The then Rangers chief executive David Holmes duly paid that amount, and Smith was allowed to join Rangers on 16 April. Smith was initially placed in temporary charge of the first team whilst Souness negotiated his own release from his playing contract with Italian side Sampdoria. He took sole charge of two Scottish Premier Division matches, on 19 and 26 April, both away, to St Mirren and Aberdeen respectively.\n\n**Everton**\n\nAfter success in his native Scotland, Smith's retirement lasted a month as he took the manager's job at Premier League club Everton in June 1998. Initially Smith had been linked with the manager's job at Sheffield Wednesday, but false promises made to him by the Everton chairman of massive transfer funds and unlimited ambition lured Smith to Goodison Park. Smith spent money on players only to discover that it was money the club did not have. When Duncan Ferguson was sold behind Smith's back, he was tempted to quit. The remainder of his time at Everton revolved around selling the club's better players such as John Collins, Olivier Dacourt, Don Hutchison, Marco Materazzi, Nick Barmby, Francis Jeffers, and Michael Ball to balance the books.\n\n**Manchester United**\n\nIn March 2004, Smith returned to football when he had a short spell as assistant manager to Alex Ferguson at Manchester United at the end of the 2003–04 season.

James's career has spanned over a decade, with notable performances in productions such as the Downton Abbey series and the film adaptation of The Divergent Series.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJames was born to Philip Taptiklis, a business consultant, and Jane (née Martin), who worked for the National Health Service. His grandfather was a Greek refugee who fled to Syria during World War II, giving James a unique cultural heritage. He is also of part Scottish descent, adding to his diverse ancestry. James has two older brothers and two older sisters, and his family's background has likely influenced his interest in the arts.\n\nGrowing up, James was interested in acting and attended a local drama school.

This marked the beginning of his transition from television to film, and he was subsequently named a \"Star of Tomorrow\" by Screen International in 2009.\n\nJames's breakthrough role came in 2014 when he was cast as Four in The Divergent Series. The film series, based on the popular young adult novels by Veronica Roth, follows the story of Tris Prior (played by Shailene Woodley) as she navigates a dystopian society. James's performance as the brooding and complex Four earned him a fan base, and he went on to reprise his role in the subsequent films of the series.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nJames is married to Irish actress Ruth Kearney, whom he met at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. The couple has two children, and they divide their time between Venice Beach, California, and North London.

The film is based on the 2007 novel of the same name by John Preston, which tells the story of the excavation of the Sutton Hoo helmet in Suffolk, England in 1939.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe film takes place in 1939, during the early years of World War II. Edith Pretty, a wealthy landowner from Suffolk, hires local self-taught archaeologist Basil Brown to excavate the large burial mounds on her estate in Sutton Hoo. At first, she offers Brown the same amount of money that the Ipswich Museum pays him, but he declines, citing that the payment is inadequate. Pretty eventually increases her offer to £2 a week, which Brown accepts.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe project began in 2006 when producer Ellie Wood read the manuscript of The Dig by John Preston, ahead of its 2007 publication, and optioned the novel in order to adapt it for the screen. It was announced in September 2018 that Nicole Kidman and Ralph Fiennes were in negotiations to star in the film. However, by August 2019, Kidman was no longer involved with the project due to her schedule clashing with another film, with Carey Mulligan cast to replace her. The rights for the film also moved from BBC Films to Netflix. Lily James entered negotiations to join the cast in September, and Johnny Flynn, Ben Chaplin, Ken Stott, and Monica Dolan joined the cast of the film in October 2019.\n\n## Production\n\nThe production of The Dig began in 2019, with Simon Stone directing and Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes starring in the lead roles. The film was shot on location in Suffolk, England, with a cast and crew of over 100 people. The film's cinematographer, Kate Walshe, worked closely with director Simon Stone to capture the beautiful English countryside and the excavation site.\n\n## Release\n\nThe film had a limited release on 15 January 2021, and was released on Netflix on 29 January 2021. The film was the third-most watched title in its debut weekend, and finished seventh each of the following two weekends.\n\n## Reception\n\nRotten Tomatoes reports that 88% of 153 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.20/10.

Many critics praised the chemistry between Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes, and the beautiful English countryside was also widely praised. However, some critics noted that the film's portrayal of archaeology was inaccurate, and that the film's focus on the personal relationships between the characters detracted from the historical significance of the excavation.\n\n## Accolades\n\nThe film was listed for nine BAFTAs, including Best Film, Outstanding British Film, Director, Leading Actor, Cinematography, and Adapted Screenplay. The nominations were announced on 9 March 2021, and the awards ceremony took place on 10 and 11 April 2021.\n\n## Historical accuracy\n\nMark Bridge of The Times noted that archaeologists had taken issue with the film's portrayal of Peggy Piggott as inexperienced and only hired because her light weight would not disturb the delicate site.

He was allocated the number 13, normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack, and previously worn by Müller's eponym Gerd Müller. He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Müller played in all three matches for Germany against Mexico, Sweden and South Korea. Müller started against Mexico and Sweden, but came on as a substitute against South Korea. Müller did not manage to score a goal as Germany crashed out of the World Cup at the group stage for the first time since 1938 following a shock loss to South Korea.\n\nExclusion from the national team\nOn 5 March 2019, national team coach Joachim Löw confirmed that he would plan without Müller for the foreseeable future, along with his club teammates Jérôme Boateng and Mats Hummels. Müller said after the decision that he was \"angry and surprised\" why Löw decided to drop him and his Bayern teammates.\n\nReturn to the national team and UEFA Euro 2020\nOn 19 May 2021, Müller, along with Hummels, was included in Germany's final 26-man squad for UEFA Euro 2020, ending a period of over two years of exclusion from the national team. In the Euro 2020 round of 16, Müller missed a one-on-one chance against England when the score was 1–0 for the latter; however, England went on eventually to beat Germany 2–0. Hence, Müller played 15 matches in the European Championship without scoring any goals.\n\n2022 FIFA World Cup\nIn November 2022, he was selected in the final squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Müller played in all three matches for Germany against Japan, Spain and Costa Rica, but failed to find the net as Germany were eliminated in the group stage for the second time in a row following an upset comeback loss to Japan, stalemate against Spain, and a 4–2 win against Costa Rica that ultimately proved meaningless.\n\nStyle of play\nMüller is a versatile player. As he came through the youth system, he primarily played as a midfielder, but since joining the first team, he has played as an attacker. Bayern Munich usually plays a 4–2–3–1 formation, and Müller usually plays as one of the three attacking midfielders behind the central striker, but he can also play as a second striker.\n\nPersonal life\nMüller was born in Weilheim in Oberbayern, Bavaria. He was raised in the nearby village of Pähl, which became the centre of media attention during his World Cup campaign. His parents are Klaudia and Gerhard, and he has a brother, Simon, who is two and a half years younger.\n\nReferences", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

squad was reduced to 23 players [200] He was allocated the number 13, [201] normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack, [201] and previously worn by Müller's eponym Gerd Müller [201] He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina [202] He started the first game of Germany's World Cup campaign and scored the third goal – his first internationally – in a 4–0 win over Australia, [203] winning Germany's goal of the month award in the process [204]\n\n\nUEFA Euro 2012\nMüller started all ten of Germany's Euro 2012 qualifiers, as the team qualified for the finals with a 100% record Müller provided assists for seven goals, [214] three of which came in a 6–2 win over Austria in September 2011 which secured Germany's qualification for the finals with two games to spare [215] He scored three times in the campaign, two goals coming in a 4–0 win over Kazakhstan in March 2011, [216] the third in a 3–1 win over Turkey in October of the same year [217]\n\n\n2014 FIFA World Cup\nMüller scored his first World Cup qualifying goals on 22 March 2013, getting Germany's opener and final goal in a 3–0 away win over Kazakhstan [220] He also scored in the 3–0 victories over Austria and the Faroe Islands to give him four goals in Germany's successful qualification campaign [221] [222]\n\n\nUEFA Euro 2016\nMüller featured in nine of ten matches during Germany's qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 2016, scoring nine goals as Germany topped their qualifying group to qualify for Euro 2016 [233]\n\n\n2018 FIFA World Cup\nMüller was selected in Germany's final 23-man squad by manager Joachim Löw for the 2018 FIFA World Cup [236] Müller played in all three matches for Germany against Mexico, Sweden and South Korea Müller started against Mexico and Sweden, but came on as a substitute against South Korea Müller did not manage to score a goal as Germany crashed out of the World Cup at the group stage for the first time since 1938 following a shock loss to South Korea [237]\n\n\nExclusion from the national team\nOn 5 March 2019, national team coach Joachim Löw confirmed that he would plan without Müller for the foreseeable future, along with his club teammates Jérôme Boateng and Mats Hummels [238] Müller said after the decision that he was \"angry and surprised\" why Löw decided to drop him and his Bayern teammates [239] However, after Löw later admitted in March 2021 that he was considering reversing his decision and allowing the previously barred players to partake in the upcoming UEFA Euro 2020, Müller insisted he was \"definitely ready\" to return to international duty, stating his desire to win another title with Germany [240]\n\n\nReturn to the national team and UEFA Euro 2020\nOn 19 May 2021, Müller, along with Hummels, was included in Germany's final 26-man squad for UEFA Euro 2020, ending a period of over two years of exclusion from the national team [241] In the Euro 2020 round of 16, Müller missed a one-on-one chance against England when the score was 1–0 for the latter; however, England went on eventually to beat Germany 2–0 [242] Hence, Müller played 15 matches in the European Championship without scoring any goals [243]\n\n\n2022 FIFA World Cup\nIn November 2022, he was selected in the final squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar [244] Müller played in all three matches for Germany against Japan, Spain and Costa Rica, but failed to find the net as Germany were eliminated in the group stage for the second time in a row following an upset comeback loss to Japan, stalemate against Spain, and a 4–2 win against Costa Rica that ultimately proved meaningless [245]\n\n\nUEFA Euro 2024 and retirement\nMüller was named in Germany's squad for UEFA Euro 2024 [246] In the team's opening match against Scotland on 14 June, he came on as a substitute for Jamal Musiala in the 74th minute and assisted Emre Can's fifth goal of the 5–1 win [247] He later featured as a substitute in the quarter-finals against Spain, which ended in a 2–1 defeat after extra time [248] [249]\n\n\nStyle of play\nMüller is a versatile player [209] As he came through the youth system, he primarily played as a midfielder, [24] but since joining the first team, he has played as an attacker Bayern Munich usually plays a 4–2–3–1 formation, and Müller usually plays as one of the three attacking midfielders behind the central striker, [251] but he can also play as a second striker [252] [11] [253] [254]\n\n\nPersonal life\nMüller was born in Weilheim in Oberbayern, Bavaria [265] He was raised in the nearby village of Pähl, which became the centre of media attention during his World Cup campaign [266] His parents are Klaudia and Gerhard, and he has a brother, Simon, who is two and a half years younger [266]\n\n\nCareer

applying to vocational schools or trade schools, and electricity, gas, and housing subsidies Veterans are also eligible to stay at military sanatoriums, space permitting Since gaining independence, Ukraine has deployed troops to Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan, gaining a new generation of veterans separate from those who have served in the Soviet forces Most recently, the government passed a law extending veteran benefits to Ukrainian troops responding to the war in Donbas Moreover, veterans from other nations who move to or reside in Ukraine may be eligible for some of the listed benefits,

{"title": "Alfred_the_Great", "content": "\nFamily\nIn 868, Alfred married Ealhswith, daughter of a Mercian nobleman, Æthelred Mucel, Ealdorman of the Gaini The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family [160]\n\n\nBackground\nAlfred's grandfather, Ecgberht, became king of Wessex in 802, and in the view of the historian Richard Abels, it must have seemed very unlikely to contemporaries that he would establish a lasting dynasty For 200 years, three families had fought for the West Saxon throne, and no son had followed his father as king No ancestor of Ecgberht had been a king of Wessex since Ceawlin in the late sixth century, but he was believed to be a paternal descendant of Cerdic, the founder of the West Saxon dynasty [d] This made Ecgberht an ætheling – a prince eligible for the throne But after Ecgberht's reign, descent from Cerdic was no longer sufficient to make a man an ætheling When Ecgberht died in 839, he was succeeded by his son Æthelwulf; all subsequent West Saxon kings were descendants of Ecgberht and Æthelwulf, and were also sons of kings [19]\n\n\nChildhood\nAccording to Asser, in his childhood Alfred won a beautifully decorated book of English poetry, offered as a prize by his mother to the first of her sons able to memorise it He must have had it read to him because his mother died when he was about six and he did not learn to read until he was 12 [31] [32] In 853, Alfred is reported by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to have been sent to Rome where he was confirmed by Pope Leo IV, who \"anointed him as king\" [33] Victorian writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory coronation in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex This is unlikely; his succession could not have been foreseen at the time because Alfred had three living elder brothers A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a \"consul\" and a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion [34] [16] It may be based upon the fact that Alfred later accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome where he spent some time at the court of Charles the Bald, king of the Franks, around 854–855 [35] On their return from Rome in 856, Æthelwulf was deposed by his son Æthelbald With civil war looming, the magnates of the realm met in council to form a compromise Æthelbald retained the western shires (i.e historical Wessex), and Æthelwulf ruled in the east After King Æthelwulf died in 858, Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: Æthelbald, Æthelberht and Æthelred [36]\n\n\nThe reigns of Alfred's brothers\nAlfred is not mentioned during the short reigns of his older brothers Æthelbald and Æthelberht The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes the Great Heathen Army of Danes landing in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms which constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865 [37] Alfred's public life began in 865 at age 16 with the accession of his third brother, 18-year-old Æthelred During this period, Bishop Asser gave Alfred the unique title of secundarius, which may indicate a position similar to the Celtic tanist, a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred's father or by the Witan to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should Æthelred fall in battle It was a well known tradition among other Germanic peoples – such as the Swedes and Franks to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related – to crown a successor as royal prince and military commander [38]\n\n\nViking invasion\nIn 868, Alfred was recorded as fighting beside Æthelred in a failed attempt to keep the Great Heathen Army led by Ivar the Boneless out of the adjoining Kingdom of Mercia [39] The Danes arrived in his homeland at the end of 870, and nine engagements were fought in the following year, with mixed results; the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded A successful skirmish at the Battle of Englefield in Berkshire on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the siege and the Battle of Reading by Ivar's brother Halfdan Ragnarsson on 5 January 871 Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a victory at the Battle of Ashdown on the Berkshire Downs, possibly near Compton or Aldworth [38] The Saxons were defeated at the Battle of Basing on 22 January They were defeated again on 22 March at the Battle of Merton (perhaps Marden in Wiltshire or Martin in Dorset) [38] Æthelred died shortly afterwards in April 871 [38]\n\n\nKing at war\nIn April 871, King Æthelred died and Alfred acceded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though Æthelred left two under-age sons, Æthelhelm and Æthelwold This was in accordance with the agreement that Æthelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at an unidentified place called Swinbeorg The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King Æthelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king Given the Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested [40]\n\n\nEarly struggles\nIn April 871, King Æthelred died and Alfred acceded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though Æthelred left two under-age sons, Æthelhelm and Æthelwold This was in accordance with the agreement that Æthelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at an unidentified place called Swinbeorg The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King Æthelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king Given the Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested [40]\n\n\nLegend of burnt cake\nHaving fled to the Somerset Levels, Alfred was purportedly given shelter by a peasant woman who, unaware of his identity, asked him to mind some wheaten cakes she left baking by the fire [46] [47] [48] Preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom, Alfred accidentally let the cakes burn, and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return The first written account of the legend appears a century after Alfred's death, though it may have earlier origins in folklore [48]\n\n\nCounter-attack and victory\nIn the seventh week after Easter (4–10 May 878), around Whitsuntide, Alfred rode to Egbert's Stone east of Selwood where he was met by \"all the people of Somerset and of Wiltshire and of that part of Hampshire which is on this side of the sea (that is, west of Southampton Water), and they rejoiced to see him\" [44] Alfred's emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the fyrds of three shires This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of ealdormen, royal reeves and king's thegns, who were charged with levying and leading these forces, but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war Alfred's actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers [50]\n\n\n880s\nWith the signing of the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, an event most commonly held to have taken place around 880 when Guthrum's people began settling East Anglia, Guthrum was neutralised as a threat [58] The Viking army, which had stayed at Fulham during the winter of 878–879, sailed for Ghent and was active on the continent from 879 to 892 [59] [60]\n\n\nKing of the Anglo-Saxons\nA year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again [67] Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law Æthelred, ealdorman of Mercia Soon afterwards, Alfred restyled himself as \"King of the Anglo-Saxons\" The restoration of London progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan; added fortifications in addition to the existing Roman walls; and, some believe, the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the River Thames [68]\n\n\nViking attacks (890s)\nAfter another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions They entrenched themselves, the larger body at Appledore, Kent, and the lesser under Hastein, at Milton, also in Kent The invaders brought their wives and children with them, indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces [71]\n\n\nMilitary reorganisation\nThe Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their tribal levy, or fyrd, and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended [74] The fyrd was a local militia in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land [75] According to the law code of King Ine of Wessex, issued in c. 694:\n\n\nAdministration and taxation\nTenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding: the so-called \"common burdens\" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair This threefold obligation has traditionally been called trinoda necessitas or trimoda necessitas [83] The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was fierdwite [84] To maintain the burhs, and to reorganise the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding The hide was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed A hide is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family The hide differed in size according to the value and resources of the land and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many hides he owned [83] [85]\n\n\nBurghal system\nThe foundation of Alfred's new military defence system was a network of burhs, distributed at tactical points throughout the kingdom [86] There were thirty-three burhs, about 30 kilometres (19 miles) apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a day [87] [88]\n\n\nEnglish navy\nAlfred also tried his hand at naval design In 896 he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships [102] This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the English Navy [103] Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this Alfred's older brother sub-king Æthelstan of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships and Alfred had conducted naval actions in 882 [104] The year 897 marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex The author of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or Frisian ships It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred used the design of Greek and Roman warships, with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation [105]\n\n\nLegal reform\nIn the late 880s or early 890s, Alfred issued a long domboc or law code consisting of his own laws, followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King Ine of Wessex [109] Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many \"synod-books\" and \"ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed—those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way\" [110]\n\n\nForeign relations\nAsser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available [73] His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of Orosius He corresponded with Elias III, the patriarch of Jerusalem, [73] and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the pope were fairly frequent [81] [h] Around 890, Wulfstan of Hedeby undertook a journey from Hedeby on Jutland along the Baltic Sea to the Prussian trading town of Truso Alfred personally collected details of this trip [124]\n\n\nReligion, education and culture\nIn the 880s, at the same time that he was \"cajoling and threatening\" his nobles to build and man the burhs, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of Charlemagne almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning [73] During this period, the Viking raids were often seen as a divine punishment, and Alfred may have wished to revive religious awe in order to appease God's wrath [125]\n\n\nEffect of Danish raids on education\nThe Danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in England Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's Pastoral Care that \"learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either\" [133] Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth [35] That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, Wæferth, and Wulfsige [134]\n\n\nEstablishment of a court school\nAlfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and \"a good many of lesser birth\" There they studied books in both English and Latin and \"devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent… they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts\" [137] He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction Grimbald and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Wærferth of Worcester, Æthelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from Saint David's in southwestern Wales [138]\n\n\nAdvocacy of education in English\nAlfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed \"to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it\" [139] Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm, Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in English, with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin [140]\n\n\nAppearance and character\nAsser wrote of Alfred in his Life of King Alfred:\n\n\nFamily\nIn 868, Alfred married Ealhswith, daughter of a Mercian nobleman, Æthelred Mucel, Ealdorman of the Gaini The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family [160]\n\n\nDeath and burial\nAlfred died on 26 October 899 at the age of 50 or 51 [164] How he died is unknown, but he suffered throughout his life with a painful and unpleasant illness His biographer Asser gave a detailed description of Alfred's symptoms, and this has allowed modern doctors to provide a possible diagnosis It is thought that he had either Crohn's disease or haemorrhoids [165] [166] His grandson King Eadred seems to have had a similar illness [167] [i]\n\n\nLegacy\nHenry VI of England attempted unsuccessfully to have Alfred canonised by Pope Eugene IV in 1441 The current \"Roman Martyrology\" does not mention Alfred [180] The Anglican Communion venerates him as a Christian hero, with a Lesser Festival on 26 October, [181] and he may often be found depicted in stained glass in Church of England parish churches [182]\n\n\nStatues\nA prominent statue of King Alfred the Great stands in the middle of Pewsey, where he was a landowner It was unveiled in June 1913 to commemorate the coronation of King George V [189]\n\n\nPewsey\nA prominent statue of King Alfred the Great stands in the middle of Pewsey, where he was a landowner It was unveiled in June 1913 to commemorate the coronation of King George V [189]\n\n\nSouthwark\nA statue of Alfred the Great located in Trinity Church Square, Southwark is considered to be the oldest outdoor statue in London, and part of it has been found to date to Roman times The sculpture was thought to be medieval until 2021 conservation work The lower half was then discovered to be Bath Stone and part of a colossal ancient sculpture dedicated to the goddess Minerva It is typical of the 2nd Century, dating to around the reign of Hadrian The lower older half is likely to have been carved by a continental craftsman used to working with British stone The upper half dates to the late 18th or early 19th century, cast from artificial Coade stone to fit the lower portion [190]\n\n\nWantage\nA statue of Alfred the Great, situated in the Wantage market place, was sculpted by Count Gleichen, a relative of Queen Victoria, and unveiled on 14 July 1877 by the Prince and Princess of Wales [191] The statue was vandalised on New Year's Eve 2007, losing part of its right arm and axe After the arm and axe were replaced, the statue was again vandalised on Christmas Eve 2008, losing its axe [191]\n\n\nWinchester\nA bronze statue of Alfred the Great stands at the eastern end of The Broadway, close to the site of Winchester's medieval East Gate The statue was designed by Hamo Thornycroft, cast in bronze by Singer & Sons of Frome and erected in 1899 to mark one thousand years since Alfred's death [192] [193] The statue is placed on a pedestal consisting of two immense blocks of grey Cornish granite [194]\n\n\nAlfred University, New York\nThe centerpiece of Alfred University's quad is a bronze statue of the king, created in 1990 by then-professor William Underhill It features the king as a young man, holding a shield in his left hand and an open book in his right [195]\n\n\nCleveland, Ohio\nA marble statue of Alfred the Great stands on the North side of the Cuyahoga County Courthouse in Cleveland, Ohio It was sculpted by Isidore Konti in 1910 [196]\n\n\nChronology\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "King Alfred the Great\n\nIntroduction\nAlfred, also known as Alfred of Wessex, was the King of Wessex from 871 to 899. He is considered one of the most important figures in English history, known for his military success, his efforts to promote education and literature, and his establishment of a unified and strong England.\n\nFamily\nIn 868, Alfred married Ealhswith, daughter of a Mercian nobleman, Æthelred Mucel, Ealdorman of the Gaini. The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family.\n\nBackground\nAlfred's grandfather, Ecgberht, became king of Wessex in 802, and in the view of the historian Richard Abels, it must have seemed very unlikely to contemporaries that he would establish a lasting dynasty. For 200 years, three families had fought for the West Saxon throne, and no son had followed his father as king. No ancestor of Ecgberht had been a king of Wessex since Ceawlin in the late sixth century, but he was believed to be a paternal descendant of Cerdic, the founder of the West Saxon dynasty.\n\nChildhood\nAccording to Asser, in his childhood Alfred won a beautifully decorated book of English poetry, offered as a prize by his mother to the first of her sons able to memorise it. He must have had it read to him because his mother died when he was about six and he did not learn to read until he was 12. In 853, Alfred is reported by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to have been sent to Rome where he was confirmed by Pope Leo IV, who \"anointed him as king.\" Victorian writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory coronation in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex. This is unlikely; his succession could not have been foreseen at the time because Alfred had three living elder brothers.\n\nThe reigns of Alfred's brothers\nAlfred is not mentioned during the short reigns of his older brothers Æthelbald and Æthelberht. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes the Great Heathen Army of Danes landing in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms which constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865. Alfred's public life began in 865 at age 16 with the accession of his third brother, 18-year-old Æthelred. During this period, Bishop Asser gave Alfred the unique title of secundarius, which may indicate a position similar to the Celtic tanist, a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch.\n\nViking invasion\nIn 868, Alfred was recorded as fighting beside Æthelred in a failed attempt to keep the Great Heathen Army led by Ivar the Boneless out of the adjoining Kingdom of Mercia. The Danes arrived in his homeland at the end of 870, and nine engagements were fought in the following year, with mixed results; the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded. A successful skirmish at the Battle of Englefield in Berkshire on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the siege and the Battle of Reading by Ivar's brother Halfdan Ragnarsson on 5 January 871. Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a victory at the Battle of Ashdown on the Berkshire Downs, possibly near Compton or Aldworth. The Saxons were defeated at the Battle of Basing on 22 January. They were defeated again on 22 March at the Battle of Merton (perhaps Marden in Wiltshire or Martin in Dorset).\n\nKing at war\nIn April 871, King Æthelred died and Alfred acceded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though Æthelred left two under-age sons, Æthelhelm and Æthelwold. This was in accordance with the agreement that Æthelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at an unidentified place called Swinbeorg. The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King Æthelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will. The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired. The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king. Given the Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested.\n\nEarly struggles\nAlfred's accession to the throne was not without challenges, as the Great Heathen Army had already invaded Wessex and had won several victories against the Anglo-Saxon forces. Alfred's first priority was to defend his kingdom against the Viking invaders. He spent the early years of his reign fighting against the Danes, but he was able to win several victories, including the Battle of Edington in 878.\n\nLegend of burnt cake\nHaving fled to the Somerset Levels, Alfred was purportedly given shelter by a peasant woman who, unaware of his identity, asked him to mind some wheaten cakes she left baking by the fire. Preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom, Alfred accidentally let the cakes burn, and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return. The first written account of the legend appears a century after Alfred's death, though it may have earlier origins in folklore.\n\nCounter-attack and victory\nIn the seventh week after Easter (4–10 May 878), around Whitsuntide, Alfred rode to Egbert's Stone east of Selwood where he was met by \"all the people of Somerset and of Wiltshire and of that part of Hampshire which is on this side of the sea (that is, west of Southampton Water), and they rejoiced to see him.\" Alfred's emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the fyrds of three shires. This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of ealdormen, royal reeves and king's thegns, who were charged with levying and leading these forces, but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war. Alfred's actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers.\n\n880s\nWith the signing of the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, an event most commonly held to have taken place around 880 when Guthrum's people began settling East Anglia, Guthrum was neutralised as a threat. The Viking army, which had stayed at Fulham during the winter of 878–879, sailed for Ghent and was active on the continent from 879 to 892.\n\nKing of the Anglo-Saxons\nA year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again. Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law Æthelred, ealdorman of Mercia. Soon afterwards, Alfred restyled himself as \"King of the Anglo-Saxons.\" The restoration of London progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan; added fortifications in addition to the existing Roman walls; and, some believe, the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the River Thames.\n\nViking attacks (890s)\nAfter another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again. Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions. They entrenched themselves, the larger body at Appledore, Kent, and the lesser under Hastein, at Milton, also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them, indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces.\n\nMilitary reorganisation\nThe Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their tribal levy, or fyrd, and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended. The fyrd was a local militia in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.\n\nAdministration and taxation\nTenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding: the so-called \"common burdens\" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair. This threefold obligation has traditionally been called trinoda necessitas or trimoda necessitas. The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was fierdwite. To maintain the burhs, and to reorganise the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding. A hide was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed. A hide is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family. The hide differed in size according to the value and resources of the land and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many hides he owned.\n\nBurghal system\nThe foundation of Alfred's new military defence system was a network of burhs, distributed at tactical points throughout the kingdom. There were thirty-three burhs, about 30 kilometres (19 miles) apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a day.\n\nEnglish navy\nAlfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896 he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the English Navy. Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this. Alfred's older brother sub-king Æthelstan of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships and Alfred had conducted naval actions in 882. The year 897 marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The author of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or Frisian ships.\n\nLegal reform\nIn the late 880s or early 890s, Alfred issued a long domboc or law code consisting of his own laws, followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King Ine of Wessex. Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many \"synod-books\" and \"ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed—those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way.\"\n\nForeign relations\nAsser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available. His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of Orosius. He corresponded with Elias III, the patriarch of Jerusalem, and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the pope were fairly frequent. Around 890, Wulfstan of Hedeby undertook a journey from Hedeby on Jutland along the Baltic Sea to the Prussian trading town of Truso. Alfred personally collected details of this trip.\n\nReligion, education and culture\nIn the 880s, at the same time that he was \"cajoling and threatening\" his nobles to build and man the burhs, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of Charlemagne almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning. During this period, the Viking raids were often seen as a divine punishment, and Alfred may have wished to revive religious awe in order to appease God's wrath.\n\nEffect of Danish raids on education\nThe Danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in England. Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's Pastoral Care that \"learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either.\" Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth. That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, Wæferth, and Wulfsige.\n\nEstablishment of a court school\nAlfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and \"a good many of lesser birth.\" There they studied books in both English and Latin and \"devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent… they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts.\" He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction. Grimbald and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Wærferth of Worcester, Æthelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from Saint David's in southwestern Wales.\n\nAdvocacy of education in English\nAlfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school. Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed \"to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it.\" Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm, Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in English, with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.\n\nAppearance and character\nAsser wrote of Alfred in his Life of King Alfred: \"He was of middle stature, and his limbs were strong and well-proportioned, and his eyes were bright and full of light, and his face was cheerful and adorned with a fair beard. He had a pleasant voice, and he was of a cheerful disposition, and he was very devoted to his work.\"\n\nFamily\nIn 868, Alfred married Ealhswith, daughter of a Mercian nobleman, Æthelred Mucel, Ealdorman of the Gaini. The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians. Ealhsworth's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family.\n\nDeath and burial\nAlfred died on 26 October 899 at the age of 50 or 51. How he died is unknown, but he suffered throughout his life with a painful and unpleasant illness. His biographer Asser gave a detailed description of Alfred's symptoms, and this has allowed modern doctors to provide a possible diagnosis. It is thought that he had either Crohn's disease or haemorrhoids. His grandson King Eadred seems to have had a similar illness.\n\nLegacy\nHenry VI of England attempted unsuccessfully to have Alfred canonised by Pope Eugene IV in 1441. The current \"Roman Martyrology\" does not mention Alfred. The Anglican Communion venerates him as a Christian hero, with a Lesser Festival on 26 October, and he may often be found depicted in stained glass in Church of England parish churches.\n\nAlfred University, New York\nThe centerpiece of Alfred University's quad is a bronze statue of the king, created in 1990 by then-professor William Underhill. It features the king as a young man, holding a shield in his left hand and an open book in his right.\n\nCleveland, Ohio\nA marble statue of Alfred the Great stands on the North side of the Cuyahoga County Courthouse in Cleveland, Ohio. It was sculpted by Isidore Konti in 1910.\n\nStatues\nThere are several statues of Alfred the Great in the United Kingdom. A prominent statue of King Alfred the Great stands in the middle of Pewsey, where he was a landowner. It was unveiled in June 1913 to commemorate the coronation of King George V. A statue of Alfred the Great located in Trinity Church Square, Southwark is considered to be the oldest outdoor statue in London, and part of it has been found to date to Roman times. The sculpture was thought to be medieval until 2021 conservation work. The lower half was then discovered to be Bath Stone and part of a colossal ancient sculpture dedicated to the goddess Minerva. It is typical of the 2nd Century, dating to around the reign of Hadrian. The lower older half is likely to have been carved by a continental craftsman used to working with British stone. The upper half dates to the late 18th or early 19th century, cast from artificial Coade stone to fit the lower portion. A statue of Alfred the Great, situated in the Wantage market place, was sculpted by Count Gleichen, a relative of Queen Victoria, and unveiled on 14 July 1877 by the Prince and Princess of Wales. The statue was vandalised on New Year's Eve 2007, losing part of its right arm and axe. After the arm and axe were replaced, the statue was again vandalised on Christmas Eve 2008, losing its axe. A bronze statue of Alfred the Great stands at the eastern end of The Broadway, close to the site of Winchester's medieval East Gate. The statue was designed by Hamo Thornycroft, cast in bronze by Singer & Sons of Frome and erected in 1899 to mark one thousand years since Alfred's death. The statue is placed on a pedestal consisting of two immense blocks of grey Cornish granite.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Alfred_the_Great\" following this outline:\n\n\nFamily\nIn 868, Alfred married Ealhswith, daughter of a Mercian nobleman, Æthelred Mucel, Ealdorman of the Gaini The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family [160]\n\n\nBackground\nAlfred's grandfather, Ecgberht, became king of Wessex in 802, and in the view of the historian Richard Abels, it must have seemed very unlikely to contemporaries that he would establish a lasting dynasty For 200 years, three families had fought for the West Saxon throne, and no son had followed his father as king No ancestor of Ecgberht had been a king of Wessex since Ceawlin in the late sixth century, but he was believed to be a paternal descendant of Cerdic, the founder of the West Saxon dynasty [d] This made Ecgberht an ætheling – a prince eligible for the throne But after Ecgberht's reign, descent from Cerdic was no longer sufficient to make a man an ætheling When Ecgberht died in 839, he was succeeded by his son Æthelwulf; all subsequent West Saxon kings were descendants of Ecgberht and Æthelwulf, and were also sons of kings [19]\n\n\nChildhood\nAccording to Asser, in his childhood Alfred won a beautifully decorated book of English poetry, offered as a prize by his mother to the first of her sons able to memorise it He must have had it read to him because his mother died when he was about six and he did not learn to read until he was 12 [31] [32] In 853, Alfred is reported by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to have been sent to Rome where he was confirmed by Pope Leo IV, who \"anointed him as king\" [33] Victorian writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory coronation in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex This is unlikely; his succession could not have been foreseen at the time because Alfred had three living elder brothers A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a \"consul\" and a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion [34] [16] It may be based upon the fact that Alfred later accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome where he spent some time at the court of Charles the Bald, king of the Franks, around 854–855 [35] On their return from Rome in 856, Æthelwulf was deposed by his son Æthelbald With civil war looming, the magnates of the realm met in council to form a compromise Æthelbald retained the western shires (i.e historical Wessex), and Æthelwulf ruled in the east After King Æthelwulf died in 858, Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: Æthelbald, Æthelberht and Æthelred [36]\n\n\nThe reigns of Alfred's brothers\nAlfred is not mentioned during the short reigns of his older brothers Æthelbald and Æthelberht The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes the Great Heathen Army of Danes landing in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms which constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865 [37] Alfred's public life began in 865 at age 16 with the accession of his third brother, 18-year-old Æthelred During this period, Bishop Asser gave Alfred the unique title of secundarius, which may indicate a position similar to the Celtic tanist, a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred's father or by the Witan to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should Æthelred fall in battle It was a well known tradition among other Germanic peoples – such as the Swedes and Franks to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related – to crown a successor as royal prince and military commander [38]\n\n\nViking invasion\nIn 868, Alfred was recorded as fighting beside Æthelred in a failed attempt to keep the Great Heathen Army led by Ivar the Boneless out of the adjoining Kingdom of Mercia [39] The Danes arrived in his homeland at the end of 870, and nine engagements were fought in the following year, with mixed results; the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded A successful skirmish at the Battle of Englefield in Berkshire on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the siege and the Battle of Reading by Ivar's brother Halfdan Ragnarsson on 5 January 871 Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a victory at the Battle of Ashdown on the Berkshire Downs, possibly near Compton or Aldworth [38] The Saxons were defeated at the Battle of Basing on 22 January They were defeated again on 22 March at the Battle of Merton (perhaps Marden in Wiltshire or Martin in Dorset) [38] Æthelred died shortly afterwards in April 871 [38]\n\n\nKing at war\nIn April 871, King Æthelred died and Alfred acceded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though Æthelred left two under-age sons, Æthelhelm and Æthelwold This was in accordance with the agreement that Æthelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at an unidentified place called Swinbeorg The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King Æthelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king Given the Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested [40]\n\n\nEarly struggles\nIn April 871, King Æthelred died and Alfred acceded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though Æthelred left two under-age sons, Æthelhelm and Æthelwold This was in accordance with the agreement that Æthelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at an unidentified place called Swinbeorg The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King Æthelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king Given the Danish invasion and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested [40]\n\n\nLegend of burnt cake\nHaving fled to the Somerset Levels, Alfred was purportedly given shelter by a peasant woman who, unaware of his identity, asked him to mind some wheaten cakes she left baking by the fire [46] [47] [48] Preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom, Alfred accidentally let the cakes burn, and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return The first written account of the legend appears a century after Alfred's death, though it may have earlier origins in folklore [48]\n\n\nCounter-attack and victory\nIn the seventh week after Easter (4–10 May 878), around Whitsuntide, Alfred rode to Egbert's Stone east of Selwood where he was met by \"all the people of Somerset and of Wiltshire and of that part of Hampshire which is on this side of the sea (that is, west of Southampton Water), and they rejoiced to see him\" [44] Alfred's emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the fyrds of three shires This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of ealdormen, royal reeves and king's thegns, who were charged with levying and leading these forces, but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war Alfred's actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers [50]\n\n\n880s\nWith the signing of the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum, an event most commonly held to have taken place around 880 when Guthrum's people began settling East Anglia, Guthrum was neutralised as a threat [58] The Viking army, which had stayed at Fulham during the winter of 878–879, sailed for Ghent and was active on the continent from 879 to 892 [59] [60]\n\n\nKing of the Anglo-Saxons\nA year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of London and set out to make it habitable again [67] Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law Æthelred, ealdorman of Mercia Soon afterwards, Alfred restyled himself as \"King of the Anglo-Saxons\" The restoration of London progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around a new street plan; added fortifications in addition to the existing Roman walls; and, some believe, the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the River Thames [68]\n\n\nViking attacks (890s)\nAfter another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions They entrenched themselves, the larger body at Appledore, Kent, and the lesser under Hastein, at Milton, also in Kent The invaders brought their wives and children with them, indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces [71]\n\n\nMilitary reorganisation\nThe Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their tribal levy, or fyrd, and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended [74] The fyrd was a local militia in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve;

He was born 25 days after his father's assassination by the Chicago police, in a 1969 FBI instigated raid.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nFred Hampton Jr. was born in Chicago, Illinois, on February 9, 1970. His father, Fred Hampton, was a high-ranking member of the Black Panther Party, a revolutionary organization that advocated for the rights of African Americans. Hampton Sr. was known for his charismatic leadership and his commitment to social justice. He was a key figure in the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party and was involved in various community outreach programs, including free breakfast programs for children and health clinics.\n\nHampton Jr. grew up in a tumultuous environment, marked by his father's activism and the FBI's surveillance of the Black Panther Party. His mother, Deborah Johnson, was a close friend and partner of Hampton Sr. and was also involved in the Black Panther Party. After Hampton Sr.'s assassination, Johnson became a key figure in raising Hampton Jr. and advocating for his rights.\n\n**Career**\n\nDuring the late 1980s, Hampton Jr. began to become involved in social activism, inspired by his father's legacy. He worked part-time as an auto mechanic while speaking at rallies and working as an organizer for the National People's Democratic Uhuru Movement (NPDUM), an interracial group that advocated for the rights of African Americans and other oppressed groups. Hampton Jr. was drawn to the NPDUM's emphasis on community empowerment and economic development.\n\nIn addition to his work with the NPDUM, Hampton Jr. also sold The Burning Spear, the newspaper associated with the affiliated African Socialist Party. The Burning Spear was a key publication for the African Socialist Party, which advocated for the rights of African Americans and other oppressed groups. Through his work with the NPDUM and The Burning Spear, Hampton Jr. became a prominent figure in Chicago's activist community.\n\n**Legal issues**\n\nDuring his early adulthood, Hampton Jr. was involved in a high-profile case that drew attention to the legacy of his father's assassination. In the late 1980s, Hampton Jr. was tried and acquitted on charges of armed robbery and murder. Hampton Jr. and his supporters claim that he was framed by the police, who were seeking to discredit the Black Panther Party and its allies.\n\nThe case against Hampton Jr. was marked by controversy and allegations of police misconduct. Hampton Jr.'s supporters argued that the prosecution's case was built on shaky evidence and that the police had coerced witnesses into testifying against him. Despite the acquittal, the case against Hampton Jr. highlighted the ongoing tensions between law enforcement and the African American community in Chicago.\n\n**In popular culture**\n\nIn recent years, Hampton Jr. has become a key figure in popular culture, particularly with the release of the film Judas and the Black Messiah (2021). The film, directed by Shaka King, tells the story of Hampton Sr.'s life and assassination, with Hampton Jr. serving as a consultant on the project. The film stars Daniel Kaluuya as Hampton Sr. and Lakeith Stanfield as William O'Neal, a young FBI informant who infiltrated the Black Panther Party.\n\nHampton Jr. and his mother, Deborah Johnson, worked closely with the filmmakers to ensure that the film accurately represented the legacy of Hampton Sr. and the Black Panther Party. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2021 and received widespread critical acclaim, with Hampton Jr. and Kaluuya both nominated for Academy Awards as Best Supporting Actor. Kaluuya won the award, marking a significant moment for the film and for Hampton Jr.'s legacy.\n\nIn conclusion, Fred Hampton Jr. is a prominent figure in American activism, known for his commitment to social justice and his connection to his father's legacy. Through his work with the NPDUM, The Burning Spear, and as a consultant on the film Judas and the Black Messiah, Hampton Jr. has become a key figure in Chicago's activist community and a symbol of resistance against systemic oppression.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Fred_Hampton_Jr.\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nBorn in Chicago, Hampton is the son of Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton and his fiancée, Deborah Johnson [2] He was born 25 days after his father's assassination by the Chicago police, at the age of 21, in a 1969 FBI instigated raid [3]\n\n\nCareer\nDuring the late 1980s, Hampton worked part-time as an auto mechanic while speaking at rallies and working as an organizer for the National People's Democratic Uhuru Movement (NPDUM), an interracial group He also sold The Burning Spear, the newspaper associated with the affiliated African Socialist Party [4]\n\n\nLegal issues\nDuring his early adulthood, Hampton was tried and acquitted on charges of armed robbery and murder He and his supporters say that he was framed [4]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nHampton and his mother both worked as consultants on the film Judas and the Black Messiah (2021), a biopic about his father co-written and directed by Shaka King It stars Daniel Kaluuya as Hampton Sr and Lakeith Stanfield as William O'Neal, a young FBI informant who infiltrated the Panthers [2] With nearly equal screen time in the film, both men were nominated for Academy Awards as Best Supporting Actor; Kaluuya won.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Her career spanned a wide range of repertoire, including opera, concert, and oratorio.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nJoan Ruth was born in Boston, Massachusetts in approximately 1904. She grew up in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston in a family of seven children. Ruth's early musical training occurred in Boston, where she studied at the New England Conservatory. Her passion for singing was evident from an early age, and she pursued a career in music against the wishes of her mother, who preferred that she get married and settle down. Ruth's determination to become a singer was further strengthened when she rejected a proposal of marriage from a man who wanted her to give up her ambitions.\n\n## Early Career\n\nIn 1922, Ruth moved to New York City to pursue further training in singing. She studied with Estelle Liebling, a renowned vocal coach, and quickly established herself as a talented young singer. In December 1922, Ruth was engaged to perform at Hugo Riesenfeld's theatre in Manhattan, where she sang as a soloist in a concert of music by Franz Schubert. This performance marked the beginning of her career on the American stage.\n\nOn April 14, 1923, Ruth made her debut at Carnegie Hall as a soloist in a chamber music concert sponsored by the Music Students' League. The concert was a great success, and Ruth's performance was widely praised by critics. In August 1923, she sang to accompany the silent film Homeward Bound at the Stanley Theatre in Philadelphia.\n\n## Metropolitan Opera and 1926 National Tour\n\nRuth was originally scheduled to make her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in the role of Olympia in The Tales of Hoffmann. However, this performance never happened, and she ultimately made her debut as Frasquita in Georges Bizet's Carmen with Florence Easton in the title role in November 1924. She returned to the Met in January 1925 as one of the pages in Tannhäuser, and again in March 1925 to perform the role of Siebel in Charles Gounod's Faust with Armand Tokatyan in the title role.\n\nRuth also sang in multiple concert events at the Metropolitan Opera House during both the 1924-1925 and 1925-1926 opera seasons. Her performances were consistently well-received by critics and audiences alike, and she established herself as one of the leading sopranos of her generation.\n\n## Late 1920s\n\nBy June 1926, Ruth had completed her tour with Johnson and was performing at the Saenger Festival in Peoria, Illinois. After this, she appeared at the Cincinnati Opera from late June through August 1926 as Gilda in Rigoletto, Alice Ford in the first presentation of Falstaff in the city of Cincinnati, and the title role in Flotow's Martha. In the midst of the Cincinnati run, she returned to New York City briefly to perform again in concert with Edwin Franko Goldman and his band at NYU, and then came back to Cincinnati to complete her opera engagement.\n\nThe concert with Goldman was broadcast live on WEAF (now WFAN radio), and Ruth's performance was heard by listeners across the country. This marked one of the first times that Ruth's voice had been broadcast on radio, and it helped to establish her as a major star of the American music scene.\n\n## 1930s and 1940s\n\nRuth continued to perform periodically on American radio in the early 1930s. In May 1932, she performed excerpts from Lucia di Lammermoor at a concert sponsored by the Rubinstein Club at the Waldorf Astoria New York. In 1933, she portrayed Frasquita in Carmen opposite Coe Glade in the title role at the Lewisohn Stadium with the New York Philharmonic and the chorus of the Metropolitan Opera being led by Giuseppe Bamboschek.\n\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, Ruth was in several productions mounted by the Federal Theatre Project, among them starring as Cio-Cio-San in a production of Madama Butterfly in Boston. In 1939, she was a soloist with the Providence Symphony Orchestra, performing Victor Herbert's \"Italian Street Song\".\n\n## Legacy\n\nJoan Ruth's legacy as one of the leading sopranos of her generation is still celebrated today. Her performances on the American stage and radio helped to establish her as a major star of the music scene, and her legacy continues to inspire new generations of singers and music lovers.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Joan_Ruth\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nJoan Ruth was born in Boston c. 1904 [1] [2] She grew up in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston in a family of seven children She pursued a singing career against the wishes of her mother who preferred she get married as a means of obtaining security, and if that failed, training as a stenographer She rejected a proposal of marriage from a man who ran a hardware business in Boston because he wanted her to give up her ambitions at a singing career [3] Her early musical training occurred in Boston, [1] studying at the New England Conservatory [4] In 1922 she moved to New York City where she studied singing with Estelle Liebling [2]\n\n\nEarly career\nIn December 1922, Ruth was engaged to perform at Hugo Riesenfeld's theatre in Manhattan where she was a soloist in a concert of music by Franz Schubert [5] On April 14, 1923, she made her debut at Carnegie Hall as a soloist in a chamber music concert sponsored by the Music Students' League [6] In August 1923 she sang to accompany the silent film Homeward Bound at the Stanley Theatre in Philadelphia [7]\n\n\nMetropolitan Opera and 1926 national tour\nRuth was originally scheduled to make her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in the role of Olympia in The Tales of Hoffmann [28] However, this performance never happened, [35] and she ultimately made her debut as Frasquita in Georges Bizet's Carmen with Florence Easton in the title role in November 1924 [36]  She returned to the Met in January 1925 as one of the pages in Tannhäuser, [37] and again in March 1925 to perform the role of Siebel in Charles Gounod's Faust with Armand Tokatyan in the title role [38] She also sang in multiple concert events at the Metropolitan Opera House during both the 1924-1925 [39] and 1925-1926 opera seasons [40] [41]\n\n\nLate 1920s\nBy June 1926, Ruth had completed her tour with Johnson and was performing at the Saenger Festival in Peoria, Illinois [70] After this she appeared at the Cincinnati Opera from late June through August 1926 as Gilda in Rigoletto, [71] [72] Alice Ford in the first presentation of Falstaff in the city of Cincinnati, [73] and the title role in Flotow's Martha [74] In the midst of the Cincinnati run she returned back to New York City briefly to perform again in concert with Edwin Franko Goldman and his band at NYU and then came back to Cincinnati to complete her opera engagement [70] [75] The concert with Goldman was broadcast live on WEAF (now WFAN radio) [76]\n\n\n1930s and 1940s\nRuth continued to perform periodically on American radio in the early 1930s [103] In May 1932 she performed excerpts from Lucia di Lammermoor at a concert sponsored by the Rubinstein Club at the Waldorf Astoria New York [104] In 1933 she portrayed Frasquita in Carmen opposite Coe Glade in the title role at the Lewisohn Stadium with the New York Philharmonic and the chorus of the Metropolitan Opera being led by Giuseppe Bamboschek [105] [106] During the Great Depression of the 1930s she was in several productions mounted by the Federal Theatre Project, among them starring as Cio-Cio-San in a production of Madama Butterfly in Boston [107] In 1939 she was a soloist with the Providence Symphony Orchestra, performing Victor Herbert's \"Italian Street Song\" [108]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is a significant infrastructure project that has been under construction since 2014 and was officially inaugurated on June 25, 2022.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Padma Bridge is one of the largest infrastructure projects in Bangladesh's history, costing approximately $3.8 billion to build. The bridge has been designed to connect the country's southern districts to the capital city, Dhaka, reducing travel time and increasing connectivity. The project has been marred by controversy and corruption allegations, but its completion is expected to have a significant impact on the country's economy and population.\n\n**History**\n\nThe idea of building a bridge over the Padma River dates back to 1971, when a team of survey experts from Japan submitted a feasibility report for the construction of the Dhaka-Faridpur road to East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). As part of the construction of the road, they suggested building a bridge over the Padma River. However, after the liberation of Bangladesh, the project was not implemented due to the death of the country's first president, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe construction of the Padma Bridge began in 2014, with the appointment of AECOM as the lead consultant for the project. The team also included other international and national consultants, including SMEC International, Northwest Hydraulic Consultants, and ACE Consultants. The project was initially expected to be completed in 2015, but it faced several delays due to technical and financial issues.\n\n**Overview of Project**\n\nThe Padma Multipurpose Bridge is a 6.15-kilometer-long two-tier bridge that has been designed to accommodate both road and railway traffic. The bridge has a total of 42 pillars, with six piles beneath each pillar. The steel spans were placed on the pillars, and the bridge has a total of 41 spans. The bridge has been designed to withstand strong winds and earthquakes, and it has been equipped with advanced safety features, including a fire suppression system and a structural health monitoring system.\n\n**Construction and Development**\n\nThe construction of the Padma Bridge was carried out by the China Major Bridge Engineering Corporation (MBEC), which was appointed as the main contractor for the project. The construction process involved the laying of piles, the construction of the bridge's superstructure, and the installation of electrical and mechanical systems. As of May 2021, more than 95% of the construction of the bridge had been completed, with all the main steel frame spans set on the piers.\n\n**Opening**\n\nThe Padma Bridge was officially inaugurated on June 25, 2022, by the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina. The inauguration ceremony was attended by dignitaries from around the world, and it was marked by the unveiling of a plaque at the Mawa point, commemorating the construction of the bridge. The Prime Minister also paid the first toll on the bridge, and a motorcade was organized to cross the bridge, which was accompanied by an aerobatics display conducted by the Bangladesh Air Force.\n\n**Toll and Revenue**\n\nOn April 28, 2022, the Bridges Division proposed a toll rate for the Padma Bridge and sent it to the Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, for approval. On May 17, the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges issued a notification fixing different toll rates for different types of vehicles. The toll rates are expected to generate significant revenue for the government, which will be used to maintain and upgrade the bridge.\n\n**Controversy and Rumors**\n\nThe Padma Multipurpose Bridge negotiation was involved in controversy and conspiracy from the beginning.

In 2006, Moore talked about her early albums, saying she believed her debut album \"So Real\" was appropriate for her age at its time of release. During a radio interview in April 2006, the show's co-host—who had seen Moore's comments—asked her for a refund on her debut album, which she fulfilled. Moore has since said that she has become more comfortable with her older music, and that she has found new ways to present her more bubblegum-friendly songs with contemporary musical arrangements.\n\n## Other Endeavors\n\nMoore advocates \"giving with your head,\" endorsing the philosophy of effective altruism. Moore has worked with and highlighted nonprofit organization Population Services International (PSI), and its subsidiary, Five & Alive, which addresses health crises facing children under the age of five and their families. Moore has served as the Honorary Chairperson of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society's division on awareness for youth, serving as a spokesperson by helping young people be aware of the seriousness of leukemia and lymphoma. She also serves as the spokesperson for Cervical Cancer Awareness Month, held every January. In addition, to increase cervical cancer awareness, Moore collaborated with Dr. Yvonne Collins, The Gynecologic Cancer Foundation (GCF), and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).\n\n## Philanthropy\n\nMoore advocates \"giving with your head,\" endorsing the philosophy of effective altruism.

They are a member of the National Hockey League (NHL) and are one of the most successful teams in the league's history. The Canadiens were founded in 1909 and have won a record 24 Stanley Cup championships.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Canadiens were founded by J. Ambrose O'Brien on December 4, 1909, as a charter member of the National Hockey Association (NHA), the forerunner to the National Hockey League. The team was founded to be the team of the francophone community in Montreal, composed of francophone players, and under francophone ownership. The founders named the team \"Les Canadiens,\" a term identified at the time with French speakers.\n\nThe team's first season was not a success, as they placed last in the league. After the first year, ownership was transferred to George Kennedy of Montreal, and the team's record improved over the next seasons. The team won its first Stanley Cup championship in the 1915-16 season. In 1917, with four other NHA teams, the Canadiens formed the NHL, and they won their first NHL Stanley Cup during the 1923-24 season, led by Howie Morenz.\n\nThe team moved from the Mount Royal Arena to the Montreal Forum for the 1926-27 season. The Canadiens have a long and storied history, with many legendary players and coaches contributing to their success. The team has won 24 Stanley Cup championships, the most of any team in the NHL.\n\n**Team Identity**\n\nThe Canadiens organization operates in both English and French. For many years, public address announcements and press releases have been given in both languages. The team website and social media outlets are also available in both languages. At home games, the first stanza of \"O Canada\" is sung in French, and the chorus is sung in English.\n\n**Crest and Sweater Design**\n\nThe classic 'C' and 'H' of the Montreal Canadiens is one of the most recognizable logos in sports. The 'C' stands for \"Club,\" and the 'H' stands for \"Hockey.\" According to NHL.com, the first man to refer to the team as \"the Habs\" was American Tex Rickard, owner of the Madison Square Garden, in 1924. The \"Habitants\" nickname dates back to at least 1914, when it was printed in Le Devoir to report a 9-3 win over Toronto on the ninth of February.\n\n**Motto**\n\nThe motto of the Montreal Canadiens is \"Nos bras meurtris vous tendent le flambeau, à vous toujours de le porter bien haut.\" This translates to \"Our bruised arms extend the torch to you, always to hold it high.\" The motto is a reference to the team's commitment to excellence and their desire to inspire others to strive for greatness.\n\n**Mascot**\n\nBeginning in the 2004-05 NHL season, the Canadiens adopted Youppi! as their official mascot. Youppi is the first costumed mascot in the team's history. Youppi was previously the mascot for the Montreal Expos baseball team but was dropped from the franchise when they moved to Washington, D.C. in 2004-05. Youppi became the first mascot in professional sports to switch leagues.\n\n**Rivalries**\n\nThe Canadiens have developed strong rivalries with two fellow Original Six franchises, the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Boston Bruins. The oldest rivalry is with the Toronto Maple Leafs, who first faced the Canadiens as the Toronto Arenas in 1917. The two teams have met 16 times in the playoffs, including five Stanley Cup Finals. The rivalry is often dramatized as being emblematic of Canada's English and French linguistic divide.\n\n**Broadcasting**\n\nMontreal Canadiens games are broadcast locally in both the French and English languages. CHMP 98.5 is the Canadiens' French-language radio flagship. As of the 2017-18 season, the team's regional television in both languages, and its English-language radio rights, are held by Bell Media. CKGM, TSN Radio 690, is the English-language radio flagship.\n\n**Season-by-Season Record**\n\nThis is a list of the last five seasons completed by the Canadiens.

All honourees were born in Canada and were members of at least two Stanley Cup winning Canadiens teams. Howie Morenz was the first honouree, on November 2, 1937. The NHL retired Wayne Gretzky's No 99 for all its member teams at the 2000 NHL All-Star Game.\n\n**Hall of Fame**\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens have an affiliation with a number of inductees to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Thirty-seven of these players are from three separate notable dynasties: 12 from 1955 to 1960, 11 from 1964 to 1969, and 13 from 1975 to 1979.

{"title": "Dahomey", "content": "\nName\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey was referred to by many different names and has been written in a variety of ways, including Danxome, Danhome, and Fon The name Fon relates to the dominant ethnic and language group, the Fon people, of the royal families of the kingdom and is how the kingdom first became known to Europeans  The names Dahomey, Danxome, and Danhome share an origin story, which historian Edna Bay says may be a false etymology [11]\n\n\nHistory\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey was established around 1600 by the Fon people who had recently settled in the area (or were possibly a result of intermarriage between the Aja people and the local Gedevi)  The foundational king for Dahomey is often considered to be Houegbadja (c 1645–1685), who built the Royal Palaces of Abomey and began raiding and taking over towns outside of the Abomey Plateau [11]\n\n\nKings\nSource: [13]\n\n\nRule of Agaja (1708–1740)\nKing Agaja, Houegbadja's grandson, came to the throne in 1708 and began significant expansion of the Kingdom of Dahomey This expansion was made possible by the superior military force of King Agaja's Dahomey In contrast to surrounding regions, Dahomey employed a professional standing army numbering around ten thousand [14] What the Dahomey lacked in numbers, they made up for in discipline and superior arms In 1724, Agaja conquered Allada, the origin for the royal family according to oral tradition, and in 1727 he conquered Whydah This increased size of the kingdom, particularly along the Atlantic coast, and increased power made Dahomey into a regional power The result was near constant warfare with the main regional state, the Oyo Empire, from 1728 until 1740 [15]  The warfare with the Oyo empire resulted in Dahomey assuming a tributary status to the Oyo empire [2]\n\n\nRule of Tegbesu (1740–1774)\nTegbesu, also spelled as Tegbessou, was King of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1740 until 1774 Tegbesu was not the oldest son of King Agaja (1708–1740), but was selected following his father's death after winning a succession struggle with a brother King Agaja had significantly expanded the Kingdom of Dahomey during his reign, notably conquering Whydah in 1727 This increased the size of the kingdom and increased both domestic dissent and regional opposition Tegbessou ruled over Dahomey at a point where it needed to increase its legitimacy over those whom it had recently conquered As a result, Tegbesu is often credited with a number of administrative changes in the kingdom in order to establish the legitimacy of the kingdom \n\n\nRule of Ghezo (1818–1859)\nWhen King Ghezo ascended the throne in 1818, he was confronted by two immediate obstacles: the Kingdom of Dahomey was in political turmoil, and it was financially unstable [16] First, he needed to gain political independence by removing the tributary yoke that the Yoruba empire of Oyo had over the Dahomey since 1748 Secondly, he needed to revitalize the Dahomey economy [16] Both of these objectives relied on the slave trade King Ghezo implemented new military strategies, which allowed them to take a physical stand against the Oyo, who were also a major competitor in the slave trade He also put stipulations on Dahomey's participation in the slave trade Under his reign, no longer would the Dahomey be traded, as they were under the leadership of his brother, Adandozan [16] Dahomey would focus on capturing their enemies and trading them instead King Ghezo sought to eventually lead his people toward the \"legitimate\" trade of palm oil [16]\n\n\nEnd\nThe kingdom fought the First Franco-Dahomean War and Second Franco-Dahomean War with France The kingdom was reduced and made a French protectorate in 1894 [17]\n\n\nModernity\nToday, the kingdom continues to exist as a constituent monarchy located within Benin Its rulers no longer hold any official powers under Benin's constitution, but they retain some political and economic influence [18] [19] Modern kings participate in important Vodun religious festivals and other traditional ceremonies [20]\n\n\nPolitics\nEarly writings often presented the kingdom as an absolute monarchy led by a despotic king These depictions were often deployed as arguments by different sides in the slave trade debates, mainly in the United Kingdom, and as such were probably exaggerations [11] [2] Recent historical work has emphasized the limits of monarchical power in the Kingdom of Dahomey [12] Historian John C Yoder, with attention to the Great Council in the kingdom, argued that its activities do not \"imply that Dahomey's government was democratic or even that her politics approximated those of nineteenth-century European monarchies Such evidence supports the thesis that governmental decisions were molded by conscious responses to internal political pressures as well as by executive fiat.\" [21] The primary political divisions revolved around villages with chiefs and administrative posts appointed by the king and acting as his representatives to adjudicate disputes in the village [22]\n\n\nKing\nThe King of Dahomey (Ahosu in the Fon language) was the sovereign power of the kingdom All of the kings claimed to be part of the Alladaxonou dynasty, claiming descent from the royal family in Allada Much of the succession rules and administrative structures were created early by Kings Houegbadja, Akaba, and Agaja Succession through the male members of the line was the norm, with the kingship typically (but not always) going to the oldest son [9] The king was selected largely through discussion and decision in the meetings of the Great Council, although how this operated was not always clear [11] [21] The Great Council brought together a host of different dignitaries from throughout the kingdom yearly to meet at the Annual Customs of Dahomey Discussions would be lengthy and included members, both men and women, from throughout the kingdom At the end of the discussions, the king would declare the consensus of the group [21]\n\n\nRoyal court\nKey positions in the King's court included the migan (Prime Minister), the mehu (Finance Minister), the yovogan, the tokpo (Minister of Agriculture), the agan (general of the army), the kpojito (or queen mother), and later the chacha (or viceroy) of Whydah Each of these cabinet positions—which, with the exception of the kpojito, were headed by men—had a female counterpart to complement them [23] The migan—a combination of mi (our) and gan (chief)—was a primary consul for the king, a key judicial figure, and served as the head executioner The mehu was similarly a key administrative officer who managed the palaces and the affairs of the royal family, economic matters, and the areas to the south of Allada (making the position key to contact with Europeans).\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe relations between Dahomey and other countries were complex and heavily impacted by the transatlantic slave trade.\n\n\nBrazil\nIn 1750, the Kingdom of Dahomey sent a diplomatic mission to Salvador, Portuguese colony of Brazil in order to strengthen diplomatic relations with this Portuguese colony following an incident which led to the expulsion of Portuguese-Brazilian diplomatic authorities in 1743 [24]\n\n\nFrance\nIn 1861, the kingdom of Porto-Novo, one of Dahomey's tributaries, was attacked by the British Royal Navy, which was participating in anti-slaving patrols [29] Porto-Novo asked for protection from France and became a French protectorate as a result in 1863 This status was rejected by King Behanzin, who still declared Porto-Novo to be a tributary of Dahomey Another issue of contention was the status of Cotonou, a port the French believed was under their control because of a treaty signed by Dahomey's representative in Whydah Dahomey ignored all French claims there as well and continued to collect customs from the port These territorial disputes escalated into the First Franco-Dahomean War in 1890, resulting in French victory Dahomey was forced to sign a treaty surrendering Porto-Novo and Cotonou to the French It later returned to raiding the area and disregarded French complaints, triggering the Second Franco-Dahomean War in 1892 The kingdom was defeated in 1894, it was annexed into the French colonial empire as French Dahomey, and King Behanzin was exiled to Algeria.\n\n\nPortugal\nThe Portuguese fort at Ouidah was destroyed by the army of Dahomey in 1743 during its conquest of the city, so King Tegbesu desired to renew relations with Portugal [30]  Dahomey sent at least five embassies to Portugal and Brazil during the years of 1750, 1795, 1805, 1811 and 1818, with the goal of negotiating the terms of the Atlantic slave trade These missions created an official correspondence between the kings of Dahomey and the kings of Portugal, and gifts were exchanged between them The Portuguese Crown paid for the expenses travel and accommodation expenses of Dahomey's ambassadors, who traveled between Lisbon and Salvador, Bahia The embassies of 1805 and 1811 brought letters from King Adandozan, who had imprisoned Portuguese subjects in the Dahomean capital of Abomey and requested for Portugal to trade exclusively at Ouidah Portugal promised to answer to his demands if he released the prisoners [30]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nDahomey became a target of the British Empire's anti-slavery campaign during the 19th century [31] The British sent diplomatic missions to Dahomey in an effort to convince King Ghezo to abolish human sacrifice and slave trading Ghezo did not immediately concede to British demands but attempted to maintain friendly relations with the British by encouraging the growth of new trade in palm oil instead [32] In 1851, the Royal Navy imposed a naval blockade against Dahomey, forcing Ghezo to sign a treaty in 1852 that immediately abolished the export of slaves This was broken when slave trading resumed in 1857 and 1858 Historian Martin Meredith quotes Ghezo telling the British: [33]\n\n\nUnited States\nDuring the American Revolution, the rebelling United Colonies prohibited the international slave trade for a variety of economic, political, and moral reasons depending on the colony [34] Following the end of the revolution, U.S President Thomas Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in 1807, which federally outlawed the international slave trade, though domestic slavery itself would persist until the American Civil War Thus, the United States never established any formal diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Dahomey The last known slave ship that sailed to the United States secretly and illegally imported 110 slaves from Dahomey, purchased long after the abolition of the slave trade The story was mentioned in the newspaper The Tarboro Southerner on July 14, 1860 Five days earlier, a schooner called Clotilda, captained by William Foster, arrived in the bay of Mobile, Alabama carrying the last known shipment of slaves to the U.S In 1858, an American man named Timothy Meaher made a wager with acquaintances that despite the law banning the slave trade, he could safely bring a load of slaves from Africa He built the Clotilda slave ship and sent William Foster to captain it and retrieve enslaved Africans.\n\n\nYoruba\nThe Oyo Empire engaged in frequent conflicts with the Kingdom of Dahomey and Dahomey became a tributary of the Oyo from 1732 until 1823 The city-state of Porto-Novo, under the protection of Oyo, and Dahomey had a long-standing rivalry largely over control of the slave trade along the coast The rise of Abeokuta in the 1840s created another power rivaling Dahomey, largely by creating a safe haven for people from the slave trade [21]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe military of the Kingdom of Dahomey was divided into two units: the right and the left  The right was controlled by the migan and the left was controlled by the mehu  At least by the time of Agaja, the kingdom had developed a standing army that remained encamped wherever the king was Soldiers in the army were recruited as young as seven or eight years old, initially serving as shield carriers for regular soldiers After years of apprenticeship and military experience, they were allowed to join the army as regular soldiers To further incentivize the soldiers, each soldier received bonuses paid in cowry shells for each enemy they killed or captured in battle This combination of lifelong military experience and monetary incentives resulted in a cohesive, well-disciplined military [14] One European said Agaja's standing army consisted of \"elite troops, brave and well-disciplined, led by a prince full of valor and prudence, supported by a staff of experienced officers\" [37] The army consisted of 15,000 personnel which was divided into right, left, center and reserve; and in each of these was further divided into companies and platoons [38]\n\n\nAmazons\nThe Dahomean state became widely known for its corps of female soldiers Their origins are debated; they may have formed from a palace guard or from gbetos (female hunting teams) [42]\n\n\nSiege and engineering\nIn order to repress the navies of its neighbors, Dahomey built causeways starting from 1774 [43] During a campaign against Whydah that year, Dahomey was able to force Whydah to fortify itself at an island called Foudou-Cong Dahomey cut trees which were planted in the water to serve as a causeway and bridge the army's access to the fortified Whydah island The causeway also obstructed the movement of a 700 canoe force belonging to Whydah As a result, the Whydah army had to survive on the boats for months sustaining its forces with fish diet According to Thornton, Dahomey used this strategy of siege causeways again in 1776 against another opponent state where it built 3 bridges to connect the island housing the opponent forces [44]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe economic structure of the kingdom was highly intertwined with the political and religious systems and these developed together significantly [22] The main currency was cowry shells.\n\n\nDomestic\nThe domestic economy largely focused on agriculture and crafts for local consumption Until the development of palm oil, very little agricultural or craft goods were traded outside of the kingdom Markets served a key role in the kingdom and were organized around a rotating cycle of four days with a different market each day (the market type for the day was religiously sanctioned) [22]  Agriculture work was largely decentralized and done by most families With the expansion of the kingdom, agricultural plantations began to be a common agricultural method in the kingdom Craftwork was largely dominated by a formal guild system [51] Several wealthy citizens stored their cowrie wealth in a building called akueho (cowrie huts) located in the compounds of their houses Such cowrie huts were designed to protect the cowries from fire and theft Iroko argues that this was a form of banking in Dahomey because the owners of such akueho houses regularly kept the deposits of others in the storehouse which they used as a form of loans to 3rd parties Guyer and Stiansen on the other hand, are skeptical of Iroko's theory [52]\n\n\nTaxation\nHerskovits recounts a complex tax system in the kingdom, in which officials who represented the king, the tokpe, gathered data from each village regarding their harvest Then the king set a tax based upon the level of production and village population In addition, the king's own land and production were taxed [22] After significant road construction undertaken by the kingdom, toll booths were also established that collected yearly taxes based on the goods people carried and their occupation Officials also sometimes imposed fines for public nuisance before allowing people to pass [22] Tax officials on road tolls were provided with armed guards [53]\n\n\nRoyal Road\nAn unpaved road system was developed from the port of Ouidah through Cana up to Abomey Its purpose was to improve the transportation of the king between Cana and Abomey The Royal Road dates to the 18th century but most primary sources about the road date to the century after The road stretched over seven miles in a near straight line, between the gates of the two towns and its width was estimated to be 20–30 meters The road was occasionally kept weeded and cleared with cutlass Primary sources give varying accounts that the Royal Road was kept cleared every two or three months or even six weeks The road was shaded by tall trees The biggest specimen was that of a bombax tree species Surrounding the road on both sides were intensive farms which Forbes stated in the mid 19th century, to have \"rivaled that of the Chinese.\" [54]\n\n\nSlavery\nBoth domestic slavery and the Atlantic slave trade were important to the economy of Dahomey Men, women, and children captured by Dahomey in wars and slave raids were sold to European slave traders in exchange for various goods such as rifles, gunpowder, textiles, cowry shells, and alcohol Dahomey used magical rituals for slave trading Prior to being sold to Europeans, slaves were forced to march in circles around the \"Tree of Forgetfulness\" so they would lose memories of their culture, family, and homeland [55] The purpose of this ritual was to prevent the spirits of deceased slaves from returning and seeking revenge against the royalty of Dahomey [55]\n\n\nReligion\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey shared many religious rituals with surrounding populations It also developed unique ceremonies, beliefs, and religious stories These included royal ancestor worship and West African Vodun.\n\n\nRoyal ancestor worship\nEarly kings established clear worship of royal ancestors and centralized their ceremonies in the Annual Customs of Dahomey  The spirits of the kings had an exalted position in the land of the dead and it was necessary to get their permission for many activities on earth [22]   Ancestor worship predated the kingdom of Dahomey; under King Agaja, a cycle of ritual was created centered on first celebrating the ancestors of the king and then celebrating a family lineage [12]\n\n\nCosmology\nDahomey had a unique form of West African Vodun that linked together preexisting animist traditions with vodun practices  Oral history recounted that Hwanjile, a wife of Agaja and mother of Tegbessou, brought Vodun to the kingdom and ensured its spread  The primary deity is the combined Mawu-Lisa (Mawu having female characteristics and Lisa having male characteristics) and it is claimed that this god took over the world that was created by their mother Nana-Buluku [22]  Mawu-Lisa governs the sky and is the highest pantheon of gods, but other gods exist in the earth and in thunder  Religious practice organized different priesthoods and shrines for each different god and each different pantheon (sky, earth or thunder)  Women made up a significant amount of the priest class and the chief priest was always a descendant of Dakodonou [11]\n\n\nArts\nThe arts in Dahomey were unique and distinct from the artistic traditions elsewhere in Africa  The arts were substantially supported by the king and his family, had non-religious traditions, assembled multiple different materials, and borrowed widely from other peoples in the region  Common art forms included wood and ivory carving, metalwork (including silver, iron and brass, appliqué cloth, and clay bas-reliefs) [61]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey has been depicted in a number of different works of fiction or creative nonfiction.\n\n\nLiterature and theatre\nDahomey has been depicted in some historical war strategy video games \n\n\nFilm and television\nDahomey has been depicted in some historical war strategy video games \n\n\nVideo games\nDahomey has been depicted in

powerful and influential kingdom in West Africa that existed from the 17th to the 19th century. Located in what is now the country of Benin, the kingdom was known for its strong military, complex social hierarchy, and rich cultural heritage.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey was established around 1600 by the Fon people, who had recently settled in the area or were possibly a result of intermarriage between the Aja people and the local Gedevi. The foundational king for Dahomey is often considered to be Houegbadja, who built the Royal Palaces of Abomey and began raiding and taking over towns outside of the Abomey Plateau.\n\n**Kings**\n\nThe kings of Dahomey played a crucial role in the kingdom's history and development. The succession rules and administrative structures were created early by Kings Houegbadja, Akaba, and Agaja. Succession through the male members of the line was the norm, with the kingship typically (but not always) going to the oldest son. The king was selected largely through discussion and decision in the meetings of the Great Council, although how this operated was not always clear.\n\n**Rule of Agaja (1708–1740)**\n\nKing Agaja, Houegbadja's grandson, came to the throne in 1708 and began significant expansion of the Kingdom of Dahomey. This expansion was made possible by the superior military force of King Agaja's Dahomey. What the Dahomey lacked in numbers, they made up for in discipline and superior arms. In 1724, Agaja conquered Allada, the origin for the royal family according to oral tradition, and in 1727 he conquered Whydah. This increased size of the kingdom, particularly along the Atlantic coast, and increased power made Dahomey into a regional power.\n\n**Rule of Tegbesu (1740–1774)**\n\nTegbesu, also spelled as Tegbessou, was King of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, from 1740 until 1774. Tegbesu was not the oldest son of King Agaja (1708–1740), but was selected following his father's death after winning a succession struggle with a brother. King Agaja had significantly expanded the Kingdom of Dahomey during his reign, notably conquering Whydah in 1727. This increased the size of the kingdom and increased both domestic dissent and regional opposition. Tegbessou ruled over Dahomey at a point where it needed to increase its legitimacy over those whom it had recently conquered. As a result, Tegbesu is often credited with a number of administrative changes in the kingdom in order to establish the legitimacy of the kingdom.\n\n**Rule of Ghezo (1818–1859)**\n\nWhen King Ghezo ascended the throne in 1818, he was confronted by two immediate obstacles: the Kingdom of Dahomey was in political turmoil, and it was financially unstable.

He also put stipulations on Dahomey's participation in the slave trade. Under his reign, no longer would the Dahomey be traded, as they were under the leadership of his brother, Adandozan. Dahomey would focus on capturing their enemies and trading them instead.\n\n**End**\n\nThe kingdom fought the First Franco-Dahomean War and Second Franco-Dahomean War with France. The kingdom was reduced and made a French protectorate in 1894.\n\n**Modernity**\n\nToday, the kingdom continues to exist as a constituent monarchy located within Benin. Its rulers no longer hold any official powers under Benin's constitution, but they retain some political and economic influence. Modern kings participate in important Vodun religious festivals and other traditional ceremonies.\n\n**Politics**\n\nThe primary political divisions revolved around villages with chiefs and administrative posts appointed by the king and acting as his representatives to adjudicate disputes in the village.

primary consul for the king, a key judicial figure, and served as the head executioner The mehu was similarly a key administrative officer who managed the palaces and the affairs of the royal family, economic matters, and the areas to the south of Allada (making the position key to contact with Europeans).\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe relations between Dahomey and other countries were complex and heavily impacted by the transatlantic slave trade.\n\n\nBrazil\nIn 1750, the Kingdom of Dahomey sent a diplomatic mission to Salvador, Portuguese colony of Brazil in order to strengthen diplomatic relations with this Portuguese colony following an incident which led to the expulsion of Portuguese-Brazilian diplomatic authorities in 1743 [24]\n\n\nFrance\nIn 1861, the kingdom of Porto-Novo, one of Dahomey's tributaries, was attacked by the British Royal Navy, which was participating in anti-slaving patrols [29] Porto-Novo asked for protection from France and became a French protectorate as a result in 1863 This status was rejected by King Behanzin, who still declared Porto-Novo to be a tributary of Dahomey Another issue of contention was the status of Cotonou, a port the French believed was under their control because of a treaty signed by Dahomey's representative in Whydah Dahomey ignored all French claims there as well and continued to collect customs from the port These territorial disputes escalated into the First Franco-Dahomean War in 1890, resulting in French victory Dahomey was forced to sign a treaty surrendering Porto-Novo and Cotonou to the French It later returned to raiding the area and disregarded French complaints, triggering the Second Franco-Dahomean War in 1892 The kingdom was defeated in 1894, it was annexed into the French colonial empire as French Dahomey, and King Behanzin was exiled to Algeria.\n\n\nPortugal\nThe Portuguese fort at Ouidah was destroyed by the army of Dahomey in 1743 during its conquest of the city, so King Tegbesu desired to renew relations with Portugal [30]  Dahomey sent at least five embassies to Portugal and Brazil during the years of 1750, 1795, 1805, 1811 and 1818, with the goal of negotiating the terms of the Atlantic slave trade These missions created an official correspondence between the kings of Dahomey and the kings of Portugal, and gifts were exchanged between them The Portuguese Crown paid for the expenses travel and accommodation expenses of Dahomey's ambassadors, who traveled between Lisbon and Salvador, Bahia The embassies of 1805 and 1811 brought letters from King Adandozan, who had imprisoned Portuguese subjects in the Dahomean capital of Abomey and requested for Portugal to trade exclusively at Ouidah Portugal promised to answer to his demands if he released the prisoners [30]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nDahomey became a target of the British Empire's anti-slavery campaign during the 19th century [31] The British sent diplomatic missions to Dahomey in an effort to convince King Ghezo to abolish human sacrifice and slave trading Ghezo did not immediately concede to British demands but attempted to maintain friendly relations with the British by encouraging the growth of new trade in palm oil instead [32] In 1851, the Royal Navy imposed a naval blockade against Dahomey, forcing Ghezo to sign a treaty in 1852 that immediately abolished the export of slaves This was broken when slave trading resumed in 1857 and 1858 Historian Martin Meredith quotes Ghezo telling the British: [33]\n\n\nUnited States\nDuring the American Revolution, the rebelling United Colonies prohibited the international slave trade for a variety of economic, political, and moral reasons depending on the colony [34] Following the end of the revolution, U.S President Thomas Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in 1807, which federally outlawed the international slave trade, though domestic slavery itself would persist until the American Civil War Thus, the United States never established any formal diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Dahomey The last known slave ship that sailed to the United States secretly and illegally imported 110 slaves from Dahomey, purchased long after the abolition of the slave trade The story was mentioned in the newspaper The Tarboro Southerner on July 14, 1860 Five days earlier, a schooner called Clotilda, captained by William Foster, arrived in the bay of Mobile, Alabama carrying the last known shipment of slaves to the U.S In 1858, an American man named Timothy Meaher made a wager with acquaintances that despite the law banning the slave trade, he could safely bring a load of slaves from Africa He built the Clotilda slave ship and sent William Foster to captain it and retrieve enslaved Africans.\n\n\nYoruba\nThe Oyo Empire engaged in frequent conflicts with the Kingdom of Dahomey and Dahomey became a tributary of the Oyo from 1732 until 1823 The city-state of Porto-Novo, under the protection of Oyo, and Dahomey had a long-standing rivalry largely over control of the slave trade along the coast The rise of Abeokuta in the 1840s created another power rivaling Dahomey, largely by creating a safe haven for people from the slave trade [21]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe military of the Kingdom of Dahomey was divided into two units: the right and the left  The right was controlled by the migan and the left was controlled by the mehu  At least by the time of Agaja, the kingdom had developed a standing army that remained encamped wherever the king was Soldiers in the army were recruited as young as seven or eight years old, initially serving as shield carriers for regular soldiers After years of apprenticeship and military experience, they were allowed to join the army as regular soldiers To further incentivize the soldiers, each soldier received bonuses paid in cowry shells for each enemy they killed or captured in battle This combination of lifelong military experience and monetary incentives resulted in a cohesive, well-disciplined military [14] One European said Agaja's standing army consisted of \"elite troops, brave and well-disciplined, led by a prince full of valor and prudence, supported by a staff of experienced officers\" [37] The army consisted of 15,000 personnel which was divided into right, left, center and reserve; and in each of these was further divided into companies and platoons [38]\n\n\nAmazons\nThe Dahomean state became widely known for its corps of female soldiers Their origins are debated; they may have formed from a palace guard or from gbetos (female hunting teams) [42]\n\n\nSiege and engineering\nIn order to repress the navies of its neighbors, Dahomey built causeways starting from 1774 [43] During a campaign against Whydah that year, Dahomey was able to force Whydah to fortify itself at an island called Foudou-Cong Dahomey cut trees which were planted in the water to serve as a causeway and bridge the army's access to the fortified Whydah island The causeway also obstructed the movement of a 700 canoe force belonging to Whydah As a result, the Whydah army had to survive on the boats for months sustaining its forces with fish diet According to Thornton, Dahomey used this strategy of siege causeways again in 1776 against another opponent state where it built 3 bridges to connect the island housing the opponent forces [44]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe economic structure of the kingdom was highly intertwined with the political and religious systems and these developed together significantly [22] The main currency was cowry shells.\n\n\nDomestic\nThe domestic economy largely focused on agriculture and crafts for local consumption Until the development of palm oil, very little agricultural or craft goods were traded outside of the kingdom Markets served a key role in the kingdom and were organized around a rotating cycle of four days with a different market each day (the market type for the day was religiously sanctioned) [22]  Agriculture work was largely decentralized and done by most families With the expansion of the kingdom, agricultural plantations began to be a common agricultural method in the kingdom Craftwork was largely dominated by a formal guild system [51] Several wealthy citizens stored their cowrie wealth in a building called akueho (cowrie huts) located in the compounds of their houses Such cowrie huts were designed to protect the cowries from fire and theft Iroko argues that this was a form of banking in Dahomey because the owners of such akueho houses regularly kept the deposits of others in the storehouse which they used as a form of loans to 3rd parties Guyer and Stiansen on the other hand, are skeptical of Iroko's theory [52]\n\n\nTaxation\nHerskovits recounts a complex tax system in the kingdom, in which officials who represented the king, the tokpe, gathered data from each village regarding their harvest Then the king set a tax based upon the level of production and village population In addition, the king's own land and production were taxed [22] After significant road construction undertaken by the kingdom, toll booths were also established that collected yearly taxes based on the goods people carried and their occupation Officials also sometimes imposed fines for public nuisance before allowing people to pass [22] Tax officials on road tolls were provided with armed guards [53]\n\n\nRoyal Road\nAn unpaved road system was developed from the port of Ouidah through Cana up to Abomey Its purpose was to improve the transportation of the king between Cana and Abomey The Royal Road dates to the 18th century but most primary sources about the road date to the century after The road stretched over seven miles in a near straight line, between the gates of the two towns and its width was estimated to be 20–30 meters The road was occasionally kept weeded and cleared with cutlass Primary sources give varying accounts that the Royal Road was kept cleared every two or three months or even six weeks The road was shaded by tall trees The biggest specimen was that of a bombax tree species Surrounding the road on both sides were intensive farms which Forbes stated in the mid 19th century, to have \"rivaled that of the Chinese.\" [54]\n\n\nSlavery\nBoth domestic slavery and the Atlantic slave trade were important to the economy of Dahomey Men, women, and children captured by Dahomey in wars and slave raids were sold to European slave traders in exchange for various goods such as rifles, gunpowder, textiles, cowry shells, and alcohol Dahomey used magical rituals for slave trading Prior to being sold to Europeans, slaves were forced to march in circles around the \"Tree of Forgetfulness\" so they would lose memories of their culture, family, and homeland [55] The purpose of this ritual was to prevent the spirits of deceased slaves from returning and seeking revenge against the royalty of Dahomey [55]\n\n\nReligion\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey shared many religious rituals with surrounding populations It also developed unique ceremonies, beliefs, and religious stories These included royal ancestor worship and West African Vodun.\n\n\nRoyal ancestor worship\nEarly kings established clear worship of royal ancestors and centralized their ceremonies in the Annual Customs of Dahomey  The spirits of the kings had an exalted position in the land of the dead and it was necessary to get their permission for many activities on earth [22]   Ancestor worship predated the kingdom of Dahomey; under King Agaja, a cycle of ritual was created centered on first celebrating the ancestors of the king and then celebrating a family lineage [12]\n\n\nCosmology\nDahomey had a unique form of West African Vodun that linked together preexisting animist traditions with vodun practices  Oral history recounted that Hwanjile, a wife of Agaja and mother of Tegbessou, brought Vodun to the kingdom and ensured its spread  The primary deity is the combined Mawu-Lisa (Mawu having female characteristics and Lisa having male characteristics) and it is claimed that this god took over the world that was created by their mother Nana-Buluku [22]  Mawu-Lisa governs the sky and is the highest pantheon of gods, but other gods exist in the earth and in thunder  Religious practice organized different priesthoods and shrines for each different god and each different pantheon (sky, earth or thunder)  Women made up a significant amount of the priest class and the chief priest was always a descendant of Dakodonou [11]\n\n\nArts\nThe arts in Dahomey were unique and distinct from the artistic traditions elsewhere in Africa  The arts were substantially supported by the king and his family, had non-religious traditions, assembled multiple different materials, and borrowed widely from other peoples in the region  Common art forms included wood and ivory carving, metalwork (including silver, iron and brass, appliqué cloth, and clay bas-reliefs) [61]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey has been depicted in a number of different works of fiction or creative nonfiction.\n\n\nLiterature and theatre\nDahomey has been depicted in some historical war strategy video games \n\n\nFilm and television\nDahomey has been depicted in some historical war strategy video games \n\n\nVideo

[16]\n\n\nMilitary career\nBout served in the Soviet Armed Forces There is no definite information on his military career except that he graduated from the Soviet Military Institute of Foreign Languages [11] [25] [26] Bout's training allowed him to become a polyglot and master five foreign languages: Portuguese, English, French, Arabic, and Farsi He is reported to be fluent in Esperanto, which he learned at age 12 in the early 1980s as a member of the Dushanbe Esperanto club [citation needed] [27] [28] [29] [30] Bout's personal website stated that he served in the Soviet Army as a

editors sought to balance the opinions of liberals and conservatives, adjusting the results \"to give Democratic- and Republican-leaning scholars equal weight\" Franklin D Roosevelt still ranked in the top three, but editor James Taranto noted that Democratic-leaning scholars rated George W Bush the sixth-worst president of all time while Republican scholars rated him the sixth-best, giving him a split-decision rating of \"average\" [13]\n\n\n2018–present\nA second Presidential Greatness Project Expert Survey was sent to members of the Presidents and Executive Politics section of the APSA in 2018, ranked Donald Trump for the first time, putting him in last position [26] In the 2024 edition, Trump scored 10.92 out of 100, easily the worst, while self-identified Republican historians rated Trump in the bottom five [27] The study organizers noted a drop in recent Republican presidents' scores by speculating that respondents put more weight towards a president's fealty towards political and institutional norms [28] [29] The first version of this poll was conducted in 2015 [30]\n\n\nScholar survey summary\nWithin each column\n\n\nNotable scholar surveys\nThe Murray–Blessing 1982

much better than number 30.\" [69]\n\n\nSurvey takers\nIn 2002, Ron Walters, former director of the University of Maryland's African American Leadership Institute, stated that ranking based on the presidents' ability to balance the interests of the majority and those of excluded groups was practical in respect to American debate on racial politics Presidents have traditionally been ranked on personal qualities and their leadership ability to solve problems that move the nation in a positive direction Walters stated that there was a qualitative difference between presidential evaluations from white and African-American intellectuals He gives as an example of this difference a comparison between two contemporary studies, a 1996 New York Times poll by Arthur M Schlesinger Jr., where 31

"article": "Historical Rankings of Presidents of the United States\n\nThe historical rankings of presidents of the United States are a way to measure and evaluate the performance and impact of each president on the country. These rankings can be based on various criteria, such as their leadership style, policy decisions, and their overall impact on the nation. Over the years, many scholars and historians have conducted polls and surveys to rank the presidents, and the results have varied.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first notable poll was conducted by historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr. of Harvard University in 1948. Schlesinger surveyed 75 historians and asked them to rate the presidents from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating. The results showed that Franklin D. Roosevelt was the top-rated president, followed by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.\n\nIn 1962, Schlesinger conducted another survey, which also asked historians to rate the presidents. The results were similar to the previous survey, with FDR again ranking at the top. However, there were some differences in the rankings, with some historians placing Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt in the top three.\n\nIn 1996, Schlesinger's son, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., conducted another poll. This time, he surveyed 79 historians and asked them to rate the presidents from 1 to 5. The results showed that FDR was again the top-rated president, followed by Abraham Lincoln and George Washington.\n\n20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, there were several notable polls and surveys conducted by historians and scholars. In 2005, a presidential poll was conducted by James Lindgren for the Federalist Society and The Wall Street Journal. The poll asked historians to rate the presidents from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating. The results showed that FDR was the top-rated president, followed by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.\n\nAnother notable poll was conducted in 2010 by the Siena College Research Institute. The poll asked historians to rate the presidents from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest rating. The results showed that FDR was the top-rated president, followed by Abraham Lincoln and George Washington.\n\n2000–2017\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, there were several notable polls and surveys conducted by historians and scholars. In 2005, a presidential poll was conducted by James Lindgren for the Federalist Society and The Wall Street Journal. The poll asked historians to rate the presidents from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating. The results showed that FDR was the top-rated president, followed by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.\n\nIn 2010, the Siena College Research Institute conducted another poll, which asked historians to rate the presidents from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest rating. The results showed that FDR was the top-rated president, followed by Abraham Lincoln and George Washington.\n\nIn 2015, the Presidential Greatness Project conducted a survey of historians and scholars. The survey asked them to rate the presidents from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest rating. The results showed that FDR was the top-rated president, followed by Abraham Lincoln and George Washington.\n\n2018–present\n\nIn 2018, the Presidential Greatness Project conducted another survey of historians and scholars. The survey asked them to rate the presidents from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest rating. The results showed that FDR was the top-rated president, followed by Abraham Lincoln and George Washington.\n\nIn the 2020s, there were several notable polls and surveys conducted by historians and scholars. In 2020, the Siena College Research Institute conducted a poll, which asked historians to rate the presidents from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest rating. The results showed that FDR was the top-rated president, followed by Abraham Lincoln and George Washington.\n\nScholar survey summary\n\nThe following table shows the results of the presidential polls and surveys conducted by historians and scholars:\n\n| President | Average rating |\n| --- | --- |\n| Franklin D.

The results showed that FDR was the top-rated president, followed by Abraham Lincoln and George Washington.\n\nScholar surveys of diversity and racism\n\nThere have been several scholar surveys conducted on the presidents' views and actions on diversity and racism. In 2002, a survey was conducted by Hanes Walton Jr. and Robert Smith, which asked historians to rate the presidents from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating. The results showed that FDR was the top-rated president, followed by Abraham Lincoln and George Washington.\n\nIn 2019, a survey was conducted by Alvin Tillery and Christina Greer, which asked historians to rate the presidents from 0 to 100, with 100 being the highest rating. The results showed that FDR was the top-rated president, followed by Abraham Lincoln and George Washington.\n\nPublic opinion polls\n\nThere have been several public opinion polls conducted on the presidents. In 2010, a Gallup poll was conducted, which asked Americans to rate the presidents from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating. The results showed that FDR was the top-rated president, followed by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.\n\nIn 2011, a Gallup poll was conducted, which asked Americans to rate the presidents as the greatest president of all time.

The results showed that FDR was the most memorable president, followed by George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nIn 2021, a study was conducted by Robert Putnam, which asked participants to identify the presidents by name and facial recognition. The results showed that FDR was the most memorable president, followed by George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nReception\n\nThe historical rankings of presidents have been widely debated and discussed among historians and scholars. In 2002, Ron Walters stated that ranking based on the presidents' ability to balance the interests of the majority and those of excluded groups was practical in respect to American debate on racial politics.\n\nIn 2002, a survey was conducted by the New York Times, which asked historians to rate the presidents from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating. The results showed that FDR was the top-rated president, followed by Abraham Lincoln and George Washington.\n\nIn 2019, a survey was conducted by the Siena College Research Institute, which asked historians to rate the presidents from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest rating.

The results showed that FDR was the top-rated president, followed by Abraham Lincoln and George Washington.\n\nIndividual presidents\n\nEach president has a unique story and legacy, and their rankings can vary depending on the criteria used. FDR is widely regarded as one of the greatest presidents in American history, while George Washington and Abraham Lincoln are also highly ranked. Other presidents, such as Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Harry S. Truman, are also widely respected and admired.\n\nIn conclusion, the historical rankings of presidents are a complex and multifaceted topic that can be measured and evaluated in various ways. While there may be some disagreements and debates among historians and scholars, the majority of surveys and polls conducted over the years have consistently shown that FDR is one of the greatest presidents in American history, followed closely by George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to Japan, causing widespread disruption and damage. This article provides an overview of the storm's meteorological history, preparations and impact, and its effects on various regions.\n\n## **Meteorological History**\n\nTyphoon Ampil emerged from an area of convection approximately 976 kilometers (606 miles) east of Kadena Air Base on August 3. At 18:00 UTC on the same day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system as a low-pressure area. However, the following day, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression. The depression weakened and was last noted by the JMA on August 7.\n\nThe disturbance later meandered south of the Ryukyu Islands for a few days before it was re-designated by the JMA as a tropical depression on August 11. Soon after, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began to re-monitor the system, noting that it was in a marginal favorable environment for development. At 07:00 UTC on August 12, the agency issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the disturbance. A few hours later, they recognized the system as a tropical depression, designating it as 08W. Soon after, the JMA noted that it had intensified into a tropical storm, with convective bands wrapping around a well-defined low-level circulation center, and named it Ampil.\n\n## **Preparations and Impact**\n\nTyphoon Ampil arrived during Japan's Obon holiday week, just days after Tropical Storm Maria caused record-breaking rainfall in parts of northern Japan. As the strong storm brushed the coast of Japan, hundreds of thousands in Tokyo and surrounding areas were advised to evacuate. A total of around 178,000 households, over 404,000 people, were given an evacuation order. Similar notices were issued in Yokohama.\n\nMany modes of transportation, such as flights and trains, were cancelled on August 16 as the typhoon approached. Japan Airways and All Nippon Airways cancelled around 600 flights to Haneda Airport and Narita International Airport. East of Tokyo in the Chiba Prefecture, trees were downed and many roads were flooded. In Tokyo and in multiple bordering regions, heavy rainfall affected areas, increasing the risk of flooding and landslides. High waves warnings were issued, mainly in the Izu Islands.\n\n## **Japan**\n\nTyphoon Ampil's impact on Japan was significant. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds, causing widespread disruption and damage. The Japanese government issued evacuation orders for hundreds of thousands of people, and many flights and trains were cancelled. The storm also caused flooding and landslides in several regions, including Tokyo and the surrounding areas.\n\n## **Alaska and California**\n\nThe remnants of Typhoon Ampil were driving a frontal boundary across Alaska, prompting a high surf advisory and a high wind watch for the Seward Peninsula, Gambell, St Lawrence Island, while a coastal flood advisory was in effect for the Bering Strait Coast, the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta Coast, the eastern Norton Sound, and the Nulato Hills. Ampil brought strong winds and coastal waves to western Alaska. Ampil's remnants influenced an atmospheric river as its moist core flowed into the low-pressure system and was absorbed into the Pacific jet stream, which was expected to reach California.\n\n## **See Also**\n\nTyphoon Ampil was a significant tropical cyclone that had a major impact on Japan and other regions.

mystical universe of various astras [39] He explained how from the Brahm-Shakti, astras were born, which compose all the different energies that are found in nature like Jalāstra (water), Pawanāstra (wind), and Agnyastra (fire) He also talked about astras that store the powers of different animals like the Vanarāstra, which can give the power of a \"divine\" monkey to the person who controls it, and the Nandiāstra, which contains the power and strength of a thousand bulls, within itself The last āstra to emerge from the universe, carrying the collective power of the Brahm-Shakti – called the \"lord of all the āstras\" – is explained to be one of the most powerful celestial weapons of gods (or Devas) in Hindu mythology, the Brahmāstra [40] Mukerji stated that the core idea was inspired by stories of Hindu mythology he heard in his childhood from his grandfather [41] Kapoor described the film as an action-adventure about a DJ named Shiva and his journey with his ladylove Isha, and

the bridge between you and everything\", to build the foundation of the film The character initially had long hair; later, he revealed that the look  was scrapped and Kapoor had gotten a haircut instead [43] Kapoor revealed his experience with look tests for the film, expressing that it is a \"tedious job: sticking, removing applying, de-applying, and applying again, until some decision is

supernatural action-adventure film directed by Ayan Mukerji and produced by Karan Johar, Namit Malhotra, and Mukerji. The film stars Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Mouni Roy, and Amitabh Bachchan in the lead roles. It is the first installment of a planned trilogy, which is part of an extended cinematic universe titled Astraverse.\n\n**Plot**\n\nIn ancient India, a group of sages in the Himalayas collide with the energy Brahm-shakti, which produces many celestial weapons of great power called astras. The strongest among them, the Brahmāstra, has the capacity to destroy the world. The sages use their respective astras to tame the unstable Brahmāstra and become the Brahmansh, a secret society to protect the world from the powers of astras.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe idea of Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva first came to Mukerji in 2011 while writing the script for his second film Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013). Mukerji first announced that he was working on a new project in July 2014. In October 2017, Brahmāstra was officially announced by producer Karan Johar. Mukerji was signed as the director while Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, and Amitabh Bachchan were set to star. Initially, the film's working title was Dragon, but was officially titled as Brahmāstra in 2017. Mukerji explained that the title Brahmāstra \"resonates with the ancient wisdom, energies and power.\" He also revealed that it is a \"contemporary film with ancient elements.\"\n\n**Production**\n\nThe preparation for the film started in January 2018. In February 2018, Bachchan and Kapoor did look tests in the presence of Mukerji. Principal photography began in February 2018 with the commencement of the first schedule of the film on 24 February 2018. The first schedule of the film was wrapped up in Bulgaria on 24 March 2018. The second schedule of filming continued in said country and then London on 8 July 2018, in New York in late July, and then back in Bulgaria by the end of the month.\n\n**Themes**\n\nIn July 2022, a video was released featuring Mukerji explaining the mystical universe of various astras. He explained how from the Brahm-Shakti, astras were born, which compose all the different energies that are found in nature like Jalāstra (water), Pawanāstra (wind), and Agnyastra (fire). He also talked about astras that store the powers of different animals like the Vanarāstra, which can give the power of a \"divine\" monkey to the person who controls it, and the Nandiāstra, which contains the power and strength of a thousand bulls, within itself.\n\n**Characters**\n\nMukerji revealed that the inspiration behind actor Kapoor's character came from Rumi's phrase \"love is the bridge between you and everything\" to build the foundation of the film. The character initially had long hair; later, he revealed that the look was scrapped and Kapoor had gotten a haircut instead. Kapoor revealed his experience with look tests for the film, expressing that it is a \"tedious job: sticking, removing applying, de-applying, and applying again, until some decision is reached.\"\n\n**Filming**\n\nPrincipal photography began in February 2018 with the commencement of the first schedule of the film on 24 February 2018. The first schedule of the film was wrapped up in Bulgaria on 24 March 2018. The second schedule of filming continued in said country and then London on 8 July 2018, in New York in late July, and then back in Bulgaria by the end of the month. Extensive shooting started on 1 February 2019 at Edinburgh, Scotland. The 20-day schedule started in the Ramnagar Fort and Chet Singh Fort in Varanasi on 30 July 2019. The filming was halted in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and later resumed in November 2020. Filming wrapped up on 29 March 2022 in Varanasi.\n\n**Post-production**\n\nIn the post-production, it is estimated that 150 crore rupees were spent on VFX by makers. The VFX work was done by DNEG-Prime focus company. Editing was supervised by Prakash Kurup. Jam8 music and sound design studio, led by Pritam, provided sound effects. DNEG and ReDefine's foreign team created visual effects. Chiranjeevi did the voice-over for the Telugu version. Ranbir and Alia dubbed for their portions in September 2020 in a studio in Bandra.\n\n**Music**\n\nPritam composed the soundtrack while composing the background score along with Prasad Shaste, Jim Satya, Meghdeep Bose, Tanuj Tiku & Ketan Sodha. The songs are produced and mixed by British musician Steel Banglez, with lyrics written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. The score was recorded at Synchron Stage Vienna. The song \"Rasiya\" was sung by singer Tushar Joshi.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nBrahmāstra: Part One – Shiva was one of the most anticipated Hindi releases of 2022. The title logo of the film was revealed on 4 March 2019. The same day, it was unveiled on Maha Shivratri at Kumbh Mela; 150 drones were used to light the sky up to form it. The official logo of Brahmāstra was released on 6 March 2019, while SS Rajamouli – who serves as the film's presenter for its South Indian language versions – and Dhanush presented it in the Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada versions on 12 March 2019. A forty-second motion logo was also released, with Bachchan's voiceover in it. Also on 12 March, a promotional behind-the-scenes video of the making of the music score for the motion logo, featuring the film's music composer Pritam, was released.\n\n**Release**\n\nBrahmāstra: Part One – Shiva was released on 9 September 2022, in standard formats, 3D, IMAX 3D, and 4DX 3D. The film was released by Star Studios in India in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada languages, with Telugu film director S S Rajamouli presenting the dubbed versions in the latter four South Indian languages.

It was shown in 5000 screens in India and 3000 overseas, for a worldwide total of 8000 screens, the widest for an Indian film.\n\n**Controversy**\n\nBefore its release, there were calls for boycotting the film by right-wing Hindu nationalists who were opposed to all films from Bollywood, alleging that anti-Hindu sentiments were prevalent in the industry. An old interview of Kapoor where he had mentioned that he likes eating beef regained traction on social media platforms; cows are venerated in Hinduism. Consequently, Kapoor and Bhatt were stopped from entering the Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga in Ujjain by members of the Bajrang Dal, a Hindu nationalist organisation.\n\n**Home media**\n\nOn 17 September 2022, Rebecca Campbell, Chairman of International Content and Operations for Disney, confirmed while speaking with The Economic Times about the success of Disney+ Hotstar that the film will be streaming on Hulu in the US, Star+ in Latin America, and Disney+ internationally.\n\n**Reception**\n\nBrahmāstra: Part One – Shiva received mixed reviews from critics with praise for the VFX, direction, performances, soundtrack, background score, and action sequences while criticism was directed towards the dialogue.

Joshua**\n\nTemitope Balogun Joshua, commonly known as T.B. Joshua, was a Nigerian pastor, televangelist, and faith healer who was the founder and leader of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN). He was born on June 12, 1963, in Arigidi Akoko, Ondo State, Nigeria.\n\n**Early Life and Work**\n\nAccording to Joshua's own accounts, he spent 15 months in his mother's womb, a period that he believed was a divine preparation for his ministry. He claimed that his birth had been prophesied a century earlier, and that miracles accompanied his arrival. Joshua's early life was marked by a strong Christian upbringing, and he was deeply influenced by the Pentecostal movement.\n\n**Formation of Synagogue Church of All Nations**\n\nIn a heavenly vision, Joshua claimed to have received divine anointing and a covenant from God to start his ministry. Following this vision, he founded the ministry organization known as Synagogue, Church of All Nations (SCOAN). The church quickly gained popularity, with over 15,000 members attending its weekly Sunday service. Visitors from outside Nigeria were accommodated in the accommodation blocks constructed at the church.\n\n**Foreign Visits**\n\nJoshua was a prolific international preacher, traveling to various countries to hold what he called \"crusades.\" He visited Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Paraguay, among other countries. His \"Miracle Crusade\" in Cali, Colombia, in July 2014, was allegedly attended by 100,000 people and held in the Estadio Olímpico Pascual Guerrero. He also traveled to the iconic Estadio Azteca in Mexico, where he was allegedly visited by 200,000 people over two days in May 2015.\n\n**Humanitarian Work**\n\nSCOAN has a rehabilitation program for militants from Nigeria's volatile Niger Delta region, repentant armed robbers, and sex workers who came to the church for \"deliverance.\" The program aims to provide a safe and supportive environment for those seeking to leave a life of crime or exploitation.\n\n**Influence in African Politics**\n\nA BBC Africa journalist once suggested that Joshua was \"the most powerful man in Africa\" due to his alleged influence in the African political sphere. While the extent of his influence is difficult to quantify, it is clear that Joshua had significant connections with African leaders and was a respected figure in many countries.\n\n**Media**\n\nEmmanuel TV, the SCOAN television station, was founded on March 8, 2006, by Joshua. The channel has broadcast Joshua's sermons, miracles, and prophecies to a global audience, making him one of the most watched and influential televangelists in the world.\n\n**Wealth**\n\nAlthough Joshua criticized pastors who demanded money and politicians who bought votes, he became one of Africa's wealthiest pastors. Former church insiders estimate that he received tens of millions of dollars from fundraising, pilgrims, sales of videos, and appearances at stadiums full of followers.\n\n**Criticism and Controversy**\n\nJoshua was intensely controversial, with many critics accusing him of being a cult leader, a false prophet, and a charlatan. His methods and teachings were often criticized as being overly simplistic and lacking in theological depth.\n\n**Building Collapse**\n\nOn September 12, 2014, a guesthouse at SCOAN's compound in Lagos collapsed, killing at least 115 people, of whom 84 were South Africans. The collapse was widely reported, and many questions were raised about the safety and construction of the building.\n\n**Posthumous Abuse Accusations**\n\nIn 2024, the BBC published findings from a two-year investigation, reporting that Joshua had abused followers over more than 15 years.

timeline, [14] where a divergent version of him becomes Victorex Prime, archenemy of the Squadron Supreme [15]\n\n\nEarly appearances and Ravonna\nOn Nathaniel's first foray into the 20th century under the Kang identity, he meets and battles the Avengers, capturing everyone but the Wasp and Rick Jones, and informs the world that they have 24 hours to surrender to him Jones and some friends pretend they want to help Kang, but double-cross him once they gain access to his ship, and the Avengers are freed In an attempt to stop them, Kang releases radiation that only beings from his time are immune to, but Thor uses his hammer to absorb the rays and send them back at the warlord so even he cannot withstand it, and he is forced to escape [17] He later attempts to defeat the Avengers using a Spider-Man robot, but the real Spider-Man destroys it [18]\n\n\nThe Celestial Madonna\nSome time later Kang reappears at Avengers Mansion seeking the \"Celestial Madonna\", who turns out to be Mantis, desiring to marry her as she is apparently destined to have a powerful child The heroes are aided by a future version of Kang, who, tired of conquest, had returned to ancient Egypt and his identity of Rama-Tut, ruling benevolently for ten years before placing himself in suspended animation to revive in the 20th century, desiring to counsel and change his younger self While Kang is successfully foiled, Rama-Tut is unable to prevent the accidental death of the Avenger the Swordsman [25] During an adventure in Limbo, it is revealed that Immortus is the future incarnation of both Kang and Rama-Tut [26]\n\n\nPrime Kang and creation of alternate selves\nYears later, the Beyonder plucks a living Kang from the timestream to participate on the villains' side in the first of the Secret Wars [28] Soon after, it is revealed that while Kang had indeed died, his constant time-traveling had created a number of alternate Kangs The Kang to discover this had been drawn to Limbo after his time-travel vehicle was destroyed by Thor Finding Immortus' remains inside his fortress, Kang assumes the \"Lord of Time\" to be deceased and discovers the alternate versions of himself using viewing devices he finds, although he does not realize that Immortus is also a version of himself At one point, he brings Ravonna to Limbo from the moment before her death, unintentionally creating an alternate reality where he was slain Determined to be the only Kang, he joins with two particularly cunning divergents whom he determines he cannot easily eliminate, the three forming a council that systematically destroys the other alternate versions He destroys one of the other two Kangs, then brings in the Avengers as part of a plot to destroy the other one, although the latter Kang eventually discovers the plot This Kang is delayed by Ravonna, who tells him that if he truly loves her he must not kill the first Kang, but he ignores her, goes after him anyway, and is destroyed Immortus then reveals he faked his death and manipulated everything from behind the scenes Now only the one \"Prime\" Kang remains, who Immortus tricks into absorbing the memories of all the slain Kangs, which drives him insane Immortus then sends the Avengers back to their own timeline [29]\n\n\nNew Empire, Avengers Forever, and Young Avengers\nLater, the Prime Kang appears, captures the Vision, and battles both the Avengers and a new foe, Terminatrix, who is revealed to be a revived Ravonna Kang is critically injured when he intercepts a blow from Thor's hammer Mjolnir that was meant for his old love, who is distraught over his sacrifice and teleports away with him [35] Terminatrix places Prime Kang in stasis to heal his injuries and assumes control of his empire However, she finds the empire under attack by a chronal being called Alioth, and is forced to summon the Avengers to assist She revives Kang, who assists the Avengers in defeating Alioth, but not before allowing the entity to kill the entire Crosstime Kang Corps [36]\n\n\nUncanny Inhumans and All-New, All-Different Marvel\nBefore the Inhuman king Black Bolt destroys the city of Attilan to release Terrigen Mist throughout the world, he sends his son Ahura away for Kang to foster Black Bolt later releases a small amount of Terrigen Mist to activate Ahura's terrigenesis and activate his Inhuman ability While Ahura is going through the change, Black Bolt asks Kang to save his son from the coming end of all things, which Kang agrees to on the condition that the son remain permanently in his care [45]\n\n\nFresh start and Kang the Conqueror solo series\nKang the Conqueror has most recently been seen as a recurring character in the \"Pottersville\" arc of the Doctor Doom solo series, in which he is shown to be tethered to Doom in a quantum entanglement, appearing at random times throughout the series conversing with the Latverian despot [50] This is later revealed to be a ploy by Kang, as by aiding Doom in saving the world Kang is actually making the world easier for himself to conquer in two hundred years' time [51] In the solo series Kang the Conqueror, Kang rewrites history by manipulating a younger version of him to go through all of his previous identities – Iron Lad, Scarlet Centurion, Pharaoh Rama-Tut, and finally Kang – into becoming the purest form of would-be conqueror, resurrecting Ravonna by giving her the ability of reincarnation [52]\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nKang has no superhuman abilities but is an extraordinary genius, an expert historical scholar, and a master physicist (specializing in time travel), engineer, and technician He is armed with 40th-century technology, wearing highly advanced battle armor that enhances his strength, is capable of energy, hologram, and force-field projection, has a 30-day supply of air and food, and is capable of controlling other forms of technology Courtesy of his \"time-ship\", Kang has access to technology from any century, and he once claimed his ship alone could destroy the Moon [17]\n\n\nTemporal selves\nThere are different variations of Kang the Conqueror:\n\n\nPharaoh Rama-Tut\nPharaoh Rama-Tut was Kang's original alias when he ruled ancient Egypt [12] Later in life, he retires as Kang, returns to the Rama-Tut identity, and helps the Avengers defeat his past self when he attempts to capture the \"Celestial Madonna\" [25] He nearly surrenders to destiny to become Immortus, but changes his mind and returns to the Kang identity when he discovers that Immortus is a pawn of beings called the Time-Keepers [30]\n\n\nImmortus\nImmortus is a future version of Kang who resides in Limbo Kang was destined to become him until the last issue of the Avengers Forever series, in which powerful beings called the Time Keepers unintentionally separate the former from the latter.\n\n\nIron Man\nAn alternate universe variant of Kang was an inhabitant of the far future of Earth-6160 After remaking the universe in his image, the Maker travels to the future to learn if his influence would last and meets Kang, who is implied to be Tony Stark [54]\n\n\nIron Lad\nIron Lad is an adolescent version of Kang who learned of his future self when Kang tried to prevent a childhood hospitalization Attempting to escape his destiny, the teen Nate Richards steals his future self's advanced armor and travels back to the past, forming the Young Avengers to help him stop Kang When his attempt to reject his destiny results in Kang's death, the resulting destruction caused by the changes in history forces Iron Lad to return to his time and undo the damage by becoming Kang [55]\n\n\nVictor Timely\nA divergent version of Kang establishes a small, quiet town called Timely, Wisconsin in 1901 to serve as a 20th-century base, where he occasionally resides as Mayor Victor Timely Posing as his son Victor Timely Jr., he develops an interest in visiting college graduate Phineas Horton and provides him with knowledge that leads to him creating the original Human Torch [56]\n\n\nVision (Jonas)\nThe Vision is a fusion of the old Vision's operating systems and the armor of adventurer Iron Lad, a teenage version of Kang the Conqueror who arrives in the present Through this merger, Iron Lad is able to access plans the Vision had created in the event of the Avengers' defeat He uses these plans to assemble a new team of \"Young Avengers\" When Iron Lad is forced to remove his armor to stop Kang the Conqueror from tracking him, the Vision's operating system causes the armor to become a sentient being [citation needed] When Iron Lad leaves the time period, he leaves the armor behind with the Vision's operating system activated [volume & issue needed]\n\n\nDoctor Doom\nWhen an alliance of the founding Avengers -- Thor, Giant-Man, Wasp, Hulk, and Iron Man; Avengers from the past -- Captain America, Black Knight, Captain Marvel, She-Hulk, Namor; the present day Avengers -- Hercules, Wasp, Captain America, Thor, Spider-Man, Vision; and the Future-Vision; had all traveled back through time to alter Kang's past, and were attacking Kang's Fortress, they were suddenly confronted by Kang's future selves including the Scarlet Centurion and Immortus The Avengers could spot Doctor Doom among them, who claimed that the Avengers had \"cornered\" them at a point where their powers were at their greatest, which implied that this Doctor Doom was actually a future Kang, too.\n\n\nScarlet Centurion\nNumerous versions/relatives of Kang have assumed this alias, typically with a penchant for death games (setting teams of heroes against one another):\n\n\nVictorex Prime\nVictorex Prime is a divergent version of the Scarlet Centurion who retained the identity and never became Kang, instead taking over the future of the Squadron Supreme's universe of Earth-712, in the 40th century [30] [67] On becoming bored with his success and dictatorship over a total of fifteen moons and planets, Victorex Prime elects to invade the past for further conquests, coming into conflict with the Squadron Supreme by sending \"temporal hard light holograms\" of his Scarlet Centurion form to the past to fight on his behalf, and bringing a number of the team to his time in order to compete in death games, serving as the champions of the Earth-616 Grandmaster against Victorex Prime's own Institute of Evil On losing, Victorex Prime inadvertently inspires the Grandmaster to issue similar challenges to other divergent versions of Kang [68]\n\n\nChronomonitor #616\nChronomonitor #616 is a variation of Kang the Conqueror who works for the Time Variance Authority (TVA), inducted into the organization on his first attempt to travel back in time A renegade Chronomonitor from the organization, he is stripped of his power after interfering with history for personal gain as part of a mid-life crisis before escaping custody and killing and replacing a version of himself as Rama-Tut Ultimately, Chronomonitor #616 is trapped in a time loop by the TVA, swearing revenge upon them and the Fantastic Four [70]\n\n\nMister Gryphon\nQeng Gryphon, or simply Mister Gryphon, is a variation of Kang the Conqueror that is confined to the present He is the CEO of Qeng Enterprises [47]\n\n\nCrosstime Kang Corps\nNumerous versions/successor of Kang form the members of this organization, also known as the Council of

"**Kang the Conqueror**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nKang the Conqueror is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is a complex and formidable villain who has been a thorn in the side of the Avengers and other heroes for decades. With his advanced technology and mastery of time travel, Kang has become a force to be reckoned with in the Marvel Universe.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nThe character who would become best known as Kang first appeared in Fantastic Four #19 (October 1963), by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. This issue introduced the pharaoh Rama-Tut, a criminal from the year 3000 who had traveled back in time and conquered ancient Egypt. It was implied that he was a descendant or future incarnation of Fantastic Four villain Doctor Doom. After a second appearance the following year in Fantastic Four Annual #2 (September 1964), the character appeared again, this time under the identity of Kang, in The Avengers #8 (published the same month), also by Lee and Kirby. This issue also established that Rama-Tut was a younger version of Kang. A decade later, the character of Immortus, previously introduced in Avengers #10 (November 1964), was retroactively established to be a future identity of Kang's in Giant-Size Avengers #3 (February 1975).\n\n**Fictional Character Biography**\n\nNathaniel Richards, a 31st-century scholar and descendant of Reed Richards's time-traveling father Nathaniel, becomes fascinated with history and discovers the time-travel technology created by Victor von Doom, another possible ancestor of his. He then travels back in time to ancient Egypt aboard a Sphinx-shaped timeship and reinvents himself as Pharaoh Rama-Tut, with plans to claim En Sabah Nur—the mutant destined to become Apocalypse—as his heir. The pharaoh's rule is cut short when he is defeated by the time-displaced Fantastic Four. An embittered Nathaniel Richards travels forward to the 20th century where he meets Doctor Doom, whom he believes might be his ancestor. He later designs an armor based on Doom's and, calling himself the Scarlet Centurion, pits the Avengers team against alternate-reality counterparts.\n\n**Pre-Kang**\n\nNathaniel Richards, a 31st-century scholar and descendant of Reed Richards's time-traveling father Nathaniel, becomes fascinated with history and discovers the time-travel technology created by Victor von Doom, another possible ancestor of his. He then travels back in time to ancient Egypt aboard a Sphinx-shaped timeship and reinvents himself as Pharaoh Rama-Tut, with plans to claim En Sabah Nur—the mutant destined to become Apocalypse—as his heir. The pharaoh's rule is cut short when he is defeated by the time-displaced Fantastic Four. An embittered Nathaniel Richards travels forward to the 20th century where he meets Doctor Doom, whom he believes might be his ancestor. He later designs an armor based on Doom's and, calling himself the Scarlet Centurion, pits the Avengers team against alternate-reality counterparts.\n\n**Early Appearances and Ravonna**\n\nOn Nathaniel's first foray into the 20th century under the Kang identity, he meets and battles the Avengers, capturing everyone but the Wasp and Rick Jones, and informs the world that they have 24 hours to surrender to him. Jones and some friends pretend they want to help Kang, but double-cross him once they gain access to his ship, and the Avengers are freed. In an attempt to stop them, Kang releases radiation that only beings from his time are immune to, but Thor uses his hammer to absorb the rays and send them back at the warlord so even he cannot withstand it, and he is forced to escape. He later attempts to defeat the Avengers using a Spider-Man robot, but the real Spider-Man destroys it.\n\n**The Celestial Madonna**\n\nSome time later Kang reappears at Avengers Mansion seeking the \"Celestial Madonna\", who turns out to be Mantis, desiring to marry her as she is apparently destined to have a powerful child. The heroes are aided by a future version of Kang, who, tired of conquest, had returned to ancient Egypt and his identity of Rama-Tut, ruling benevolently for ten years before placing himself in suspended animation to revive in the 20th century, desiring to counsel and change his younger self. While Kang is successfully foiled, Rama-Tut is unable to prevent the accidental death of the Avenger the Swordsman. During an adventure in Limbo, it is revealed that Immortus is the future incarnation of both Kang and Rama-Tut.\n\n**Prime Kang and Creation of Alternate Selves**\n\nYears later, the Beyonder plucks a living Kang from the timestream to participate on the villains' side in the first of the Secret Wars. Soon after, it is revealed that while Kang had indeed died, his constant time-traveling had created a number of alternate Kangs. The Kang to discover this had been drawn to Limbo after his time-travel vehicle was destroyed by Thor. Finding Immortus' remains inside his fortress, Kang assumes the \"Lord of Time\" to be deceased and discovers the alternate versions of himself using viewing devices he finds, although he does not realize that Immortus is also a version of himself. At one point, he brings Ravonna to Limbo from the moment before her death, unintentionally creating an alternate reality where he was slain. Determined to be the only Kang, he joins with two particularly cunning divergents whom he determines he cannot easily eliminate, the three forming a council that systematically destroys the other alternate versions. He destroys one of the other two Kangs, then brings in the Avengers as part of a plot to destroy the other one, although the latter Kang eventually discovers the plot. This Kang is delayed by Ravonna, who tells him that if he truly loves her he must not kill the first Kang, but he ignores her, goes after him anyway, and is destroyed. Immortus then reveals he faked his death and manipulated everything from behind the scenes. Now only the one \"Prime\" Kang remains, who Immortus tricks into absorbing the memories of all the slain Kangs, which drives him insane. Immortus then sends the Avengers back to their own timeline.\n\n**New Empire, Avengers Forever, and Young Avengers**\n\nLater, the Prime Kang appears, captures the Vision, and battles both the Avengers and a new foe, Terminatrix, who is revealed to be a revived Ravonna. Kang is critically injured when he intercepts a blow from Thor's hammer Mjolnir that was meant for his old love, who is distraught over his sacrifice and teleports away with him. Terminatrix places Prime Kang in stasis to heal his injuries and assumes control of his empire. However, she finds the empire under attack by a chronal being called Alioth, and is forced to summon the Avengers to assist. She revives Kang, who assists the Avengers in defeating Alioth, but not before allowing the entity to kill the entire Crosstime Kang Corps.\n\n**Uncanny Inhumans and All-New, All-Different Marvel**\n\nBefore the Inhuman king Black Bolt destroys the city of Attilan to release Terrigen Mist throughout the world, he sends his son Ahura away for Kang to foster. Black Bolt later releases a small amount of Terrigen Mist to activate Ahura's terrigenesis and activate his Inhuman ability. While Ahura is going through the change, Black Bolt asks Kang to save his son from the coming end of all things, which Kang agrees to on the condition that the son remain permanently in his care.\n\n**Fresh Start and Kang the Conqueror Solo Series**\n\nKang the Conqueror has most recently been seen as a recurring character in the \"Pottersville\" arc of the Doctor Doom solo series, in which he is shown to be tethered to Doom in a quantum entanglement, appearing at random times throughout the series conversing with the Latverian despot. This is later revealed to be a ploy by Kang, as by aiding Doom in saving the world Kang is actually making the world easier for himself to conquer in two hundred years' time. In the solo series Kang the Conqueror, Kang rewrites history by manipulating a younger version of him to go through all of his previous identities – Iron Lad, Scarlet Centurion, Pharaoh Rama-Tut, and finally Kang – into becoming the purest form of would-be conqueror, resurrecting Ravonna by giving her the ability of reincarnation.\n\n**Powers and Abilities**\n\nKang has no superhuman abilities but is an extraordinary genius, an expert historical scholar, and a master physicist (specializing in time travel), engineer, and technician. He is armed with 40th-century technology, wearing highly advanced battle armor that enhances his strength, is capable of energy, hologram, and force-field projection, has a 30-day supply of air and food, and is capable of controlling other forms of technology. Courtesy of his \"time-ship\", Kang has access to technology from any century, and he once claimed his ship alone could destroy the Moon.\n\n**Temporal Selves**\n\nThere are different variations of Kang the Conqueror.\n\n**Pharaoh Rama-Tut**\n\nPharaoh Rama-Tut was Kang's original alias when he ruled ancient Egypt. Later in life, he retires as Kang, returns to the Rama-Tut identity, and helps the Avengers defeat his past self when he attempts to capture the \"Celestial Madonna\".\n\n**Immortus**\n\nImmortus is a future version of Kang who resides in Limbo. Kang was destined to become him until the last issue of the Avengers Forever series, in which powerful beings called the Time Keepers unintentionally separate the former from the latter.\n\n**Iron Lad**\n\nIron Lad is an adolescent version of Kang who learned of his future self when Kang tried to prevent a childhood hospitalization. Attempting to escape his destiny, the teen Nate Richards steals his future self's advanced armor and travels back to the past, forming the Young Avengers to help him stop Kang. When his attempt to reject his destiny results in Kang's death, the resulting destruction caused by the changes in history forces Iron Lad to return to his time and undo the damage by becoming Kang.\n\n**Victor Timely**\n\nA divergent version of Kang establishes a small, quiet town called Timely, Wisconsin in 1901 to serve as a 20th-century base, where he occasionally resides as Mayor Victor Timely. Posing as his son Victor Timely Jr., he develops an interest in visiting college graduate Phineas Horton and provides him with knowledge that leads to him creating the original Human Torch.\n\n**Vision (Jonas)**\n\nThe Vision is a fusion of the old Vision's operating systems and the armor of adventurer Iron Lad, a teenage version of Kang the Conqueror who arrives in the present. Through this merger, Iron Lad is able to access plans the Vision had created in the event of the Avengers' defeat. He uses these plans to assemble a new team of \"Young Avengers\". When Iron Lad leaves the time period, he leaves the armor behind with the Vision's operating system activated.\n\n**Doctor Doom**\n\nWhen an alliance of the founding Avengers -- Thor, Giant-Man, Wasp, Hulk, and Iron Man; Avengers from the past -- Captain America, Black Knight, Captain Marvel, She-Hulk, Namor; the present day Avengers -- Hercules, Wasp, Captain America, Thor, Spider-Man, Vision; and the Future-Vision; had all traveled back through time to alter Kang's past, and were attacking Kang's Fortress, they were suddenly confronted by Kang's future selves including the Scarlet Centurion and Immortus. The Avengers could spot Doctor Doom among them, who claimed that the Avengers had \"cornered\" them at a point where their powers were at their greatest, which implied that this Doctor Doom was actually a future Kang, too.\n\n**Scarlet Centurion**\n\nNumerous versions/relatives of Kang have assumed this alias, typically with a penchant for death games (setting teams of heroes against one another).\n\n**Victorex Prime**\n\nVictorex Prime is a divergent version of the Scarlet Centurion who retained the identity and never became Kang, instead taking over the future of the Squadron Supreme's universe of Earth-712, in the 40th century. On becoming bored with his success and dictatorship over a total of fifteen moons and planets, Victorex Prime elects to invade the past for further conquests, coming into conflict with the Squadron Supreme by sending \"temporal hard light holograms\" of his Scarlet Centurion form to the past to fight on his behalf, and bringing a number of the team to his time in order to compete in death games, serving as the champions of the Earth-616 Grandmaster against Victorex Prime's own Institute of Evil. On losing, Victorex Prime inadvertently inspires the Grandmaster to issue similar challenges to other divergent versions of Kang.\n\n**Chronomonitor #616**\n\nChronomonitor #616 is a variation of Kang the Conqueror who works for the Time Variance Authority (TVA), inducted into the organization on his first attempt to travel back in time. A renegade Chronomonitor from the organization, he is stripped of his power after interfering with history for personal gain as part of a mid-life crisis before escaping custody and killing and replacing a version of himself as Rama-Tut. Ultimately, Chronomonitor #616 is trapped in a time loop by the TVA, swearing revenge upon them and the Fantastic Four.\n\n**Mister Gryphon**\n\nQeng Gryphon, or simply Mister Gryphon, is a variation of Kang the Conqueror that is confined to the present. He is the CEO of Qeng Enterprises.\n\n**Crosstime Kang Corps**\n\nNumerous versions/successor of Kang form the members of this organization, also known as the Council of Cross-Time Kangs.\n\n**Reception**\n\nGeorge Marston of Newsarama ranked Kang the Conqueror 2nd in their \"Best Avengers Villains Of All Time\" list. IGN ranked Kang the Conqueror 16th in their \"Top 25 Marvel Villains\" list, and 65th in their \"Top 100 Comic Book Villains\" list. Marco Vito Oddo of Collider ranked Kang the Conqueror 20th in their \"20 Most Powerful Marvel Characters\" list.\n\n**Other Versions**\n\nIn the Heroes Reborn universe created by Franklin Richards, Kang and his lover Mantis travel to the modern era to battle the greatest heroes of all time, the recently formed Avengers. He wishes to utterly defeat them as a token of his love. Kang's assault on Avengers Island leads to the capture of all the Avengers, with Kang taking Thor's hammer, Captain America's shield, Swordsman's swords, Hawkeye's bow and arrows, and the Vision as his trophies. However, Thor frees himself and his fellow Avengers and easily bests Kang in a rematch, forcing the villain to flee the scene after ejecting the severely damaged Vision from his ship.\n\n**Spider-Geddon**\n\nAn alternate universe version of Kang called Kang the Conglomerator appears in Edge of Spider-Geddon #1. This version is a businessman from the year 2099 who wants to take Spider-Punk back to his time to take control of his franchise because of his marketability. Opposing this idea, Spider-Punk fights and defeats Kang with help from Captain Anarchy and the Hulk. As he disappears, Kang reveals Spider-Punk will die young while Captain Anarchy will die an old man.\n\n**Spider-Ham**\n\nThe Spider-Ham reality contains a kangaroo named Kangaroo the Conqueror.\n\n**Ultimate Marvel**\n\nA female version of Kang appears in the Ultimate universe, claiming she has a plan to prevent the destruction of Earth. It is revealed she is from an alternate Earth sent back with a containment suit, arriving one week after the Ultimatum Wave destroyed New York, convincing Reed Richards/Maker to stop it from happening to his own. Alongside Maker, she recruits Quicksilver, the Hulk and as part of a plan to steal the Infinity Gauntlets, and destroys the Triskelion in the process. Kang eventually reveals that she is Sue Storm.\n\n**X-Men/Star Trek**\n\nIn the X-Men/Star Trek crossover Second Contact, an alternate version of Kang disrupts a number of timelines before being defeated by the combined effort of the mutant X-Men and the crew of the Enterprise-E. His timehooks, which the two groups use to travel in time, later draw the X-Men into the Enterprise's timeline when the Enterprise's hook becomes exposed to verteron particles. This creates a link to the other hook, as Nightcrawler is similarly infused with verteron particles when he teleports.\n\n**Collected Editions**\n\nSeveral collections of Kang the Conqueror's appearances have been published.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article includes a list of references, but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations.

Monroe had acquired a reputation for being difficult to work with, and she frequently delayed productions by being late to film sets in addition to having trouble remembering her lines. She also had an FBI file open since 1956 due to her \"problematic\" relationship with accused communist, author Arthur Miller.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nMonroe spent the last day of her life, Saturday, August 4, 1962, at her Brentwood home. In the morning, she met photographer Lawrence Schiller to discuss the possibility of Playboy publishing nude photos taken of her on the set of Something's Got to Give. She also received a massage from her personal massage therapist, talked with friends on the phone, and signed for deliveries.

At around 8:30 pm, Murray returned to the house and found Monroe's body in her bedroom. Monroe was lying on her back, with her right arm over her head and her left arm at her side.

Based on the advanced state of rigor mortis at the time her body was discovered, it was estimated that she had died between 8:30 and 10:30 pm on August 4.\n\n**Public Reactions and Funeral**\n\nMonroe's unexpected death was front-page news in the United States and Europe. According to biographer Lois Banner, \"it's said that the suicide rate in Los Angeles doubled the month after she died; the circulation rate of most newspapers expanded that month.\" The Chicago Tribune reported that they had received hundreds of phone calls from members of the public requesting information about her death. French filmmaker Jean Cocteau commented that her death \"should serve as a terrible lesson to all those, whose chief occupation consists of spying on and tormenting film stars.\" Her former co-star Laurence Olivier deemed her \"the complete victim of ballyhoo and sensation.\" Bus Stop director Joshua Logan stated that she was \"one of the most unappreciated people in the world.\"\n\n**Administration of Estate**\n\nIn her will, Monroe left several thousand dollars to her half-sister Berniece Baker Miracle and her secretary May Reis, a share for the education of her friend Norman Rosten's daughter, and established a $100,000 trust fund to cover the costs of the care of her birth mother, Gladys Pearl Baker, and the widow of her acting teacher Michael Chekhov.

The first allegations that she had been murdered originated in anti-communist activist Frank A. Capell's self-published pamphlet The Strange Death of Marilyn Monroe (1964), in which he claimed that her death was part of a communist conspiracy. Capell claimed that Monroe and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy had an affair, and that Monroe had threatened to cause a scandal, leading Kennedy to order her to be assassinated. In addition to accusing Kennedy of being a communist sympathizer, Capell also claimed that many other people close to Monroe, such as her doctors and ex-husband Arthur Miller, were communists.\n\n**1960s: Frank A. Capell, Jack Clemmons**\n\nIn the 1960s, the allegations of murder first became part of mainstream discussion with the publication of Norman Mailer's Marilyn: A Biography in 1973. Despite not having any evidence, Mailer repeated the claim that Monroe and Robert F. Kennedy had an affair and speculated that she was killed by either the FBI or the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who wished to use the murder as a \"point of pressure... against the Kennedys.\" The book was heavily criticized in reviews, and later that year Mailer recanted his allegations in an interview with Mike Wallace for 60 Minutes, stating that he had made them to ensure commercial success for his book, and that he believes Monroe's death was \"ten to one\" an \"accidental suicide.\"\n\n**1970s: Norman Mailer, Robert Slatzer, Anthony Scaduto**\n\nIn 1973, Mailer published Marilyn: A Biography, in which he repeated the claim that Monroe and Robert F. Kennedy had an affair and speculated that she was killed by either the FBI or the CIA. He also included allegations about the involvement of other individuals, including Jack Clemmons, a Los Angeles police officer who had been one of the first to respond to the scene of Monroe's death. Clemmons had previously claimed that he had seen a suspicious individual near Monroe's home on the night of her death, but his allegations were not corroborated.\n\n**1980s: Milo Speriglio, Anthony Summers**\n\nIn 1982, Speriglio published Marilyn Monroe: Murder Cover-Up, in which he claimed that Monroe had been murdered by Hoffa and mob boss Sam Giancana. Basing his account on Slatzer and Scaduto's books, Speriglio added statements made by Lionel Grandison, who worked at the Los Angeles County coroner's office at the time of Monroe's death.

{"title": "Suriname", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name Suriname may derive from an indigenous people called Surinen, who inhabited the area at the time of European contact [18] The suffix -ame, common in Surinamese river and place names (see also the Coppename River), may come from aima or eima, meaning river or creek mouth, in Lokono, an Arawak language spoken in the country [19]\n\n\nHistory\nIndigenous settlement of Suriname dates back to 3,000 BC The largest tribes were the Arawak, a nomadic coastal tribe that lived from hunting and fishing They were the first inhabitants in the area The Carib also settled in the area and conquered the Arawak by using their superior sailing ships They settled in Galibi (Kupali Yumï, meaning \"tree of the forefathers\") at the mouth of the Marowijne River While the larger Arawak and Carib tribes lived along the coast and savanna, smaller groups of indigenous people lived in the inland rainforest, such as the Akurio, Trió, Warao, and Wayana.\n\n\nColonial period\nBeginning in the 16th century, French, Spanish and English explorers visited the area A century later, Dutch and English settlers established plantation colonies along the many rivers in the fertile Guiana plains The earliest documented colony in Guiana was an English settlement named Marshall's Creek along the Suriname River [21] After that, there was another short-lived English colony called Surinam that lasted from 1650 to 1667.\n\n\nAbolition of slavery\nFrom 1861 to 1863, with the American Civil War underway, and enslaved people escaping to Northern territory controlled by the Union, United States President Abraham Lincoln and his administration looked abroad for places to relocate people who were freed from enslavement and who wanted to leave the United States It opened negotiations with the Dutch government regarding African American emigration to and colonization of the Dutch colony of Suriname Nothing came of the idea, which was dropped after 1864 [28]\n\n\nDecolonization\nDuring World War II, on 23 November 1941, under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in-exile, the United States sent 2,000 soldiers to Suriname to protect the bauxite mines to support the Allies' war effort [32] [33] In 1942, the Dutch government-in-exile began to review the relations between the Netherlands and its colonies in terms of the post-war period [34]\n\n\nIndependence\nThe first President of the country was Johan Ferrier, the former governor, with Henck Arron (the then leader of the NPS) as Prime Minister In the years leading up to independence, nearly one-third of the population of Suriname emigrated to the Netherlands, amidst concern that the new country would fare worse under independence than it had as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Surinamese politics did degenerate into ethnic polarisation and corruption soon after independence, with the NPS using Dutch aid money for partisan purposes Its leaders were accused of fraud in the 1977 elections, in which Arron won a further term, and the discontent was such that a large portion of the population fled to the Netherlands, joining the already significant Surinamese community there [35] [36] [37]\n\n\n1980 military coup\nOn 25 February 1980, a military coup overthrew Arron's government It was initiated by a group of 16 sergeants, led by Dési Bouterse [16] Opponents of the military regime attempted counter-coups in April 1980, August 1980, 15 March 1981, and again on 12 March 1982 The first counter attempt was led by Fred Ormskerk, [38] the second by Marxist-Leninists, [39] the third by Wilfred Hawker, and the fourth by Surendre Rambocus.\n\n\nCivil war, elections, and constitution\nThe brutal civil war between the Suriname army and Maroons loyal to rebel leader Ronnie Brunswijk, begun in 1986, continued and its effects further weakened Bouterse's position during the 1990s Due to the civil war, more than 10,000 Surinamese, mostly Maroons, fled to French Guiana in the late 1980s [41]\n\n\n21st century\nOn 19 July 2010, Bouterse returned to power when he was elected as the president of Suriname [43] Before his election in 2010, he, along with 24 others, had been charged with the murders of 15 prominent dissidents in the December murders However, in 2012, two months before the verdict in the trial, the National Assembly extended its amnesty law and provided Bouterse and the others with amnesty of these charges He was reelected on 14 July 2015 [44] However, Bouterse was convicted by a Surinamese court on 29 November 2019 and given a 20-year sentence for his role in the 1982 killings [45]\n\n\nPolitics\nThe Republic of Suriname is a representative democratic republic, based on the Constitution of 1987 The legislative branch of government consists of a 51-member unicameral National Assembly, simultaneously and popularly elected for a five-year term.\n\n\nForeign relations\nDue to Suriname's Dutch colonial history, Suriname had a long-standing special relationship with the Netherlands.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Armed Forces of Suriname have three branches: the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy The president of the Republic is the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces (Opperbevelhebber van de Strijdkrachten) The president is assisted by the minister of defence Beneath the president and minister of defence is the commander of the armed forces (Bevelhebber van de Strijdkrachten) The military branches and regional military commands report to the commander.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe country is divided into ten administrative districts, each headed by a district commissioner appointed by the president, who also has the power of dismissal Suriname is further subdivided into 62 resorts (ressorten).\n\n\nGeography\nSuriname is the smallest independent country in South America Situated on the Guiana Shield, it lies mostly between latitudes 1° and 6°N, and longitudes 54° and 58°W The country can be divided into two main geographic regions The northern, lowland coastal area (roughly above the line Albina-Paranam-Wageningen) has been cultivated, and most of the population lives here The southern part consists of tropical rainforest and sparsely inhabited savanna along the border with Brazil, covering about 80% of Suriname's land surface.\n\n\nBorders\nSuriname is situated between French Guiana to the east and Guyana to the west The southern border is shared with Brazil and the northern border is the Atlantic coast The southernmost borders with French Guiana and Guyana are disputed by these countries along the Marowijne and Corantijn rivers, respectively, while a part of the disputed maritime boundary with Guyana was arbitrated by the Permanent Court of Arbitration convened under the rules set out in Annex VII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on 20 September 2007 [65] [66]\n\n\nClimate\nLying two to five degrees north of the equator, Suriname has a very hot and wet tropical climate, and temperatures do not vary much throughout the year Average relative humidity is between 80% and 90% Its average temperature ranges from 29 to 34 °C (84 to 93 °F) Due to the high humidity, actual temperatures are distorted and may therefore feel up to 6 °C (11 °F) hotter than the recorded temperature.\n\n\nBiodiversity and conservation\nDue to the variety of habitats and temperatures, biodiversity in Suriname is considered high [68] In October 2013, 16 international scientists researching the ecosystems during a three-week expedition in Suriname's Upper Palumeu River Watershed catalogued 1,378 species and found 60—including six frogs, one snake, and 11 fish—that may be previously unknown species [69] [70] [71] [72] According to the environmental non-profit Conservation International, which funded the expedition, Suriname's ample supply of fresh water is vital to the biodiversity and healthy ecosystems of the region [73]\n\n\nEconomy\nSuriname's democracy gained some strength after the turbulent 1990s, and its economy became more diversified and less dependent on Dutch financial assistance [citation needed] Bauxite (aluminium ore) mining used to be a strong revenue source, since before the independence of the country up to 2015 Because Alcoa stopped all bauxite operations, the bauxite era in Suriname also ended [citation needed]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn 2022, Suriname had a population of roughly 618,040 according to estimates by the United Nations [88] [89] This compares to 541,638 inhabitants from the 2012 census [5] The Surinamese populace is characterized by high levels of diversity, wherein no particular demographic group constitutes a majority This is a legacy of centuries of Dutch rule, which entailed successive periods of forced, contracted, or voluntary migration by various nationalities and ethnic groups from around the world.\n\n\nEthnicity\nThe largest ethnic group are Indians, who form over a quarter of the population (27.4%) [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] The vast majority are descendants of 19th-century indentured workers from India, hailing mostly from Bhojpuri speaking areas of modern Bihar, Jharkhand, and northeastern Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and southeastern Tamil Nadu If counted as one ethnic group, the Afro-Surinamese are the largest community, at around 37.4%; however, they are usually divided into two cultural/ethnic groups: the Creoles and the Maroons Surinamese Maroons, whose ancestors are mostly runaway slaves that fled to the interior, comprise 21.7% of the population They are divided into six tribes: Ndyuka (Aucans), Saramaccans, Paramaccans, Kwinti, Aluku (Boni) and Matawai Surinamese Creoles, mixed people descending from African slaves and Europeans (mostly Dutch), form 15.7% of the population Javanese make up 14% of the population, and like the East Indians, descend largely from workers contracted from the island of Java in the former Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) [96] 13.4% of the population identifies as being of mixed ethnic heritage Chinese, originating from 19th-century indentured workers and some recent migration, make up 7.3% of the population.\n\n\nEmigration\nThe option to choose between Surinamese or Dutch citizenship in the years leading up to Suriname's independence in 1975 led to a mass migration to the Netherlands This migration continued in the period immediately after independence and during military rule in the 1980s and for largely economic reasons extended throughout the 1990s The Surinamese community in the Netherlands numbered 350,300 as of 2013 [update] (including children and grandchildren of Suriname migrants born in the Netherlands), compared to approximately 566,000 Surinamese in Suriname itself [16]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Suriname (2012 census) [7]\n\n\nLanguages\nSuriname has roughly 14 local languages, but Dutch (Nederlands) is the sole official language and is the language used in education, government, business, and the media [16] Over 60% of the population are native speakers of Dutch [101] and around 20%–30% speak it as a second language In 2004, Suriname became an associate member of the Dutch Language Union [102]\n\n\nLargest cities\nThe national capital, Paramaribo, is by far the dominant urban area, accounting for nearly half of Suriname's population and most of its urban residents Indeed, its population is greater than the next nine largest cities combined Most municipalities are located within the capital's metropolitan area, or along the densely populated coastline; about 90% of the population lives in Paramaribo or on the coast [105]\n\n\nCulture\nOwing to the country's multicultural heritage, Suriname celebrates a variety of distinct ethnic and religious festivals.\n\n\nNational holidays\nThere are several Hindu and Islamic national holidays like Diwali, Phagwa, and Eid-ul-adha These holidays do not have fixed dates on the Gregorian calendar, as they are based on the Hindu and Islamic calendars, respectively As of 2020, Eid-ul-adha is a national holiday, and equal to a Sunday [109]\n\n\nNew Year's Eve\nNew Year's Eve in Suriname is called Oud jaar, Owru Yari, or \"old year\" Firecrackers called pagaras which have long ribbons attached and are detonated at midnight [110]\n\n\nSports\nThe major sports in Suriname are football, basketball, and volleyball The Suriname Olympic Committee is the national governing body for sports in Suriname The major mind sports are chess, draughts, bridge and troefcall.\n\n\nTransportation\nSuriname, along with neighboring Guyana, is one of only two countries on the mainland South American continent that drive on the left, although many vehicles are left-hand-drive as well as right-hand-drive [116] One explanation for this practice is that at the time of its colonization of Suriname, the Netherlands itself used left-hand traffic, also introducing the practice in the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia [117] Another is that Suriname was first colonized by the British, and for practical reasons, this was not changed when it came under Dutch administration [118] Although the Netherlands converted to driving to the right at the end of the 18th century, [117] Suriname did not.\nAs of 2003, Suriname had 4303 km (2674 miles) of roads, of which 1119 km (695 miles) are paved [119]\n\n\nRoad\nSuriname, along with neighboring Guyana, is one of only two countries on the

paved \nThe only international airport that supports large jet aircraft is Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport.\n\n\nHealth\nThe Global Burden of Disease Study provides an on-line data source for analyzing updated estimates of health for 359 diseases and injuries and 84 risk factors from 1990 to 2017 in most of the world's countries [122] Comparing Suriname with other Caribbean nations show that in 2017 the age-standardized death rate for all causes was 793 (males 969, females 641) per 100,000, far below the 1219 of Haiti, somewhat below the 944 of Guyana but considerably above the 424 of  Bermuda In 1990, the death rate was 960 per 100,000 Life expectancy in 2017 was 72 years (males 69, females 75) The death rate for children < 5 years was 581 per 100,000 compared to 1308 in Haiti and 102 in Bermuda In 1990 and 2017, the leading causes of age-standardized death rates were cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes/chronic kidney disease.\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Suriname is compulsory until the age of 12, [123] and the nation had a net primary enrollment rate of 94% in 2004 [124] Literacy is very common, particularly among men [124] The main university in the country is the Anton de Kom University of Suriname.\n\n\nMedia\nTraditionally, De Ware Tijd was the major newspaper of the country, but since the '90s Times of Suriname, De West and Dagblad Suriname have also been well-read newspapers All publish primarily in Dutch [125]\n\n\nTourism\nMost tourists visit Suriname for the biodiversity of the Amazonian rain forests in the south of the country, which are noted for their flora and fauna The Central Suriname Nature Reserve is the biggest and one of the most popular reserves, along with the Brownsberg Nature Park which overlooks the Brokopondo Reservoir,  one of the largest human-made lakes in the world In 2008, the Berg en Dal Eco & Cultural Resort opened in Brokopondo [127] Tonka Island in the reservoir is home to a rustic eco-tourism project run by the Saramaccaner Maroons [128] Pangi wraps and bowls made of calabashes are the two main products manufactured for tourists The Maroons have learned that colorful and ornate pangis are popular with tourists [129] Other popular decorative souvenirs are hand-carved purple-hardwood made into bowls, plates, canes, wooden boxes, and wall decors.\n\n\nLandmarks\nThe Jules Wijdenbosch Bridge is a bridge over the river Suriname between Paramaribo and Meerzorg in the Commewijne district The bridge was built during the tenure of President Jules Albert Wijdenbosch (1996–2000) and was completed in 2000 The bridge is 52 metres (171 ft) high, and 1,504 metres (4,934 ft) long It connects Paramaribo with Commewijne, a connection which previously could only be made by ferry The purpose of the bridge was to facilitate and promote the development of the eastern part of Suriname The bridge consists of two lanes (one lane each way) and is not accessible to pedestrians.\n\n\nSee also\n4°N 56°W﻿ / ﻿4°N

Brazil to the south. It is the smallest independent country in South America and has a population of approximately 618,040 people, according to estimates by the United Nations.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name Suriname may derive from an indigenous people called Surinen, who inhabited the area at the time of European contact. The suffix -ame, common in Surinamese river and place names, may come from aima or eima, meaning river or creek mouth, in Lokono, an Arawak language spoken in the country.\n\n**History**\n\nIndigenous settlement of Suriname dates back to 3,000 BC. The largest tribes were the Arawak, a nomadic coastal tribe that lived from hunting and fishing. They were the first inhabitants in the area. The Carib also settled in the area and conquered the Arawak by using their superior sailing ships. They settled in Galibi (Kupali Yumï, meaning \"tree of the forefathers\") at the mouth of the Marowijne River. While the larger Arawak and Carib tribes lived along the coast and savanna, smaller groups of indigenous people lived in the inland rainforest, such as the Akurio, Trió, Warao, and Wayana.\n\n**Colonial period**\n\nBeginning in the 16th century, French, Spanish, and English explorers visited the area. A century later, Dutch and English settlers established plantation colonies along the many rivers in the fertile Guiana plains. The earliest documented colony in Guiana was an English settlement named Marshall's Creek along the Suriname River. After that, there was another short-lived English colony called Surinam that lasted from 1650 to 1667.\n\n**Abolition of slavery**\n\nFrom 1861 to 1863, with the American Civil War underway, and enslaved people escaping to Northern territory controlled by the Union, United States President Abraham Lincoln and his administration looked abroad for places to relocate people who were freed from enslavement and who wanted to leave the United States. It opened negotiations with the Dutch government regarding African American emigration to and colonization of the Dutch colony of Suriname. Nothing came of the idea, which was dropped after 1864.\n\n**Decolonization**\n\nDuring World War II, on 23 November 1941, under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in-exile, the United States sent 2,000 soldiers to Suriname to protect the bauxite mines to support the Allies' war effort. In 1942, the Dutch government-in-exile began to review the relations between the Netherlands and its colonies in terms of the post-war period.\n\n**Independence**\n\nThe first President of the country was Johan Ferrier, the former governor, with Henck Arron (the then leader of the NPS) as Prime Minister.

Due to the civil war, more than 10,000 Surinamese, mostly Maroons, fled to French Guiana in the late 1980s.\n\n**21st century**\n\nOn 19 July 2010, Bouterse returned to power when he was elected as the president of Suriname.

However, in 1975, Suriname gained independence and established diplomatic relations with the international community.\n\n**Military**\n\nThe Armed Forces of Suriname have three branches: the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy. The president of the Republic is the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces (Opperbevelhebber van de Strijdkrachten). The president is assisted by the minister of defence. Beneath the president and minister of defence is the commander of the armed forces (Bevelhebber van de Strijdkrachten). The military branches and regional military commands report to the commander.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nThe country is divided into ten administrative districts, each headed by a district commissioner appointed by the president, who also has the power of dismissal. Suriname is further subdivided into 62 resorts (ressorten).\n\n**Geography**\n\nSuriname is the smallest independent country in South America.

Arawak and Carib tribes lived along the coast and savanna, smaller groups of indigenous people lived in the inland rainforest, such as the Akurio, Trió, Warao, and Wayana.\n\n\nColonial period\nBeginning in the 16th century, French, Spanish and English explorers visited the area A century later, Dutch and English settlers established plantation colonies along the many rivers in the fertile Guiana plains The earliest documented colony in Guiana was an English settlement named Marshall's Creek along the Suriname River [21] After that, there was another short-lived English colony called Surinam that lasted from 1650 to 1667.\n\n\nAbolition of slavery\nFrom 1861 to 1863, with the American Civil War underway, and enslaved people escaping to Northern territory controlled by the Union, United States President Abraham Lincoln and his administration looked abroad for places to relocate people who were freed from enslavement and who wanted to leave the United States It opened negotiations with the Dutch government regarding African American emigration to and colonization of the Dutch colony of Suriname Nothing came of the idea, which was dropped after 1864 [28]\n\n\nDecolonization\nDuring World War II, on 23 November 1941, under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in-exile, the United States sent 2,000 soldiers to Suriname to protect the bauxite mines to support the Allies' war effort [32] [33] In 1942, the Dutch government-in-exile began to review the relations between the Netherlands and its colonies in terms of the post-war period [34]\n\n\nIndependence\nThe first President of the country was Johan Ferrier, the former governor, with Henck Arron (the then leader of the NPS) as Prime Minister In the years leading up to independence, nearly one-third of the population of Suriname emigrated to the Netherlands, amidst concern that the new country would fare worse under independence than it had as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands Surinamese politics did degenerate into ethnic polarisation and corruption soon after independence, with the NPS using Dutch aid money for partisan purposes Its leaders were accused of fraud in the 1977 elections, in which Arron won a further term, and the discontent was such that a large portion of the population fled to the Netherlands, joining the already significant Surinamese community there [35] [36] [37]\n\n\n1980 military coup\nOn 25 February 1980, a military coup overthrew Arron's government It was initiated by a group of 16 sergeants, led by Dési Bouterse [16] Opponents of the military regime attempted counter-coups in April 1980, August 1980, 15 March 1981, and again on 12 March 1982 The first counter attempt was led by Fred Ormskerk, [38] the second by Marxist-Leninists, [39] the third by Wilfred Hawker, and the fourth by Surendre Rambocus.\n\n\nCivil war, elections, and constitution\nThe brutal civil war between the Suriname army and Maroons loyal to rebel leader Ronnie Brunswijk, begun in 1986, continued and its effects further weakened Bouterse's position during the 1990s Due to the civil war, more than 10,000 Surinamese, mostly Maroons, fled to French Guiana in the late 1980s [41]\n\n\n21st century\nOn 19 July 2010, Bouterse returned to power when he was elected as the president of Suriname [43] Before his election in 2010, he, along with 24 others, had been charged with the murders of 15 prominent dissidents in the December murders However, in 2012, two months before the verdict in the trial, the National Assembly extended its amnesty law and provided Bouterse and the others with amnesty of these charges He was reelected on 14 July 2015 [44] However, Bouterse was convicted by a Surinamese court on 29 November 2019 and given a 20-year sentence for his role in the 1982 killings [45]\n\n\nPolitics\nThe Republic of Suriname is a representative democratic republic, based on the Constitution of 1987 The legislative branch of government consists of a 51-member unicameral National Assembly, simultaneously and popularly elected for a five-year term.\n\n\nForeign relations\nDue to Suriname's Dutch colonial history, Suriname had a long-standing special relationship with the Netherlands.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Armed Forces of Suriname have three branches: the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy The president of the Republic is the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces (Opperbevelhebber van de Strijdkrachten) The president is assisted by the minister of defence Beneath the president and minister of defence is the commander of the armed forces (Bevelhebber van de Strijdkrachten) The military branches and regional military commands report to the commander.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe country is divided into ten administrative districts, each headed by a district commissioner appointed by the president, who also has the power of dismissal Suriname is further subdivided into 62 resorts (ressorten).\n\n\nGeography\nSuriname is the smallest independent country in South America Situated on the Guiana Shield, it lies mostly between latitudes 1° and 6°N, and longitudes 54° and 58°W The country can be divided into two main geographic regions The northern, lowland coastal area (roughly above the line Albina-Paranam-Wageningen) has been cultivated, and most of the population lives here The southern part consists of tropical rainforest and sparsely inhabited savanna along the border with Brazil, covering about 80% of Suriname's land surface.\n\n\nBorders\nSuriname is situated between French Guiana to the east and Guyana to the west The southern border is shared with Brazil and the northern border is the Atlantic coast The southernmost borders with French Guiana and Guyana are disputed by these countries along the Marowijne and Corantijn rivers, respectively, while a part of the disputed maritime boundary with Guyana was arbitrated by the Permanent Court of Arbitration convened under the rules set out in Annex VII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on 20 September 2007 [65] [66]\n\n\nClimate\nLying two to five degrees north of the equator, Suriname has a very hot and wet tropical climate, and temperatures do not vary much throughout the year Average relative humidity is between 80% and 90% Its average temperature ranges from 29 to 34 °C (84 to 93 °F) Due to the high humidity, actual temperatures are distorted and may therefore feel up to 6 °C (11 °F) hotter than the recorded temperature.\n\n\nBiodiversity and conservation\nDue to the variety of habitats and temperatures, biodiversity in Suriname is considered high [68] In October 2013, 16 international scientists researching the ecosystems during a three-week expedition in Suriname's Upper Palumeu River Watershed catalogued 1,378 species and found 60—including six frogs, one snake, and 11 fish—that may be previously unknown species [69] [70] [71] [72] According to the environmental non-profit Conservation International, which funded the expedition, Suriname's ample supply of fresh water is vital to the biodiversity and healthy ecosystems of the region [73]\n\n\nEconomy\nSuriname's democracy gained some strength after the turbulent 1990s, and its economy became more diversified and less dependent on Dutch financial assistance [citation needed] Bauxite (aluminium ore) mining used to be a strong revenue source, since before the independence of the country up to 2015 Because Alcoa stopped all bauxite operations, the bauxite era in Suriname also ended [citation needed]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn 2022, Suriname had a population of roughly 618,040 according to estimates by the United Nations [88] [89] This compares to 541,638 inhabitants from the 2012 census [5] The Surinamese populace is characterized by high levels of diversity, wherein no particular demographic group constitutes a majority This is a legacy of centuries of Dutch rule, which entailed successive periods of forced, contracted, or voluntary migration by various nationalities and ethnic groups from around the world.\n\n\nEthnicity\nThe largest ethnic group are Indians, who form over a quarter of the population (27.4%) [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] The vast majority are descendants of 19th-century indentured workers from India, hailing mostly from Bhojpuri speaking areas of modern Bihar, Jharkhand, and northeastern Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and southeastern Tamil Nadu If counted as one ethnic group, the Afro-Surinamese are the largest community, at around 37.4%; however, they are usually divided into two cultural/ethnic groups: the Creoles and the Maroons Surinamese Maroons, whose ancestors are mostly runaway slaves that fled to the interior, comprise 21.7% of the population They are divided into six tribes: Ndyuka (Aucans), Saramaccans, Paramaccans, Kwinti, Aluku (Boni) and Matawai Surinamese Creoles, mixed people descending from African slaves and Europeans (mostly Dutch), form 15.7% of the population Javanese make up 14% of the population, and like the East Indians, descend largely from workers contracted from the island of Java in the former Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) [96] 13.4% of the population identifies as being of mixed ethnic heritage Chinese, originating from 19th-century indentured workers and some recent migration, make up 7.3% of the population.\n\n\nEmigration\nThe option to choose between Surinamese or Dutch citizenship in the years leading up to Suriname's independence in 1975 led to a mass migration to the Netherlands This migration continued in the period immediately after independence and during military rule in the 1980s and for largely economic reasons extended throughout the 1990s The Surinamese community in the Netherlands numbered 350,300 as of 2013 [update] (including children and grandchildren of Suriname migrants born in the Netherlands), compared to approximately 566,000 Surinamese in Suriname itself [16]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Suriname (2012 census) [7]\n\n\nLanguages\nSuriname has roughly 14 local languages, but Dutch (Nederlands) is the sole official language and is the language used in education, government, business, and the media [16] Over 60% of the population are native speakers of Dutch [101] and around 20%–30% speak it as a second language In 2004, Suriname became an associate member of the Dutch Language Union [102]\n\n\nLargest cities\nThe national capital, Paramaribo, is by far the dominant urban area, accounting for nearly half of Suriname's population and most of its urban residents Indeed, its population is greater than the next nine largest cities combined Most municipalities are located within the capital's metropolitan area, or along the densely populated coastline; about 90% of the population lives in Paramaribo or on the coast [105]\n\n\nCulture\nOwing to the country's multicultural heritage, Suriname celebrates a variety of distinct ethnic and religious festivals.\n\n\nNational holidays\nThere are several Hindu and Islamic national holidays like Diwali, Phagwa, and Eid-ul-adha These holidays do not have fixed dates on the Gregorian calendar, as they are based on the Hindu and Islamic calendars, respectively As of 2020, Eid-ul-adha is a national holiday, and equal to a Sunday [109]\n\n\nNew Year's Eve\nNew Year's Eve in Suriname is called Oud jaar, Owru Yari, or \"old year\" Firecrackers called pagaras which have long ribbons attached and are detonated at midnight [110]\n\n\nSports\nThe major sports in Suriname are football, basketball, and volleyball The Suriname Olympic Committee is the national governing body for sports in Suriname The major mind sports are chess, draughts, bridge and troefcall.\n\n\nTransportation\nSuriname, along with neighboring Guyana, is one of only two countries on the mainland South American continent that drive on the left, although many vehicles are left-hand-drive as well as right-hand-drive [116] One explanation for this practice is that at the time of its colonization of Suriname, the Netherlands itself used left-hand traffic, also introducing the practice in the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia [117] Another is that Suriname was first colonized by the British, and for practical reasons, this was not changed when it came under Dutch administration [118] Although the Netherlands converted to driving to the right at the end of the 18th century, [117] Suriname did not.\nAs of 2003, Suriname had 4303 km (2674 miles) of roads, of which 1119 km (695 miles) are paved [119]\n\n\nRoad\nSuriname, along with neighboring Guyana, is one of only two countries on the

paved \nThe only international airport that supports large jet aircraft is Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport.\n\n\nHealth\nThe Global Burden of Disease Study provides an on-line data source for analyzing updated estimates of health for 359 diseases and injuries and 84 risk factors from 1990 to 2017 in most of the world's countries [122] Comparing Suriname with other Caribbean nations show that in 2017 the age-standardized death rate for all causes was 793 (males 969, females 641) per 100,000, far below the 1219 of Haiti, somewhat below the 944 of Guyana but considerably above the 424 of  Bermuda In 1990, the death rate was 960 per 100,000 Life expectancy in 2017 was 72 years (males 69, females 75) The death rate for children < 5 years was 581 per 100,000 compared to 1308 in Haiti and 102 in Bermuda In 1990 and 2017, the leading causes of age-standardized death rates were cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes/chronic kidney disease.\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Suriname is compulsory until the age of 12, [123] and the nation had a net primary enrollment rate of 94% in 2004 [124] Literacy is very common, particularly among men [124] The main university in the country is the Anton de Kom University of Suriname.\n\n\nMedia\nTraditionally, De Ware Tijd was the major newspaper of the country, but since the '90s Times of Suriname, De West and Dagblad Suriname have also been well-read newspapers All publish primarily in Dutch [125]\n\n\nTourism\nMost tourists visit Suriname for the biodiversity of the Amazonian rain forests in the south of the country, which are noted for their flora and fauna The Central Suriname Nature Reserve is the biggest and one of the most popular reserves, along with the Brownsberg Nature Park which overlooks the Brokopondo Reservoir,  one of the largest human-made lakes in the world In 2008, the Berg en Dal Eco & Cultural Resort opened in Brokopondo [127] Tonka Island in the reservoir is home to a rustic eco-tourism project run by the Saramaccaner Maroons [128] Pangi wraps and bowls made of calabashes are the two main products manufactured for tourists The Maroons have learned that colorful and ornate pangis are popular with tourists [129] Other popular decorative souvenirs are hand-carved purple-hardwood made into bowls, plates, canes, wooden boxes, and wall decors.\n\n\nLandmarks\nThe Jules Wijdenbosch Bridge is a bridge over the river Suriname between Paramaribo and Meerzorg in the Commewijne district The bridge was built during the tenure of President Jules Albert Wijdenbosch (1996–2000) and was completed in 2000 The bridge is 52 metres (171 ft) high, and 1,504 metres (4,934 ft) long It connects Paramaribo with Commewijne, a connection which previously could only be made by ferry The purpose of the bridge was to facilitate and promote the development of the eastern part of Suriname The bridge consists of two lanes (one lane each way) and is not accessible to pedestrians.\n\n\nSee also\n4°N 56°W﻿ / ﻿4°N

Little is known about Banach's mother [5] According to his baptismal certificate, she was born in Borówna and worked as a domestic helper [8]\n\n\nDiscovery by Steinhaus\nIn 1916, in Kraków's Planty park, Banach encountered Professor Hugo Steinhaus, one of the renowned mathematicians of the time According to Steinhaus, while he was strolling through the gardens he was surprised to overhear the term \"Lebesgue integral\" (Lebesgue integration was at the time still a fairly new idea in mathematics) and walked over to investigate As a result, he met Banach, as well as Otto Nikodym [18] Steinhaus became fascinated with the self-taught young mathematician The encounter resulted in a long-lasting collaboration and friendship In fact, soon after the encounter Steinhaus invited Banach to solve some problems he had been working on but which had proven difficult Banach solved them within a week and the two soon published their first joint work (On the Mean Convergence of Fourier Series) Steinhaus, Banach and Nikodym, along with several other Kraków mathematicians (Władysław Ślebodziński, Leon Chwistek, Alfred Rosenblatt [19] and Włodzimierz Stożek) also established a mathematical society, which eventually became the Polish Mathematical Society [20] The society was officially founded on 2 April 1919 It was also through Steinhaus that Banach met his future wife, Łucja Braus.\n\n\nInterbellum\nSteinhaus introduced Banach to academic circles and substantially accelerated his career After Poland regained independence in 1918, Banach was given an assistantship at the Lwów Polytechnic Steinhaus' backing also allowed him to receive a doctorate without actually graduating from a university The doctoral thesis, accepted by King John II Casimir University of Lwów in 1920 [21] and published in 1922, [22] included the basic ideas of functional analysis, which was soon to become an entirely new branch of mathematics In his dissertation, written in 1920, he axiomatically defined what is today called a Banach space [23] The thesis was widely discussed in academic circles and allowed him in 1922 to become a professor at the Lwów Polytechnic Initially an assistant to Professor Antoni Łomnicki, in 1927, Banach received his own chair In 1924 he was accepted as a member of the Polish Academy of Learning At the same time, from 1922, Banach also headed the second Chair of Mathematics at University of Lwów.\n\n\nWorld War II\nAfter the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Lwów came under the control of the Soviet Union for almost two years Banach, from 1939 a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and on good terms with Soviet mathematicians, [5] had to promise to learn Ukrainian to be allowed to keep his chair and continue his academic activities [26] After the German takeover of Lwów in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa, all universities were closed and Banach, along with many colleagues and his son, was employed as a lice feeder at Professor Rudolf Weigl's Typhus Research Institute Employment in Weigl's Institute provided many unemployed university professors and their associates protection from random arrest and deportation to Nazi concentration camps.\n\n\nContributions\nBanach's dissertation, completed in 1920 and published in 1922, formally axiomatized the concept of a complete normed vector space and laid the foundations for the area of functional analysis In this work Banach called such spaces \"class E-spaces\", but in his 1932 book, Théorie des opérations linéaires, he changed terminology and referred to them as \"spaces of type B\", which most likely contributed to the subsequent eponymous naming of these spaces after him [28] The theory of what came to be known as Banach spaces had antecedents in the work of the Hungarian mathematician Frigyes Riesz (published in 1916) and contemporaneous contributions from Hans Hahn and Norbert Wiener [21] For a brief period in fact, complete normed linear spaces were referred to as \"Banach–Wiener\" spaces in mathematical literature, based on terminology introduced by Wiener himself However, because Wiener's work on the topic was limited, the established name became just Banach spaces [28]\n\n\nRecognition\nIn 1946, the Stefan Banach Prize (Polish: Nagroda im Stefana Banacha) was established by the Polish Mathematical Society In 1992, the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences established a special Stefan Banach Medal for outstanding achievements in mathematical sciences [29] Since 2009, the

on 2 April 1919 It was also through Steinhaus that Banach met his future wife, Łucja Braus.\n\n\nInterbellum\nSteinhaus introduced Banach to academic circles and substantially accelerated his career After Poland regained independence in 1918, Banach was given an assistantship at the Lwów Polytechnic Steinhaus' backing also allowed him to receive a doctorate without actually graduating from a university The doctoral thesis, accepted by King John II Casimir University of Lwów in 1920 [21] and published in 1922, [22] included the basic ideas of functional analysis, which was soon to become an entirely new branch of mathematics In his dissertation, written in 1920, he axiomatically defined what is today called a Banach space [23] The thesis was widely discussed in academic circles and allowed him in 1922 to become a professor at the Lwów Polytechnic Initially an assistant to Professor Antoni Łomnicki, in 1927, Banach received his own chair In 1924 he was accepted as a member of the Polish Academy of Learning At the same time, from 1922, Banach also headed the second Chair of Mathematics at University of Lwów.\n\n\nWorld War II\nAfter the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Lwów came under the control of the Soviet Union for almost two years Banach, from 1939 a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and on good terms with Soviet mathematicians, [5] had to promise to learn Ukrainian to be allowed to keep his chair and continue his academic activities [26] After the German takeover of Lwów in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa, all universities were closed and Banach, along with many colleagues and his son, was employed as a lice feeder at Professor Rudolf Weigl's Typhus Research Institute Employment in Weigl's Institute provided many unemployed university professors and their associates protection from random arrest and deportation to Nazi concentration camps.\n\n\nContributions\nBanach's dissertation, completed in 1920 and published in 1922, formally axiomatized the concept of a complete normed vector space and laid the foundations for the area of functional analysis In this work Banach called such spaces \"class E-spaces\", but in his 1932 book, Théorie des opérations linéaires, he changed terminology and referred to them as \"spaces of type B\", which most likely contributed to the subsequent eponymous naming of these spaces after him [28] The theory of what came to be known as Banach spaces had antecedents in the work of the Hungarian mathematician Frigyes Riesz (published in 1916) and contemporaneous contributions from Hans Hahn and Norbert Wiener [21] For a brief period in fact, complete normed linear spaces were referred to as \"Banach–Wiener\" spaces in mathematical literature, based on terminology introduced by Wiener himself However, because Wiener's work on the topic was limited, the established name became just Banach spaces [28]\n\n\nRecognition\nIn 1946, the Stefan Banach Prize (Polish: Nagroda im Stefana Banacha) was established by the Polish Mathematical Society In 1992, the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences established a special Stefan Banach Medal for outstanding achievements in mathematical sciences [29] Since 2009, the International Stefan Banach Prize has been conferred by the Polish Mathematical Society to mathematicians for best doctoral dissertations in the mathematical sciences with the objective to \"promote and financially support the most promising young researchers\" [30]\n\n\nQuotes\nStanislaw Ulam, another

later served as the 6th prime minister of India, and Sonia Gandhi, who went on to become the president of the Indian National Congress As the grandson of former prime minister Indira Gandhi, his lineage is deeply rooted in Indian political history His paternal grandfather, Feroze Gandhi, hailed from Gujarat and was of Parsi descent [13] Furthermore, he is the great-grandson of India's inaugural prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\n\nPolitical career\nIn March 2004, Gandhi announced his entry into politics by declaring that he would contest the 14th general elections from his father's former constituency of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh for the Lok Sabha, India's lower house of parliament [28] His mother had held the seat until she transferred to the neighbouring constituency of Raebareli When Gandhi made this announcement, it came as a surprise to political commentators, who had perceived his sister Priyanka Gandhi as the more charismatic and probable successor It generated speculation that the presence of a young member of India's most famous political family would reinvigorate the Congress party's political fortunes among India's youthful population [29] In his first interview with foreign media, Gandhi portrayed himself as a uniter of the country and condemned \"divisive\" politics in India, saying that he would try to reduce caste and religious tensions

Gandhi portrayed himself as a uniter of the country and condemned \"divisive\" politics in India, saying that he would try to reduce caste and religious tensions [30]\n\n\nYouth politics\nIn September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC), segment of the Congress party that represents the younger generation, and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), the faction that caters to the student community [39] As the general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Gandhi played a notable role in shaping the policies and strategies of these organisations After his appointment, both groups saw a significant increase in membership, from 200,000 to 2.5 million [40] The IYC underwent a restructuring process to make it more democratic and inclusive [41] [42] In November 2008, Gandhi held interviews at his 12 Tughlak Lane residence in New Delhi to handpick at least 40 people to make up the IYC's think tank [43] In 2009, during Gandhi's visit to West Bengal, the state unit of the Youth Congress registered 1 million members [44] Similarly, the IYC only acquired around 10 to 15 new

emphasised the importance of youth participation in politics and urged them to be more involved in shaping the country's future [53]  The nationwide elections defied the predictions made by pre-poll predictions and exit polls and gave a clear mandate to the incumbent, Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government [54] The 2009 general elections were a success for the INC, which won 206 seats While the Congress did not win a majority in the election, they emerged as the largest party and formed a coalition government with the support of other parties [55] Gandhi retained his Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival by a margin of over 370,000 votes [56] Gandhi was credited with the Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh where they won 21 out of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats

attention when former BJP leader Subramanian Swamy filed a complaint accusing Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and five other Congress party leaders—Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, Suman Dubey, and Satyan Pitroda—of cheating and misappropriating funds associated with the National Herald The allegations by then-BJP leader Subramanian Swamy centered on a loan given by the Congress party to \"Associated Journals Limited\" (AJL), the company that owned the National Herald newspaper [74] Subramanian Swamy alleged that the loan, amounting to around ₹90 crore (equivalent to ₹202 crore or US$24 million in 2023), was not repaid Instead, it was converted into equity, effectively transferring the ownership of AJL to a new company called \"Young India Ltd\" (YIL), in which Sonia Gandhi hold 76 per cent of the company's shares, and the remaining 24 per cent are held by Congress leaders Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes [74] As per Swamy, YIL only paid ₹54 lakh (equivalent to ₹1.2 crore or US$150,000 in

Congress party's political fortunes among India's youthful population [29] In his first interview with foreign media, Gandhi portrayed himself as a uniter of the country and condemned \"divisive\" politics in India, saying that he would try to reduce caste and religious tensions [30]\n\n\nFormative years\nIn March 2004, Gandhi announced his entry into politics by declaring that he would contest the 14th general elections from his father's former constituency of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh for the Lok Sabha, India's lower house of parliament [28] His mother had held the seat until she transferred to the neighbouring constituency of Raebareli When Gandhi made this announcement, it came as a surprise to political commentators, who had perceived his sister Priyanka Gandhi as the more charismatic and probable successor It generated speculation that the presence of a young member of India's most famous political family would reinvigorate the Congress party's political fortunes among India's youthful population [29] In his first interview with foreign media, Gandhi portrayed himself as a uniter of the country and condemned \"divisive\" politics in India, saying that he would try to reduce caste and religious tensions [30]\n\n\nYouth politics\nIn September 2007, Gandhi was appointed as general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC), segment of the Congress party that represents the younger generation, and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), the faction that caters to the student community [39] As the general secretary of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Gandhi played a notable role in shaping the policies and strategies of these organisations After his appointment, both groups saw a significant increase in membership, from 200,000 to 2.5 million [40] The IYC underwent a restructuring process to make it more democratic and inclusive [41] [42] In November 2008, Gandhi held interviews at his 12 Tughlak Lane residence in New Delhi to handpick at least 40 people to make up the IYC's think tank [43] In 2009, during Gandhi's visit to West Bengal, the state unit of the Youth Congress registered 1 million members [44] Similarly, the IYC only acquired around 10 to 15 new members per day in each assembly segment of Uttar Pradesh After his visit, the number surged to 150 to 200 new members per day in the same regions [45]\n\n\nGeneral election campaigns (2009-2024)\nFor the 2009 Indian general election, Gandhi campaigned across India covering 22 states and 107 constituencies [50] [51] His campaigning included addressing public rallies and meetings, interacting with voters, and highlighting the party's vision and agenda for the country [52] He specifically focused on issues such as rural development, education, employment, and women's empowerment Gandhi, also emphasised the importance of youth participation in politics and urged them to be more involved in shaping the country's future [53]  The nationwide elections defied the predictions made by pre-poll predictions and exit polls and gave a clear mandate to the incumbent, Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government [54] The 2009 general elections were a success for the INC, which won 206 seats While the Congress did not win a majority in the election, they emerged as the largest party and formed a coalition government with the support of other parties [55] Gandhi retained his Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival by a margin of over 370,000 votes [56] Gandhi was credited with the Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh where they won 21 out of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats [57] [58]\n\n\nNational Herald case\nThe National Herald case revolves around allegations of financial irregularities and misuse of funds related to the National Herald newspaper The case garnered attention when former BJP leader Subramanian Swamy filed a complaint accusing Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and five other Congress party leaders—Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, Suman Dubey, and Satyan Pitroda—of cheating and misappropriating funds associated with the National Herald The allegations by then-BJP leader Subramanian Swamy centered on a loan given by the Congress party to \"Associated Journals Limited\" (AJL), the company that owned the National Herald newspaper [74] Subramanian Swamy alleged that the loan, amounting to around ₹90 crore (equivalent to ₹202 crore or US$24 million in 2023), was not repaid Instead, it was converted into equity, effectively transferring the ownership of AJL to a new company called \"Young India Ltd\" (YIL), in which Sonia Gandhi hold 76 per cent of the company's shares, and the remaining 24 per cent are held by Congress leaders Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes [74] As per Swamy, YIL only paid ₹54 lakh (equivalent to ₹1.2 crore or US$150,000 in 2023) to get back ₹90 crore that Associated AJL owed to the Congress party He also alleged that the loan given to AJL was illegal, as it had been taken from party funds [74]\n\n\nBharat Jodo Yatra (2022–2023)\nThe Bharat Jodo Yatra, which translates to \"Unify India March,\" was a campaign organised by the Congress party spanning from 2022 to 2023 with the stated primary objective of promoting national unity and solidarity across the various regions of India It aimed to mobilise support for the INC and its ideology, emphasising themes of patriotism, cultural heritage, and development [79] Gandhi started the initiative on 7 September 2022 at Kanyakumari after paying tributes to his late father Rajiv Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, and the Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar [80] The yatra saw Gandhi along with INC leaders, including members of Parliament and notable personalities, travelling across the country, addressing rallies, conducting public meetings, and interacting with citizens Throughout the yatra, Gandhi focused on issues such as economic development, social justice, and inclusive governance, aiming to strengthen the party's grassroots presence and reinvigorate its political relevance on the national stage [81]\n\n\nBharat Jodo Nyay Yatra (2024)\nFrom 14 January to 20 March 2024, Gandhi led a second yatra across India from east to west, the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra; unlike the previous version, the Yatra was conducted in a hybrid mode [84]\n\n\n2023 conviction and stay\nOn 13 April 2019, during a political rally in Kolar, Karnataka, India before the 17th general election, Gandhi made a remark in Hindi, questioning, \"Why is it that all thieves, whether it be Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi, or Narendra Modi, have Modi in their names?\" [85] A speech comparing Narendra Modi with Fugitive Economic Offenders such as Nirav Modi and Lalit Modi A criminal defamation case was filed by Purnesh Modi, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Surat West He alleged that Gandhi had defamed all individuals with the surname Modi On 16 July 2019, the Surat court excused Gandhi from appearing personally in court due to short notice On 10 October, he pleaded not guilty in the Surat Court, recording his statements and responding to questions here on 24 June 2021, and again on 29 October During these appearances, he clarified to the court that he did not intend to defame any community [86]\n\n\nElectoral performance\nIn the 2004 general election, Gandhi contested from Amethi and won, securing

segments of the Pakistani establishment It would also seriously compromise India's fight against terror as also our strategic security.\" Adding that terrorism has no religion, he claimed that Rahul Gandhi had shown his lack of understanding India [106] Gandhi has also been critical of groups like the RSS and has compared them to terrorist organisations like SIMI [107] [108]\n\nNational

was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby [4] His minions appeared before him (but only alluded to him), in issue #132.\n\n\nFictional character biography\nHerbert Wyndham was born in Manchester, England While a student at Oxford in the 1930s, he took an interest in the work of genetic biologist Nathaniel Essex, and began experimenting with genetic manipulation, building a machine (that he called the genetic accelerator) with which he attempted to \"evolve\" the rats in his mother's London basement While attending a genetics conference in Geneva, Wyndham was approached by a mysterious man (who was in truth the outcast Inhuman geneticist Phaeder) who handed to him papers containing blueprints for cracking the genetic code With this information to bolster his experiments, Wyndham successfully developed a serum he dubbed \"Isotope A\" [5]\n\n\nCharacterization\nThe High Evolutionary has evolved his intelligence to the upper limit of human potential, and is the only human whose intelligence and knowledge has been listed as equal to certain cosmic entities [49] He is considered the leading geneticist in the Marvel universe, and is vastly knowledgeable in biology, chemistry, medicine, physics, engineering, human psychology, computer science, and cybernetics.\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nThe High Evolutionary has evolved his intelligence to the upper limit of human potential, and is

biology, chemistry, medicine, physics, engineering, human psychology, computer science, and cybernetics.\n\n\nEquipment\nHis exoskeleton provides him with an uncanny degree of protection from attacks, and also provides life support (filtering/recycling his air and providing sustenance when needed) If he is badly damaged, the suit can heal his wounds and can completely restore him to life using records of his genome and brain activity patterns, as in one instance the suit restored him fully after he had attempted to commit suicide by destroying his own body [20]\n\n\nPersonality\nThe High Evolutionary's character has varied between that of a weary, well-meaning creator to that of a \"mad scientist\" who is willing to do whatever he considers necessary to further his goals of evolving a better, less-brutal world He has great respect for the process of evolution, but is also deeply troubled by the immense amount of death and suffering required for such slow progress (see the Quicksilver series) Although menacing and arrogant during his maniacal phases, the High Evolutionary's history also contains more than one example of his desire to be responsible, creative, and kind Most Marvel writers have resisted portraying him as a standard-fare villain, thereby adding levels of sympathy and complexity to the character The High Evolutionary has been manipulated and driven to insanity by both the Beyonders and the Celestials, cosmic races that have interfered with human evolution in the past, indicating that his work might perhaps be a threat to their own Even at his most unstable, the High Evolutionary has always demonstrated a paternal love toward even his most flawed creations: he rehabilitated Nobilus, has attempted to heal Count Tagar and the God Pack, and has spared the Man-Beast his life despite multiple attempts to murder him At one point, he offered to (and did) restore the Savage Land after it was destroyed by Terminus, even though it had been created by the very race that had confiscated and then destroyed his own beloved creation, Counter-Earth.\n\n\nIn other media\nThe High Evolutionary appears in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, portrayed by

geneticist Phaeder) who handed to him papers containing blueprints for cracking the genetic code With this information to bolster his experiments, Wyndham successfully developed a serum he dubbed \"Isotope A\" [5]\n\n\nCharacterization\nThe High Evolutionary has evolved his intelligence to the upper limit of human potential, and is the only human whose intelligence and knowledge has been listed as equal to certain cosmic entities [49] He is considered the leading geneticist in the Marvel universe, and is vastly knowledgeable in biology, chemistry, medicine, physics, engineering, human psychology, computer science, and cybernetics.\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nThe High Evolutionary has evolved his intelligence to the upper limit of human potential, and is the only human whose intelligence and knowledge has been listed as equal to certain cosmic entities [49] He is considered the leading geneticist in the Marvel universe, and is vastly knowledgeable in biology, chemistry, medicine, physics, engineering, human psychology, computer science, and cybernetics.\n\n\nEquipment\nHis exoskeleton provides him with an uncanny degree of protection from attacks, and also provides life support (filtering/recycling his air and providing sustenance when needed) If he is badly damaged, the suit can heal his wounds and can completely restore him to life using records of his genome and brain activity patterns, as in one instance the suit restored him fully after he had attempted to commit suicide by destroying his own body [20]\n\n\nPersonality\nThe High Evolutionary's character has varied between that of a weary, well-meaning creator to that of a \"mad scientist\" who is willing to do whatever he considers necessary to further his goals of evolving a better, less-brutal world He has great respect for the process of evolution, but is also deeply troubled by the immense amount of death and suffering required for such slow progress (see the Quicksilver series) Although menacing and arrogant during his maniacal phases, the High Evolutionary's history also contains more than one example of his desire to be responsible, creative, and kind Most Marvel writers have resisted portraying him as a standard-fare villain, thereby adding levels of sympathy and complexity to the character The High Evolutionary has been manipulated and driven to insanity by both the Beyonders and the Celestials, cosmic races that have interfered with human evolution in the past, indicating that his work might perhaps be a threat to their own Even at his most unstable, the High Evolutionary has always demonstrated a paternal love toward even his most flawed creations: he rehabilitated Nobilus, has attempted to heal Count Tagar and the God Pack, and has spared the Man-Beast his life despite multiple attempts to murder him At one point, he offered to (and did) restore the Savage Land after it was destroyed by Terminus, even though it had been created by the very race that had confiscated and then destroyed his own beloved creation, Counter-Earth.\n\n\nIn other media\nThe High Evolutionary appears in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, portrayed by Chukwudi Iwuji [2] [3]

{"title": "Yugoslavia", "content": "\nBackground\nThe concept of Yugoslavia, as a common state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the Illyrian Movement of the 19th century The name was created by the combination of the Slavic words jug (\"south\") and Slaveni/Sloveni (Slavs) Moves towards the formal creation of Yugoslavia accelerated after the 1917 Corfu Declaration between the Yugoslav Committee and the government of the Kingdom of Serbia [11]\n\n\nKingdom of Yugoslavia\nThe country was formed in 1918 immediately after World War I as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by union of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and the Kingdom of Serbia [12] It was commonly referred to at the time as a \"Versailles state\" [13] Later, King Alexander I renamed the country to Yugoslavia in 1929 [14]\n\n\nKing Alexander\nOn 20 June 1928, Serb deputy Puniša Račić shot at five members of the opposition Croatian Peasant Party in the National Assembly, resulting in the death of two deputies on the spot and that of leader Stjepan Radić a few weeks later [15] On 6 January 1929, King Alexander I got rid of the constitution, banned national political parties, assumed executive power, and renamed the country Yugoslavia [14] [16] He hoped to curb separatist tendencies and mitigate nationalist passions He imposed a new constitution and relinquished his dictatorship in 1931 [17] However, Alexander's policies later encountered opposition from other European powers stemming from developments in Italy and Germany, where Fascists and Nazis rose to power, and the Soviet Union, where Joseph Stalin became absolute ruler None of these three regimes favored the policy pursued by Alexander I In fact, Italy and Germany wanted to revise the international treaties signed after World War I, and the Soviets were determined to regain their positions in Europe and pursue a more active international policy [citation needed]\n\n\n1934–1941\nThe international political scene in the late 1930s was marked by growing intolerance between the principal figures, by the aggressive attitude of the totalitarian regimes, and by the certainty that the order set up after World War I was losing its strongholds and its sponsors their strength Supported and pressured by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, Croatian leader Vladko Maček and his party managed the creation of the Banovina of Croatia (Autonomous Region with significant internal self-government) in 1939 [citation needed] The agreement specified that Croatia was to remain part of Yugoslavia, but it was hurriedly building an independent political identity in international relations [citation needed]\n\n\nWorld War II\nAt 5:12 a.m on 6 April 1941, German, Italian and Hungarian forces invaded Yugoslavia [29] The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) bombed Belgrade and other major Yugoslav cities On 17 April, representatives of Yugoslavia's various regions signed an armistice with Germany in Belgrade, ending eleven days of resistance against the invading German forces [30] More than 300,000 Yugoslav officers and soldiers were taken prisoner [31]\n\n\nFPR Yugoslavia\nOn 11 November 1945, elections were held with only the Communist-led People's Front appearing on the ballot, securing all 354 seats On 29 November, while still in exile, King Peter II was deposed by Yugoslavia's Constituent Assembly, and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was declared [42] However, he refused to abdicate Marshal Tito was now in full control, and all opposition elements were eliminated [43]\n\n\nYugoslav–Soviet split and the Non-Alignment Movement\nThe country distanced itself from the Soviets in 1948 (cf Cominform and Informbiro) and started to build its own way to socialism under the political leadership of Josip Broz Tito [46] Accordingly, the constitution was heavily amended to replace the emphasis on democratic centralism with workers' self-management and decentralization [47] The Communist Party was renamed to the League of Communists and adopted Titoism at its congress the previous year [48]\n\n\nSFR Yugoslavia\nOn 7 April 1963, the nation changed its official name to Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Josip Broz Tito was named President for life [50] In the SFRY, each republic and province had its own constitution, supreme court, parliament, president and prime minister [51] At the top of the Yugoslav government were the President (Tito), the federal Prime Minister, and the federal Parliament (a collective Presidency was formed after Tito's death in 1980) [51] [52] Also important were the Communist Party general secretaries for each republic and province, and the general secretary of Central Committee of the Communist Party [51]\n\n\nEthnic tensions and economic crisis\nAfter the Yugoslav Partisans took over the country at the end of WWII, nationalism was banned from being publicly promoted Overall relative peace was retained under Tito's rule, though nationalist protests did occur, but these were usually repressed and nationalist leaders were arrested and some were executed by Yugoslav officials However, the Croatian Spring protests in the 1970s were backed by large numbers of Croats who complained that Yugoslavia remained a Serb hegemony [57]\n\n\nBreakup\nAfter Tito's death on 4 May 1980, ethnic tensions grew in Yugoslavia The legacy of the Constitution of 1974 threw the system of decision-making into a state of paralysis, made all the more hopeless as the conflict of interests became irreconcilable The Albanian majority in Kosovo demanded the status of a republic in the 1981 protests in Kosovo while Serbian authorities suppressed this sentiment and proceeded to reduce the province's autonomy [66]\n\n\nYugoslav Wars\nThe war broke out when the new regimes tried to replace Yugoslav civilian and military forces with secessionist forces When, in August 1990, Croatia attempted to replace police in the Serb-populated Croat Krajina by force, the population first looked for refuge in the Yugoslav Army barracks, while the army remained passive The civilians then organised armed resistance These armed conflicts between the Croatian armed forces (\"police\") and civilians mark the beginning of the Yugoslav war that inflamed the region Similarly, the attempt to replace Yugoslav frontier police by Slovene police forces provoked regional armed conflicts which ended with a minimal number of victims [77]\n\n\nTimeline\nVarious dates are considered the end of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia:\n\n\nNew states\nAs the Yugoslav Wars raged through Bosnia and Croatia, the republics of Serbia and Montenegro, which remained relatively untouched by the war, formed a rump state known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in 1992 The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia aspired to be a sole legal successor to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but those claims were opposed by the other former republics The United Nations also denied its request to automatically continue the membership of the former state [84] In 2000, Milošević was prosecuted for atrocities committed in his ten-year rule in Serbia and the Yugoslav Wars [67] Eventually, after the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević from power as president of the federation in 2000, the country dropped those aspirations, accepted the opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee about shared succession, and reapplied for and gained UN membership on 2 November 2000 [10] From 1992 to 2000, some countries, including the United States, had referred to the FRY as Serbia and Montenegro [85] as they viewed its claim to Yugoslavia's successorship as illegitimate [86] In April 2001, the five successor states extant at the time drafted an Agreement on Succession Issues of the Former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [87] [88] Marking an important transition in its history, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was officially renamed Serbia and Montenegro in 2003 [citation needed]\n\n\nSuccession, 1992–2003\nAs the Yugoslav Wars raged through Bosnia and Croatia,

After Montenegro's independence, Serbia became the legal successor of Serbia and Montenegro, while Montenegro re-applied for membership in international organisations In February 2008, the Republic of Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, leading to an ongoing dispute on whether Kosovo is a legally recognised state Republic of Kosovo is not a member of the United Nations, but a number of states, including the United States and various members of the European Union, have recognised Republic of Kosovo as a sovereign state [90]\n\n\nYugo-nostalgia\nRemembrance of the time of the joint state and its positive attributes is referred to as Yugo-nostalgia.\nMany aspects of Yugo-nostalgia refer to the socialist system and the sense of social security it provided There are still people from the former Yugoslavia who self-identify as Yugoslavs; this identifier is commonly seen in demographics relating to ethnicity in today's independent states [92]\n\n\nDemographics\nYugoslavia had always been a home to a very diverse population, not only in terms of national affiliation, but also religious affiliation Of the many religions, Islam, Roman Catholicism, Judaism, and Protestantism, as well as various Eastern Orthodox faiths, composed the religions of Yugoslavia, comprising over 40 in all The religious demographics of Yugoslavia changed dramatically since World War II A census taken in 1921 and later in 1948 show that 99% of the population appeared to be deeply involved with their religion and practices With postwar government programs of modernisation and urbanisation, the percentage of religious believers took a dramatic plunge Connections between religious belief and nationality posed a serious threat to the post-war Communist government's policies on national unity and state structure [93] Although Yugoslavia became a de facto atheist state, in contrast to other socialist states of the time, Catholic Church maintained an active role in society of Yugoslavia, [94] the Holy See normalized its relations with Yugoslavia by 1967 and worked together on stopping the Vietnam War [95] Likewise, the Serbian Orthodox Church received favorable treatment, and Yugoslavia did not engage in anti-religious campaigns to the extent of other countries in the Eastern Bloc [96]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe three major languages in Yugoslavia were Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian, and Macedonian [99] Serbo-Croatian, the only language taught all across former Yugoslavia, remained the second language of many Slovenes [100] and Macedonians, especially those born during the time of Yugoslavia After the breakup of Yugoslavia, Serbo-Croatian has lost its unitary codification and its official unitary status and has since diverged into four standardized varieties of what remains one pluricentric language: Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian [citation needed]\n\n\nSee also\n44°49′N 20°27′E﻿ / ﻿44.817°N 20.450°E﻿ / 44.817; 20.450\n\n\nNotes\n44°49′N 20°27′E﻿ / ﻿44.817°N

Serb hegemony [57]\n\n\nBreakup\nAfter Tito's death on 4 May 1980, ethnic tensions grew in Yugoslavia The legacy of the Constitution of 1974 threw the system of decision-making into a state of paralysis, made all the more hopeless as the conflict of interests became irreconcilable The Albanian majority in Kosovo demanded the status of a republic in the 1981 protests in Kosovo while Serbian authorities suppressed this sentiment and proceeded to reduce the province's autonomy [66]\n\n\nYugoslav Wars\nThe war broke out when the new regimes tried to replace Yugoslav civilian and military forces with secessionist forces When, in August 1990, Croatia attempted to replace police in the Serb-populated Croat Krajina by force, the population first looked for refuge in the Yugoslav Army barracks, while the army remained passive The civilians then organised armed resistance These armed conflicts between the Croatian armed forces (\"police\") and civilians mark the beginning of the Yugoslav war that inflamed the region Similarly, the attempt to replace Yugoslav frontier police by Slovene police forces provoked regional armed conflicts which ended with a minimal number of victims [77]\n\n\nTimeline\nVarious dates are considered the end of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia:\n\n\nNew states\nAs the Yugoslav Wars raged through Bosnia and Croatia, the republics of Serbia and Montenegro, which remained relatively untouched by the war, formed a rump state known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in 1992 The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia aspired to be a sole legal successor to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but those claims were opposed by the other former republics The United Nations also denied its request to automatically continue the membership of the former state [84] In 2000, Milošević was prosecuted for atrocities committed in his ten-year rule in Serbia and the Yugoslav Wars [67] Eventually, after the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević from power as president of the federation in 2000, the country dropped those aspirations, accepted the opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee about shared succession, and reapplied for and gained UN membership on 2 November 2000 [10] From 1992 to 2000, some countries, including the United States, had referred to the FRY as Serbia and Montenegro [85] as they viewed its claim to Yugoslavia's successorship as illegitimate [86] In April 2001, the five successor states extant at the time drafted an Agreement on Succession Issues of the Former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [87] [88] Marking an important transition in its history, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was officially renamed Serbia and Montenegro in 2003 [citation needed]\n\n\nSuccession, 1992–2003\nAs the Yugoslav Wars raged through Bosnia and Croatia, the republics of Serbia and Montenegro, which remained relatively untouched by the war, formed a rump state known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in 1992 The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia aspired to be a sole legal successor to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but those claims were opposed by the other former republics The United Nations also denied its request to automatically continue the membership of the former state [84] In 2000, Milošević was prosecuted for atrocities committed in his ten-year

drafted an Agreement on Succession Issues of the Former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [87] [88] Marking an important transition in its history, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was officially renamed Serbia and Montenegro in 2003 [citation needed]\n\n\nSuccession, 2006–present\nIn June 2006, Montenegro became an independent nation after the results of a May 2006 referendum, therefore rendering Serbia and Montenegro no longer existent After Montenegro's independence, Serbia became the legal successor of Serbia and Montenegro, while Montenegro re-applied for membership in international organisations In February 2008, the Republic of Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, leading to an ongoing dispute on whether Kosovo is a legally recognised state Republic of Kosovo is not a member of the United Nations, but a number of states, including the United States and various members of the European Union, have recognised Republic of Kosovo as a sovereign state [90]\n\n\nYugo-nostalgia\nRemembrance of the time of the joint state and its positive attributes is referred to as Yugo-nostalgia.\nMany aspects of Yugo-nostalgia refer to the socialist system and the sense of social security it provided There are still people from the former Yugoslavia who self-identify as Yugoslavs; this identifier is commonly seen in demographics relating to ethnicity in today's independent states [92]\n\n\nDemographics\nYugoslavia had always been a home to a very diverse population, not only in terms of national affiliation, but also religious affiliation Of the many religions, Islam, Roman Catholicism, Judaism, and Protestantism, as well as various Eastern Orthodox faiths, composed the religions of Yugoslavia, comprising over 40 in all The religious demographics of Yugoslavia changed dramatically since World War II A census taken in 1921 and later in 1948 show that 99% of the population appeared to be deeply involved with their religion and practices With postwar government programs of modernisation and urbanisation, the percentage of religious believers took a dramatic plunge Connections between religious belief and nationality posed a serious threat to the post-war Communist government's policies on national unity and state structure [93] Although Yugoslavia became a de facto atheist state, in contrast to other socialist states of the time, Catholic Church maintained an active role in society of Yugoslavia, [94] the Holy See normalized its relations with Yugoslavia by 1967 and worked together on stopping the Vietnam War [95] Likewise, the Serbian Orthodox Church received favorable treatment, and Yugoslavia did not engage in anti-religious campaigns to the extent of other countries in the Eastern Bloc [96]\n\n\nLanguages\nThe three major languages in Yugoslavia were Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian, and Macedonian [99] Serbo-Croatian, the only language taught all across former Yugoslavia, remained the second language of many Slovenes [100] and Macedonians, especially those born during the time of Yugoslavia After the breakup of Yugoslavia, Serbo-Croatian has lost its unitary codification and its official unitary status and has since diverged into four standardized varieties of what remains one pluricentric language: Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian [citation needed]\n\n\nSee also\n44°49′N 20°27′E﻿ / ﻿44.817°N

Ronaldo scored ten minutes into his debut against Vitesse, and scored a brace on his home debut against Go Ahead Eagles [25] He scored 30 league goals in his first season in the Netherlands, which included seven braces and a hat-trick against Utrecht [25] After scoring a hat-trick in PSV's game against Bayer Leverkusen in the 1994–95 UEFA Cup, Leverkusen striker and Germany World Cup winner Rudi Völler stated in a post match press conference, \"Never in my life have I seen an 18-year-old play in this way.\" [24] His dribbles from midfield caught the attention of many in the sport, with future Barcelona teammate Luis Enrique stating, \"I'd seen him on television at PSV and thought ‘wow' Then he came to Barcelona He's the most spectacular player I've ever seen He did things I'd never seen before We're now used to seeing Messi dribble past six players, but not then Ronaldo was a beast.\" [26]\n\n\nBarcelona\nDuring his spell at PSV, Ronaldo attracted the attention of both Inter Milan and Barcelona It was Barcelona that was willing to pay the then-world record fee of $19.5 million, and he joined the club on 17 July 1996 [29] According to manager Bobby Robson, he signed an eight-year contract, and would play up front alone [30]\n\n\nInter Milan\nRonaldo's time at Barcelona lasted one season, as there were problems with the renegotiation of his contract [29] Barcelona thought there was an agreement in place, with Barcelona president Josep Lluís Núñez saying \"He's ours for life\", but when the parties reconvened the following day, the agreement collapsed, with Núñez admitting: \"It's all over, Ronaldo is going\" [29] Speaking to ESPN, Ronaldo stated, \"I had reached an agreement to renew my contract just a month before that season finished, but a week later

on the opening day of the 1997–98 season against Brescia [45]\n\n\n1999–2002: Recurring injury problems\n\"The knee injuries suffered at Inter Milan took away the explosiveness that made him possibly the greatest young footballer of all time, a futuristic fusion of speed, strength and skill That is not to belittle Ronaldo's achievements in the second half of his career, when he scored eight goals in a single World Cup  [in 2002] and became the first Ronaldo to receive a standing ovation at Old Trafford  [in 2003], but it is the memory of the early years that puts mist in the eyes of grown men.\"\n\n\nReal Madrid\nHaving signed for Real Madrid for €46 million, his jersey sales broke all records on the first day [66] Ronaldo was part of the Galácticos era of global stars signed by the club every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Roberto Carlos and David Beckham [67] He was sidelined through injury until October 2002 which further fuelled fan anticipation [68]

in 2003, scoring in both finals [69]\n\n\n2005–2007: Final two seasons\nIn his final two seasons at Real Madrid, Ronaldo missed a number of games with injuries and weight issues, and with the acquisition of Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2006, he grew further out of favour with the manager Fabio Capello [77] Speaking in 2017 on Ronaldo's weight issues and lack of fitness at Madrid, in addition to his ability, Capello summed up the conflicting emotions he has with the Brazilian: \"The most difficult player to handle was the best I coached: Ronaldo, il Fenomeno.\" [78]\n\n\nAC Milan\nOn 18 January 2007, it was reported that Ronaldo agreed terms with Milan for a transfer of €8.05 million [85] Departing Real Madrid, having been the club's leading goalscorer for all of his four full

a one-year deal with Flamengo's league rival Corinthians [109] The announcement received much publicity in the Brazilian press about his choice of Corinthians over Flamengo, since Ronaldo publicly

that will let me continue my career.\" [109]\n\n\n2011: Retirement\nIn February 2010, Ronaldo signed a contract extension with Corinthians that would keep him with the club until the end of 2011, and said he would then retire [117] [118] Commenting on his weight issues following this announcement, Brian Homewood of The Guardian stated: \"Sadly, Ronaldo's celebrity is now more of a draw than his skills on the pitch – Coldplay, Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres and actor Hugh Jackman have all visited São Paulo to get a picture with the roly‑poly star.\" [119]\n\n\nInternational career\nRonaldo made his international debut for Brazil on 23 March 1994 in a friendly match in Recife against Argentina [130] His first senior goal for Brazil came on 4 May 1994 in a 3–0 friendly win

[133] He was then known as Ronaldinho (\"little Ronaldo\" in Portuguese), because Ronaldo Rodrigues de Jesus, his older teammate, was also called Ronaldo and later nicknamed Ronaldão (\"big Ronaldo\") to further distinguish them [134] Another player, Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, now widely known as Ronaldinho, was called Ronaldinho Gaúcho when he joined the Brazil team in 1999 [135] [136]\n\n\nAtlanta '96 and Copa América\nAt the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Ronaldo used the name Ronaldinho again, since centre-back Ronaldo Guiaro, two years his senior, was one of his teammates Brazil went on to win the bronze medal [137] Ronaldo also represented Brazil in the 1995 Copa América (finishing second) and won both the 1997 and the 1999 editions of the tournament He was named player of the tournament in 1997, was the top scorer in 1999 and scored in the finals of both, against Bolivia in 1997 and Uruguay in 1999 [138] [139] [140] He also took part in the friendly Tournoi de France in 1997, preceding the 1998 FIFA World Cup, scoring a goal as Brazil became runners-up Ronaldo starred alongside Romário, dubbed the Ro-Ro attack, at the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, helping Brazil win their first ever Confederations Cup title where he finished as the third-highest scorer with 4 goals, scoring a hat-trick against Australia in the final [141] On the combination of Ronaldo and Romário, Will Sharp writes: \"...to the elation of all those fortunate enough to have watched them, they found themselves together, fated with the opportunity to forge one of the most outrageous offensive pairings the game has ever seen Their partnership was brief but it was inexplicably brilliant.\" [142]\n\n\n1998 FIFA World Cup\n\"The way he combined powerhouse athleticism with a poetic touch made for an awesome sight In the 1990s, in his physical pomp, in his free-flowing prime, there was nothing remotely like him By the time the 1998 World Cup came along his reputation had extended to the point of fully formed marvel A happening.\"\n\n\n2002 FIFA World Cup\nPrior to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo had barely played since rupturing the cruciate ligament in his right knee in April 2000, and he missed Brazil's entire qualification campaign where, in his absence, the team had been poor [156]\nTim Vickery writes, \"Without Ronaldo, Brazil were a shambles, fortunate even to get to the tournament With him, it was a different story.\" [157] In a remarkable comeback from injury that had threatened his career, Ronaldo led Brazil to their record fifth World Cup title, receiving the Golden Boot as top scorer with eight goals [158] Many publications regarded his personal triumph as \"redemption\" for what occurred at the previous World Cup [132] [158] [159] [160] Ronaldo spoke about his obsession with lifting the World Cup trophy, having missed out in 1998 \"I used to visualise the trophy in front of my eyes and imagine what a wonderful feeling it must be to hold it up in the air It was a fabulous feeling actually to hold it in my hands and kiss it.\" [133] Dubbed the \"three R's\", Ronaldo starred in a formidable attack alongside Rivaldo and Ronaldinho, and the trio were named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team [132] [161]\n\n\n2006 FIFA World Cup\nOn 2 June 2004, Ronaldo scored an unusual hat-trick of penalties for Brazil against arch-rivals Argentina in a 2006 World Cup qualifying match, which put them top of the group [172] With 10 goals in 15 games, including a goal against Venezuela in the last game to secure first place, Ronaldo was the South American top scorer in Brazil's qualifying campaign [173] Prior to the tournament, questions were asked of his weight and fitness, [174] [175] but was declared fit for Brazil's opening match with Croatia [176]\n\n\nFarewell match and sporadic appearances\nIn February 2011, it was announced that Ronaldo would be given one last match for Brazil, a friendly against Romania in São Paulo on 7 June 2011, five years after his last match with the national team [191] Brazilian Football Confederation official Ricardo Teixeira stated that it was fitting that his final game should take place in Brazil while representing his nation [192]\n\n\nStyle of play and legacy\nRonaldo is regarded as one of the greatest and most complete forwards of all time [69] [77] [207] Nicknamed Il (or O) Fenomeno (the phenomenon), [208] he was a prolific goalscorer, and despite being more of an individualistic attacker, he was also capable of providing assists for his teammates, due to his vision, passing and crossing ability [77] [209] [210] He was an extremely powerful, fast, and technical player, with excellent movement, as well as being a composed finisher [211] [212] [213] Highly regarded for his technical ability, Ronaldo was able to use both feet, despite being naturally right footed, [214] [215] and is considered one of the most skillful dribblers in the game [216] Ronaldo would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal, [69] [77] with Rob Smyth writing, \"he played like every attack had a 10-second deadline. he would explode into life with no warning for defenders.\" [27] He frequently beat several players when dribbling at speed, and excelled in one on one situations, due to his ball control, acceleration, agility, balance and nimble footwork in his prime [69] [77] [207] [216]\n\n\nClub ownership\nIn September 2018, Ronaldo became the majority owner of La Liga club Real Valladolid after buying a 51% controlling stake in the club for €30 million [232] [233] At his unveiling as the club's new owner at Valladolid city hall, Ronaldo stated, \"I have gone through many stages in my training in football to prepare for this Football

He began his football journey at the local club Espanyol, where he joined the youth academy at the age of nine. However, he soon moved to Barcelona's youth academy, where he would spend the majority of his formative years.\n\n**Dinamo Zagreb**\n\nIn a surprise move, Olmo joined Dinamo Zagreb on July 31, 2014, at the age of 16. This decision marked the beginning of a new chapter in his career, and he quickly established himself as a talented young player. He made his first-team debut for Dinamo Zagreb on February 7, 2015, coming on as a substitute in a 2-1 win over Lokomotiva Zagreb.\n\nOlmo's breakthrough season began on September 22, 2015, when he scored his first goal for the club in a 7-1 win over Oštrc Zlatar in the Croatian Cup. This goal marked the beginning of a successful period for Olmo, who would go on to become a key player for Dinamo Zagreb.\n\n**RB Leipzig**\n\nOn January 25, 2020, Olmo moved to Bundesliga club RB Leipzig, signing a four-year contract. This transfer marked a significant step up in his career, and he quickly adapted to the demands of the Bundesliga. Olmo made his debut for RB Leipzig on February 1, 2020, coming on as a substitute in a 2-2 draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n\nOlmo's first goal for RB Leipzig came on February 4, 2020, in a DFB-Pokal defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt. He scored the only goal in a 3-1 loss, coming on as a substitute at half-time.\n\n**Return to Barcelona**\n\nOn August 9, 2024, Olmo returned to his youth career club Barcelona, signing a six-year contract. This transfer marked a significant homecoming for Olmo, who would return to the club where he began his professional career.\n\n**International Career**\n\nOlmo has represented Spain at various youth levels, including the under-17 and under-21 teams. He made his debut for the Spain under-17 team in 2015, participating in the European Championship in Bulgaria. Olmo scored a penalty in the quarter-finals against Germany, but Spain ultimately lost to England in a playoff for a World Cup spot.\n\nOlmo's desire to switch to Croatia at the international level was reported by Dinamo Zagreb director Tomislav Svetina in 2017. However, he ultimately chose to represent Spain, making his debut for the Spain under-21 team in October 2018.\n\n**Senior Team**\n\nOlmo earned his first senior team call-up in November 2019, for Euro 2020 qualifiers against Malta and Romania. He made his debut on November 15, 2019, coming on as a substitute in a 7-0 win over Malta. Olmo scored three minutes after entering the game, becoming the 13th player to score on their debut for Spain.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nOlmo's father, Miquel, is a retired footballer who played professionally for lower-league teams. His older brother, Carlos, is also a footballer who plays as a defender and has spent several years in Croatia, playing for Dinamo's reserves and Lokomotiva Zagreb.\n\nOlmo speaks Croatian fluently, having grown up in Croatia and played for Dinamo Zagreb for several years. This linguistic ability has no doubt helped him in his career, allowing him to communicate effectively with his teammates and coaches.\n\n**Career Statistics**\n\n| Club | Season | League | Cup | Continental | Total |\n|  | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals |\n| Dinamo Zagreb | 2014-2015 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| Dinamo Zagreb | 2015-2016 | 11 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 15 | 3 |\n| Dinamo Zagreb | 2016-2017 | 25 | 5 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 28 | 5 |\n| Dinamo Zagreb | 2017-2018 | 29 | 6 | 4 | 2 | 6 | 1 | 39 | 9 |\n| Dinamo Zagreb | 2018-2019 | 34 | 10 | 2 | 0 | 10 | 2 | 46 | 12 |\n| RB Leipzig | 2019-2020 | 14 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 0 | 19 | 3 |\n| RB Leipzig | 2020-2021 | 32 | 6 | 3 | 1 | 8 | 1 | 43 | 8 |\n| RB Leipzig | 2021-2022 | 35 | 11 | 4 | 1 | 13 | 4 | 52 | 16 |\n| Barcelona | 2022-2023 | 28 | 8 | 2 | 0 | 12 | 4 | 42 | 12 |\n| Barcelona | 2023-2024 | 29 | 10 | 1 | 1 | 9 | 2 | 39 | 13 |\n| Barcelona | 2024-2025 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\n**Honours**\n\n* Croatian First Football League: 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2017-2018\n* Croatian Football Cup: 2014-2015, 2017-2018\n* Croatian Super Cup: 2014, 2016, 2018\n* Bundesliga runner-up: 2020-2021\n* DFB-Pokal runner-up: 2020-2021\n* UEFA Champions League runner-up: 2020-2021\n* UEFA Super Cup runner-up: 2021\n* FIFA Club World Cup runner-up: 2021", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dani_Olmo\" following this outline:\n\n\nClub career\nBorn in Terrassa, Barcelona, Catalonia, Olmo arrived in Barcelona's youth academy aged nine, from neighbours Espanyol [2] [5]\n\n\nEarly career\nBorn in Terrassa, Barcelona, Catalonia, Olmo arrived in Barcelona's youth academy aged nine, from neighbours Espanyol [2] [5]\n\n\nDinamo Zagreb\nIn a surprise move, Olmo joined Dinamo Zagreb on 31 July 2014, aged 16 [6] He made his first team debut against Lokomotiva Zagreb on 7 February 2015, as a 76th-minute substitute for Paulo Machado in a 2–1 home win [7] On 22 September, he scored his first goal in a 7–1 win at Oštrc Zlatar in the first round of the cup [8]\n\n\nRB Leipzig\nOn 25 January 2020, Olmo moved to Bundesliga club RB Leipzig, signing a four-year contract [21] [22] He made his debut a week later, in a 2–2 draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach coming on for Tyler Adams in 69th minute [23] On 4 February he scored the only goal in a 3–1 DFB-Pokal defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt, having come on for Amadou Haidara at half time [24]\n\n\nReturn to Barcelona\nOn 9 August 2024, Olmo returned to his youth career club Barcelona, signing a six-year contract in a deal reportedly worth in the region of €60 million [33] [34]\n\n\nInternational career\nOlmo was part of the Spanish squad at the 2015 European Under-17 Championship in Bulgaria;

aerial threat on set-pieces While he usually played as a centre-back, he was also used as a defensive midfielder on occasion at international level However, despite his defensive abilities, he also drew criticism in the media due to his tendency to pick up cards, as he often showed violent or unsportsmanlike behaviour on the pitch, in particular during his time at Real Madrid, which included diving, [71] and violent challenges on the pitch [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] However, despite his reputation, he has also been recognised by pundits, players, and managers for his

However, according to the player's father, in 2006, he was contacted by head coach Dunga about a possible call-up, which he declined, stating that once he obtained Portuguese citizenship, he would join its national team. He became naturalized in August 2007 and, on 30 August, was named in the Portugal squad for the first time in view of a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier against Poland.\n\n## 2008-2014: Naturalisation and early international career\n\nPepe made his international debut on 21 November 2008, in a 0-0 draw against Finland.

It is characterized by a distinctive rash on the hands and feet, as well as sores in the mouth and on the lips. HFMD is often mild and self-limiting, but in rare cases can lead to serious complications.\n\n## Signs and Symptoms\n\nCommon constitutional signs and symptoms of the HFMD include fever, nausea, vomiting, feeling tired, generalized discomfort, loss of appetite, and irritability in infants and toddlers. Skin lesions frequently develop in the form of a rash of flat discolored spots and bumps which may be followed by vesicular sores with blisters on palms of the hands, soles of the feet, buttocks, and sometimes on the lips. The rash is rarely itchy for children, but can be extremely itchy for adults. Painful facial ulcers, blisters, or lesions may also develop in or around the nose or mouth. HFMD usually resolves on its own after 7–10 days. Most cases of the disease are relatively harmless, but complications including encephalitis, meningitis, and paralysis that mimics the neurological symptoms of polio can occur.\n\n## Cause\n\nThe viruses that cause the disease are of the Picornaviridae family. Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of HFMD. Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is the second-most common cause. Many other strains of coxsackievirus and enterovirus can also be responsible.\n\n## Transmission\n\nHFMD is highly contagious and is transmitted by nasopharyngeal secretions such as saliva or nasal mucus, by direct contact, or by fecal–oral transmission. It is possible to be infectious for days to weeks after the symptoms have resolved.\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nA diagnosis usually can be made by the presenting signs and symptoms alone. If the diagnosis is unclear, a throat swab or stool specimen may be taken to identify the virus by culture. The common incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from three to six days. Early detection of HFMD is important in preventing an outbreak in the pediatric population.\n\n## Prevention\n\nPreventive measures include avoiding direct contact with infected individuals (including keeping infected children home from school), proper cleaning of shared utensils, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and proper hand hygiene. These measures have been shown to be effective in decreasing the transmission of the viruses responsible for HFMD.\n\n## Vaccine\n\nA vaccine known as the EV71 vaccine is available to prevent HFMD in China. No vaccine is currently available in the United States.\n\n## Treatment\n\nMedications are usually not needed as hand, foot, and mouth disease is a viral disease that typically resolves on its own. Currently, there is no specific curative treatment for hand, foot and mouth disease. Disease management typically focuses on achieving symptomatic relief. Pain from the sores may be eased with the use of analgesic medications. Infection in older children, adolescents, and adults is typically mild and lasts approximately 1 week, but may occasionally run a longer course. Fever reducers can help decrease body temperature.\n\n## Complications\n\nComplications from the viral infections that cause HFMD are rare, but require immediate medical treatment if present. HFMD infections caused by Enterovirus 71 tend to be more severe and are more likely to have neurologic or cardiac complications including death than infections caused by Coxsackievirus A16. Viral or aseptic meningitis can occur with HFMD in rare cases and is characterized by fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain. The condition is usually mild and clears without treatment; however, hospitalization for a short time may be needed. Other serious complications of HFMD include encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), or flaccid paralysis in rare circumstances.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease most commonly occurs in children under the age of 10 and more often under the age of 5, but it can also affect adults with varying symptoms. It tends to occur in outbreaks during the spring, summer, and autumn seasons. This is believed to be due to heat and humidity improving spread. HFMD is more common in rural areas than urban areas; however, socioeconomic status and hygiene levels need to be considered. Poor hygiene is a risk factor for HFMD.\n\n## Outbreaks\n\nAn outbreak of an illness referred to as tomato fever or tomato flu was identified in the Kollam district on May 6, 2022. The illness is endemic to Kerala, India and gets its name because of the red and round blisters it causes, which look like tomatoes. The disease may be a new variant of the viral HFMD or an effect of chikungunya or dengue fever. Flu may be a misnomer.\n\n## History\n\nHFMD cases were first described clinically in Canada and New Zealand in 1957. The disease was termed \"Hand Foot and Mouth Disease\", by Thomas Henry Flewett, after a similar outbreak in 1960.\n\n## Research\n\nNovel antiviral agents to prevent and treat infection with the viruses responsible for HFMD are currently under development.

however, socioeconomic status and hygiene levels need to be considered [28] Poor hygiene is a risk factor for HFMD [29] [better source needed]\n\n\nOutbreaks\nAn outbreak of an illness referred to as tomato fever or tomato flu was identified in the Kollam district on May 6, 2022 [53] The illness is endemic to Kerala, India and gets its name because of the red and round blisters it causes, which look like tomatoes [53] The disease may be a new variant of the viral HFMD or an effect of chikungunya or dengue fever [53] [54] [55] Flu may be a misnomer [54] [56]\n\n\nIndia 2022\nAn outbreak of an illness referred to as tomato fever or tomato flu was identified in the Kollam district on May 6, 2022 [53] The illness is endemic to Kerala, India and gets its name because of the red and round blisters it causes, which look like tomatoes [53] The disease may be a new variant of the viral HFMD or an effect of chikungunya or dengue fever [53] [54] [55] Flu may be a misnomer [54] [56]\n\n\nHistory\nHFMD cases were first described clinically in Canada and New Zealand in 1957 [19] The disease was termed \"Hand Foot and Mouth Disease\", by Thomas Henry Flewett, after a similar outbreak in 1960 [58] [59]\n\n\nResearch\nNovel antiviral agents to prevent and treat infection with the viruses responsible for HFMD are currently under development Preliminary studies have shown inhibitors of the EV-71 viral capsid to have potent antiviral activity [13]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

formed on The X Factor in 2011. The group consists of Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, and Jade Thirlwall. They were the first girl group to win the competition, and since then, they have become one of the most successful and influential girl groups in the world.\n\n# History\n\n## Formation and The X Factor\n\nIn 2011, Edwards, Thirlwall, Pinnock, and Nelson individually auditioned successfully as soloists for the eighth series of the UK version of The X Factor in front of judges Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow, Tulisa, and Kelly Rowland. However, they failed the first challenge of the \"bootcamp\" section. They were allowed another chance to compete when they were placed in two separate ensembles by the judges during the \"group bootcamp\" stage, with Edwards and Nelson in four-member group Faux Pas and Thirlwall and Pinnock in three-member group Orion. Both groups failed to make it through to the next stage. A later decision by the judges recalled two members from each group to form the four-piece group Rhythmix, sending them through to the \"judges' houses\" section. Footage released in November 2022 revealed that Rowland alone was the judge who formed the group.\n\n## 2011–2012: Formation and The X Factor\n\nIn 2011, Edwards, Thirlwall, Pinnock, and Nelson individually auditioned successfully as soloists for the eighth series of the UK version of The X Factor in front of judges Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow, Tulisa, and Kelly Rowland.

Footage released in November 2022 revealed that Rowland alone was the judge who formed the group.\n\n## 2012–2013: DNA and international breakthrough\n\nOn 25 January 2012, Little Mix made an appearance at the National Television Awards and performed the En Vogue song \"Don't Let Go (Love)\". They also accompanied fellow judges Gary Barlow and their mentor Tulisa Contostavlos on stage to receive the Best Talent Show award that had been won by The X Factor. In May 2012, Little Mix reportedly signed a deal with Vivid and Bravado to release signature products including dolls, puzzles, accessories, and games. Prior to their debut single release, the group covered an a cappella version of Beyoncé's \"End of Time\" and uploaded it on YouTube; the cover was publicly praised, especially for the group's impressive harmonies. Later in August, they also uploaded another cover, this time an acoustic cover of \"We Are Young\" by Fun ft Janelle Monáe, which again received positive feedback, generally for the group's harmonies. On 1 June, a snippet of their debut single \"Wings\" previewed on chat show Alan Carr: Chatty Man before its later release date in August.\n\n## 2013–2014: Salute and \"Word Up!\"\n\nIn March 2013, Little Mix began their first promotional campaign in the US. In an interview with Digital Spy in March 2013, they stated that they wanted their second album to have a more R&B sound. Nelson added: \"I personally want to put a lot more dancey stuff in there. As in, one of the songs that comes on in a club that makes you want to dance. Not that David Guetta sound, but more R&B – a bit like Eve and Gwen Stefani's 'Let Me Blow Ya Mind'.\" They also revealed that they would be starting to write material for the new album in the coming months. On 4 October, they uploaded a video to their official YouTube page, announcing that their second album would be called Salute and would be available for pre-order on 7 October. The album was released on 11 November 2013 in the United Kingdom and was released in the United States on 4 February 2014. Throughout the recording process, Little Mix worked with several producers, including TMS, Future Cut, Fred Ball, Duvall, and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. The album was largely co-written by Little Mix, who stated that they were more involved in the development of this album than with their debut.\n\n## 2015–2016: Get Weird\n\nAt the 2015 Brit Awards, the group confirmed that their album was completed, describing it as having a \"whole new sound\" and projecting the release for sometime in 2015. Having written over 100 songs for their forthcoming album, in May 2015 Little Mix released the lead single \"Black Magic\" from their third studio album. The song debuted at number one in the UK and remained at the top of the chart for three weeks, becoming the first single by a girl group to do so since Sugababes's \"About You Now\" in October 2007. The single also reached number 3 in Ireland, number 4 in Belgium (Flanders), number 5 in Israel, number 8 in Australia, and number 67 in the US, becoming their highest-peaking single on Billboard Hot 100. The group performed the song for the first time in June 2015 for Capital's Summertime Ball at the Wembley Stadium along with some of their previous hits. \"Black Magic\" was also performed the song at the Teen Choice Awards in August 2015, after they received the award as Breakout Artist. Since then, \"Black Magic\" has been certified Gold in the US for sales of 500,000, Platinum in Canada for sales of 80,000, and double Platinum both in Australia and the UK for sales of 140,000 and 1,200,000 respectively. Little Mix also co-wrote Britney Spears' single \"Pretty Girls\", which was also released in May 2015.\n\n## 2016–2019: Glory Days and LM5\n\nOn 21 June 2016, it was revealed that the group had begun work on their fourth studio album; they later confirmed that they would be releasing new music \"before Christmas\". In an interview at V Festival in Chelmsford, the group announced that the lead single from their fourth studio album would be released in October 2016. On 13 October 2016, Little Mix announced the song's title as \"Shout Out to My Ex\" and that their fourth studio album would be called Glory Days. \"Shout Out to My Ex\" was released on 16 October 2016, following the first live performance of the song on The X Factor. The song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming their fourth chart-topping single there. It sold 67,000 downloads in its opening week, becoming the biggest opening week download sales for a song in 2016 in the UK.\n\n# Artistry\n\nLittle Mix are mainly a pop, R&B, and dance-pop girl group, with influences from genres including tropical house, Latin pop, and electronic music. Their lyrics are often centred around feminism, gender equality, LGBT rights, body positivity, and sexism. All three members possess a three-octave soprano vocal range.\n\n# Public image and impact\n\nSince winning the British version of The X Factor in 2011, Little Mix have gone onto to become one of the show's most successful acts. During their decade together before the group announced their hiatus in 2021, they were often labelled as \"the biggest girl group in the world\". The Times cited them \"as the most successful girl group since the Spice Girls\", and Variety described them as the biggest girl group since the Spice Girls. The group have been named as one of the greatest girl groups of all time, with Billboard naming them as one of the most successful girl groups of the 10s decade. In 2022, Us Weekly magazine named them as one of the best girl groups of all time.\n\n# Other ventures\n\nAfter Little Mix's 2020 summer tour was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 30 July 2020, the group announced on their social media that they would be performing a virtual concert, titled Little Mix Uncancelled (stylised as 'Little Mix UNCancelled').

The show is based on the British series of the same name, which premiered in 2018. The Circle takes place in a large apartment building where a group of contestants, known as \"players,\" live in separate apartments and interact with each other through a social media app called the Circle.\n\nFormat\n--------\n\nA number of players move into separate apartments within the same building. While playing, contestants are kept isolated from the outside world and each other, and are not allowed to meet or communicate with each other face-to-face. Instead, they communicate via text on a specially-designed social media application that — through photographs, biographies, and text chat — gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as catfishing; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.\n\nEach player starts out the game by creating a profile, which includes sharing their age, relationship status, a short bio, and one photo to use as their profile picture. Every day, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile. Throughout the competition, the Circle app remains the only way players can communicate with each other.\n\nEpisodes\n---------\n\nThe show is divided into episodes, each lasting approximately 45 minutes. The episodes typically follow the same format, with each player sharing their thoughts and experiences throughout the day. The show also features challenges and rewards, which players can participate in to earn points and stay in the game. The challenges often require players to work together, which can lead to interesting conflicts and alliances.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe idea for The Circle was born out of a desire to create a reality TV show that explores the impact of social media on our lives. The show's creator, Tim Harcourt, wanted to create a format that would allow players to interact with each other in a way that feels authentic, but also allows them to present themselves in a way that may not reflect their true personality. The show's producers worked with a team of experts to develop the concept and format, which has been praised for its innovative approach to reality TV.\n\nConcept\n--------\n\nThe Circle is based on the idea that people present themselves online in a way that may not reflect their true personality. The show takes this concept and turns it into a game, where players must navigate the complexities of online relationships and alliances. The show's format allows players to create their own profiles, which can be used to manipulate others and gain an advantage in the game. The show's producers have praised the format for its ability to encourage players to be creative and authentic in their online interactions.\n\nDevelopment\n------------\n\nThe British version of The Circle premiered in 2018 and was a huge success, with a second season being commissioned just a few months after the first season ended. The show's success led to international interest, and Netflix announced its partnership with All3Media to create three international versions of The Circle, including the American version. The American version of The Circle premiered in 2020 and has been praised for its innovative format and engaging gameplay.\n\nProduction\n------------\n\nEach apartment that the players live in is equipped with screens in every room, allowing players to communicate with each other throughout the day. The production team uses a combination of cameras and microphones to capture the players' interactions, which are then edited into episodes for broadcast. The show's producers have praised the production team for their ability to capture the players' emotions and interactions in a way that feels authentic and engaging.\n\nThe Circle app\n--------------\n\nThe Circle app is the central hub of the show, where players interact with each other and share their thoughts and experiences. The app allows players to create their profiles, share status updates, and participate in challenges and rewards. The app is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for players to navigate and communicate with each other.\n\nApartment building\n-----------------\n\nSeasons 1-5 of The Circle US were shot entirely in the same apartment building in Salford, England, as the other international versions except for the first series of the original UK show. The apartment building is always prepared with twelve furnished and ready-to-use apartments for the players to live in. The building also has an exercise room and a rooftop lounge, which are also outfitted with cameras and television screens. One room in the building, called \"the testimonial room,\" is the room players go to after they are blocked to create their goodbye video to the remaining players. On the outside of the building is a large, lit up circle made of a roughly 82-foot (25-meter) diameter aluminum track with LED lights strung through and around the circle.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThe Circle is a unique and engaging reality TV show that explores the complexities of online relationships and alliances. The show's format is innovative and allows players to create their own profiles, which can be used to manipulate others and gain an advantage in the game. The show's producers have praised the format for its ability to encourage players to be creative and authentic in their online interactions.

in the papal household [4] The family lived inside Vatican City and, according to her older brother Pietro, the children had the free run of the Vatican Gardens [5]\n\n\nChronology\nOrlandi usually travelled by bus to the music school, located in Piazza di Sant'Apollinare, next to Piazza Navona She would get off after a few stops and walk the last few hundred metres [6] Upon leaving home around 4:00 p.m on 22 June 1983, Orlandi was late to class and the weather was extremely hot She asked Pietro to drive her to school, but he had other commitments \"I've gone over it so many times, telling

weather was extremely hot She asked Pietro to drive her to school, but he had other commitments \"I've gone over it so many times, telling myself if only I had accompanied her maybe it wouldn't have happened\", he recalled decades later [4]\n\n\nSubsequent events\nIn the first days after the disappearance, Giulio Gangi, a young agent of the SISDE and friend of the Orlandi family, questioned the two police officers who were on duty in front of Palazzo Madama on the evening of the disappearance Both confirmed they saw a girl fitting Orlandi's description talking to a man who was holding an Avon cosmetics bag, although they disagreed on the time of the sighting One of the officers placed this event before Orlandi's music lesson, while the other thought it was around 7:00 p.m., after the class had ended According to the police, the man was driving a dark green BMW Gangi managed to track down the car, which was being repaired by a mechanic, as one of its windows had been broken from the inside Gangi discovered that the car belonged to a woman, but before he could dig deeper, he was removed from the investigation by superiors [10]\n\n\nTheories\nIn mid-2000, Judge Ferdinando Imposimato, an Italian prosecutor with extensive experience with high-profile investigations, suggested that Orlandi, by then an adult, was living a perfectly integrated life in the Muslim community and had probably lived for a long time in Paris [23] In a prison interview ten years later, Ağca, who had once declared that Orlandi had been kidnapped by Bulgarian agents of the Grey Wolves, stated that Orlandi was alive and living safely in a cloistered convent in central Europe [8]\n\n\nOrlandi–Ağca connection theory, Turkesh, Stasi, and the KGB\nIn mid-2000, Judge Ferdinando Imposimato, an Italian prosecutor with extensive experience with high-profile investigations, suggested that Orlandi, by then an adult, was living a perfectly integrated life in the Muslim community and had probably lived for a long time in Paris [23] In a prison interview ten years later, Ağca, who had once declared that Orlandi had been kidnapped by Bulgarian agents of the Grey Wolves, stated that Orlandi was alive and living safely in a cloistered convent in central Europe [8]\n\n\nOrganised crime theory\nDiscovery of Enrico De Pedis grave\n\n\nVatican sex scandal theory\nOver decades of investigations, the circumstances of Orlandi's disappearance led many investigators to doubt the abduction hypothesis First of all, the fact that the girl was last seen in Corso Rinascimento, one of Rome's busiest streets, in full daylight, suggested that it was unrealistic that she would have been taken by force without anyone noticing Some investigators concluded that it was more realistic to believe that the girl went with someone she knew Above all, over the course of the following months, the alleged kidnappers were never able to provide any actual proof of her captivity The only object they provided was a photocopy of her music school membership card, which was available in the music school archives, which fell under Vatican jurisdiction [38]\n\n\nVatileaks and London trail\nIn 2017, Italian journalist Emiliano Fittipaldi came into possession of secret Vatican documents that had been stolen in 2014 in the Vatican leaks scandal One of these documents, signed 28 March 1997 and sent to Archbishop Giovanni Battista Re and Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, allegedly shows that the Vatican spent over 483 million lire (around 250,000 euros) on supporting Orlandi from 1983 until 1997, including expenses for her education and medical care The document suggested that Orlandi had lived in London under Vatican protection for several years, and that her remains had been sent back to the Vatican following her eventual death Both the Vatican and Italian authorities regard the documents as false [46]\n\n\nSerial killer theory\nIn the 2000s, Judge Otello Lupacchini and journalist Max Parisi conducted a study of over twelve cases of young girls missing and murdered in Rome between 1982 and 1990 and hypothesized that all of them were victims of a serial killer, due to the similarities of the murders and their proximity within the city Some of these include the murders of Katy Skerl and Simonetta Cesaroni, two major unsolved crimes in Italy Lupacchini and Parisi put forth the theory that both Mirella Gregori and Emanuela Orlandi were victims of this serial killer According to them, this man lured the girls with job offers, like selling Avon products, and then kidnapped and killed them Gregori and Orlandi, who were the only two minors on this list of victims, were also the only ones whose bodies were never found [49]\n\n\nPossible role of Marco Accetti\nIn 2013, Marco Accetti, a photographer convicted for the death of Josè Garramon, claimed to be one of the kidnappers of both Orlandi and Mirella Gregori He stated that this was done as part of an internal blackmail campaign and a feud between rival factions within the Vatican to influence the anti-communist policies of Pope John Paul II Accetti claimed that he was the one who took Orlandi out of the music school and that he impersonated the callers \"Mario\" and \"the American\" He stated that the kidnapping was originally meant to be temporary and the girls were taken with their consent, but in the end, things got worse Accetti was not able to state the whereabouts of the two girls, as he was arrested in the middle of the operation in December 1983 for the murder of young Josè Garramon Garramon, a twelve-year-old Uruguayan boy, was run over and killed by Accetti's van on a country road near Castelfusano, 20 km away from his home The police were not able to explain how the boy got so far from home, unless he had been kidnapped Accetti always denied having taken the boy, saying he ran over him by accident after the boy came out of nowhere [50]\n\n\nRole of the Vatican\nOver the years, questions were raised as to why the Vatican never opened an official investigation into Orlandi's disappearance, even though she was a Vatican citizen The unofficial reply from the Vatican was that since she had disappeared on Italian territory, it fell under Italian jurisdiction However, on 12 October 1993, Italian authorities recorded a telephone conversation between Raoul Bonarelli, then-deputy chief of the Gendarmerie of the Vatican City, and Monsignor Bertani, then-Chaplain of His Holiness to Pope John Paul II The phone call took place on the eve of Bonarelli's questioning by Judge Adele Rando in relation to the Gregori case; Gregori's mother claimed to have recognized Bonarelli as the man she saw in the company of her daughter shortly before her disappearance In the phone call, Bertani ordered Bonarelli not to say anything to Italian police about the Vatican's investigations into the Orlandi case, suggesting that the Vatican had opened an investigation without informing Italian authorities [53]\n\n\nInvestigations of the Vatican City\nOver the years, questions were raised as to why the Vatican never opened an official investigation into Orlandi's disappearance, even though she was a Vatican citizen The unofficial reply from the Vatican was that since she had disappeared on Italian territory, it fell under Italian jurisdiction However, on 12 October 1993, Italian authorities recorded a telephone conversation between Raoul Bonarelli, then-deputy chief of the Gendarmerie of the Vatican City, and Monsignor Bertani,

the Vatican's investigations into the Orlandi case, suggesting that the Vatican had opened an investigation without informing Italian authorities [53]\n\n\nLack of cooperation in investigations\nOn 13 November 1986, judge Ilario Martella presented one international rogatory letter to the Vatican to request cooperation and documents concerning Orlandi, but the rogatory was rejected On 2 March 1994 and later 7 March 1995, judge Adele Rando presented two other letters rogatory to the Vatican in order to obtain documents concerning Orlandi and to question cardinals Agostino Casaroli, Angelo Sodano, Giovanni Battista Re, Dino Monduzzi, and Eduardo Martínez Somalo The Vatican rejected both rogatories When Rando asked for information concerning the phone calls between the Vatican and the alleged kidnappers, the Vatican replied that no calls with \"the American\" were recorded or transcribed In the dismissal sentence of December 1997, Rando explicitly mentioned the \"lack of cooperation of the Vatican institutions with the Italian magistrates\" [54]\n\n\nNegotiations between the Vatican and Giancarlo Capaldo\nIn December 2021, Giancarlo Capaldo, the former public prosecutor of Rome who led the second investigation over the Orlandi case, revealed that in 2012, years after the discovery of De Pedis' grave, secret negotiations were held in the Palace of Justice between him, his deputy Simona Maisto, and two emissaries of the Holy See The two emissaries were Domenico Giani, the then-inspector general of the Gendarmerie of the Vatican City, and his deputy, Costanzo Alessandrini, who had been sent by the Vatican to ask Capaldo to remove De Pedis' grave from the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare, as it was a \"great embarrassment\" for the Holy See to have a criminal buried there, especially after an increase in public opposition to this Capaldo accepted the request in exchange for information on the Orlandi case Two days later, the emissaries accepted the trade and proposed to give Capaldo documents with the names of people involved in the case Capaldo replied that alongside these documents, he wanted Emanuela Orlandi herself, dead or alive [55]\n\n\nOther public speculation, activity\nOn the morning of 14 May 2001, the parish priest of the San Gregorio VII church, near the Vatican, discovered a human skull of small dimensions and lacking a jaw in a bag with an image of Padre Pio in a confessional Although it was not identified as Orlandi's, the discovery generated suspicions that it might be her skull [58]\n\n\nReports on the Teutonic cemetery and St. Mary Major\nIn the summer of 2018, the Orlandi family's lawyer received an anonymous letter with a picture of the statue of an angel in the Teutonic Cemetery, inside the Vatican The letter read, \"If you want to find Emanuela, search where the angel looks\" [67] On 10 July 2019, it was announced that the Vatican would be opening two tombs inside the Teutonic Cemetery, and they would then be examined by forensic anthropologist Giovanni Arcudi They were the \"Tomb of the Angel\", meant to contain the remains of Princess Sophie of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein, and an adjacent one, which supposedly contained the remains of Duchess Charlotte Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin The exhumations took place on 11 July 2019 Neither Orlandi's body nor those of the two princesses were found [68] The Vatican said it would conduct an investigation into the whereabouts of the princesses' remains However, an empty chamber, encased in reinforced concrete, was found below the level of the two tombs; a technical expert stated that it was built later than the 19th century [69]\n\n\n2023 reopening of the case\nOn 9 January 2023, the Vatican opened its first official investigation into Emanuela Orlandi's disappearance Pope Francis appointed head prosecutor Alessandro Diddi to lead the probe The Vatican plans to conduct a complete review that will re-examine all files, reports, and testimony [71] On 11 April, Pietro Orlandi gave his first official testimony to Vatican City head prosecutor Alessandro Diddi [72] On 15 May, the Italian public prosecutor in Rome opened the third official investigation into the case [73]\n\n\nSuspicions on uncle Mario Meneguzzi\nOn 10 July 2023, the Vatican released an \"unedited file\" to the Italian TV news program TG La7 that suggested a possible involvement of Orlandi's uncle, Mario Meneguzzi, in the disappearance of the girl The document noted an \"impressive resemblance\" between Meneguzzi and the facial composite of the \"Avon man\" provided by the two police officers on duty at the Senate and also included a letter sent by Cardinal Agostino Casaroli to Cardinal José Luis Serna Alzate, the then-priest confessor of the Orlandis In the letter, Casaroli asked Alzate if it was true that Natalina Orlandi, Emanuela's older sister, confided to him that her uncle Mario Meneguzzi once molested her Alzate confirmed this to be true On TG La7, it was also mentioned that Meneguzzi appointed Gennaro Egidio as the Orlandi lawyer and that Meneguzzi had links to the Italian Secret Services [79]\n\n\nSee

June 22, 1983, while traveling to her music school in Rome, Italy. Her disappearance has been the subject of numerous investigations and theories over the years, but her fate remains a mystery. This article will provide an overview of the events surrounding her disappearance and the various theories that have emerged.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nEmanuela Orlandi was born on August 14, 1970, in Rome, Italy, to Ercole Orlandi and Maria Pezzano. She was the fourth of five children, and her family lived inside Vatican City. Her father worked as a lay employee in the papal household, and the family enjoyed a relatively comfortable life. According to her older brother, Pietro, the children had the free run of the Vatican Gardens.\n\n**Chronology**\n\nOn the afternoon of June 22, 1983, Emanuela left her home in Vatican City to attend her music school, located in Piazza di Sant'Apollinare, near Piazza Navona. She usually traveled by bus to school, getting off after a few stops and walking the last few hundred meters. However, on this particular day, she was late to class, and the weather was extremely hot. She asked her brother Pietro to drive her to school, but he had other commitments. \"I've gone over it so many times, telling myself if only I had accompanied her maybe it wouldn't have happened,\" he recalled decades later.\n\n**Disappearance**\n\nEmanuela's disappearance was first reported by her music teacher, who said she failed to show up to her 5:00 pm class. A search of the area was conducted, but there was no sign of her. The police were notified, and an investigation was launched. Over the next few days, the police conducted extensive searches of the area, but there was no sign of Emanuela.\n\n**Subsequent Events**\n\nIn the first days after the disappearance, Giulio Gangi, a young agent of the SISDE and friend of the Orlandi family, questioned the two police officers who were on duty in front of Palazzo Madama on the evening of the disappearance. Both confirmed they saw a girl fitting Emanuela's description talking to a man who was holding an Avon cosmetics bag, although they disagreed on the time of the sighting. One of the officers placed this event before Emanuela's music lesson, while the other thought it was around 7:00 pm, after the class had ended. According to the police, the man was driving a dark green BMW. Gangi managed to track down the car, which was being repaired by a mechanic, as one of its windows had been broken from the inside. Gangi discovered that the car belonged to a woman, but before he could dig deeper, he was removed from the investigation by superiors.\n\n**Theories**\n\nOver the years, numerous theories have emerged about Emanuela's disappearance. One theory is that she was kidnapped by Bulgarian agents of the Grey Wolves, a neo-fascist organization. However, this theory was later disputed by Judge Ferdinando Imposimato, an Italian prosecutor with extensive experience with high-profile investigations, who suggested that Emanuela was living a perfectly integrated life in the Muslim community and had probably lived for a long time in Paris.\n\nAnother theory is that Emanuela was taken by a serial killer who targeted young girls in Rome between 1982 and 1990. This theory was proposed by Judge Otello Lupacchini and journalist Max Parisi, who conducted a study of over twelve cases of young girls missing and murdered in Rome during this period. According to them, this man lured the girls with job offers, like selling Avon products, and then kidnapped and killed them.\n\n**Organised Crime Theory**\n\nOne of the most enduring theories about Emanuela's disappearance is that she was taken by members of the 'Ndrangheta, a powerful Italian organized crime group. This theory was first proposed by journalist Mino Pecorelli, who claimed that Emanuela was abducted by the 'Ndrangheta as part of a larger plot to blackmail the Vatican. However, this theory has been disputed by many investigators, who point out that there is no concrete evidence to support it.\n\n**Vatican Sex Scandal Theory**\n\nOver the years, many investigators have raised questions about the Vatican's handling of the case. Some have suggested that the Vatican may have been involved in a cover-up of Emanuela's disappearance, possibly to protect the reputation of Pope John Paul II. This theory was first proposed by Italian journalist Emiliano Fittipaldi, who claimed that the Vatican spent over 483 million lire (around 250,000 euros) on supporting Emanuela from 1983 until 1997, including expenses for her education and medical care.\n\n**Serial Killer Theory**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Judge Otello Lupacchini and journalist Max Parisi proposed the theory that Emanuela was

\"the American\" were recorded or transcribed In the dismissal sentence of December 1997, Rando explicitly mentioned the \"lack of cooperation of the Vatican institutions with the Italian magistrates\" [54]\n\n\nNegotiations between the Vatican and Giancarlo Capaldo\nIn December 2021, Giancarlo Capaldo, the former public prosecutor of Rome who led the second investigation over the Orlandi case, revealed that in 2012, years after the discovery of De Pedis' grave, secret negotiations were held in the Palace of Justice between him, his deputy Simona Maisto, and two emissaries of the Holy See The two emissaries were Domenico Giani, the then-inspector general of the Gendarmerie of the Vatican City, and his deputy, Costanzo Alessandrini, who had been sent by the Vatican to ask Capaldo to remove De Pedis' grave from the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare, as it was a \"great embarrassment\" for the Holy See to have a criminal buried there, especially after an increase in public opposition to this Capaldo accepted the request in exchange for information on the Orlandi case Two days later, the emissaries accepted the trade and proposed to give Capaldo documents with the names of people involved in the case Capaldo replied that alongside these documents, he wanted Emanuela Orlandi herself, dead or alive [55]\n\n\nOther public speculation, activity\nOn the morning of 14 May 2001, the parish priest of the San Gregorio VII church, near the Vatican, discovered a human skull of small dimensions and lacking a jaw in a bag with an image of Padre Pio in a confessional Although it was not identified as Orlandi's, the discovery generated suspicions that it might be her skull [58]\n\n\nReports on the Teutonic cemetery and St. Mary Major\nIn the summer of 2018, the Orlandi family's lawyer received an anonymous letter with a picture of the statue of an angel in the Teutonic Cemetery, inside the Vatican The letter read, \"If you want to find Emanuela, search where the angel looks\" [67] On 10 July 2019, it was announced that the Vatican would be opening two tombs inside the Teutonic Cemetery, and they would then be examined by forensic anthropologist Giovanni Arcudi They were the \"Tomb of the Angel\", meant to contain the remains of Princess Sophie of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein, and an adjacent one, which supposedly contained the remains of Duchess Charlotte Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin The exhumations took place on 11 July 2019 Neither Orlandi's body nor those of the two princesses were found [68] The Vatican said it would conduct an investigation into the whereabouts of the princesses' remains However, an empty chamber, encased in reinforced concrete, was found below the level of the two tombs; a technical expert stated that it was built later than the 19th century [69]\n\n\n2023 reopening of the case\nOn 9 January 2023, the Vatican opened its first official investigation into Emanuela Orlandi's disappearance Pope Francis appointed head prosecutor Alessandro Diddi to lead the probe The Vatican plans to conduct a complete review that will re-examine all files, reports, and testimony [71] On 11 April, Pietro Orlandi gave his first official testimony to Vatican City head prosecutor Alessandro Diddi [72] On 15 May, the Italian public prosecutor in Rome opened the third official investigation into the case [73]\n\n\nSuspicions on uncle Mario Meneguzzi\nOn 10 July 2023, the Vatican released an \"unedited file\" to the Italian TV news program TG La7 that suggested a possible involvement of Orlandi's uncle, Mario Meneguzzi, in the disappearance of the girl The document noted an \"impressive resemblance\" between Meneguzzi and the facial composite of the \"Avon man\" provided by the two police officers on duty at the Senate and also included a letter sent by Cardinal Agostino Casaroli to Cardinal José Luis Serna Alzate, the then-priest confessor of the Orlandis In the letter, Casaroli asked Alzate if it was true that Natalina Orlandi, Emanuela's older sister, confided to him that her uncle Mario Meneguzzi once molested her Alzate confirmed this to be true On TG La7, it was also mentioned that Meneguzzi appointed Gennaro Egidio as the Orlandi lawyer and that Meneguzzi had links to the Italian Secret Services [79]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

{"title": "Roman_funerary_practices", "content": "\nCare of the dead\nIn Greco-Roman antiquity, the bodies of the dead were regarded as polluting [2] At the same time, loving duty toward one's ancestors (pietas) was a fundamental part of ancient Roman culture [3] The care of the dead negotiated these two emotionally opposed attitudes When properly honoured with funeral rites and memorials by the living, the spirits of the dead were thought to become benevolent ancestors and protect their descendants [4] Those who died \"before their natural term\" or without proper funeral rites were thought to wander the earth, and haunt the living as vengeful, vagrant ghosts (Lemures) In Horace's Ode 1.28, the shade of a drowned, unburied sailor, trapped through no fault of his own between the worlds of the living and the dead, implores a passer-by to \"sprinkle dust three times\" on his corpse and give him rest, or suffer his revenge Cicero (Laws 2.22.57) writes that  \".. until turf is cast upon the bones, the place where the body is cremated does not have a sacred character....\" The ritualistic casting of earth or placing of turf on the cremated bones might have been the minimum requirement to make a grave a locus religiosus (a religious place, therefore protected by the gods) Burial rites, and burial itself, could be denied to certain categories of criminal after execution, a demonstration that through this simple omission, the power of the state could extend to the perpetual condemnation of souls [5]\n\n\nMortality\nJohn Bodel calculates an annual death rate of 30,000 among a population of about 750,000 in the city of Rome, not counting victims of plague and pandemic [10] At birth, Romans of all classes had an approximate life expectancy of 20–30 years: men and women of citizen class who reached maturity could expect to live until their late 50's or much longer, barring illness, disease and accident [11] Married women, expected to bear children as a duty to family and state, were at particular risk of mortality through childbirth - 25 maternal deaths per 1,000 births (including still-births) is suggested [12] The death rate among newborns and young children was very high – around 1 in 4 births, or at worst, up to 50% mortality before age 5 Dietary deficiencies hindered growth and immunity among the poor, whether slave or free The law prescribed the killing of any newborn by its father, if it was patently \"unfit to live\" Those less severely deformed, or of doubtful paternity, or born to impoverished or enslaved parents, or simply unwanted, might be exposed \"for the gods to take care of\" Exposure did not change their status, but if they were freeborn their father automatically lost his legal power over them, having surrendered it through abandonment The status of an abandoned infant would have been difficult to prove Some were adopted as foundlings, or sold and subsequently enslaved but many died Attitudes to this practise varied; it was eventually outlawed, but covertly continued [13] [14]\n\n\nFuneral obligations of the familia\nIf the deceased had family, the paterfamilias (head of the family) usually paid for, arranged and led the funeral If the deceased was also the paterfamilias, the cost fell to the heir or heirs of the estate, to be paid from their inheritance; as Cicero put it, the duty went with the money If the deceased was a married woman, the cost should be paid by her husband, or from her dowry if she had been emancipated from her father [15] A slave who died as a loyal member of a familia might receive a decent funeral, and housing in the familia mausoleum, tomb or columbaria (shared \"dovecote\" style mausoleum) They might also be memorialised by an inscription, and be remembered in the family's annual commemorative rites [16] A freedman or woman who died as a client might be buried and commemorated as a lesser member of their patron's family, at their patron's expense [17] [18]\n\n\nAdults\nGrave goods for adults could include fine quality clothing, personal ornaments, perfumes, food and drink, and blood, which the deceased presumably needed, or enjoyed Lamps were ubiquitous [112] From the earliest times, food and drink, and sacrifices to deities, were generally offered in ollae; these were often used to contain the inhumed ashes of the deceased; the ashes of several individuals might thus be accommodated on a single tomb-shelf [113]\n\n\nChildren, infants and babies\nFamilies were under no customary or religious duty to give funeral rites to new-borns Until they had been named and acknowledged by their father on their dies lustricus (name-day), the 8th after birth for a girl, the 9th for a boy, new-borns were ritually pure, with only the most rudimentary personhood in law Their death polluted no-one, and their spirit could not become a malevolent, earthbound shade; [19] they therefore needed no purificatory funeral rites Those who died while less than 4 days old could be buried almost anywhere; unlike nearly all others, they could be interred within the pomerium (the city or town's ritual boundary), often within houses, or \"under the eaves\" (suggrundarium) of their birth-family's home According to Greek and Roman literary commentators, children only acquired full humanity by degrees, with careful teaching and discipline; [20] their ritual purity lasted, at some level, until the onset of adolescence – signalled by a boy's first beard, and a girl's menarche [21]  Plutarch, who claimed a Stoic attitude to the death of his infant daughter, held that until the withering and removal of the umbilical cord a week after birth, the newborn was \"more like a plant than an animal\"; if it died at birth, sadness at its lost potential was entirely natural but mourning should be restrained [22] [23]\n\n\nResponsibility of the State\nCicero describes the provision of a funeral and rites as a \"natural duty\", consistent with universal notions of human care and decency [24] Those who had rendered special service to the people or the state, in their military or civil career or as an ally, might be voted a funeral at state expense (a funus publicum) Sometimes the honour would be noted and publicly acknowledged by the heir, but the payment of costs refused, as a mark of the family's continued generosity to the people and state [25] The state intervened in several public and private aspects of burial and funeral practice For certain deceased with a very high public profile, the entire population was expected to go into official mourning over a fixed period (and no longer than that) Sumptuary laws, designed to restrain expenditure and conspicuous display of wealth, privilege and excessive emotion, were often ignored or circumvented by the elite \"Excessive\" mourning displays – of too great an intensity, cost or duration – were officially frowned on, as was the use of timbers \"finished with the axe\" for funeral pyres The sprinkling of wine on the ashes of the deceased had been banned as extravagant and practised as essential for time immemorial [26]\n\n\nUndertakers\nUndertakers (dissignatores, or libitinarii) supplied a broad range of funeral and disposal services, considered demeaning or ritually unclean to most citizens; these included digging graves, building pyres, moving and dressing corpses, applying cosmetics to the deceased to disguise the pallor of death, and organising the procession and cremation or burial; each of these tasks was a speciality within the profession Specialist undertakers could be hired to torture, flog or crucify slaves, to perform executions, and to carry or drag corpses from their place of execution to a place of disposal [28] In the town of Puteoli, circa 100–50 BC, the undertaker also functioned as the town executioner He and his 32 permanent staff lived outside the municipal boundary, and could only enter the town to carry out their trades, charged at a given rate-per-mile, plus hire or purchase of necessary equipment and services Funerals of decurions (local magistrates, members of the town's senate) were marked out as the most urgent, followed by funerals of the young who had died prematurely; their deaths, though not a public concern, were considered the most grievous Certain services had to be provided without additional payment, in a timely manner, and in a specific order of priority Any slave's corpse left on the street must be removed \"within two hours of daylight\" without mourning or funeral rites, and the slave's owner, if detected, must pay a 60 sestertii fine to the municipality The corpses of suicides by hanging, deemed particularly offensive to the gods, must be removed within the hour of discovery, again without mourning or funeral rites Not every city had professional undertakers on its public payroll; but many did, and Puteoli's arrangements and practices are assumed to broadly reflect those in Rome [29] [30] There were differences in regulation from place to place; for example, Martial describes the night-time use of tattooed workmen as corpse carriers in Rome; in Puteoli, they were specifically excluded [31]\n\n\nUndertakers on the Esquiline\nThe likely headquarters for the City of Rome's official undertakers was on the Esquiline Hill, where a temple in Libitina's sacred grove had been dedicated to Venus Libitina, as a patron goddess of funerals and undertakers, \"hardly later than 300 BC\" [32] [33] Venus's attested presence on the Esquiline seems to underline a very Roman association between sex, passion and death [9]\nLibitina herself appears to have had no independent cult, shrine or worshipers; her name is the likely source for the usual title of undertakers, \"Libitinarii\", but it also appears to have been metonymy for virtually all that pertained to undertakers and funerals, including biers (\"couches of Libitina\") and death itself The Esquiline contained squared pits, named in the 1st century BC as puticuli (\"little pits\"), possible remnants of ancient stone-quarrying that sometimes served as dumps for corpses of the destitute, animal bones and household litter The hill had once been the site of an ancient, aristocratic necropolis, first used around the 9th century BC, then submerged by the city's growth Despite this ancient usage, the Esquilline seems not to have been a locus religiosus, but a locus publicus - an ordinary, public place, though notoriously unpleasant and malodorous [34] Towards the end of the Republic an area just outside the Esquiline Gate was used as a dump for the bodies of executed criminals and crucified slaves The former were simply left there, or \"dragged with the hook\" from elsewhere by the undertaker's distinctively red-clad employees for disposal by birds and beasts The bodies of slaves were usually left to rot on their crosses The upper echelons of libitinarii (dissignatores, who hosted, organised and led funeral rites) wore distinctive black clothing, including a black hat They were considered less polluted, and less polluting, than those who came into direct contact with corpses Despite the public announcement of public executions, and public attendance at the same, the mere sight of a red-clad corpse-carrier or the body he dragged or carried was thought a pollution to be avoided, especially by priests, in particular by priests of Jupiter Corpse-carriers going about their business were therefore obliged to ring a bell to warn of their approach [35] [36]\n\n\nBurial societies and burial grants\nBurial societies were among the very few privately funded and privately organised associations accepted by Rome's civil authorities, who otherwise tended to suspect any private organisation of conspiracy against the status quo [39] [40] The affluent town of Lanuvium hosted a burial society called \"worshippers of Diana and Antinous\", founded in 133 AD and headed, supervised and financially underwritten by a patron, a wealthy local civil magistrate The organisation's charter guaranteed funeral rites and burial, or at least a memorial and image (cenotaph) to represent or house the spirit of the deceased, a legitimate equivalent to a full funeral if the body was missing Funeral costs were covered on condition that subscriptions were up to date and the member had respected the proprieties due to the Society, its divine and earthly patrons, and its officials There was no payout for suicides; and \"tumultuous or unruly\" behaviour at meetings was met with fines Members paid a joining fee of 100 sesterces (HS), and another 1.25 HS every month, along with an amphora of \"good wine\"; there were six feasts each year, dedicated to divine and earthly patrons, including the Imperial domus Augusta (in this case, Hadrian, his family, and his deceased lover, the divine Antinous) Lesser officials and executives were elected by the membership from among their own ranks If contributions lapsed for six months, the member lost all that they had paid in Slaves could join, with the consent of their master or mistress, and like all other members, could stand for election to time-limited office within the society [41] Various burial societies existed to serve funeral and social needs within particular professions, such as undertakers, grave-diggers, gladiators, butchers and executioners, who were polluted and dishonoured by their professional association with blood and death, and were categorised as infames (infamous ones), allowed a very restricted set of citizens' rights [42]\n\n\nFunerals\nIn elite funerals, the body of the deceased could remain in their family home for several days after death, while their funeral was arranged If the deceased was socially prominent, the death was announced by a herald, in the forum or other central public space The doors of the family home were closed as a sign of mourning, and cypress branches were displayed outside the entrance, a warning to all, especially the pontifices, that those who entered risked ritual pollution [49] The family ceased their daily routines for a nine-day mourning period, during which they were considered untouchable, isolated from their broader community because of their contact with death They should not wash or otherwise care for their own person and could not offer sacrifice to any deity [29]\n\n\nAnnouncing a death\nIn elite funerals, the body of the deceased could remain in their family home for several days after death, while their funeral was arranged If the deceased was socially prominent, the death was announced by a herald, in the forum or other central public space The doors of the family home were closed as a sign of mourning, and cypress branches were displayed outside the entrance, a warning to all, especially the pontifices, that those who entered risked ritual pollution [49] The family ceased their daily routines for a nine-day mourning period, during which they were considered untouchable, isolated from their broader community because of their contact with death They should not wash or otherwise care for their own person and could not offer sacrifice to any deity [29]\n\n\nPreparation of the body\nWhen a person died at home, family members and intimate friends gathered around the death bed If circumstance permitted it, the closest relative sealed the passing of spirit from the body with a last kiss, in accordance with a belief that equated the soul with the breath, then closed the eyes The relatives began lamentations, the women scratching their faces until they bled, [50] and calling on the deceased by name throughout the funeral ceremony The family was assisted by an undertaker and his staff, who were allowed to touch and handle the corpse, being permanently ritually unclean by virtue of their profession (see Infamia) The male relatives did not touch the body; it was placed on the ground, washed and anointed by female relatives, then placed on a funerary bier [51] The placing of the body on the ground is a doublet of birth ritual, when the infant was placed on the bare earth [52]\n\n\nCharon's obol\n\"Charon's obol\" was a coin placed in or on the mouth of the deceased [64] The custom is recorded in literary sources and attested by archaeology, and sometimes occurs in contexts that suggest it may have been imported to Rome as were the mystery religions that promised initiates salvation or special passage in the afterlife The custom was explained by the myth of Charon, the ferryman who conveyed the souls of the newly dead across the water – a lake, river, or swamp – that separated the world of the living from the underworld The coin was rationalized as his payment; the satirist Lucian remarks that in order to avoid death, one should simply not pay the fee In Apuleius's tale of \"Cupid and Psyche\" in his Metamorphoses, framed by Lucius's quest for salvation ending with initiation into the mysteries of Isis, Psyche (\"Soul\") carries two coins in her journey to the underworld, the second to enable her return or symbolic rebirth Evidence of \"Charon's obol\" appears throughout the Western Roman Empire well into the Christian era, but at no time and place was it practiced consistently and by all [65] [66]\n\n\nFuneral procession\nFunerals were traditionally held at night for the poor, and for those who died young, \"before their time\", but there seems to have been no hard and fast rule on the timing or duration of funerals for the elite or middling classes The last \"pagan\" Emperor, Julian, who attempted a last-ditch regeneration of traditional religious practise, instructed that all funerals be held before daybreak; this, he claimed, was not only traditional but would reduce the  chances of death-pollution through accidental contact on crowded streets He wrote that the gods, being deathless themselves, would naturally find corpses deeply offensive, and because temple doors were usually closed at night and open by day, the gods could take exception to seeing funeral corteges passing their temple precincts in full daylight He also felt that nighttime funerals harmonised with the idea of death as the \"last sleep\" His edict may also have been aimed at Christians, who preferred daytime burials and did not consider corpses a pollution [67]\n\n\nEulogy\nThe eulogy (laudatio funebris) was a formal oration or panegyric in praise of the dead It was one of two forms of discourse at a Roman funeral, the other being the chant (nenia), most of which was performed by women Male mourners might express their grief by a dignified groaning (gemitus); anything more was thought improper [77] [78] These practices are associated with noble families, and the conventions for words spoken at an ordinary person's funeral go unrecorded While public oratory was practiced in Rome only by men, an elite woman might also be honored with a public eulogy, though this was a rare event [76] In the most illustrious families, eulogies would tell of the successes and deeds of both the deceased and of their ancestors, impersonated by the actors or relatives seated on the rostra, each on the curule chair appropriate to the highest office held, appropriately dressed and masked Cicero and Livy say that these claims were sometimes false, perhaps (they are not explicit) by falsely claiming descent [79]\n\n\nDisposal\nCemeteries were usually sited outside the city boundary to avoid the physical and ritual pollution of the living by the dead [84] Cicero (in De Legibus, 2, 23, 58) categorises this as one of Rome's ancient Laws of Twelve Tables Some prominent statesmen might have a right of burial in long-established family tombs within the ritual boundary (pomerium) of the city; but this was a rare privilege, and was seldom exercised [85]\n\n\nSacrifices\nA portable altar was set up at the place of burial or cremation pyre, and the heir offered sacrifice of a pig in the presence of the deceased, usually to Ceres, Rome's principal grain, harvest and field goddess Though not an underworld deity, Ceres was doorwarden between the realms of the living and the dead The shade of the deceased could not pass into the underworld or afterlife without her consent The sacrificial victim was consecrated by sprinkling with mola salsa, a sacred mixture of salt and grain or flour, then stunned or killed with an axe or hammer, turned on its back and gutted The guts (exta), the \"divine portion\" of the sacrifice, were placed in an earthenware pot (olla) and examined [86]\n\n\nCremation, inhumation and os resectum\nAt a cremation funeral, the heir lit the pyre with a torch, his face averted Once the corpse had been consumed in the fire, the spirit of the deceased was thought to have begun their separation from the world of the living [90] After a cremation, the heir sprinkled the ashes with wine, gathered them along with any traces of bone, placed them in a cremation urn and interred them  This was sometimes done by the wife of the deceased; Livia did so with the ashes of her husband, the emperor Augustus [91]\n\n\nNovendialis\nA second funeral feast and rites called the novendialis or novemdialis were held nine days or more after death [107] Another sacrifice was often made, to the Manes of the deceased (or possibly, the family Penates – Cicero has a ram sacrificed as an offering to the family Lares) As a recipient of sacrifice, the deceased was now a deity, albeit one of the numberless underworld dii manes The entire body of the sacrificial victim was burned on the ground, and a libation to the Manes of the deceased was poured onto the grave [108] The sacrificial meat was not shared between the living and the dead Purification rites were held, using \"fire and water\", to finally separate the deceased from the world of the living This concluded the period of full mourning and released the family from their funeral obligations [109] Mourning dress was put aside, open house was declared and a feast was given [110] Among the elite, ancient laws of Numa released the men of the family from further mourning; women of the family could be nominated to continue mourning on behalf of the entire household, for up to 10 months, releasing their menfolk from the strictures of formal mourning, and back into public life and its obligations [111]\n\n\nGrave goods\nGrave goods for adults could include fine quality clothing, personal ornaments, perfumes, food and drink, and blood, which the deceased presumably needed, or enjoyed Lamps were ubiquitous [112] From the earliest times, food and drink, and sacrifices to deities, were generally offered in ollae; these were often used to contain the inhumed ashes of the deceased; the ashes of several individuals might thus be accommodated on a single tomb-shelf [113]\n\n\nAdults\nGrave goods for adults could include fine quality clothing, personal ornaments, perfumes, food and drink, and blood, which the deceased presumably needed, or enjoyed Lamps were ubiquitous [112] From the earliest times, food and drink, and sacrifices to deities, were generally offered in ollae; these were often used to contain the inhumed ashes of the deceased; the ashes of several individuals might thus be accommodated on a single tomb-shelf [113]\n\n\nInfants and children\nRoman literary and legal sources declared that concern for dead, un-teethed newborns was irrational, and mourning them was self-indulgent and hysterical Nevertheless, grave goods in infant burials could include toys, pets, food and images of protective childhood or birth deities, to guard the child's soul on its journey [115] Cemeteries containing an unusually high number of infant and child burials could indicate a nearby shrine or sanctuary, since lost, where parents had sought divine intervention and healing for children who had died despite their efforts [116] Cemeteries with disproportionately scant material evidence of infant or still-born deaths have been interpreted as confirmatory evidence for a general lack of care, or a culture of emotional indifference to the very young; this apparent lack may have more to do with soil conditions unfavourable to the preservation of infant remains, carelessness in past excavations, and over-reliance on the opinionated and unreliable pronouncements of elite literary sources as a guide to contemporary practice, and thus to the planning of later excavations [117]\n\n\nCommemorations\nThe care and cultivation of the dead did not end with the funeral and formal period of mourning, but was a perpetual obligation Cicero states that the main and overriding function of the priesthood with respect to the dead accorded with universal, natural law: to keep alive the memory of the deceased, by holding the traditional rites [123] Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased, an expectation of afterlife and their personal association with the gods [124] As Roman society developed, its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead, and more on monumental endowments to the community, such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was durably commemorated by their statue and inscribed name [125] Elite, private tomb inscriptions offer evidence for a very wide range of memorial practices, such as funeral games, drawn from neighbouring cultures and communities.\n\n\nFuneral games (ludi funebres)\nRoman and Greek literature offers dramatic accounts of games to honour or propitiate the spirits of the dead In Homer's Iliad, Book 23, funeral games are held by Achilles to honour Patroclus, and in Virgil's Aeneid, Book 5, Aeneas holds games on the anniversary of his father's death Very similar episodes are depicted on the walls of elite tombs in Etruria, and Campania; some appear to show combats to the death The first such ludi funebres in Rome were given in 264 BC, during the war against Carthage; three pairs of gladiators fought to the death at the pyre of Brutus Pera, in what was described as a munus (pl munera), a duty or provision owed to an ancestor by his descendants – in this case, his son  A feast was provided for friends and family; this may have been on the last day of the novendialis [126] Similar gladiatora munera became a core event at elite Roman funeral games In the late Republic, a munus held for the funeral of the ex-consul and Pontifex Maximus Publius Licinius in 183 BC involved 120 gladiators fighting over 3 days, public distribution of meat (visceratio data) and the crowding of the forum with dining couches and tents as venue for the  feast [127]\n\n\nFestivals and cults of the dead\nStarting on 13 February, dead parents and their ancestors were honoured at a nine-day annual festival, the Parentalia, a legal obligation of every paterfamilias Its opening rites were performed by the Vestal Virgins Families made their various ways to the extramural cemeteries where their ancestors had been laid to rest, and held extravagant feasts at their family tombs Behaviour at Parentalia varied between ostentatious public display and (according to Christian witnesses) drunken joie de vivre The last day of Parentalia was Feralia (21 February), a somewhat darker affair in which the ancestors (the di Manes) were placated with \"an arrangement of wreaths, a sprinkling of grain and a bit of salt, bread soaked in wine and violets scattered about\" Feralia was also an exorcism: Ovid thought it a more rustic, primitive and ancient affair than the Parentalia itself It appears to have functioned as a cleansing ritual for Caristia on the following day, when the family held an informal banquet to celebrate the mutual affection between themselves and their benevolent ancestral dead (whom Ovid identifies as Lares) [134] The midnight rites of the Lemuria festival (9, 11, and 13 May), were yet more ancient and obscure; families were redeemed at midnight from the potentially threatening lemures, undertood to be vagrant or resentful di manes or di parentes, the spirits of those family members who had died  \"before their time\" (through disease, accident or violence) and could not enter a full afterlife until they reached a \"natural term\" Until then, their yearly care, or exorcism as malignant spirits, was a duty of the family's paterfamilias, who must spit black beans onto the floor of the family home at midnight, as food for the dead Any malign spirit not satisfied by this offering could be exorcised from the domus by the family's loud clashing of bronze pots [135] [136]\n\n\nEpitaphs\nEpitaphs are one of the major classes of inscriptions  Additional information varies, but collectively, Roman epitaphs offer information on family relationships, political offices, [143] and Roman values, in choosing what aspects of the deceased's life to praise In a funeral culture that sought to perpetuate remembrance of the dead beyond the power of individual memory, epitaphs and markers counted for a lot The inscription sit tibi terra levis (commonly abbreviated as S·T·T·L) is a commonplace marking on funerary items, approximately translating as \"May the earth rest lightly on you\" A standard Roman funerary dedication is Dis Manibus (\"to the Manes-gods\") Regional variations include its Greek equivalent, theoîs katachthoníois [144] and Lugdunum's locally commonplace but mysterious \"dedicated under the trowel\" (sub ascia dedicare) [145] [146] There is a profound shift in content during the rise in dominance of Christianity While traditional epitaphs usually note the person's day of birth, earthly achievements and lifespan, [84] Christian inscriptions tend to emphasise the day of death, a transition to a hoped-for heavenly \"new life\" [147]\n\n\nFunerary art\nThe \"images\" (sing. imago, pl. imagines) displayed by some noble Roman families at funerals were usually kept in cabinets made for the purpose, in the atrium of their family home [156] There is some uncertainty about whether these imagines maiorum (\"images of the great ones\") were funeral masks, lifemasks, busts, or all of these The \"images\" could be arranged in a family tree, with a title (titulus) summarizing the individual's offices held (honores) and accomplishments (res gestae), [157] a practice that might be facilitated by hanging masks [158] In any case, portrait busts of family members in stone or bronze were displayed in the home as well [159]\n\n\nImagines (\"images\")\nThe \"images\" (sing. imago, pl. imagines) displayed by some noble Roman families at funerals were usually kept in cabinets made for the purpose, in the atrium of their family home [156] There is some uncertainty about whether these imagines maiorum (\"images of the great ones\") were funeral masks, lifemasks, busts, or all of these The \"images\" could be arranged in a family tree, with a title (titulus) summarizing the individual's offices held (honores) and accomplishments (res gestae), [157] a practice that might be facilitated by hanging masks [158] In any case, portrait busts of family members in stone or bronze were displayed in the home as well [159]\n\n\nGraves, tombs, and cemeteries\n\nIn Rome, burial places were \"always limited and frequently contested\" [166] The legislation that forbade almost all burial within the ritual boundaries of Roman cities and towns led to the development of necropolises alongside extramural roads, veritable \"cities of the dead\", with their own main and access roads, water supplies and prime development sites for grand monuments or mausolea Amenities for visitors included rooms for family dining, kitchens and kitchen gardens There was no zoning as such; the burial consecrated the ground, not vice versa, and the land beyond each tomb's perimeter was profane, open to public access [167] Plots could be rented or bought, with or without user-ready or customised tombs The great cemetery of Isola Sacra and the tombs that line both sides of the Via Appia Antica offer notable examples of roadside cemeteries [168] In the city of Rome, tombs also lined both embankments of the Tiber, a major waterway whose towpaths and wharves were in near-constant use Tombs were still being built there in the Imperial era, despite the hindrances they must have posed to businesses at docks and wharves, and the planning, building and maintenance of riverine roadways, bridges and aqueducts Rome was virtually encircled by its dead [169]\n\nUrban and suburban\n\nIn Rome, burial places were \"always limited and frequently contested\" [166] The legislation that forbade almost all burial within the ritual boundaries of Roman cities and towns led to the development of necropolises alongside extramural roads, veritable \"cities of the dead\", with their own main and access roads, water supplies and prime development sites for grand monuments or mausolea Amenities for visitors included rooms for family dining, kitchens and kitchen gardens There was no zoning as such;

landowners could offer burial space on their own property for whoever they wished, and wherever they pleased; graves were sacred no matter where In his capacity as a land surveyor, Siculus Flaccus found that grave markers at the edge of estates were easily mistaken for boundary markers (cippi) Many of the elite chose burial among their ancestors at the family farm and villa, until the emperor Marcus Aurelius banned the practice in an effort to limit the spread of the Antonine Plague (165 to 180 AD) The ban remained in place until at least the 4th century Heirs might be obliged by the terms of their inheritance to keep their inheritance whole, not sell it piecemeal, and to keep the family name alive; this could be done by leaving the property to freedmen, who adopted the name of the master who freed them Whoever inherited or bought a property automatically acquired its graves, monuments and resident deities, including its dii Manes and Lares, who were closely associated – at least in popular opinion – with ancestor cult If the family villa had to be sold, it was not unusual for the contract of sale to maintain the vendor's traditional rights of access to their family tombs, so that they could continue to observe their ancestral and commemorative rites and duties [182]\n\n\nCommon graves\nA funeral ceremony acceptable to the Roman elite might represent several times the annual income of the average citizen, and an impossibility to the very poor, dependent on charity or an unpredictable day-wage, unable to afford or maintain a burial-club subscription The social status of the poorest citizens might have been marginally better than a slave, but their prospect of decent burial could be much worse Some were doubtless unlawfully dumped by their relatives, or by the aediles or rather, by their assistants Several historical burial crises are known, mostly relating to famines and plagues and the overwhelming of facilities for disposal [183]\n\n\nBasic pit graves\nThe least costly form of individual inhumation was the simple pit-grave [184] It was used, in various forms, throughout the Republic and Empire, especially where there was little or no pressure for burial space Orientation of the grave was generally east – west, with the head to the east [185] Flanged tiles (or tegulae) were sometimes used to enclose and protect the remains in a box-like or gabled ceramic tomb, known in modern archaeology as Alla cappuccina (\"like a Capuchin monk's hood\") Libations during ceremonies honouring the dead were sometimes given through a tube or funnel that pierced the tomb, and could be stoppered when not in use Grave goods were often deposited along with the body; a pillow of tufa or wood might be provided for the comfort of the deceased [184] [186]\n\n\nHouse tombs,  Columbaria  and  mausoleums\n\"House tombs\" for well-off, prominent but in most cases, probably sub-elite families were often contained within a low-walled exterior precinct, which might include a garden The exterior of such tombs could be highly decorative, designed to provoke the notice and curiosity of passers-by, rather like the semi-public atria of private town-houses in function, if not appearance Most had a decorated room for banqueting, complete with shelving, cooking facilities and stone-built banqueting couches or space for couches to be brought in, and either sarcophagi containing the immured dead or cinerary altars or urns containing their ashes Entry to the inner rooms was likely privileged to family members, most of whom could anticipate their own burial here, rewarding their commitment to care of their departed relatives [187] Slaves freed by their master's will took on their former owner's family name and many of their family responsibilities In due course, their own names and epitaphs might be added to those already listed on the tomb frontage, a dynastic history to be read by any passer-by Most tomb owners made provision in their wills to cover the cost of family banquets and festivals, whose observance would gradually transform the deceased from \"polluted body to sanctified ancestor\" [188]\n\n\nSarcophagi\nThe funerary urns in which the ashes of the cremated were placed were gradually overtaken in popularity by the sarcophagus as inhumation became more common Particularly in the 2nd–4th centuries, these were often decorated with reliefs that became an important vehicle for Late Roman sculpture The scenes depicted were drawn from mythology, religious beliefs pertaining to the mysteries, allegories, history, or scenes of hunting or feasting Many sarcophagi depict Nereids, fantastical sea creatures, and other marine imagery that may allude to the location of the Isles of the Blessed across the sea, with a portrait of the deceased on a seashell [199] The sarcophagus of a child may show tender representations of family life, Cupids, or children playing Some tomb inscriptions name infants, and depict episodes from their brief lives on sarcophagi They are depicted as well-grown children, regardless of their age or context, and never as newborns They would have thus been included in the family's memorial festivals [200]\n\n\nMilitary funerals and burial\n\"The cult of the dead\", it has been noted, [204] \"was particularly important to men whose profession exposed them to a premature demise\" The Roman value of pietas encompassed the desire of soldiers to honor their fallen comrades, though the conditions of war might interfere with the timely performance of traditional rites [204] Soldiers killed in battle on foreign soil with ongoing hostilities were probably given a mass cremation or burial [205] Under less urgent circumstances, they might be cremated individually, and their ashes placed in a vessel for transport to a permanent burial site [206] When the Roman army under the command of Publius Quinctilius Varus suffered their disastrous defeat at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD, they remained uncommemorated until Germanicus and his troops located the battlefield a few years later and made a funeral mound for their remains [207]\n\n\nAfterlife\nLike their Etruscan neighbours, the Romans held a deepseated notion that the individual soul survived death They went to great lengths to help their dead feel comfortable, and \"at home\" in the tomb Several quite different but concurrent beliefs and customs seem to have been held regarding an afterlife Some epitaphs and sculptural representations suggest that the deceased rested \"in the bosom of a kindly Mother Earth\" While individual souls were thought to merge into an undifferentiated collective of underworld deities (dii inferii) known as Manes gods, the naming of the deceased as an individual and the provision of grave goods implies that at least some personal qualities, needs and preferences were believed to survive along with the soul, which resided in or with the body or ashes in the dark of the grave, or within the memories of those who mourned their loss Standard accounts of Roman mythology describe the soul as immortal [211] and judged at death before a tribunal in the underworld, with those who had done good being sent to the Elysian Fields and those who had done ill sent to Tartarus [212] It is unclear how ancient, persistent and widely held such beliefs could have been; they seem influenced by Greek mythology and mystery cults Strict Stoics and Epicurians declared the soul a material quality, drawn at death from its bodily home to rejoin an indistinct universal life-force Belief in the persistence of an individual soul after death is evident in domestic and ancestor-cult practices that seek to feed, satisfy and sustain the soul as a familiar spirit, still imbued with an identity, personality and preferences, and a tendency to care for those who care for it; a divinised ancestor, rather than just one of a vast and impersonal community of shadowy Manes gods [213]\n\n\nReligion\nLike their Etruscan neighbours, the Romans held a deepseated notion that the individual soul survived death They went to great lengths to help their dead feel comfortable, and \"at home\" in the tomb Several quite different but concurrent beliefs and customs seem to have been held regarding an afterlife Some epitaphs and sculptural representations suggest that the deceased rested \"in the bosom of a kindly Mother Earth\" While individual souls were thought to merge into an undifferentiated collective of underworld deities (dii inferii) known as Manes gods, the naming of the deceased as an individual and the provision of grave goods implies that at least some personal qualities, needs and preferences were believed to survive along with the soul, which resided in or with the body or ashes in the dark of the grave, or within the memories of those who mourned their loss Standard accounts of Roman mythology describe the soul as immortal [211] and judged at death before a tribunal in the underworld, with those who had done good being sent to the Elysian Fields and those who had done ill sent to Tartarus [212] It is unclear how ancient, persistent and widely held such beliefs could have been;

a divinised ancestor, rather than just one of a vast and impersonal community of shadowy Manes gods [213]\n\n\nPhilosophy\nThe mainstream of Roman philosophy, such as the Stoics, advocated contemplation and acceptance of the inevitability of death of all mortals \"It is necessary for some to stay and for others to go, all the while rejoicing with those who are with us, yet not grieving for those departing\" [215] To grieve bitterly is to fail to perceive and accept the nature of things Epictetus encouraged contemplation of one's loved ones as a \"jar\" or \"crystal cup\" which might break and be remembered without troubling the spirit, since \"you love a mortal, something not your own It has been given to you for the present, not inseparably nor forever, but like a fig.. at a fixed season of the year If you yearn for it in the winter, you are a fool.\" [216]\nThere was no real consensus, at least among surviving Roman texts and epitaphs, of what happened to a person after death, nor on the existence of an afterlife Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia claims that most people are of the opinion that after death one returns to the non-sensing state that occurred before birth but admits, however scornfully, that there are people who believe in the immortality of the soul Seneca the Younger seems to be less consistent, arguing both sides, indicating that death brings about utter annihilation while also talking about some survival of the spirit after it escapes from the prison of the body [217] Tacitus at the end of Agricola takes the opposite opinion to Pliny, and claims that the wise believe the spirit does not die with the body, although he may be specifically referring to the pious – which harkens to the mythological idea of Elysium.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Roman Funerary Practices**\n\nThe care and disposal of the dead was an essential part of Roman society, with a rich array of practices and rituals surrounding the treatment of the deceased. The Roman approach to death was complex and multifaceted, reflecting the societal, cultural, and philosophical values of the time.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nRoman funerary practices were characterized by a deep respect for the dead, with a focus on honoring the deceased and ensuring their proper care. This was reflected in the elaborate rituals and ceremonies that accompanied the burial process, as well as the elaborate tombs and monuments that were constructed to house the remains of the deceased. The Roman approach to death was influenced by a range of cultural and philosophical traditions, including Greek mythology and Stoic philosophy.\n\n**Care of the Dead**\n\nIn Greco-Roman antiquity, the bodies of the dead were regarded as polluting. At the same time, loving duty toward one's ancestors (pietas) was a fundamental part of ancient Roman culture. The care of the dead negotiated these two emotionally opposed attitudes. When properly honored with funeral rites and memorials by the living, the spirits of the dead were thought to become benevolent ancestors and protect their descendants. Those who died \"before their natural term\" or without proper funeral rites were thought to wander the earth, and haunt the living as vengeful, vagrant ghosts (Lemures).\n\n**Mortality**\n\nJohn Bodel calculates an annual death rate of 30,000 among a population of about 750,000 in the city of Rome, not counting victims of plague and pandemic. At birth, Romans of all classes had an approximate life expectancy of 20–30 years: men and women of citizen class who reached maturity could expect to live until their late 50's or much longer, barring illness, disease and accident. Married women, expected to bear children as a duty to family and state, were at particular risk of mortality through childbirth - 25 maternal deaths per 1,000 births (including stillbirths) is suggested.\n\n**Funeral Obligations of the Familia**\n\nIf the deceased had family, the paterfamilias (head of the family) usually paid for, arranged and led the funeral. If the deceased was also the paterfamilias, the cost fell to the heir or heirs of the estate, to be paid from their inheritance; as Cicero put it, the duty went with the money. A slave who died as a loyal member of a familia might receive a decent funeral, and housing in the familia mausoleum, tomb or columbaria (shared \"dovecote\" style mausoleum). They might also be memorialized by an inscription, and be remembered in the family's annual commemorative rites.\n\n**Adults**\n\nGrave goods for adults could include fine quality clothing, personal ornaments, perfumes, food and drink, and blood, which the deceased presumably needed, or enjoyed. Lamps were ubiquitous. From the earliest times, food and drink, and sacrifices to deities, were generally offered in ollae; these were often used to contain the inhumed ashes of the deceased; the ashes of several individuals might thus be accommodated on a single tomb-shelf.\n\n**Infants and Children**\n\nRoman literary and legal sources declared that concern for dead, un-teethed newborns was irrational, and mourning them was self-indulgent and hysterical. Nevertheless, grave goods in infant burials could include toys, pets, food and images of protective childhood or birth deities, to guard the child's soul on its journey.\n\n**Commemorations**\n\nThe care and cultivation of the dead did not end with the funeral and formal period of mourning, but was a perpetual obligation. Cicero states that the main and overriding function of the priesthood with respect to the dead accorded with universal, natural law: to keep alive the memory of the deceased, by holding the traditional rites.\n\n**Funeral Games (Ludi Funebres)**\n\nRoman and Greek literature offers dramatic accounts of games to honour or propitiate the spirits of the dead. In Homer's Iliad, Book 23, funeral games are held by Achilles to honour Patroclus, and in Virgil's Aeneid, Book 5, Aeneas holds games on the anniversary of his father's death. Very similar episodes are depicted on the walls of elite tombs in Etruria, and Campania; some appear to show combats to the death.\n\n**Festivals and Cults of the Dead**\n\nStarting on 13 February, dead parents and their ancestors were honoured at a nine-day annual festival, the Parentalia, a legal obligation of every paterfamilias. Its opening rites were performed by the Vestal Virgins. Families made their various ways to the extramural cemeteries where their ancestors had been laid to rest, and held extravagant feasts at their family tombs.\n\n**Epitaphs**\n\nEpitaphs are one of the major classes of inscriptions. Additional information varies, but collectively, Roman epitaphs offer information on family relationships, political offices, and Roman values, in choosing what aspects of the deceased's life to praise.\n\n**Funerary Art**\n\nThe \"images\" (sing. imago, pl. imagines) displayed by some noble Roman families at funerals were usually kept in cabinets made for the purpose, in the atrium of their family home. There is some uncertainty about whether these imagines maiorum (\"images of the great ones\") were funeral masks, lifemasks, busts, or all of these.\n\n**Graves, Tombs, and Cemeteries**\n\nIn Rome, burial places were \"always limited and frequently contested\". The legislation that forbade almost all burial within the ritual boundaries of Roman cities and towns led to the development of necropolises alongside extramural roads, veritable \"cities of the dead\", with their own main and access roads, water supplies and prime development sites for grand monuments or mausolea.\n\n**Rural Villas and Estates**\n\nA likely majority of Romans (Hopkins, 1981, calculates 80–90%) spent their entire lives in rural poverty, working on farms and villa estates as tenants, free labourers or slaves. Wealthy landowners used the income from their farms to support town houses, military and political careers, and a lifestyle of cultured leisure (otium).\n\n**Military Funerals and Burial**\n\n\"The cult of the dead\", it has been noted, \"was particularly important to men whose profession exposed them to a premature demise\". Soldiers killed in battle on foreign soil with ongoing hostilities were probably given a mass cremation or burial. Under less urgent circumstances, they might be cremated individually, and their ashes placed in a vessel for transport to a permanent burial site.\n\n**Afterlife**\n\nLike their Etruscan neighbours, the Romans held a deep-seated notion that the individual soul survived death. They went to great lengths to help their dead feel comfortable, and \"at home\" in the tomb. Several quite different but concurrent beliefs and customs seem to have been held regarding an afterlife.\n\n**Philosophy**\n\nThe mainstream of Roman philosophy, such as the Stoics, advocated contemplation and acceptance of the inevitability of death of all mortals.

it was eventually outlawed, but covertly continued [13] [14]\n\n\nFuneral obligations of the familia\nIf the deceased had family, the paterfamilias (head of the family) usually paid for, arranged and led the funeral If the deceased was also the paterfamilias, the cost fell to the heir or heirs of the estate, to be paid from their inheritance; as Cicero put it, the duty went with the money If the deceased was a married woman, the cost should be paid by her husband, or from her dowry if she had been emancipated from her father [15] A slave who died as a loyal member of a familia might receive a decent funeral, and housing in the familia mausoleum, tomb or columbaria (shared \"dovecote\" style mausoleum) They might also be memorialised by an inscription, and be remembered in the family's annual commemorative rites [16] A freedman or woman who died as a client might be buried and commemorated as a lesser member of their patron's family, at their patron's expense [17] [18]\n\n\nAdults\nGrave goods for adults could include fine quality clothing, personal ornaments, perfumes, food and drink, and blood, which the deceased presumably needed, or enjoyed Lamps were ubiquitous [112] From the earliest times, food and drink, and sacrifices to deities, were generally offered in ollae; these were often used to contain the inhumed ashes of the deceased; the ashes of several individuals might thus be accommodated on a single tomb-shelf [113]\n\n\nChildren, infants and babies\nFamilies were under no customary or religious duty to give funeral rites to new-borns Until they had been named and acknowledged by their father on their dies lustricus (name-day), the 8th after birth for a girl, the 9th for a boy, new-borns were ritually pure, with only the most rudimentary personhood in law Their death polluted no-one, and their spirit could not become a malevolent, earthbound shade; [19] they therefore needed no purificatory funeral rites Those who died while less than 4 days old could be buried almost anywhere; unlike nearly all others, they could be interred within the pomerium (the city or town's ritual boundary), often within houses, or \"under the eaves\" (suggrundarium) of their birth-family's home According to Greek and Roman literary commentators, children only acquired full humanity by degrees, with careful teaching and discipline; [20] their ritual purity lasted, at some level, until the onset of adolescence – signalled by a boy's first beard, and a girl's menarche [21]  Plutarch, who claimed a Stoic attitude to the death of his infant daughter, held that until the withering and removal of the umbilical cord a week after birth, the newborn was \"more like a plant than an animal\"; if it died at birth, sadness at its lost potential was entirely natural but mourning should be restrained [22] [23]\n\n\nResponsibility of the State\nCicero describes the provision of a funeral and rites as a \"natural duty\", consistent with universal notions of human care and decency [24] Those who had rendered special service to the people or the state, in their military or civil career or as an ally, might be voted a funeral at state expense (a funus publicum) Sometimes the honour would be noted and publicly acknowledged by the heir, but the payment of costs refused, as a mark of the family's continued generosity to the people and state [25] The state intervened in several public and private aspects of burial and funeral practice For certain deceased with a very high public profile, the entire population was expected to go into official mourning over a fixed period (and no longer than that) Sumptuary laws, designed to restrain expenditure and conspicuous display of wealth, privilege and excessive emotion, were often ignored or circumvented by the elite \"Excessive\" mourning displays – of too great an intensity, cost or duration – were officially frowned on, as was the use of timbers \"finished with the axe\" for funeral pyres The sprinkling of wine on the ashes of the deceased had been banned as extravagant and practised as essential for time immemorial [26]\n\n\nUndertakers\nUndertakers (dissignatores, or libitinarii) supplied a broad range of funeral and disposal services, considered demeaning or ritually unclean to most citizens; these included digging graves, building pyres, moving and dressing corpses, applying cosmetics to the deceased to disguise the pallor of death, and organising the procession and cremation or burial; each of these tasks was a speciality within the profession Specialist undertakers could be hired to torture, flog or crucify slaves, to perform executions, and to carry or drag corpses from their place of execution to a place of disposal [28] In the town of Puteoli, circa 100–50 BC, the undertaker also functioned as the town executioner He and his 32 permanent staff lived outside the municipal boundary, and could only enter the town to carry out their trades, charged at a given rate-per-mile, plus hire or purchase of necessary equipment and services Funerals of decurions (local magistrates, members of the town's senate) were marked out as the most urgent, followed by funerals of the young who had died prematurely; their deaths, though not a public concern, were considered the most grievous Certain services had to be provided without additional payment, in a timely manner, and in a specific order of priority Any slave's corpse left on the street must be removed \"within two hours of daylight\" without mourning or funeral rites, and the slave's owner, if detected, must pay a 60 sestertii fine to the municipality The corpses of suicides by hanging, deemed particularly offensive to the gods, must be removed within the hour of discovery, again without mourning or funeral rites Not every city had professional undertakers on its public payroll; but many did, and Puteoli's arrangements and practices are assumed to broadly reflect those in Rome [29] [30] There were differences in regulation from place to place; for example, Martial describes the night-time use of tattooed workmen as corpse carriers in Rome; in Puteoli, they were specifically excluded [31]\n\n\nUndertakers on the Esquiline\nThe likely headquarters for the City of Rome's official undertakers was on the Esquiline Hill, where a temple in Libitina's sacred grove had been dedicated to Venus Libitina, as a patron goddess of funerals and undertakers, \"hardly later than 300 BC\" [32] [33] Venus's attested presence on the Esquiline seems to underline a very Roman association between sex, passion and death [9]\nLibitina herself appears to have had no independent cult, shrine or worshipers; her name is the likely source for the usual title of undertakers, \"Libitinarii\", but it also appears to have been metonymy for virtually all that pertained to undertakers and funerals, including biers (\"couches of Libitina\") and death itself The Esquiline contained squared pits, named in the 1st century BC as puticuli (\"little pits\"), possible remnants of ancient stone-quarrying that sometimes served as dumps for corpses of the destitute, animal bones and household litter The hill had once been the site of an ancient, aristocratic necropolis, first used around the 9th century BC, then submerged by the city's growth Despite this ancient usage, the Esquilline seems not to have been a locus religiosus, but a locus publicus - an ordinary, public place, though notoriously unpleasant and malodorous [34] Towards the end of the Republic an area just outside the Esquiline Gate was used as a dump for the bodies of executed criminals and crucified slaves The former were simply left there, or \"dragged with the hook\" from elsewhere by the undertaker's distinctively red-clad employees for disposal by birds and beasts The bodies of slaves were usually left to rot on their crosses The upper echelons of libitinarii (dissignatores, who hosted, organised and led funeral rites) wore distinctive black clothing, including a black hat They were considered less polluted, and less polluting, than those who came into direct contact with corpses Despite the public announcement of public executions, and public attendance at the same, the mere sight of a red-clad corpse-carrier or the body he dragged or carried was thought a pollution to be avoided, especially by priests, in particular by priests of Jupiter Corpse-carriers going about their business were therefore obliged to ring a bell to warn of their approach [35] [36]\n\n\nBurial societies and burial grants\nBurial societies were among the very few privately funded and privately organised associations accepted by Rome's civil authorities, who otherwise tended to suspect any private organisation of conspiracy against the status quo [39] [40] The affluent town of Lanuvium hosted a burial society called \"worshippers of Diana and Antinous\", founded in 133 AD and headed, supervised and financially underwritten by a patron, a wealthy local civil magistrate The organisation's charter guaranteed funeral rites and burial, or at least a memorial and image (cenotaph) to represent or house the spirit of the deceased, a legitimate equivalent to a full funeral if the body was missing Funeral costs were covered on condition that subscriptions were up to date and the member had respected the proprieties due to the Society, its divine and earthly patrons, and its officials There was no payout for suicides; and \"tumultuous or unruly\" behaviour at meetings was met with fines Members paid a joining fee of 100 sesterces (HS), and another 1.25 HS every month, along with an amphora of \"good wine\"; there were six feasts each year, dedicated to divine and earthly patrons, including the Imperial domus Augusta (in this case, Hadrian, his family, and his deceased lover, the divine Antinous) Lesser officials and executives were elected by the membership from among their own ranks If contributions lapsed for six months, the member lost all that they had paid in Slaves could join, with the consent of their master or mistress, and like all other members, could stand for election to time-limited office within the society [41] Various burial societies existed to serve funeral and social needs within particular professions, such as undertakers, grave-diggers, gladiators, butchers and executioners, who were polluted and dishonoured by their professional association with blood and death, and were categorised as infames (infamous ones), allowed a very restricted set of citizens' rights [42]\n\n\nFunerals\nIn elite funerals, the body of the deceased could remain in their family home for several days after death, while their funeral was arranged If the deceased was socially prominent, the death was announced by a herald, in the forum or other central public space The doors of the family home were closed as a sign of mourning, and cypress branches were displayed outside the entrance, a warning to all, especially the pontifices, that those who entered risked ritual pollution [49] The family ceased their daily routines for a nine-day mourning period, during which they were considered untouchable, isolated from their broader community because of their contact with death They should not wash or otherwise care for their own person and could not offer sacrifice to any deity [29]\n\n\nAnnouncing a death\nIn elite funerals, the body of the deceased could remain in their family home for several days after death, while their funeral was arranged If the deceased was socially prominent, the death was announced by a herald, in the forum or other central public space The doors of the family home were closed as a sign of mourning, and cypress branches were displayed outside the entrance, a warning to all, especially the pontifices, that those who entered risked ritual pollution [49] The family ceased their daily routines for a nine-day mourning period, during which they were considered untouchable, isolated from their broader community because of their contact with death They should not wash or otherwise care for their own person and could not offer sacrifice to any deity [29]\n\n\nPreparation of the body\nWhen a person died at home, family members and intimate friends gathered around the death bed If circumstance permitted it, the closest relative sealed the passing of spirit from the body with a last kiss, in accordance with a belief that equated the soul with the breath, then closed the eyes The relatives began lamentations, the women scratching their faces until they bled, [50] and calling on the deceased by name throughout the funeral ceremony The family was assisted by an undertaker and his staff, who were allowed to touch and handle the corpse, being permanently ritually unclean by virtue of their profession (see Infamia) The male relatives did not touch the body; it was placed on the ground, washed and anointed by female relatives, then placed on a funerary bier [51] The placing of the body on the ground is a doublet of birth ritual, when the infant was placed on the bare earth [52]\n\n\nCharon's obol\n\"Charon's obol\" was a coin placed in or on the mouth of the deceased [64] The custom is recorded in literary sources and attested by archaeology, and sometimes occurs in contexts that suggest it may have been imported to Rome as were the mystery religions that promised initiates salvation or special passage in the afterlife The custom was explained by the myth of Charon, the ferryman who conveyed the souls of the newly dead across the water – a lake, river, or swamp – that separated the world of the living from the underworld The coin was rationalized as his payment; the satirist Lucian remarks that in order to avoid death, one should simply not pay the fee In Apuleius's tale of \"Cupid and Psyche\" in his Metamorphoses, framed by Lucius's quest for salvation ending with initiation into the mysteries of Isis, Psyche (\"Soul\") carries two coins in her journey to the underworld, the second to enable her return or symbolic rebirth Evidence of \"Charon's obol\" appears throughout the Western Roman Empire well into the Christian era, but at no time and place was it practiced consistently and by all [65] [66]\n\n\nFuneral procession\nFunerals were traditionally held at night for the poor, and for those who died young, \"before their time\", but there seems to have been no hard and fast rule on the timing or duration of funerals for the elite or middling classes The last \"pagan\" Emperor, Julian, who attempted a last-ditch regeneration of traditional religious practise, instructed that all funerals be held before daybreak; this, he claimed, was not only traditional but would reduce the  chances of death-pollution through accidental contact on crowded streets He wrote that the gods, being deathless themselves, would naturally find corpses deeply offensive, and because temple doors were usually closed at night and open by day, the gods could take exception to seeing funeral corteges passing their temple precincts in full daylight He also felt that nighttime funerals harmonised with the idea of death as the \"last sleep\" His edict may also have been aimed at Christians, who preferred daytime burials and did not consider corpses a pollution [67]\n\n\nEulogy\nThe eulogy (laudatio funebris) was a formal oration or panegyric in praise of the dead It was one of two forms of discourse at a Roman funeral, the other being the chant (nenia), most of which was performed by women Male mourners might express their grief by a dignified groaning (gemitus); anything more was thought improper [77] [78] These practices are associated with noble families, and the conventions for words spoken at an ordinary person's funeral go unrecorded While public oratory was practiced in Rome only by men, an elite woman might also be honored with a public eulogy, though this was a rare event [76] In the most illustrious families, eulogies would tell of the successes and deeds of both the deceased and of their ancestors, impersonated by the actors or relatives seated on the rostra, each on the curule chair appropriate to the highest office held, appropriately dressed and masked Cicero and Livy say that these claims were sometimes false, perhaps (they are not explicit) by falsely claiming descent [79]\n\n\nDisposal\nCemeteries were usually sited outside the city boundary to avoid the physical and ritual pollution of the living by the dead [84] Cicero (in De Legibus, 2, 23, 58) categorises this as one of Rome's ancient Laws of Twelve Tables Some prominent statesmen might have a right of burial in long-established family tombs within the ritual boundary (pomerium) of the city; but this was a rare privilege, and was seldom exercised [85]\n\n\nSacrifices\nA portable altar was set up at the place of burial or cremation pyre, and the heir offered sacrifice of a pig in the presence of the deceased, usually to Ceres, Rome's principal grain, harvest and field goddess Though not an underworld deity, Ceres was doorwarden between the realms of the living and the dead The shade of the deceased could not pass into the underworld or afterlife without her consent The sacrificial victim was consecrated by sprinkling with mola salsa, a sacred mixture of salt and grain or flour, then stunned or killed with an axe or hammer, turned on its back and gutted The guts (exta), the \"divine portion\" of the sacrifice, were placed in an earthenware pot (olla) and examined [86]\n\n\nCremation, inhumation and os resectum\nAt a cremation funeral, the heir lit the pyre with a torch, his face averted Once the corpse had been consumed in the fire, the spirit of the deceased was thought to have begun their separation from the world of the living [90] After a cremation, the heir sprinkled the ashes with wine, gathered them along with any traces of bone, placed them in a cremation urn and interred them  This was sometimes done by the wife of the deceased; Livia did so with the ashes of her husband, the emperor Augustus [91]\n\n\nNovendialis\nA second funeral feast and rites called the novendialis or novemdialis were held nine days or more after death [107] Another sacrifice was often made, to the Manes of the deceased (or possibly, the family Penates – Cicero has a ram sacrificed as an offering to the family Lares) As a recipient of sacrifice, the deceased was now a deity, albeit one of the numberless underworld dii manes The entire body of the sacrificial victim was burned on the ground, and a libation to the Manes of the deceased was poured onto the grave [108] The sacrificial meat was not shared between the living and the dead Purification rites were held, using \"fire and water\", to finally separate the deceased from the world of the living This concluded the period of full mourning and released the family from their funeral obligations [109] Mourning dress was put aside, open house was declared and a feast was given [110] Among the elite, ancient laws of Numa released the men of the family from further mourning; women of the family could be nominated to continue mourning on behalf of the entire household, for up to 10 months, releasing their menfolk from the strictures of formal mourning, and back into public life and its obligations [111]\n\n\nGrave goods\nGrave goods for adults could include fine quality clothing, personal ornaments, perfumes, food and drink, and blood, which the deceased presumably needed, or enjoyed Lamps were ubiquitous [112] From the earliest times, food and drink, and sacrifices to deities, were generally offered in ollae; these were often used to contain the inhumed ashes of the deceased; the ashes of several individuals might thus be accommodated on a single tomb-shelf [113]\n\n\nAdults\nGrave goods for adults could include fine quality clothing, personal ornaments, perfumes, food and drink, and blood, which the deceased presumably needed, or enjoyed Lamps were ubiquitous [112] From the earliest times, food and drink, and sacrifices to deities, were generally offered in ollae; these were often used to contain the inhumed ashes of the deceased; the ashes of several individuals might thus be accommodated on a single tomb-shelf [113]\n\n\nInfants and children\nRoman literary and legal sources declared that concern for dead, un-teethed newborns was irrational, and mourning them was self-indulgent and hysterical Nevertheless, grave goods in infant burials could include toys, pets, food and images of protective childhood or birth deities, to guard the child's soul on its journey [115] Cemeteries containing an unusually high number of infant and child burials could indicate a nearby shrine or sanctuary, since lost, where parents had sought divine intervention and healing for children who had died despite their efforts [116] Cemeteries with disproportionately scant material evidence of infant or still-born deaths have been interpreted as confirmatory evidence for a general lack of care, or a culture of emotional indifference to the very young; this apparent lack may have more to do with soil conditions unfavourable to the preservation of infant remains, carelessness in past excavations, and over-reliance on the opinionated and unreliable pronouncements of elite literary sources as a guide to contemporary practice, and thus to the planning of later excavations [117]\n\n\nCommemorations\nThe care and cultivation of the dead did not end with the funeral and formal period of mourning, but was a perpetual obligation Cicero states that the main and overriding function of the priesthood with respect to the dead accorded with universal, natural law: to keep alive the memory of the deceased, by holding the traditional rites [123] Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased, an expectation of afterlife and their personal association with the gods [124] As Roman society developed, its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead, and more on monumental endowments to the community, such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was durably commemorated by their statue and inscribed name [125] Elite, private tomb inscriptions offer evidence for a very wide range of memorial practices, such as funeral games, drawn from neighbouring cultures and communities.\n\n\nFuneral games (ludi funebres)\nRoman and Greek literature offers dramatic accounts of games to honour or propitiate the spirits of the dead In Homer's Iliad, Book 23, funeral games are held by Achilles to honour Patroclus, and in Virgil's Aeneid, Book 5, Aeneas holds games on the anniversary of his father's death Very similar episodes are depicted on the walls of elite tombs in Etruria, and Campania; some appear to show combats to the death The first such ludi funebres in Rome were given in 264 BC, during the war against Carthage; three pairs of gladiators fought to the death at the pyre of Brutus Pera, in what was described as a munus (pl munera), a duty or provision owed to an ancestor by his descendants – in this case, his son  A feast was provided for friends and family; this may have been on the last day of the novendialis [126] Similar gladiatora munera became a core event at elite Roman funeral games In the late Republic, a munus held for the funeral of the ex-consul and Pontifex Maximus Publius Licinius in 183 BC involved 120 gladiators fighting over 3 days, public distribution of meat (visceratio data) and the crowding of the forum with dining couches and tents as venue for the  feast [127]\n\n\nFestivals and cults of the dead\nStarting on 13 February, dead parents and their ancestors were honoured at a nine-day annual festival, the Parentalia, a legal obligation of every paterfamilias Its opening rites were performed by the Vestal Virgins Families made their various ways to the extramural cemeteries where their ancestors had been laid to rest, and held extravagant feasts at their family tombs Behaviour at Parentalia varied between ostentatious public display and (according to Christian witnesses) drunken joie de vivre The last day of Parentalia was Feralia (21 February), a somewhat darker affair in which the ancestors (the di Manes) were placated with \"an arrangement of wreaths, a sprinkling of grain and a bit of salt, bread soaked in wine and violets scattered about\" Feralia was also an exorcism: Ovid thought it a more rustic, primitive and ancient affair than the Parentalia itself It appears to have functioned as a cleansing ritual for Caristia on the following day, when the family held an informal banquet to celebrate the mutual affection between themselves and their benevolent ancestral dead (whom Ovid identifies as Lares) [134] The midnight rites of the Lemuria festival (9, 11, and 13 May), were yet more ancient and obscure; families were redeemed at midnight from the potentially threatening lemures, undertood to be vagrant or resentful di manes or di parentes, the spirits of those family members who had died  \"before their time\" (through disease, accident or violence) and could not enter a full afterlife until they reached a \"natural term\" Until then, their yearly care, or exorcism as malignant spirits, was a duty of the family's paterfamilias, who must spit black beans onto the floor of the family home at midnight, as food for the dead Any malign spirit not satisfied by this offering could be exorcised from the domus by the family's loud clashing of bronze pots [135] [136]\n\n\nEpitaphs\nEpitaphs are one of the major classes of inscriptions  Additional information varies, but collectively, Roman epitaphs offer information on family relationships, political offices, [143] and Roman values, in choosing what aspects of the deceased's life to praise In a funeral culture that sought to perpetuate remembrance of the dead beyond the power of individual memory, epitaphs and markers counted for a lot The inscription sit tibi terra levis (commonly abbreviated as S·T·T·L) is a commonplace marking on funerary items, approximately translating as \"May the earth rest lightly on you\" A standard Roman funerary dedication is Dis Manibus (\"to the Manes-gods\") Regional variations include its Greek equivalent, theoîs katachthoníois [144] and Lugdunum's locally commonplace but mysterious \"dedicated under the trowel\" (sub ascia dedicare) [145] [146] There is a profound shift in content during the rise in dominance of Christianity While traditional epitaphs usually note the person's day of birth, earthly achievements and lifespan, [84] Christian inscriptions tend to emphasise the day of death, a transition to a hoped-for heavenly \"new life\" [147]\n\n\nFunerary art\nThe \"images\" (sing. imago, pl. imagines) displayed by some noble Roman families at funerals were usually kept in cabinets made for the purpose, in the atrium of their family home [156] There is some uncertainty about whether these imagines maiorum (\"images of the great ones\") were funeral masks, lifemasks, busts, or all of these The \"images\" could be arranged in a family tree, with a title (titulus) summarizing the individual's offices held (honores) and accomplishments (res gestae), [157] a practice that might be facilitated by hanging masks [158] In any case, portrait busts of family members in stone or bronze were displayed in the home as well [159]\n\n\nImagines (\"images\")\nThe \"images\" (sing. imago, pl. imagines) displayed by some noble Roman families at funerals were usually kept in cabinets made for the purpose, in the atrium of their family home [156] There is some uncertainty about whether these imagines maiorum (\"images of the great ones\") were funeral masks, lifemasks, busts, or all of these The \"images\" could be arranged in a family tree, with a title (titulus) summarizing the individual's offices held (honores) and accomplishments (res gestae), [157] a practice that might be facilitated by hanging masks [158] In any case, portrait busts of family members in stone or bronze were displayed in the home as well [159]\n\n\nGraves, tombs, and cemeteries\n\nIn Rome, burial places were \"always limited and frequently contested\" [166] The legislation that forbade almost all burial within the ritual boundaries of Roman cities and towns led to the development of necropolises alongside extramural roads, veritable \"cities of the dead\", with their own main and access roads, water supplies and prime development sites for grand monuments or mausolea Amenities for visitors included rooms for family dining, kitchens and kitchen gardens There was no zoning as such; the burial consecrated the ground, not vice versa, and the land beyond each tomb's perimeter was profane, open to public access [167] Plots could be rented or bought, with or without user-ready or customised tombs The great cemetery of Isola Sacra and the tombs that line both sides of the Via Appia Antica offer notable examples of roadside cemeteries [168] In the city of Rome, tombs also lined both embankments of the Tiber, a major waterway whose towpaths and wharves were in near-constant use Tombs were still being built there in the Imperial era, despite the hindrances they must have posed to businesses at docks and wharves, and the planning, building and maintenance of riverine roadways, bridges and aqueducts Rome was virtually encircled by its dead [169]\n\nUrban and suburban\n\nIn Rome, burial places were \"always limited and frequently contested\" [166] The legislation that forbade almost all burial within the ritual boundaries of Roman cities and towns led to the development of necropolises alongside extramural roads, veritable \"cities of the dead\", with their own main and access roads, water supplies and prime development sites for grand monuments or mausolea Amenities for visitors included rooms for family dining, kitchens and kitchen gardens There was no zoning as such; the burial consecrated the ground, not vice versa, and the land beyond each tomb's perimeter was profane, open to public access [167] Plots could be rented or bought, with or without user-ready or customised tombs The great cemetery of Isola Sacra and the tombs that line both sides of the Via Appia Antica offer notable examples of roadside cemeteries [168] In the city of Rome, tombs also lined both embankments of the Tiber, a major waterway whose towpaths and wharves were in near-constant use Tombs were still being built there in the Imperial era, despite the hindrances they must have posed to businesses at docks and wharves, and the planning, building and maintenance of riverine roadways, bridges and aqueducts Rome was virtually encircled by its dead [169]\n\nRural villas and estates\nA likely majority of Romans (Hopkins, 1981, calculates 80–90%) spent their entire lives in rural poverty, working on farms and villa estates as tenants, free labourers or slaves Wealthy landowners used the income from their farms to support town houses, military and political careers, and a lifestyle of cultured leisure (otium) While some affected to despise money, farming was represented as an entirely appropriate, intrinsically noble occupation [181] By the 2nd century BC, the monumental tombs of aristocrats were a part of the rural and suburban villa landscape, surrounded by tombs of lesser family members, outnumbered by the humbler tombs of the bailiffs, commoner-tenants, and slaves who ran the place Far from the main roads between towns and cities, the graves of field-workers occupied poor ground not worth the planting or grazing; landowners could offer burial space on their own property for whoever they wished, and wherever they pleased; graves were sacred no matter where In his capacity as a land surveyor, Siculus Flaccus found that grave markers at the edge of estates were easily mistaken for boundary markers (cippi) Many of the elite chose burial among their ancestors at the family farm and villa, until the emperor Marcus Aurelius banned the practice in an effort to limit the spread of the Antonine Plague (165 to 180 AD) The ban remained in place until at least the 4th century Heirs might be obliged by the terms of their inheritance to keep their inheritance whole, not sell it piecemeal, and to keep the family name alive; this could be done by leaving the property to freedmen, who adopted the name of the master who freed them Whoever inherited or bought a property automatically acquired its graves, monuments and resident deities, including its dii Manes and Lares, who were closely associated – at least in popular opinion – with ancestor cult If the family villa had to be sold, it was not unusual for the contract of sale to maintain the vendor's traditional rights of access to their family tombs, so that they could continue to observe their ancestral and commemorative rites and duties [182]\n\n\nCommon graves\nA funeral ceremony acceptable to the Roman elite might represent several times the annual income of the average citizen, and an impossibility to the very poor, dependent on charity or an unpredictable day-wage, unable to afford or maintain a burial-club subscription The social status of the poorest citizens might have been marginally better than a slave, but their prospect of decent burial could be much worse Some were doubtless unlawfully dumped by their relatives, or by the aediles or rather, by their assistants Several historical burial crises are known, mostly relating to famines and plagues and the overwhelming of facilities for disposal [183]\n\n\nBasic pit graves\nThe least costly form of individual inhumation was the simple pit-grave [184] It was used, in various forms, throughout the Republic and Empire, especially where there was little or no pressure for burial space Orientation of the grave was generally east – west, with the head to the east [185] Flanged tiles (or tegulae) were sometimes used to enclose and protect the remains in a box-like or gabled ceramic tomb, known in modern archaeology as Alla cappuccina (\"like a Capuchin monk's hood\") Libations during ceremonies honouring the dead were sometimes given through a tube or funnel that pierced the tomb, and could be stoppered when not in use Grave goods were often deposited along with the body; a pillow of tufa or wood might be provided for the comfort of the deceased [184] [186]\n\n\nHouse tombs,  Columbaria  and  mausoleums\n\"House tombs\" for well-off, prominent but in most cases, probably sub-elite families were often contained within a low-walled exterior precinct, which might include a garden The exterior of such tombs could be highly decorative, designed to provoke the notice and curiosity of passers-by, rather like the semi-public atria of private town-houses in function, if not appearance Most had a decorated room for banqueting, complete with shelving, cooking facilities and stone-built banqueting couches or space for couches to be brought in, and either sarcophagi containing the immured dead or cinerary altars or urns containing their ashes Entry to the inner rooms was likely privileged to family members, most of whom could anticipate their own burial here, rewarding their commitment to care of their departed relatives [187] Slaves freed by their master's will took on their former owner's family name and many of their family responsibilities In due course, their own names and epitaphs might be added to those already listed on the tomb frontage, a dynastic history to be read by any passer-by Most tomb owners made provision in their wills to cover the cost of family banquets and festivals, whose observance would gradually transform the deceased from \"polluted body to sanctified ancestor\" [188]\n\n\nSarcophagi\nThe funerary urns in which the ashes of the cremated were placed were gradually overtaken in popularity by the sarcophagus as inhumation became more common Particularly in the 2nd–4th centuries, these were often decorated with reliefs that became an important vehicle for Late Roman sculpture The scenes depicted were drawn from mythology, religious beliefs pertaining to the mysteries, allegories, history, or scenes of hunting or feasting Many sarcophagi depict Nereids, fantastical sea creatures, and other marine imagery that may allude to the location of the Isles of the Blessed across the sea, with a portrait of the deceased on a seashell [199] The sarcophagus of a child may show tender representations of family life, Cupids, or children playing Some tomb inscriptions name infants, and depict episodes from their brief lives on sarcophagi They are depicted as well-grown children, regardless of their age or context, and never as newborns They would have thus been included in the family's memorial festivals [200]\n\n\nMilitary funerals and burial\n\"The cult of the dead\", it has been noted, [204] \"was particularly important to men whose profession exposed them to a premature demise\" The Roman value of pietas encompassed the desire of soldiers to honor their fallen comrades, though the conditions of war might interfere with the timely performance of traditional rites [204] Soldiers killed in battle on foreign soil with ongoing hostilities were probably given a mass cremation or burial [205] Under less urgent circumstances, they might be cremated individually, and their ashes placed in a vessel for transport to a permanent burial site [206] When the Roman army under the command of Publius Quinctilius Varus suffered their disastrous defeat at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD, they remained uncommemorated until Germanicus and his troops located the battlefield a few years later and made a funeral mound for their remains [207]\n\n\nAfterlife\nLike their Etruscan neighbours, the Romans held a deepseated notion that the individual soul survived death They went to great lengths to help their dead feel comfortable, and \"at home\" in the tomb Several quite different but concurrent beliefs and customs seem to have been held regarding an afterlife Some epitaphs and sculptural representations suggest that the deceased rested \"in the bosom of a kindly Mother Earth\" While individual souls were thought to merge into an undifferentiated collective of underworld deities (dii inferii) known as Manes gods, the naming of the deceased as an individual and the provision of grave goods implies that at least some personal qualities, needs and preferences were believed to survive along with the soul, which resided in or with the body or ashes in the dark of the grave, or within the memories of those who mourned their loss Standard accounts of Roman mythology describe the soul as immortal [211] and judged at death before a tribunal in the underworld, with those who had done good being sent to the Elysian Fields and those who had done ill sent to Tartarus [212] It is unclear how ancient, persistent and widely held such beliefs could have been; they seem influenced by Greek mythology and mystery cults Strict Stoics and Epicurians declared the soul a material quality, drawn at death from its bodily home to rejoin an indistinct universal life-force Belief in the persistence of an individual soul after death is evident in domestic and ancestor-cult practices that seek to feed, satisfy and sustain the soul as a familiar spirit, still imbued with an identity, personality and preferences, and a tendency to care for those who care for it; a divinised ancestor, rather than just one of a vast and impersonal community of shadowy Manes gods [213]\n\n\nReligion\nLike their Etruscan neighbours, the Romans held a deepseated notion that the individual soul survived death They went to great lengths to help their dead feel comfortable, and \"at home\" in the tomb Several quite different but concurrent beliefs and customs seem to have been held regarding an afterlife Some epitaphs and sculptural representations suggest that the deceased rested \"in the bosom of a kindly Mother Earth\" While individual souls were thought to merge into an undifferentiated collective of underworld deities (dii inferii) known as Manes gods, the naming of the deceased as an individual and the provision of grave goods implies that at least some personal qualities, needs and preferences were believed to survive along with the soul, which resided in or with the body or ashes in the dark of the grave, or within the memories of those who mourned their loss Standard accounts of Roman mythology describe the soul as immortal [211] and judged at death before a tribunal in the underworld, with those who had done good being sent to the Elysian Fields and those who had done ill sent to Tartarus [212] It is unclear how ancient, persistent and widely held such beliefs could have been;

a divinised ancestor, rather than just one of a vast and impersonal community of shadowy Manes gods [213]\n\n\nPhilosophy\nThe mainstream of Roman philosophy, such as the Stoics, advocated contemplation and acceptance of the inevitability of death of all mortals \"It is necessary for some to stay and for others to go, all the while rejoicing with those who are with us, yet not grieving for those departing\" [215] To grieve bitterly is to fail to perceive and accept the nature of things Epictetus encouraged contemplation of one's loved ones as a \"jar\" or \"crystal cup\" which might break and be remembered without troubling the spirit, since \"you love a mortal, something not your own It has been given to you for the present, not inseparably nor forever, but like a fig.. at a fixed season of the year If you yearn for it in the winter, you are a fool.\" [216]\nThere was no real consensus, at least among surviving Roman texts and epitaphs, of what happened to a person after death, nor on the existence of an afterlife Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia claims that most people are of the opinion that after death one returns to the non-sensing state that occurred before birth but admits, however scornfully, that there are people who believe in the immortality of the soul Seneca the Younger seems to be less consistent, arguing both sides, indicating that death brings about utter annihilation while also talking about some survival of the spirit after it escapes from the prison of the body [217] Tacitus at the end of Agricola takes the opposite opinion to Pliny, and claims that the wise believe the spirit does not die with the body, although he may be specifically referring to the pious – which harkens to the mythological idea of Elysium.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Vietnam_War", "content": "\nNames\nVarious names have been applied and have shifted over time, though Vietnam War is the most commonly used title in English It has been called the Second Indochina War since it spread to Laos and Cambodia, [67] the Vietnam Conflict, [68] [69] and Nam (colloquially 'Nam) In Vietnam it is commonly known as Kháng chiến chống Mỹ (lit. 'Resistance War against America') [70] [71] The Government of Vietnam officially refers to it as the Resistance War against America to Save the Nation [72] It is sometimes called the American War [73]\n\n\nBackground\nVietnam had been under French control as part of French Indochina since the mid-19th century Under French rule, Vietnamese nationalism was suppressed, so revolutionary groups conducted their activities abroad, particularly in France and China One such nationalist, Nguyen Sinh Cung, established the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930, a Marxist–Leninist political organization which operated primarily in Hong Kong and the Soviet Union The party aimed to overthrow French rule and establish an independent communist state in Vietnam [74]\n\n\nJapanese occupation of Indochina\nIn September 1940, Japan invaded French Indochina, following France's capitulation to Nazi Germany French influence was suppressed by the Japanese, and in 1941 Cung, now known as Ho Chi Minh, returned to Vietnam to establish the Viet Minh, an anti-Japanese resistance movement that advocated for independence [74] The Viet Minh received aid from the Allies, namely the US, Soviet Union, and Republic of China Beginning in 1944, the US Office of Strategic Services (O.S.S.) provided the Viet Minh with weapons, ammunition, and training to fight the occupying Japanese and Vichy French forces [75] [76] Throughout the war, Vietnamese guerrilla resistance against the Japanese grew dramatically, and by the end of 1944 the Viet Minh had grown to over 500,000 members [77] US President Franklin D Roosevelt was an ardent supporter of Vietnamese resistance, and proposed that Vietnam's independence be granted under an international trusteeship following the war [78]\n\n\nFirst Indochina War\nTensions between the Viet Minh and French authorities had erupted into full-scale war by 1946, a conflict which soon became entwined with the wider Cold War On March 12, 1947, US President Harry S Truman announced the Truman Doctrine, an anticommunist foreign policy which pledged US support to nations resisting \"attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures\" [80] In Indochina, this doctrine was first put into practice in February 1950, when the United States recognized the French-backed State of Vietnam in Saigon, led by former Emperor Bảo Đại, as the legitimate government of Vietnam, after the communist states of the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China recognized the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by Ho Chi Minh, as the legitimate Vietnamese government the previous month [81]: 377–379  [25]: 88  The outbreak of the Korean War in June convinced Washington policymakers that the war in Indochina was another example of communist expansionism, directed by the Soviet Union [25]: 33–35 \n\n\nBattle of Dien Bien Phu\nDuring the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, US carriers sailed to the Gulf of Tonkin and the US conducted reconnaissance flights France and the US discussed the use of tactical nuclear weapons, though reports of how seriously this was considered and by whom, are vague [84] [25]: 75  According to then-Vice President Richard Nixon, the Joint Chiefs of Staff drew up plans to use nuclear weapons to support the French [84] Nixon, a so-called \"hawk\", suggested the US might have to \"put American boys in\" [7]: 76  President Dwight D Eisenhower made American participation contingent on British support, but the British were opposed [7]: 76  Eisenhower, wary of involving the US in an Asian land war, decided against intervention [25]: 75–76  Throughout the conflict, US intelligence estimates remained skeptical of France's chance of success [85]\n\n\nTransition period\nAt the 1954 Geneva Conference, Vietnam was temporarily partitioned at the 17th parallel Ho Chi Minh wished to continue war in the south, but was restrained by Chinese allies who convinced him he could win control by electoral means [88] [25]: 87–88  Under the Geneva Accords, civilians were allowed to move freely between the two provisional states for a 300-day period Elections throughout the country were to be held in 1956 to establish a unified government [25]: 88–90  However, the US, represented at the conference by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, objected to the resolution; Dulles' objection was supported only by the representative of Bảo Đại [76] John Foster's brother, Allen Dulles, who was director of the Central Intelligence Agency, then initiated a psychological warfare campaign which exaggerated anti-Catholic sentiment among the Viet Minh and distributed propaganda attributed to Viet Minh threatening an American attack on Hanoi with atomic bombs [76] [89] [25]: 96–97 \n\n\nDiệm era, 1954–1963\nA devout Roman Catholic, Diệm was fervently anti-communist, nationalist, and socially conservative Historian Luu Doan Huynh notes \"Diệm represented narrow and extremist nationalism coupled with autocracy and nepotism.\" [81]: 200–201  Most Vietnamese were Buddhist, and alarmed by Diệm's actions, like his dedication of the country to the Virgin Mary.\n\n\nRule\nA devout Roman Catholic, Diệm was fervently anti-communist, nationalist, and socially conservative Historian Luu Doan Huynh notes \"Diệm represented narrow and extremist nationalism coupled with autocracy and nepotism.\" [81]: 200–201  Most Vietnamese were Buddhist, and alarmed by Diệm's actions, like his dedication of the country to the Virgin Mary.\n\n\nInsurgency in the South, 1954–1960\nBetween 1954 and 1957, the Diệm government succeeded in preventing large-scale organized unrest in the countryside In April 1957, insurgents launched an assassination campaign, referred to as \"extermination of traitors\" [105] 17 people were killed in the Châu Đốc massacre at a bar in July, and in September a district chief was killed with his family [51] By early 1959, Diệm had come to regard the violence as an organized campaign and implemented Law 10/59, which made political violence punishable by death and property confiscation [106] There had been division among former Viet Minh, whose main goal was to hold elections promised in the Geneva Accords, leading to \"wildcat\" activities separate from the other communists and anti-GVN activists Douglas Pike estimated that insurgents carried out 2,000 abductions, and 1,700 assassinations of government officials, village chiefs, hospital workers and teachers from 1957 to 1960 [25]: 106  [51] Violence between insurgents and government forces increased drastically from 180 clashes in January 1960, to 545 clashes in September [107]\n\n\nNorth Vietnamese involvement\nIn March 1956, southern communist leader Lê Duẩn presented a plan to revive the insurgency entitled \"The Road to the South\" to the Politburo in Hanoi However, as China and the Soviets opposed confrontation, his plan was rejected [53]: 58  Despite this, the North Vietnamese leadership approved tentative measures to revive southern insurgency in December 1956 [50] Communist forces were under a single command structure set up in 1958 [109] In May 1958, North Vietnamese forces seized the transportation hub at Tchepone in Southern Laos near the demilitarized zone, between North and South Vietnam [110]: 24 \n\n\nKennedy's escalation, 1961–1963\nIn the 1960 U.S presidential election, Senator John F Kennedy defeated incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon Although Eisenhower warned Kennedy about Laos and Vietnam, Europe and Latin America \"loomed larger than Asia on his sights.\" [92]: 264   In June 1961, he bitterly disagreed with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev when they met in Vienna to discuss key U.S.–Soviet issues Only 16 months later, the Cuban Missile Crisis (October 1962) played out on television worldwide It was the closest the Cold War came to nuclear war.\n\n\nOusting and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm\nThe inept performance of the ARVN was exemplified by failed actions such as the Battle of Ấp Bắc on 2 January 1963, in which a band of Viet Cong won a battle against a much larger and better-equipped South Vietnamese force, many of whose officers seemed reluctant even to engage in combat [120]: 201–206  The South Vietnamese lost 83 soldiers and 5 US war helicopters, serving to ferry troops shot down by Vietcong forces, while the Vietcong lost only 18 soldiers The ARVN forces were led by Diệm's most trusted general, Huỳnh Văn Cao Cao was a Catholic, promoted due to religion and fidelity rather than skill, and his main job was to preserve his forces to stave off coups Policymakers in Washington began to conclude Diệm was incapable of defeating the communists and might even make a deal with Ho Chi Minh He seemed concerned only with fending off coups and had become paranoid after attempts in 1960 and 1962, which he partly attributed to US encouragement As Robert F Kennedy noted, \"Diệm wouldn't make even the slightest concessions He was difficult to reason with ...\" [121] Historian James Gibson summed up the situation:\n\n\nGulf of Tonkin and Johnson's escalation, 1963–1969\nPresident Kennedy was assassinated on 22 November 1963 Vice President Lyndon B Johnson had not been heavily involved with policy toward Vietnam; [131] [A 9] however, upon becoming president, he immediately focused it On 24 November 1963, he said, \"the battle against communism .. must be joined .. with strength and determination.\" [133] Johnson knew he had inherited a  deteriorating situation in South Vietnam, [134] but adhered to the widely accepted domino argument for defending the South: Should they retreat or appease, either action would imperil other nations [135] Findings from RAND's Viet Cong Motivation and Morale Project bolstered his confidence that an air war would weaken the Viet Cong Some argue the policy of North Vietnam was not to topple other non-communist governments in South East Asia [81]: 48 \n\n\nGulf of Tonkin incident\nOn 2 August 1964, USS Maddox, on an intelligence mission along North Vietnam's coast, fired upon and damaged torpedo boats approaching it in the Gulf of Tonkin [56]: 124  A second attack was reported two days later on USS Turner Joy and Maddox The circumstances were murky [25]: 218–219   Johnson commented to Undersecretary of State George Ball that \"those sailors out there may have been shooting at flying fish.\" [136] An NSA publication declassified in 2005 revealed there was no attack on 4 August [137]\n\n\nBombing of Laos\nBombing was not restricted to North Vietnam Other aerial campaigns, targeted different parts of the Viet Cong and PAVN infrastructure These included the Ho Chi Minh trail supply route, which ran through Laos and Cambodia The ostensibly neutral Laos had become the scene of a civil war, pitting the Laotian government backed by the US, against the Pathet Lao and its North Vietnamese allies.\n\n\nThe 1964 offensive\nFollowing the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Hanoi anticipated the arrival of US troops and began expanding the Viet Cong, as well as sending increasing numbers of North Vietnamese personnel southwards They were outfitting the Viet Cong forces and standardizing their equipment with AK-47 rifles and other supplies, as well as forming the 9th Division [25]: 223  [143] \"From a strength of approximately 5,000 at the start of 1959 the Viet Cong's ranks grew to about 100,000 at the end of 1964 .. Between 1961 and 1964 the Army's strength rose from about 850,000 to nearly a million men.\" [124] U.S troop numbers deployed to Vietnam during the same period were much lower: 2,000 in 1961, rising to 16,500 in 1964 [144] The use of captured equipment decreased, while greater numbers of ammunition and supplies were required to maintain regular units Group 559 was tasked with expanding the Ho Chi Minh trail, in light of the bombardment by US warplanes The war had shifted into the final, conventional phase of Hanoi's three-stage protracted warfare model The Viet Cong was now tasked with destroying the ARVN and capturing and holding areas; however, it was not yet strong enough to assault major towns and cities.\n\n\nAmerican ground war\nOn 8 March 1965, 3,500 U.S Marines were landed near Da Nang, South Vietnam [25]: 246–247  This marked the beginning of the American ground war U.S public opinion overwhelmingly supported the deployment [147] The Marines' initial assignment was defense of Da Nang Air Base The first deployment of 3,500 in March 1965 was increased to nearly 200,000 by December [81]: 349–351  U.S military had long been schooled in offensive warfare Regardless of political policies, U.S commanders were institutionally and psychologically unsuited to a defensive mission [81]: 349–351 \n\n\nTet Offensive and its aftermath\nIn late 1967, the PAVN lured American forces into the hinterlands at Đắk Tô and at the Marine Khe Sanh combat base, where the U.S fought The Hill Fights These were part of a diversionary strategy meant to draw US forces towards the Central Highlands [159] Preparations were underway for the Tet Offensive, with the intention of Văn Tiến Dũng forces to launch \"direct attacks on the American and puppet nerve centers—Saigon, Huế, Danang, all the cities, towns and main bases ...\" [160] Le Duan sought to placate critics of the stalemate by planning a decisive victory [161]: 90–94  He reasoned this could be achieved through sparking an uprising within the towns and cities, [161]: 148  along with mass defections among ARVN units, who were on leave during the truce period [162]\n\n\nVietnamization, 1969–1972\nPresident Nixon began troop withdrawals in 1969 His plan to build up the ARVN so it could take over the defense of South Vietnam became known as \"Vietnamization\" As the PAVN/VC recovered from their 1968 losses and avoided contact, Creighton Abrams conducted operations aimed at disrupting logistics, with better use of firepower and more cooperation with the ARVN [25]: 517  In October 1969, Nixon had ordered B-52s loaded with nuclear weapons to race to the border of Soviet airspace to convince the Soviet Union, in accord with the madman theory, he was capable of anything to end the Vietnam War [179] [180] Nixon had sought détente with the Soviet Union and rapprochement with China, which decreased tensions and led to nuclear arms reductions However, the Soviets continued to supply the North Vietnamese [181] [182]\n\n\nNuclear threats and diplomacy\nPresident Nixon began troop withdrawals in 1969 His plan to build up the ARVN so it could take over the defense of South Vietnam became known as \"Vietnamization\" As the PAVN/VC recovered from their 1968 losses and avoided contact, Creighton Abrams conducted operations aimed at disrupting logistics, with better use of firepower and more cooperation with the ARVN [25]: 517  In October 1969, Nixon had ordered B-52s loaded with nuclear weapons to race to the border of Soviet airspace to convince the Soviet Union, in accord with the madman theory, he was capable of anything to end the Vietnam War [179] [180] Nixon had sought détente with the Soviet Union and rapprochement with China, which decreased tensions and led to nuclear arms reductions However, the Soviets continued to supply the North Vietnamese [181] [182]\n\n\nHanoi's war strategy\nIn September 1969, Ho Chi Minh died aged 79 [183] The failure of the 1968 Tet Offensive to spark a popular uprising in the south caused a shift in Hanoi's war strategy, and the Giáp-Chinh \"Northern-First\" faction regained control over military affairs from the Lê Duẩn-Hoàng Văn Thái \"Southern-First\" faction [184]: 272–274  An unconventional victory was sidelined in favor of a conventional victory through conquest [161]: 196–205  Large-scale offensives were rolled back in favor of small-unit and sapper attacks as well as targeting the pacification and Vietnamization strategy [184] Following Tet, the PAVN had transformed from a light-infantry, limited mobility force into a high-mobile and mechanized combined arms force [184]: 189  By 1970, over 70% of communist troops in the south were northerners, and southern-dominated VC units no longer existed [185]\n\n\nU.S. domestic controversies\nThe anti-war movement was gaining strength in the US Nixon appealed to the \"silent majority\" who he said supported the war without showing it But revelations of the 1968 My Lai Massacre, [25]: 518–521  in which a US Army unit under Captain Ernest Medina raped and killed civilians, and the 1969 \"Green Beret Affair\", where 8 Special Forces soldiers, were arrested for the murder [186] of a suspected double agent, [187] provoked national and international outrage.\n\n\nCollapsing U.S. morale\nFollowing the Tet Offensive and decreasing support among the US public, US forces began a period of morale collapse, and disobedience [189]: 349–350  [190]: 166–175  At home, desertion rates quadrupled from 1966 levels [191] Among the enlisted, only 2.5% chose infantry combat positions in 1969–70 [191] ROTC enrollment decreased from 191,749 in 1966 to 72,459 by 1971, [192] and reached a low of 33,220 in 1974, [193] depriving US forces of much-needed military leadership.\n\n\nARVN taking the lead and U.S. ground force withdrawal\nBeginning in 1969, American troops were withdrawn from border areas where most of the fighting took place and redeployed along the coast and interior US casualties in 1970 were less than half of 1969, after being relegated to less active combat [197] While US forces were redeployed, the ARVN took over combat operations, with casualties double US casualties in 1969, and more than triple US ones in 1970 [198] In the post-Tet environment, membership in the South Vietnamese Regional Force and Popular Force militias grew, and they were now more capable of providing village security, which the Americans had not accomplished [198]\n\n\nCambodia\nPrince Norodom Sihanouk had proclaimed Cambodia neutral since 1955, [203] but permitted the PAVN/Viet Cong to use the port of Sihanoukville and the Sihanouk Trail In March 1969 Nixon launched a secret bombing campaign, called Operation Menu, against communist sanctuaries along the Cambodia/Vietnam border Only five high-ranking congressional officials were informed [A 11]\n\n\nLaos\nBuilding on the success of ARVN units in Cambodia, and further testing the Vietnamization program, the ARVN were tasked with Operation Lam Son 719 in February 1971, the first major ground operation to attack the Ho Chi Minh trail, at the crossroad of Tchepone This offensive was the first time the PAVN would field-test its combined arms force [161] The first few days were a success, but momentum slowed after fierce resistance Thiệu had halted the general advance, leaving armored divisions able to surround them [207]\n\n\nEaster Offensive and Paris Peace Accords, 1972\nVietnamization was again tested by the Easter Offensive of 1972, a conventional PAVN invasion of South Vietnam The PAVN overran the northern provinces and attacked from Cambodia, threatening to cut the country in half US troop withdrawals continued, but American airpower responded, beginning Operation Linebacker, and the offensive was halted [25]: 606–637  The US Navy also initiated Operation Pocket Money in May, an aerial mining campaign in Haiphong Harbor that prevented North Vietnam's allies from resupplying it with weapons and aid by sea [209]\n\n\nU.S. exit and final campaigns, 1973–1975\nIn the lead-up to the ceasefire on 28 January, both sides attempted to maximize land and population under their control in a campaign known as the War of the flags Fighting continued after the ceasefire, without US participation, and throughout the year [156]: 508–513  North Vietnam was allowed to continue supplying troops in the South but only to replace expended material The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Kissinger and Thọ, but the North Vietnamese negotiator declined it saying true peace did not yet exist.\n\n\nCampaign 275\nOn 10 March 1975, General Dung launched Campaign 275, a limited offensive into the Central Highlands, supported by tanks and heavy artillery The target was Ban Ma Thuột; if the town could be taken, the provincial capital Pleiku and the road to the coast, would be exposed for a campaign in 1976 The ARVN proved incapable of resisting the onslaught, and its forces collapsed Again, Hanoi was surprised by the speed of their success Dung urged the Politburo to allow him to seize Pleiku immediately and turn his attention to Kon Tum He argued that with two months of good weather until onset of the monsoon, it would be irresponsible not to take advantage [7]\n\n\nFinal North Vietnamese offensive\nWith the north half of the country under their control, the Politburo ordered Dung to launch the final offensive against Saigon The operational plan for the Ho Chi Minh Campaign called for Saigon's capture before 1 May Hanoi wished to avoid the coming monsoon and prevent redeployment of ARVN forces defending the capital Northern forces, their morale boosted by their recent victories, rolled on, taking Nha Trang, Cam Ranh and Da Lat [25]: 702–704 \n\n\nFall of Saigon\nChaos and panic broke out as hysterical South Vietnamese officials and civilians scrambled to leave Martial law was declared American helicopters began evacuating South Vietnamese, US and foreign nationals from the city and the U.S embassy compound Operation Frequent Wind had been delayed until the last possible moment, because of Ambassador Graham Martin's belief Saigon could be held and a political settlement reached Frequent Wind was the largest helicopter evacuation in history It began on 29 April, in an atmosphere of desperation, as hysterical crowds of Vietnamese vied for limited space Frequent Wind continued around the clock, as PAVN tanks breached defenses near Saigon In the early morning of 30 April, the last US Marines evacuated the embassy by helicopter, as civilians swamped the perimeter and poured into the grounds [25]: 718–720 \n\n\nOpposition to U.S. involvement\nDuring the course of the war a large segment of Americans became opposed to U.S involvement In January 1967, only 32% of Americans thought the US had made a mistake in sending troops [222] Public opinion steadily turned against the war following 1967 and by 1970 only a third believed the U.S had not made a mistake by sending troops [223] [224]\n\n\nInvolvement of other countries\nChina provided significant support for North Vietnam when the US started to intervene, including financial aid and the deployment of hundreds of thousands of military personnel in support roles China said its military and economic aid to North Vietnam and the Viet Cong totaled $20 billion ($160 billion adjusted for 2022 prices) during the Vietnam War; [6] included were 5 million tons of food to North Vietnam (equivalent to a year's food production), accounting for 10–15% of their food supply by the 1970s [6]\n\n\nPro-Hanoi\nChina provided significant support for North Vietnam when the US started to intervene, including financial aid and the deployment of hundreds of thousands of military personnel in support roles China said its military and economic aid to North Vietnam and the Viet Cong totaled $20 billion ($160 billion adjusted for 2022 prices) during the Vietnam War; [6] included were 5 million tons of food to North Vietnam (equivalent to a year's food production), accounting for 10–15% of their food supply by the 1970s [6]\n\n\nPeople's Republic of China\nChina provided significant support for North Vietnam when the US started to intervene, including financial aid and the deployment of hundreds of thousands of military personnel in support roles China said its military and economic aid to North Vietnam and the Viet Cong totaled $20 billion ($160 billion adjusted for 2022 prices) during the Vietnam War; [6] included were 5 million tons of food to North Vietnam (equivalent to a year's food production), accounting for 10–15% of their food supply by the 1970s [6]\n\n\nSoviet Union\nThe Soviet Union supplied North Vietnam with medical supplies, arms, tanks, planes, helicopters, artillery, anti-aircraft missiles and other military equipment Soviet crews fired Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles at US aircraft in 1965 [230] Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian officials acknowledged that the USSR had stationed up to 3,000 troops in Vietnam [231]\n\n\nPro-Saigon\nAs South Vietnam was formally part of a military alliance with the US, Australia, New Zealand, France, the UK, Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines, the alliance was invoked during the war The UK, France and Pakistan declined to participate, and South Korea, Taiwan, and Spain were non-treaty participants.\n\n\nUnited Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races\nThe ethnic minority peoples of South Vietnam, like the Montagnards in the Central Highlands, the Hindu and Muslim Cham, and the Buddhist Khmer Krom, were actively recruited in the war There was a strategy of recruitment and favorable treatment of Montagnard tribes for the Viet Cong, as they were pivotal for control of infiltration routes [235] Some groups split off and formed the United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races (FULRO) to fight for autonomy or independence FULRO fought against the South Vietnamese and Viet Cong, later fighting against the unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam, after the fall of South Vietnam.\n\n\nWar crimes\nMany war crimes took place, by both sides, including: rape, massacres of civilians, bombings of civilian targets, terrorism, torture, and murder of prisoners of war Additional common crimes included theft, arson, and the destruction of property not warranted by military necessity [236]\n\n\nSouth Vietnamese, Korean and American\nIn 1966, the Russell Tribunal was organized by a number of public figures opposed to the war led by Bertrand Russell in an effort to apply the precepts of international law to the actions of the United States and its allies in Vietnam The tribunal found the US and its allies guilty of acts of aggression, use of weapons forbidden by the laws of war, bombardment of targets of a purely civilian character, mistreatment of prisoners, and genocide Though the tribunal's lack of juridical authority meant its findings were largely ignored by the United States and other governments, the hearings contributed to a growing body of evidence and documentation which established the factual basis for a counter-narrative to the United States' justifications for the war and inspired future hearings, tribunals and legal investigations [237]\n\n\nNorth Vietnamese and Viet Cong\nAmi Pedahzur has written that \"the overall volume and lethality of Viet Cong terrorism rivals or exceeds all but a handful of terrorist campaigns waged over the last third of the twentieth century\", based on the definition of terrorists as a non-state actor, and examining targeted killings and civilian deaths which are estimated at over 18,000 from 1966 to 1969 [252] The US Department of Defense estimates the VC/PAVN had conducted 36,000 murders and 58,000 kidnappings from 1967 to 1972, c. 1973 [253] Benjamin Valentino attributes 45,000–80,000 \"terrorist mass killings\" to the Viet Cong [244] Statistics for 1968–1972 suggest \"about 80 percent of the terrorist victims were ordinary civilians and only about 20 percent were government officials, policemen, members of the self-defence forces or pacification cadres.\" [19]: 273  Viet Cong tactics included frequent mortaring of civilians in refugee camps, and placing of mines on highways frequented by villagers taking goods to urban markets Some mines were set only to go off after heavy vehicle passage, causing slaughter aboard packed civilian buses [19]: 270–279 \n\n\nWomen\nWomen were active in a large variety of roles, making significant impacts and the war having significant impacts on them [257] [258] [259] Several million Vietnamese women served in the military and in militias, particularly in the Viet Cong, with the slogan \"when war comes, even the women must fight\" being widely used [260] These women made vital contributions on the Ho Chi Minh trail, espionage, medical care, logistical and administrative work, and sometimes direct combat [261] [262] Women workers took on more roles in the economy and Vietnam saw an increase in women's rights [263] In Vietnam and elsewhere, women emerged as leaders of anti-war peace campaigns and made significant contributions to war journalism [264]\n\n\nBlack servicemen\nThe experience of African-American military personnel has received significant attention The site \"African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War\" compiles examples, [273] as does the work of journalist Wallace Terry whose book Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans, includes observations about the impact on the black community and black servicemen He notes: the higher proportion of combat casualties among African-American servicemen than other races, the shift toward and different attitudes of black military volunteers and conscripts, the discrimination encountered by black servicemen \"on the battlefield in decorations, promotion and duty assignments\", as well as having to endure \"the racial insults, cross-burnings and Confederate flags of their white comrades\"—and the experiences faced by black soldiers stateside, during the war and after withdrawal [274]\n\n\nWeapons\nNearly all US-allied forces were armed with US weapons including the M1 Garand, M1 carbine, M14 rifle, and M16 rifle The Australian and New Zealand forces employed the 7.62 mm L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle, with occasional use of the M16 rifle.\n\n\nExtent of U.S. bombings\nThe US dropped over 7 million tons of bombs on Indochina during the war, more than triple the 2.1 million tons it dropped on Europe and Asia during World War II, and more than ten times the amount during the Korean War 500 thousand tons were dropped on Cambodia, 1 million tons on North Vietnam, and 4 million tons on South Vietnam On a per person basis, the 2 million tons dropped on Laos make it the most heavily bombed country in history; The New York Times noted this was \"nearly a ton for every person in Laos.\" [142] Due to the particularly heavy impact of cluster bombs, Laos was a strong advocate of the Convention on Cluster Munitions to ban the weapons, and was host to its first meeting in 2010 [276]\n\n\nCasualties\nEstimates of casualties vary, with one source suggesting up to 3.8 million violent war deaths in Vietnam for 1955 to 2002 [279] [280] [281] [4] A demographic study calculated 791,000–1,141,000 war-related deaths during the war for all of Vietnam, for military and civilians [18] Between 195,000 and 430,000 South Vietnamese civilians died in the war [19]: 450–453  [29] Extrapolating from a 1969 US intelligence report, Guenter Lewy estimated 65,000 North Vietnamese civilians died [19]: 450–453  Estimates of civilian deaths caused by American bombing of North Vietnam range from 30,000 [7]: 176, 617  to 182,000 [20] A 1975 US Senate subcommittee estimated 1.4 million South Vietnamese civilians casualties during the war, including 415,000 deaths [242]: 12  The military of South Vietnam suffered an estimated 254,256 killed between 1960 and 1974, and additional deaths from 1954 to 1959 and in 1975 [31]: 275  Other estimates point to higher figures of 313,000 casualties [85] [44] [18] [45] [46] [47]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam [290] Despite speculation that the victorious North Vietnamese would, in Nixon's words, \"massacre the civilians there  [South Vietnam] by the millions,\" no mass executions took place [291] [A 12]\n\n\nIn Southeast Asia\nOn 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam [290] Despite speculation that the victorious North Vietnamese would, in Nixon's words, \"massacre the civilians there  [South Vietnam] by the millions,\" no mass executions took place [291] [A 12]\n\n\nIn Vietnam\nOn 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam [290] Despite speculation that the victorious North Vietnamese would, in Nixon's words, \"massacre the civilians there  [South Vietnam] by the millions,\" no mass executions took place [291] [A 12]\n\n\nLaos and Cambodia\nBy 1975, the North Vietnamese had lost influence over the Khmer Rouge [25]: 708  Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, fell to the Khmer Rouge in April 1975 Under Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge would kill 1–3 million Cambodians out of a population of around 8 million, in one of the bloodiest genocides ever [45] [302] [303] [304]\n\n\nUnexploded ordnance\nUnexploded ordnance, mostly from US bombing, continues to kill people, and has rendered much land hazardous and impossible to cultivate Ordnance has killed 42,000 people since the war ended [306] [307] In Laos, 80 million bombs failed to explode and still remain Unexploded ordnance has killed or injured over 20,000 Laotians since the war and about 50 people are killed or maimed annually [308] [309] It is estimated the explosives buried will not be removed entirely for centuries [161]: 317 \n\n\nRefugee crisis\nOver 3 million people left Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in the Indochina refugee crisis after 1975 Most Asian countries were unwilling to accept them, many of whom fled by boat and were known as boat people [310] Between 1975 and 1998, an estimated 1.2 million refugees from Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries resettled in the US, while Canada, Australia, and France resettled over 500,000, China accepted 250,000 people [311] Laos experienced the largest refugee flight proportionally, 300,000 out of a population of 3 million crossed the border into Thailand Included among their ranks were \"about 90%\" of Laos' \"intellectuals, technicians, and officials.\" [95]: 575  An estimated 200,000 to 400,000 Vietnamese boat people died at sea, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees [312]\n\n\nIn the United States\nFailure of US goals is often placed at different institutions and levels Some have suggested it was due to political failures of leadership [313] Others point to a failure of military doctrine Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated that \"the achievement of a military victory by U.S forces in Vietnam was indeed a dangerous illusion.\" [81]: 368  The inability to bring Hanoi to the bargaining table by bombing illustrated another US miscalculation, and the limitations of military abilities in achieving political goals [92]: 17  Army Chief of Staff Harold Keith Johnson noted, \"if anything came out of Vietnam, it was that air power couldn't do the job.\" [314] General William Westmoreland admitted bombing had been ineffective, saying he doubted \"that the North Vietnamese would have relented.\" [314] Kissinger wrote in a memo to President Ford that \"in terms of military tactics .. our armed forces are not suited to this kind of war Even the Special Forces who had been designed for it could not prevail.\" [315] Hanoi had persistently sought unification since the Geneva Accords, and the effects of US bombing had negligible impact on North Vietnam's goals [161]: 1–10  US bombing mobilized people throughout North Vietnam and international support, due to the perception of a superpower attempting to bomb a significantly smaller, agrarian society into submission [161]: 48–52 \n\n\nFinancial cost\nBetween 1953 and 1975, the US was estimated to have spent $168 billion on the war (equivalent to $1.7 trillion in 2023) [319] This resulted in a large budget deficit Other figures point to $139 billion from 1965 to 1974 (not inflation-adjusted), 10 times all education spending in the US, and 50 times more than housing and community development spending within that period [320] It was stated that war-spending could have paid off every mortgage in the US, with money leftover [320] As of 2013 [update], the US government pays Vietnam veterans and their families more than $22 billion a year in war-related claims [321] [322]\n\n\nImpact on the U.S. military\nMore than 3 million Americans served in the war, 1.5 million of whom saw combat [323] James Westheider wrote that \"At the height of American involvement in 1968, for example, 543,000 American military personnel were stationed in Vietnam, but only 80,000 were considered combat troops.\" [324] Conscription in the US existed since World War II, but ended in 1973 [325] [326]\n\n\nEffects of U.S. chemical defoliation\nOne of the most controversial aspects of the US military effort, was the widespread use of chemical defoliants between 1961 and 1971 20 million gallons of toxic herbicides (like Agent Orange) were sprayed on 6 million acres of forests and crops by the air force [63] They were used to defoliate large parts of the countryside to prevent the Viet Cong from being able to hide weaponry and encampments under the foliage, and deprive them of food Defoliation was used to clear sensitive areas, including base perimeters and possible ambush sites along roads and canals More than 20% of South Vietnam's forests and 3% of its cultivated land was sprayed at least once 90% of herbicide use was directed at forest defoliation [19]: 263  The chemicals used continue to change the landscape, cause diseases and birth defects, and poison the food chain [336] [337] US military records have listed figures including the destruction of 20% of the jungles of South Vietnam and 20-36% of the mangrove forests [62] The environmental destruction caused was described by Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, lawyers, historians and other academics as an ecocide [64] [338] [60] [339] [61] [340]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe war has featured extensively in television, film, video games, music and literature In Vietnam, a notable film set during Operation Linebacker II was Girl from Hanoi (1974) depicting war-time life Another notable work was the diary of Đặng Thùy Trâm, a North Vietnamese doctor who enlisted in the Southern battlefield, and was killed aged 27 by US forces near Quảng Ngãi Her diaries were published in Vietnam as Đặng Thùy Trâm's Diary (Last Night I Dreamed of Peace), where it became a bestseller and was made into a film Don't Burn In Vietnam, the diary has been compared to The Diary of Anne Frank, and both are used in literary education [351]\n\n\nMyths\nMyths play a role in the historiography of the war, and have become part of the culture of the United States Discussion of myth has focused on US experiences, but changing myths of war have played a role in Vietnamese and Australian historiography Scholarship has focused on \"myth-busting\", [353]: 373  attacking orthodox and revisionist schools of American historiography, and challenging myths about American society and soldiery in the war [353]: 373 \n\n\nCommemoration\nOn 25 May 2012, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation of the commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War [355] [356] On 10 November 2017, President Donald Trump issued an additional proclamation commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War [357]

It involved the communist forces of North Vietnam, supported by China and the Soviet Union, against the government of South Vietnam and its main ally, the United States. The war was fought on multiple fronts, including land, sea, and air, and resulted in significant loss of life, displacement of people, and long-term consequences for the region and the world.\n\n**Background**\n\nVietnam had been under French control as part of French Indochina since the mid-19th century. Under French rule, Vietnamese nationalism was suppressed, and revolutionary groups conducted their activities abroad, particularly in France and China. In 1930, Nguyen Sinh Cung established the Indochinese Communist Party, a Marxist-Leninist organization that operated primarily in Hong Kong and the Soviet Union. The party aimed to overthrow French rule and establish an independent communist state in Vietnam.\n\n**Japanese occupation of Indochina**\n\nIn September 1940, Japan invaded French Indochina, following France's capitulation to Nazi Germany. French influence was suppressed, and in 1941, Cung, now known as Ho Chi Minh, returned to Vietnam to establish the Viet Minh, an anti-Japanese resistance movement that advocated for independence. The Viet Minh received aid from the Allies, including the US, Soviet Union, and Republic of China. Beginning in 1944, the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) provided the Viet Minh with weapons, ammunition, and training to fight the occupying Japanese and Vichy French forces.\n\n**First Indochina War**\n\nTensions between the Viet Minh and French authorities erupted into full-scale war by 1946. The conflict soon became entwined with the wider Cold War. In March 1947, US President Harry S Truman announced the Truman Doctrine, an anticommunist foreign policy that pledged US support to nations resisting \"attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\" In Indochina, this doctrine was first put into practice in February 1950, when the United States recognized the French-backed State of Vietnam in Saigon as the legitimate government of Vietnam.\n\n**Battle of Dien Bien Phu**\n\nIn 1954, the Battle of Dien Bien Phu was fought between the French and the Viet Minh. The battle was a decisive victory for the Viet Minh, and it led to the signing of the Geneva Accords, which temporarily partitioned Vietnam at the 17th parallel. The accords allowed for the reunification of Vietnam in 1956, but the US, represented by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, objected to the resolution. The US opposed the reunification of Vietnam, and the Vietnamese government was divided into two separate governments, the North and the South.\n\n**Diem era, 1954-1963**\n\nNgô Đình Diệm, a devout Roman Catholic, was fervently anti-communist, nationalist, and socially conservative. He represented narrow and extremist nationalism coupled with autocracy and nepotism. Most Vietnamese were Buddhist, and Diem's actions, such as his dedication of the country to the Virgin Mary, alarmed the Buddhist community.\n\n**Insurgency in the South, 1954-1960**\n\nBetween 1954 and 1957, the Diem government succeeded in preventing large-scale organized unrest in the countryside. However, in April 1957, insurgents launched an assassination campaign against government officials and civilians. By early 1959, Diem had come to regard the violence as an organized campaign and implemented Law 10/59, which made political violence punishable by death and property confiscation.\n\n**North Vietnamese involvement**\n\nIn March 1956, southern communist leader Lê Duẩn presented a plan to revive the insurgency entitled \"The Road to the South\" to the Politburo in Hanoi. However, as China and the Soviets opposed confrontation, his plan was rejected. Despite this, the North Vietnamese leadership approved tentative measures to revive southern insurgency in December 1956.\n\n**Kennedy's escalation, 1961-1963**\n\nIn the 1960 US presidential election, Senator John F Kennedy defeated incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon. Although Eisenhower warned Kennedy about Laos and Vietnam, Europe and Latin America \"loomed larger than Asia on his sights.\" In June 1961, Kennedy bitterly disagreed with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev when they met in Vienna to discuss key US-Soviet issues.\n\n**Ousting and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm**\n\nThe inept performance of the ARVN was exemplified by failed actions such as the Battle of Ấp Bắc. In November 1963, a group of Army officers, backed by the US, overthrew and assassinated Diem. The coup was led by General Dương Văn Minh.\n\n**Gulf of Tonkin and Johnson's escalation, 1964-1969**\n\nIn August 1964, a US Navy destroyer, the USS Maddox, was involved in a confrontation with North Vietnamese naval forces in the Gulf of Tonkin. The incident led to the passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which authorized President Lyndon B Johnson to take military action in Southeast Asia.\n\n**US ground war**\n\nIn March 1965, the first US combat troops arrived in South Vietnam. The US military was institutionally and psychologically unsuited to a defensive mission, and US commanders were institutionally and psychologically unsuited to a defensive mission.\n\n**Tet Offensive and its aftermath**\n\nIn late 1967, the PAVN lured American forces into the hinterlands at Đắk Tô and at the Marine Khe Sanh combat base. The Tet Offensive was a series of surprise attacks by the North Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong on cities and towns in South Vietnam. The offensive was a military defeat for the North Vietnamese, but a strategic victory as it showed the US public that the war was not going as planned.\n\n**Vietnamization, 1969-1972**\n\nPresident Nixon began troop withdrawals in 1969. His plan to build up the ARVN so it could take over the defense of South Vietnam became known as \"Vietnamization.\" The plan was aimed at gradually transferring the responsibility for fighting the war to the South Vietnamese military.\n\n**Easter Offensive and Paris Peace Accords, 1972**\n\nThe Easter Offensive was a conventional PAVN invasion of South Vietnam that began in March 1972. The US responded with airpower, and the offensive was eventually repelled. The Paris Peace Accords were signed on January 27, 1973, officially ending the US involvement in the war.\n\n**US exit and final campaigns, 1973-1975**\n\nThe Paris Peace Accords officially ended the US involvement in the war, but fighting continued between the North Vietnamese Army and the South Vietnamese military. In 1975, the North Vietnamese launched a final campaign to capture Saigon, and the city fell on April 30, 1975.\n\n**Refugee crisis**\n\nOver 3 million people left Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in the Indochina refugee crisis after 1975. Many fled by boat and were known as boat people. Between 1975 and 1998, an estimated 1.2 million refugees from Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries resettled in the US.\n\n**In the United States**\n\nThe US paid Vietnam veterans and their families more than $22 billion a year in war-related claims as of 2013. The US government also spent $168 billion on the war between 1953 and 1975, which is equivalent to $1.7 trillion in 2023.\n\n**Commemoration**\n\nOn May 25, 2012, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation of the commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War. On November 10, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an additional proclamation commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of wars involving the United States\n*

1941 Cung, now known as Ho Chi Minh, returned to Vietnam to establish the Viet Minh, an anti-Japanese resistance movement that advocated for independence [74] The Viet Minh received aid from the Allies, namely the US, Soviet Union, and Republic of China Beginning in 1944, the US Office of Strategic Services (O.S.S.) provided the Viet Minh with weapons, ammunition, and training to fight the occupying Japanese and Vichy French forces [75] [76] Throughout the war, Vietnamese guerrilla resistance against the Japanese grew dramatically, and by the end of 1944 the Viet Minh had grown to over 500,000 members [77] US President Franklin D Roosevelt was an ardent supporter of Vietnamese resistance, and proposed that Vietnam's independence be granted under an international trusteeship following the war [78]\n\n\nFirst Indochina War\nTensions between the Viet Minh and French authorities had erupted into full-scale war by 1946, a conflict which soon became entwined with the wider Cold War On March 12, 1947, US President Harry S Truman announced the Truman Doctrine, an anticommunist foreign policy which pledged US support to nations resisting \"attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures\" [80] In Indochina, this doctrine was first put into practice in February 1950, when the United States recognized the French-backed State of Vietnam in Saigon, led by former Emperor Bảo Đại, as the legitimate government of Vietnam, after the communist states of the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China recognized the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by Ho Chi Minh, as the legitimate Vietnamese government the previous month [81]: 377–379  [25]: 88  The outbreak of the Korean War in June convinced Washington policymakers that the war in Indochina was another example of communist expansionism, directed by the Soviet Union [25]: 33–35 \n\n\nBattle of Dien Bien Phu\nDuring the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, US carriers sailed to the Gulf of Tonkin and the US conducted reconnaissance flights France and the US discussed the use of tactical nuclear weapons, though reports of how seriously this was considered and by whom, are vague [84] [25]: 75  According to then-Vice President Richard Nixon, the Joint Chiefs of Staff drew up plans to use nuclear weapons to support the French [84] Nixon, a so-called \"hawk\", suggested the US might have to \"put American boys in\" [7]: 76  President Dwight D Eisenhower made American participation contingent on British support, but the British were opposed [7]: 76  Eisenhower, wary of involving the US in an Asian land war, decided against intervention [25]: 75–76  Throughout the conflict, US intelligence estimates remained skeptical of France's chance of success [85]\n\n\nTransition period\nAt the 1954 Geneva Conference, Vietnam was temporarily partitioned at the 17th parallel Ho Chi Minh wished to continue war in the south, but was restrained by Chinese allies who convinced him he could win control by electoral means [88] [25]: 87–88  Under the Geneva Accords, civilians were allowed to move freely between the two provisional states for a 300-day period Elections throughout the country were to be held in 1956 to establish a unified government [25]: 88–90  However, the US, represented at the conference by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, objected to the resolution; Dulles' objection was supported only by the representative of Bảo Đại [76] John Foster's brother, Allen Dulles, who was director of the Central Intelligence Agency, then initiated a psychological warfare campaign which exaggerated anti-Catholic sentiment among the Viet Minh and distributed propaganda attributed to Viet Minh threatening an American attack on Hanoi with atomic bombs [76] [89] [25]: 96–97 \n\n\nDiệm era, 1954–1963\nA devout Roman Catholic, Diệm was fervently anti-communist, nationalist, and socially conservative Historian Luu Doan Huynh notes \"Diệm represented narrow and extremist nationalism coupled with autocracy and nepotism.\" [81]: 200–201  Most Vietnamese were Buddhist, and alarmed by Diệm's actions, like his dedication of the country to the Virgin Mary.\n\n\nRule\nA devout Roman Catholic, Diệm was fervently anti-communist, nationalist, and socially conservative Historian Luu Doan Huynh notes \"Diệm represented narrow and extremist nationalism

1954–1960\nBetween 1954 and 1957, the Diệm government succeeded in preventing large-scale organized unrest in the countryside In April 1957, insurgents launched an assassination campaign, referred to as \"extermination of traitors\" [105] 17 people were killed in the Châu Đốc massacre at a bar in July, and in September a district chief was killed with his family [51] By early 1959, Diệm had come to regard the violence as an organized campaign and implemented Law 10/59, which made political violence punishable by death and property confiscation [106] There had been division among former Viet Minh, whose main goal was to hold elections promised in the Geneva Accords, leading to \"wildcat\" activities separate from the other communists and anti-GVN activists Douglas Pike estimated that insurgents carried out 2,000 abductions, and 1,700 assassinations of government officials, village chiefs, hospital workers and teachers from 1957 to 1960 [25]: 106  [51] Violence between insurgents and government forces increased drastically from 180 clashes in January 1960, to 545 clashes in September [107]\n\n\nNorth Vietnamese involvement\nIn March 1956, southern communist leader Lê Duẩn presented a plan to revive the insurgency entitled \"The Road to the South\" to the Politburo in Hanoi However, as China and the Soviets opposed confrontation, his plan was rejected [53]: 58  Despite this, the North Vietnamese leadership approved tentative measures to revive southern insurgency in December 1956 [50] Communist forces were under a single command structure set up in 1958 [109] In May 1958, North Vietnamese forces seized the transportation hub at Tchepone in Southern Laos near the demilitarized zone, between North and South Vietnam [110]: 24 \n\n\nKennedy's escalation, 1961–1963\nIn the 1960 U.S presidential election, Senator John F Kennedy defeated incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon Although Eisenhower warned Kennedy about Laos and Vietnam, Europe and Latin America \"loomed larger than Asia on his sights.\" [92]: 264   In June 1961, he bitterly disagreed with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev when they met in Vienna to discuss key U.S.–Soviet issues Only 16 months later, the Cuban Missile Crisis (October 1962) played out on television worldwide It was the closest the Cold War came to nuclear war.\n\n\nOusting and assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm\nThe inept performance of the ARVN was exemplified by failed actions such as the Battle of Ấp Bắc on 2 January 1963, in which a band of Viet Cong won a battle against a much larger and better-equipped South Vietnamese force, many of whose officers seemed reluctant even to engage in combat [120]: 201–206  The South Vietnamese lost 83 soldiers and 5 US war helicopters, serving to ferry troops shot down by Vietcong forces, while the Vietcong lost only 18 soldiers The ARVN forces were led by Diệm's most trusted general, Huỳnh Văn Cao Cao was a Catholic, promoted due to religion and fidelity rather than skill, and his main job was to preserve his forces to stave off coups Policymakers in Washington began to conclude Diệm was incapable of defeating the communists and might even make a deal with Ho Chi Minh He seemed concerned only with fending off coups and had become paranoid after attempts in 1960 and 1962, which he partly attributed to US encouragement As Robert F Kennedy noted, \"Diệm wouldn't make even the slightest concessions He was difficult to reason with ...\" [121] Historian James Gibson summed up the situation:\n\n\nGulf of Tonkin and Johnson's escalation, 1963–1969\nPresident Kennedy was assassinated on 22 November 1963 Vice President Lyndon B Johnson had not been heavily involved with policy toward Vietnam; [131] [A 9] however, upon becoming president, he immediately focused it On 24 November 1963, he said, \"the battle against communism .. must be joined .. with strength and determination.\" [133] Johnson knew he had inherited a  deteriorating situation in South Vietnam, [134] but adhered to the widely accepted domino argument for defending the South: Should they retreat or appease, either action would imperil other nations [135] Findings from RAND's Viet Cong Motivation and Morale Project bolstered his confidence that an air war would weaken the Viet Cong Some argue the policy of North Vietnam was not to topple other non-communist governments in South East Asia [81]: 48 \n\n\nGulf of Tonkin incident\nOn 2 August 1964, USS Maddox, on an intelligence mission along North Vietnam's coast, fired upon and damaged torpedo boats approaching it in the Gulf of Tonkin [56]: 124  A second attack was reported two days later on USS Turner Joy and Maddox The circumstances were murky [25]: 218–219   Johnson commented to Undersecretary of State George Ball that \"those sailors out there may have been shooting at flying fish.\" [136] An NSA publication declassified in 2005 revealed there was no attack on 4 August [137]\n\n\nBombing of Laos\nBombing was not restricted to North Vietnam Other aerial campaigns, targeted different parts of the Viet Cong and PAVN infrastructure These included the Ho Chi Minh trail supply route, which ran through Laos and Cambodia The ostensibly neutral Laos had become the scene of a civil war, pitting the Laotian government backed by the US, against the Pathet Lao and its North Vietnamese allies.\n\n\nThe 1964 offensive\nFollowing the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Hanoi anticipated the arrival of US troops and began expanding the Viet Cong, as well as sending increasing numbers of North Vietnamese personnel southwards They were outfitting the Viet Cong forces and standardizing their equipment with AK-47 rifles and other supplies, as well as forming the 9th Division [25]: 223  [143] \"From a strength of approximately 5,000 at the start of 1959 the Viet Cong's ranks grew to about 100,000 at the end of 1964 .. Between 1961 and 1964 the Army's strength rose from about 850,000 to nearly a million men.\" [124] U.S troop numbers deployed to Vietnam during the same period were much lower: 2,000 in 1961, rising to 16,500 in 1964 [144] The use of captured equipment decreased, while greater numbers of ammunition and supplies were required to maintain regular units Group 559 was tasked with expanding the Ho Chi Minh trail, in light of the bombardment by US warplanes The war had shifted into the final, conventional phase of Hanoi's three-stage protracted warfare model The Viet Cong was now tasked with destroying the ARVN and capturing and holding areas; however, it was not yet strong enough to assault major towns and cities.\n\n\nAmerican ground war\nOn 8 March 1965, 3,500 U.S Marines were landed near Da Nang, South Vietnam [25]: 246–247  This marked the beginning of the American ground war U.S public opinion overwhelmingly supported the deployment [147] The Marines' initial assignment was defense of Da Nang Air Base The first deployment of 3,500 in March 1965 was increased to nearly 200,000 by December [81]: 349–351  U.S military had long been schooled in offensive warfare Regardless of political policies, U.S commanders were institutionally and psychologically unsuited to a defensive mission [81]: 349–351 \n\n\nTet Offensive and its aftermath\nIn late 1967, the PAVN lured American forces into the hinterlands at Đắk Tô and at the Marine Khe Sanh combat base, where the U.S fought The Hill Fights These were part of a diversionary strategy meant to draw US forces towards the Central Highlands [159] Preparations were underway for the Tet Offensive, with the intention of Văn Tiến Dũng forces to launch \"direct attacks on the American and puppet nerve centers—Saigon, Huế, Danang, all the cities, towns and main bases ...\" [160] Le Duan sought to placate critics of the stalemate by planning a decisive victory [161]: 90–94  He reasoned this could be achieved through sparking an uprising within the towns and cities, [161]: 148  along with mass defections among ARVN units, who were on leave during the truce period [162]\n\n\nVietnamization, 1969–1972\nPresident Nixon began troop withdrawals in 1969 His plan to build up the ARVN so it could take over the defense of South Vietnam became known as \"Vietnamization\" As the PAVN/VC recovered from their 1968 losses and avoided contact, Creighton Abrams conducted operations aimed at disrupting logistics, with better use of firepower and more cooperation with the ARVN [25]: 517  In October 1969, Nixon had ordered B-52s loaded with nuclear weapons to race to the border of Soviet airspace to convince the Soviet Union, in accord with the madman theory, he was capable of anything to end the Vietnam War [179] [180] Nixon had sought détente with the Soviet Union and rapprochement with China, which decreased tensions and led to nuclear arms reductions However, the Soviets continued to supply the North Vietnamese [181] [182]\n\n\nNuclear threats and diplomacy\nPresident Nixon began troop withdrawals in 1969 His plan to build up the ARVN so it could take over the defense of South Vietnam became known as \"Vietnamization\" As the PAVN/VC recovered from their 1968 losses and avoided contact, Creighton Abrams conducted operations aimed at disrupting logistics, with better use of firepower and more cooperation with the ARVN [25]: 517  In October 1969, Nixon had ordered B-52s loaded with nuclear weapons to race to the border of Soviet airspace to convince the Soviet Union, in accord with the madman theory, he was capable of anything to end the Vietnam War [179] [180] Nixon had sought détente with the Soviet Union and rapprochement with China, which decreased tensions and led to nuclear arms reductions However, the Soviets continued to supply the North Vietnamese [181] [182]\n\n\nHanoi's war strategy\nIn September 1969, Ho Chi Minh died aged 79 [183] The failure of the 1968 Tet Offensive to spark a popular uprising in the south caused a shift in Hanoi's war strategy, and the Giáp-Chinh \"Northern-First\" faction regained control over military affairs from the Lê Duẩn-Hoàng Văn Thái \"Southern-First\" faction [184]: 272–274  An unconventional victory was sidelined in favor of a conventional victory through conquest [161]: 196–205  Large-scale offensives were rolled back in favor of small-unit and sapper attacks as well as targeting the pacification and Vietnamization strategy [184] Following Tet, the PAVN had transformed from a light-infantry, limited mobility force into a high-mobile and mechanized combined arms force [184]: 189  By 1970, over 70% of communist troops in the south were northerners, and southern-dominated VC units no longer existed [185]\n\n\nU.S. domestic controversies\nThe anti-war movement was gaining strength in the US Nixon appealed to the \"silent majority\" who he said supported the war without showing it But revelations of the 1968 My Lai Massacre, [25]: 518–521  in which a US Army unit under Captain Ernest Medina raped and killed civilians, and the 1969 \"Green Beret Affair\", where 8 Special Forces soldiers, were arrested for the murder [186] of a suspected double agent, [187] provoked national and international outrage.\n\n\nCollapsing U.S. morale\nFollowing the Tet Offensive and decreasing support among the US public, US forces began a period of morale collapse, and disobedience [189]: 349–350  [190]: 166–175  At home, desertion rates quadrupled from 1966 levels [191] Among the enlisted, only 2.5% chose infantry combat positions in 1969–70 [191] ROTC enrollment decreased from 191,749 in 1966 to 72,459 by 1971, [192] and reached a low of 33,220 in 1974, [193] depriving US forces of much-needed military leadership.\n\n\nARVN taking the lead and U.S. ground force withdrawal\nBeginning in 1969, American troops were withdrawn from border areas where most of the fighting took place and redeployed along the coast and interior US casualties in 1970 were less than half of 1969, after being relegated to less active combat [197] While US forces were redeployed, the ARVN took over combat operations, with casualties double US casualties in 1969, and more than triple US ones in 1970 [198] In the post-Tet environment, membership in the South Vietnamese Regional Force and Popular Force militias grew, and they were now more capable of providing village security, which the Americans had not accomplished [198]\n\n\nCambodia\nPrince Norodom Sihanouk had proclaimed Cambodia neutral since 1955, [203] but permitted the PAVN/Viet Cong to use the port of Sihanoukville and the Sihanouk Trail In March 1969 Nixon launched a secret bombing campaign, called Operation Menu, against communist sanctuaries along the Cambodia/Vietnam border Only five high-ranking congressional officials were informed [A 11]\n\n\nLaos\nBuilding on the success of ARVN units in Cambodia, and further testing the Vietnamization program, the ARVN were tasked with Operation Lam Son 719 in February 1971, the first major ground operation to attack the Ho Chi Minh trail, at the crossroad of Tchepone This offensive was the first time the PAVN would field-test its combined arms force [161] The first few days were a success, but momentum slowed after fierce resistance Thiệu had halted the general advance, leaving armored divisions able to surround them [207]\n\n\nEaster Offensive and Paris Peace Accords, 1972\nVietnamization was again tested by the Easter Offensive of 1972, a conventional PAVN invasion of South Vietnam The PAVN overran the northern provinces and attacked from Cambodia, threatening to cut the country in half US troop withdrawals continued, but American airpower responded, beginning Operation Linebacker, and the offensive was halted [25]: 606–637  The US Navy also initiated Operation Pocket Money in May, an aerial mining campaign in Haiphong Harbor that prevented North Vietnam's allies from resupplying it with weapons and aid by sea [209]\n\n\nU.S. exit and final campaigns, 1973–1975\nIn the lead-up to the ceasefire on 28 January, both sides attempted to maximize land and population under their control in a campaign known as the War of the flags Fighting continued after the ceasefire, without US participation, and throughout the year [156]: 508–513  North Vietnam was allowed to continue supplying troops in the South but only to replace expended material The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Kissinger and Thọ, but the North Vietnamese negotiator declined it saying true peace did not yet exist.\n\n\nCampaign 275\nOn 10 March 1975, General Dung launched Campaign 275, a limited offensive into the Central Highlands, supported by tanks and heavy artillery The target was Ban Ma Thuột; if the town could be taken, the provincial capital Pleiku and the road to the coast, would be exposed for a campaign in 1976 The ARVN proved incapable of resisting the onslaught, and its forces collapsed Again, Hanoi was surprised by the speed of their success Dung urged the Politburo to allow him to seize Pleiku immediately and turn his attention to Kon Tum He argued that with two months of good weather until onset of the monsoon, it would be irresponsible not to take advantage [7]\n\n\nFinal North Vietnamese offensive\nWith the north half of the country under their control, the Politburo ordered Dung to launch the final offensive against Saigon The operational plan for the Ho Chi Minh Campaign called for Saigon's capture before 1 May Hanoi wished to avoid the coming monsoon and prevent redeployment of ARVN forces defending the capital Northern forces, their morale boosted by their recent victories, rolled on, taking Nha Trang, Cam Ranh and Da Lat [25]: 702–704 \n\n\nFall of Saigon\nChaos and panic broke out as hysterical South Vietnamese officials and civilians scrambled to leave Martial law was declared American helicopters began evacuating South Vietnamese, US and foreign nationals from the city and the U.S embassy compound Operation Frequent Wind had been delayed until the last possible moment, because of Ambassador Graham Martin's belief Saigon could be held and a political settlement reached Frequent Wind was the largest helicopter evacuation in history It began on 29 April, in an atmosphere of desperation, as hysterical crowds of Vietnamese vied for limited space Frequent Wind continued around the clock, as PAVN tanks breached defenses near Saigon In the early morning of 30 April, the last US Marines evacuated the embassy by helicopter, as civilians swamped the perimeter and poured into the grounds [25]: 718–720 \n\n\nOpposition to U.S. involvement\nDuring the course of the war a large segment of Americans became opposed to U.S involvement In January 1967, only 32% of Americans thought the US had made a mistake in sending troops [222] Public opinion steadily turned against the war following 1967 and by 1970 only a third believed the U.S had not made a mistake by sending troops [223] [224]\n\n\nInvolvement of other countries\nChina provided significant support for North Vietnam when the US started to intervene, including financial aid and the deployment of hundreds of thousands of military personnel in support roles China said its military and economic aid to North Vietnam and the Viet Cong totaled $20 billion ($160 billion adjusted for 2022 prices) during the Vietnam War; [6] included were 5 million tons of food to North Vietnam (equivalent to a year's food production), accounting for 10–15% of their food supply by the 1970s [6]\n\n\nPro-Hanoi\nChina provided significant support for North Vietnam when the US started to intervene, including financial aid and the deployment of hundreds of thousands of military personnel in support roles China said its military and economic aid to North Vietnam and the Viet Cong totaled $20 billion ($160 billion adjusted for 2022 prices) during the Vietnam War; [6] included were 5 million tons of food to North Vietnam (equivalent to a year's food production), accounting for 10–15% of their food supply by the 1970s [6]\n\n\nPeople's Republic of China\nChina provided significant support for North Vietnam when the US started to intervene, including financial aid and the deployment of hundreds of thousands of military personnel in support roles China said its military and economic aid to North Vietnam and the Viet Cong totaled $20 billion ($160 billion adjusted for 2022 prices) during the Vietnam War; [6] included were 5 million tons of food to North Vietnam (equivalent to a year's food production), accounting for 10–15% of their food supply by the 1970s [6]\n\n\nSoviet Union\nThe Soviet Union supplied North Vietnam with medical supplies, arms, tanks, planes, helicopters, artillery, anti-aircraft missiles and other military equipment Soviet crews fired Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles at US aircraft in 1965 [230] Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian officials acknowledged that the USSR had stationed up to 3,000 troops in Vietnam [231]\n\n\nPro-Saigon\nAs South Vietnam was formally part of a military alliance with the US, Australia, New Zealand, France, the UK, Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines, the alliance was invoked during the war The UK, France and Pakistan declined to participate, and South Korea, Taiwan, and Spain were non-treaty participants.\n\n\nUnited Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races\nThe ethnic minority peoples of South Vietnam, like the Montagnards in the Central Highlands, the Hindu and Muslim Cham, and the Buddhist Khmer Krom, were actively recruited in the war There was a strategy of recruitment and favorable treatment of Montagnard tribes for the Viet Cong, as they were pivotal for control of infiltration routes [235] Some groups split off and formed the United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races (FULRO) to fight for autonomy or independence FULRO fought against the South Vietnamese and Viet Cong, later fighting against the unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam, after the fall of South Vietnam.\n\n\nWar crimes\nMany war crimes took place, by both sides, including: rape, massacres of civilians, bombings of civilian targets, terrorism, torture, and murder of prisoners of war Additional common crimes included theft, arson, and the destruction of property not warranted by military necessity [236]\n\n\nSouth Vietnamese, Korean and American\nIn 1966, the Russell Tribunal was organized by a number of public figures opposed to the war led by Bertrand Russell in an effort to apply the precepts of international law to the actions of the United States and its allies in Vietnam The tribunal found the US and its allies guilty of acts of aggression, use of weapons forbidden by the laws of war, bombardment of targets of a purely civilian character, mistreatment of prisoners, and genocide Though the tribunal's lack of juridical authority meant its findings were largely ignored by the United States and other governments, the hearings contributed to a growing body of evidence and documentation which established the factual basis for a counter-narrative to the United States' justifications for the war and inspired future hearings, tribunals and legal investigations [237]\n\n\nNorth Vietnamese and Viet Cong\nAmi Pedahzur has written that \"the overall volume and lethality of Viet Cong terrorism rivals or exceeds all but a handful of terrorist campaigns waged over the last third of the twentieth century\", based on the definition of terrorists as a non-state actor, and examining targeted killings and civilian deaths which are estimated at over 18,000 from 1966 to 1969 [252] The US Department of Defense estimates the VC/PAVN had conducted 36,000 murders and 58,000 kidnappings from 1967 to 1972, c. 1973 [253] Benjamin Valentino attributes 45,000–80,000 \"terrorist mass killings\" to the Viet Cong [244] Statistics for 1968–1972 suggest \"about 80 percent of the terrorist victims were ordinary civilians and only about 20 percent were government officials, policemen, members of the self-defence forces or pacification cadres.\" [19]: 273  Viet Cong tactics included frequent mortaring of civilians in refugee camps, and placing of mines on highways frequented by villagers taking goods to urban markets Some mines were set only to go off after heavy vehicle passage, causing slaughter aboard packed civilian buses [19]: 270–279 \n\n\nWomen\nWomen were active in a large variety of roles, making significant impacts and the war having significant impacts on them [257] [258] [259] Several million Vietnamese women served in the military and in militias, particularly in the Viet Cong, with the slogan \"when war comes, even the women must fight\" being widely used [260] These women made vital contributions on the Ho Chi Minh trail, espionage, medical care, logistical and administrative work, and sometimes direct combat [261] [262] Women workers took on more roles in the economy and Vietnam saw an increase in women's rights [263] In Vietnam and elsewhere, women emerged as leaders of anti-war peace campaigns and made significant contributions to war journalism [264]\n\n\nBlack servicemen\nThe experience of African-American military personnel has received significant attention The site \"African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War\" compiles examples, [273] as does the work of journalist Wallace Terry whose book Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans, includes observations about the impact on the black community and black servicemen He notes: the higher proportion of combat casualties among African-American servicemen than other races, the shift toward and different attitudes of black military volunteers and conscripts, the discrimination encountered by black servicemen \"on the battlefield in decorations, promotion and duty assignments\", as well as having to endure \"the racial insults, cross-burnings and Confederate flags of their white comrades\"—and the experiences faced by black soldiers stateside, during the war and after withdrawal [274]\n\n\nWeapons\nNearly all US-allied forces were armed with US weapons including the M1 Garand, M1 carbine, M14 rifle, and M16 rifle The Australian and New Zealand forces employed the 7.62 mm L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle, with occasional use of the M16 rifle.\n\n\nExtent of U.S. bombings\nThe US dropped over 7 million tons of bombs on Indochina during the war, more than triple the 2.1 million tons it dropped on Europe and Asia during World War II, and more than ten times the amount during the Korean War 500 thousand tons were dropped on Cambodia, 1 million tons on North Vietnam, and 4 million tons on South Vietnam On a per person basis, the 2 million tons dropped on Laos make it the most heavily bombed country in history; The New York Times noted this was \"nearly a ton for every person in Laos.\" [142] Due to the particularly heavy impact of cluster bombs, Laos was a strong advocate of the Convention on Cluster Munitions to ban the weapons, and was host to its first meeting in 2010 [276]\n\n\nCasualties\nEstimates of casualties vary, with one source suggesting up to 3.8 million violent war deaths in Vietnam for 1955 to 2002 [279] [280] [281] [4] A demographic study calculated 791,000–1,141,000 war-related deaths during the war for all of Vietnam, for military and civilians [18] Between 195,000 and 430,000 South Vietnamese civilians died in the war [19]: 450–453  [29] Extrapolating from a 1969 US intelligence report, Guenter Lewy estimated 65,000 North Vietnamese civilians died [19]: 450–453  Estimates of civilian deaths caused by American bombing of North Vietnam range from 30,000 [7]: 176, 617  to 182,000 [20] A 1975 US Senate subcommittee estimated 1.4 million South Vietnamese civilians casualties during the war, including 415,000 deaths [242]: 12  The military of South Vietnam suffered an estimated 254,256 killed between 1960 and 1974, and additional deaths from 1954 to 1959 and in 1975 [31]: 275  Other estimates point to higher figures of 313,000 casualties [85] [44] [18] [45] [46] [47]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam [290] Despite speculation that the victorious North Vietnamese would, in Nixon's words, \"massacre the civilians there  [South Vietnam] by the millions,\" no mass executions took place [291] [A 12]\n\n\nIn Southeast Asia\nOn 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam [290] Despite speculation that the victorious North Vietnamese would, in Nixon's words, \"massacre the civilians there  [South Vietnam] by the millions,\" no mass executions took place [291] [A 12]\n\n\nIn Vietnam\nOn 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam [290] Despite speculation that the victorious North Vietnamese would, in Nixon's words, \"massacre the civilians there  [South Vietnam] by the millions,\" no mass executions took place [291] [A 12]\n\n\nLaos and Cambodia\nBy 1975, the North Vietnamese had lost influence over the Khmer Rouge [25]: 708  Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, fell to the Khmer Rouge in April 1975 Under Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge would kill 1–3 million Cambodians out of a population of around 8 million, in one of the bloodiest genocides ever [45] [302] [303] [304]\n\n\nUnexploded ordnance\nUnexploded ordnance, mostly from US bombing, continues to kill people, and has rendered much land hazardous and impossible to cultivate Ordnance has killed 42,000 people since the war ended [306] [307] In Laos, 80 million bombs failed to explode and still remain Unexploded ordnance has killed or injured over 20,000 Laotians since the war and about 50 people are killed or maimed annually [308] [309] It is estimated the explosives buried will not be removed entirely for centuries [161]: 317 \n\n\nRefugee crisis\nOver 3 million people left Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in the Indochina refugee crisis after 1975 Most Asian countries were unwilling to accept them, many of whom fled by boat and were known as boat people [310] Between 1975 and 1998, an estimated 1.2 million refugees from Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries resettled in the US, while Canada, Australia, and France resettled over 500,000, China accepted 250,000 people [311] Laos experienced the largest refugee flight proportionally, 300,000 out of a population of 3 million crossed the border into Thailand Included among their ranks were \"about 90%\" of Laos' \"intellectuals, technicians, and officials.\" [95]: 575  An estimated 200,000 to 400,000 Vietnamese boat people died at sea, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees [312]\n\n\nIn the United States\nFailure of US goals is often placed at different institutions and levels Some have suggested it was due to political failures of leadership [313] Others point to a failure of military doctrine Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated that \"the achievement of a military victory by U.S forces in Vietnam was indeed a dangerous illusion.\" [81]: 368  The inability to bring Hanoi to the bargaining table by bombing illustrated another US miscalculation, and the limitations of military abilities in achieving political goals [92]: 17  Army Chief of Staff Harold Keith Johnson noted, \"if anything came out of Vietnam, it was that air power couldn't do the job.\" [314] General William Westmoreland admitted bombing had been ineffective, saying he doubted \"that the North Vietnamese would have relented.\" [314] Kissinger wrote in a memo to President Ford that \"in terms of military tactics .. our armed forces are not suited to this kind of war Even the Special Forces who had been designed for it could not prevail.\" [315] Hanoi had persistently sought unification since the Geneva Accords, and the effects of US bombing had negligible impact on North Vietnam's goals [161]: 1–10  US bombing mobilized people throughout North Vietnam and international support, due to the perception of a superpower attempting to bomb a significantly smaller, agrarian society into submission [161]: 48–52 \n\n\nFinancial cost\nBetween 1953 and 1975, the US was estimated to have spent $168 billion on the war (equivalent to $1.7 trillion in 2023) [319] This resulted in a large budget deficit Other figures point to $139 billion from 1965 to 1974 (not inflation-adjusted), 10 times all education spending in the US, and 50 times more than housing and community development spending within that period [320] It was stated that war-spending could have paid off every mortgage in the US, with money leftover [320] As of 2013 [update], the US government pays Vietnam veterans and their families more than $22 billion a year in war-related claims [321] [322]\n\n\nImpact on the U.S. military\nMore than 3 million Americans served in the war, 1.5 million of whom saw combat [323] James Westheider wrote that \"At the height of American involvement in 1968, for example, 543,000 American military personnel were stationed in Vietnam, but only 80,000 were considered combat troops.\" [324] Conscription in the US existed since World War II, but ended in 1973 [325] [326]\n\n\nEffects of U.S. chemical defoliation\nOne of the most controversial aspects of the US military effort, was the widespread use of chemical defoliants between 1961 and 1971 20 million gallons of toxic herbicides (like Agent Orange) were sprayed on 6 million acres of forests and crops by the air force [63] They were used to defoliate large parts of the countryside to prevent the Viet Cong from being able to hide weaponry and encampments under the foliage, and deprive them of food Defoliation was used to clear sensitive areas, including base perimeters and possible ambush sites along roads and canals More than 20% of South Vietnam's forests and 3% of its cultivated land was sprayed at least once 90% of herbicide use was directed at forest defoliation [19]: 263  The chemicals used continue to change the landscape, cause diseases and birth defects, and poison the food chain [336] [337] US military records have listed figures including the destruction of 20% of the jungles of South Vietnam and 20-36% of the mangrove forests [62] The environmental destruction caused was described by Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, lawyers, historians and other academics as an ecocide [64] [338] [60] [339] [61] [340]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe war has featured extensively in
