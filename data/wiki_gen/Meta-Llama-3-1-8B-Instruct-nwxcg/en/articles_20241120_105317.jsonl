The rhyme is a popular example of a \"birth day\" or \"day of the week\" tradition, which has its roots in ancient cultures and has been practiced in various forms throughout history.\n\n**Lyrics**\n\nThe following is a common modern version of the rhyme:\n\n\"A child born on the Monday,\nDearly loved, liked and fortunate,\nA child born on the Tuesday,\nFull of grace, and a little too slow,\nA child born on the Wednesday,\nFull of woe, and troubles to meet,\nA child born on the Thursday,\nHas far to go, and must take a seat,\nA child born on the Friday,\nThe world's hopes and fears in his hand,\nA child born on the Saturday,\nLoves only for himself,\nA child born on the Sunday,\nLoves only for fun.\"\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that there are many variations of this rhyme, and different versions may have slightly different lyrics. Some versions may also include additional lines or verses.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe origins of Monday's child rhyme are unclear, but it is believed to have originated in England in the 16th or 17th century. The rhyme was first recorded in A E Bray's Traditions of Devonshire (Volume II, pp. 287–288) in 1838. James Orchard Halliwell, an English antiquary and scholar, also collected the rhyme in the mid-19th century. However, the tradition of fortune-telling by days of birth is much older. Thomas Nashe, an English writer and poet, recalled stories told to children in Suffolk in the 1570s, which included predictions based on the day of the week they were born.\n\nThe practice of using the day of the week to predict a person's fate or character was a common feature of ancient cultures. In ancient Greece and Rome, for example, the gods were believed to influence the fate of individuals based on the day of the week they were born. Similarly, in ancient China, the concept of \"astrological days\" was used to predict a person's fate based on the day of the week and their time of birth.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nMonday's child rhyme has had a lasting impact on popular culture. In James Joyce's novel Ulysses, brothel worker Zoe Higgins quotes the line about Thursday's child to Stephen Dedalus upon learning he was born on a Thursday, the same weekday on which the novel is set. This literary reference has helped to keep the rhyme in the public consciousness and has introduced it to a new generation of readers.\n\nIn addition to its literary significance, Monday's child rhyme has also been used in various forms of entertainment. It has been featured in songs, films, and television shows, often as a way of adding a touch of whimsy or nostalgia to a scene or storyline. The rhyme has also been used in advertising and marketing campaigns, often as a way of tapping into the cultural nostalgia and fascination with the rhyme.\n\n**See also**\n\n* \"Birth day\" traditions\n* Astrological days\n* Fortune-telling\n* Folk divination\n* Nursery rhymes\n* Popular culture\n* Literature\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as the article is not referencing any specific sources.)\n\n**External links**\n\n(Note: This section is intentionally left blank, as the article does not have any external links.)\n\nIn conclusion, Monday's child rhyme is a traditional English nursery rhyme that has been used for centuries as a form of folk divination. The rhyme claims to predict a person's fate or character based on the day of the week they were born. Despite its unclear origins, the rhyme has had a lasting impact on popular culture and has been used in various forms of entertainment.

{"title": "O._J._Simpson_murder_case", "content": "\nBackground\nBrown met Simpson in 1977 [22] when he was 30 and she was 18, working as a waitress at the Daisy (a Beverly Hills private club) [23] [24] They began dating although Simpson was married; he filed for divorce from his first wife in March 1979.\n\n\nSimpson–Brown marriage\nBrown met Simpson in 1977 [22] when he was 30 and she was 18, working as a waitress at the Daisy (a Beverly Hills private club) [23] [24] They began dating although Simpson was married; he filed for divorce from his first wife in March 1979.\n\n\nFrogmen\nA few months before the killings, Simpson finished filming a pilot for Frogmen, an adventure series comparable to The A-Team Simpson played the primary character, \"Bullfrog\" Burke, who led a gang of former US Navy SEALs He underwent \"a fair amount of\" military training for Frogmen, including the use of a knife, and in one scene, he held a knife to the throat of a woman playing his daughter Investigators discovered a 25-minute tape of the pilot, which did not feature the knife scene, and viewed it on Simpson's television while searching his home The defense attempted to prevent its use on these grounds, but Judge Ito permitted it to be shown [47] \"Bullfrog\" Burke was skilled at night killings, [48] and the \"silent kill\" technique of slashing the throat [49] SEALs also regularly wear knit \"watch caps\" like the one found at the scene [50]\n\n\nMurders\nOn the evening of June 12, 1994, Brown and Simpson both attended their daughter Sydney's dance recital at Paul Revere Middle School Afterward, Brown and her family went to eat at Mezzaluna restaurant One of the waiters at the restaurant was Ron Goldman, who had become close friends with Brown in recent weeks, [51] but was not assigned to the Brown family's table [52]\n\n\nFlight to Chicago\nOn the night of June 12, Simpson was scheduled to board a red-eye flight from Los Angeles International Airport to Chicago, where he was due to play golf the following day at a convention with representatives of The Hertz Corporation, for whom he was a spokesman [68] The flight was due to leave at 11:45 pm Limousine driver Allan Park arrived early at Simpson's Rockingham estate to pick him up at around 10:25 pm [69] [70] Park drove around the estate to make sure he could navigate the area with the stretch limousine properly and to see which driveway would have the best access for the car He began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, but got no response He noted the house was dark, and nobody appeared to be home as he smoked a cigarette and made several calls to his boss to get Simpson's home phone number He testified that he saw a \"shadowy African-American figure\", the same size as Simpson, enter the front door from where the driveway starts, before the lights came on; he did not see what direction the figure came from [71] [72] He testified that he saw Simpson's house number on the curb outside the estate, but no car was parked outside The prosecution presented exhibits showing the position next to the house number on the curb in which Simpson's Ford Bronco was found the next morning, implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there when he arrived to pick up Simpson [71] [69]\n\n\nInitial investigation and arrest\nAfter learning that Brown was the female victim, LAPD commander Keith Bushey ordered detectives Tom Lange, Philip Vannatter, Ron Phillips, and Mark Fuhrman to notify Simpson of her death and to escort him to the police station to pick up the former couple's children, who were asleep in Brown's condominium at the time of the murders The detectives buzzed the intercom at Simpson's estate for over 30 minutes but received no response They noted that Simpson's car was parked at an awkward angle, with its back end out more than the front, and that there was blood on the door, which they feared meant someone inside might be hurt Vannatter instructed Fuhrman to scale the wall and unlock the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter The detectives would argue they entered without a search warrant because of exigent circumstances – specifically out of fear that someone inside might be injured [82] Fuhrman briefly interviewed Kaelin, who told the detective that the car belonged to Simpson and that earlier that night he had heard thumps on his wall In a walk around the premises to inspect what may have caused the thumps, Fuhrman discovered a blood-stained right-hand glove, which was determined to be the mate of the left-hand glove found next to the body of Goldman This evidence along with the presence of blood in the driveway of the Rockingham estate and on Simpson's vehicle constituted probable cause and a search warrant for the location was applied for and granted [83]\n\n\n\"Suicide note\"\nAt 5 pm, Kardashian and one of his defense lawyers read Simpson's public letter [87] [91] [92] In the letter, Simpson sent greetings to 24 friends and wrote, \"First everyone understand I had nothing to do with Nicole's murder\" He described the fights with Brown and their decision not to reconcile their relationship, and asked the media \"as a last wish\" not to bother his children He wrote to his former girlfriend Paula Barbieri, who had broken up with him hours before the double murder, \"I'm sorry .. we're not going to have, our chance ..  [sic] As I leave, you'll be in my thoughts\" It also included \"I can't go on\" and an apology to the Goldman family The letter concluded, \"Don't feel sorry for me I have had a great life, great friends Please think of the real O J and not this lost person\" [87] [91] [89] [93] [92] Most interpreted this as a suicide note; Simpson's mother collapsed after hearing it, [87] [94] [63] [95] [96] and reporters joined the search for Simpson At Kardashian's press conference, Shapiro said that he and Simpson's psychiatrists agreed with the suicide note interpretation Through television, Shapiro appealed to Simpson to surrender [97] [87]\n\n\nBronco chase\nNews helicopters searched the Los Angeles highway system for Al Cowlings's automobile, a white 1993 Ford Bronco [95] [92] At 5:51 pm, Simpson reportedly called 9-1-1; the call was traced to the Santa Ana Freeway, near Lake Forest At around 6:20 pm, a motorist in Orange County notified California Highway Patrol after seeing someone believed to be Simpson in a Bronco on the I-5 freeway heading north The police tracked calls placed by Simpson on his cell phone At 6:45 pm, police officer Ruth Dixon saw the Bronco heading north on Interstate 405; when she caught up to it, Cowlings yelled out that Simpson was in the back seat of the vehicle and was pointing a gun at his own head [97] [87] [92] The officer backed off, but followed the vehicle [100] at 35 miles per hour (56 km/h), [9] with up to 20 police cars following her in the chase [87] [101] [102] Bob Tur [94] of KCBS-TV was the first to find Simpson from a news helicopter, after colleagues heard that the FBI's mobile phone tracking had located Simpson at the El Toro Y More than nine news helicopters eventually joined the pursuit; Tur compared the fleet to Apocalypse Now, and the high degree of media participation caused camera signals to appear on incorrect television channels [97] [92] The chase was so long that one helicopter ran out of fuel, forcing its station to ask another for a camera feed [63]\n\n\nPreliminary hearing\nOn June 20, Simpson was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to both murders and was held without bail The following day, a grand jury was called to determine whether to indict him for the two murders but was dismissed on June 23, as a result of excessive media coverage that could have influenced its neutrality Instead, authorities held a probable cause hearing to determine whether to bring Simpson to trial California Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell ruled on July 7 that there was sufficient evidence to bring Simpson to trial for the murders At his second arraignment on July 22, when asked how he pleaded to the murders, Simpson firmly stated: \"Absolutely, one hundred percent, not guilty.\" [112]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nWhen the trial began, all of the networks were getting these hate-mail letters because people's soap operas were being interrupted for the Simpson trial But then what happened was the people who liked soap operas got addicted to the Simpson trial And they got really upset when the Simpson trial was over, and people would come up to me on the street and say, 'God, I loved your show.'\n\nTrial\nSimpson wanted a speedy trial, and the defense and prosecuting attorneys worked around the clock for several months to prepare their cases The trial began on January 24, 1995, seven months after the murders, and was televised by closed-circuit TV camera via Court TV, and in part by other cable and network news outlets, for 134 days Judge Lance Ito presided over the trial in the C.S Foltz Criminal Courts Building.\n\n\nJury\nDistrict Attorney Gil Garcetti elected to file charges in downtown Los Angeles, as opposed to Santa Monica, in which jurisdiction the crimes took place [143] The Los Angeles Superior Court then decided to hold the trial in Downtown Los Angeles instead of Santa Monica due to safety issues at the Santa Monica Court house owing to the 1994 Northridge earthquake [144] The decision may have impacted the trial's outcome as it resulted in a jury pool that mainly consisted of African Americans [145] Richard Gabriel, a jury consultant noted that African Americans were far more likely than other minorities to be receptive to claims of racially motivated fraud by the police and were less likely to be familiar with and thus accept DNA evidence [143]\n\n\nProsecution case\nThe two lead prosecutors were Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark and William Hodgman, who was replaced as lead prosecutor by Christopher Darden Clark was designated as the lead prosecutor and Darden became Clark's co-counsel Prosecutors Hank Goldberg and Hodgman, who had successfully prosecuted high-profile cases in the past, assisted Clark and Darden Two prosecutors who were DNA experts, Rockne Harmon and George \"Woody\" Clarke, were brought in to present the DNA evidence in the case and were assisted by Prosecutor Lisa Kahn [156] [157] [158]\n\n\nTheory\nThe prosecution argued that the domestic violence within the Simpson-Brown marriage culminated in her murder [159] Simpson's history of abusing Brown resulted in their divorce and his pleading guilty to one count of domestic violence in 1989 [160] On the night of the murders, Simpson attended a dance recital for his daughter and was reportedly angry with Brown because of a black dress that she wore, which he said was \"tight\" Simpson's then girlfriend, Paula Barbieri, wanted to attend the recital with Simpson but he did not invite her After the recital, Simpson returned home to a voicemail from Barbieri ending their relationship.\n\n\nDomestic violence\nThe prosecution opened its case by calling LAPD 911 dispatcher Sharon Gilbert and playing a 9-1-1 call from Brown on January 1, 1989, in which she expressed fear that Simpson would physically harm her; Simpson himself is even heard in the background yelling at her and possibly hitting her as well The officer who responded to that call, Detective John Edwards, testified next that when he arrived, a severely beaten Brown ran from the bushes where she was hiding and to the detective screaming \"He's going to kill me, he's going to kill me\", referring to Simpson Pictures of Brown's face from that night were then shown to the jury to confirm his testimony That incident led to Simpson's arrest and eventual pleading of no contest to one count of domestic violence for which he received probation for one year [164]\n\n\nTimeline\nThe physician Robert Huizenga testified in July 1995 [241] that Simpson was not physically capable of carrying out the murders due to chronic arthritis and old football injuries During cross-examination, the prosecution produced an exercise video that Simpson had made a few weeks before the murders titled O.J Simpson Minimum Maintenance: Fitness for Men, which demonstrated that Simpson was anything but frail [242] Huizenga admitted afterwards that Simpson could have committed the murders if he was in \"the throes of an adrenaline-rush\" [243]\n\n\nDNA evidence and blood trail\nThe prosecution presented a total of 108 exhibits, including 61 drops of blood, [197] of DNA evidence to link Simpson to the murders With no witnesses to the crime, the prosecution was dependent on DNA as the only physical evidence linking Simpson to the crime [158] The volume of DNA evidence in this case was unique and the prosecution believed they could reconstruct how the crime was committed with enough accuracy to resemble an eyewitness account [197] [198] Marcia Clark stated in her opening statements that there was a \"trail of blood from the Bundy Crime scene through Simpson's Ford Bronco to his bedroom at Rockingham\" [199]\n\n\nHair and fiber evidence\nLAPD criminalist and hair fiber expert Susan Brockbank testified on June 27, 1995, and FBI Special Agent and fiber expert Doug Deedrick testified on June 29, 1995, to the following findings: [207] [208]\n\n\nShoeprint analysis\nIn June, FBI shoeprint expert William J Bodziak testified that the bloody shoeprints found at the crime scene and inside Simpson's Bronco were made from a rare and expensive pair of Bruno Magli Italian shoes He determined the shoes were a size 12, the same size that Simpson wore, and are only sold at Bloomingdales Only 299 pairs of that size were sold in the US and one of them was sold at the same store that Simpson often buys his shoes from Bodziak also testified that, despite two sets of footprints at the crime scene, only one attacker was present because they were all made by the same shoes During cross-examination Bailey suggested the murderer deliberately wore shoes that were the wrong size, which Bodziak dismissed as \"ridiculous\" [168] [224] [225] [226] [227]\n\n\nDefense case\nSimpson hired a team of high-profile defense lawyers, initially led by Robert Shapiro, who was previously a civil lawyer known for settling, and then subsequently by Johnnie Cochran, who at that point was known for police brutality and civil rights cases [232] The team included noted defense attorney F Lee Bailey, Robert Kardashian, Harvard appeals lawyer Alan Dershowitz, his student Robert Blasier, and Dean of Santa Clara University School of Law Gerald Uelmen Assisting Cochran were Carl E Douglas and Shawn Holley Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld were also hired; they headed the Innocence Project and specialized in DNA evidence Simpson's defense was said to have cost between US$3-6 million; the media dubbed the talented attorneys the Dream Team, [233] [234] while the taxpayer cost of prosecution was over US$9 million [235]\n\n\nPostulate\nThe defense team's reasonable doubt angle was summarized as \"compromised, contaminated, corrupted\" in opening statements [236] [164] They argued the DNA evidence against Simpson was compromised by mishandling by Dennis Fung and Andrea Mazzola during the collection phase of evidence gathering, and that 100% of the DNA of the real killer(s) had vanished from the evidence samples [237] The defense argued that evidence was then contaminated in the LAPD crime lab by criminalist Collin Yamauchi and that Simpson's DNA from his reference vial was transferred to all but three exhibits [238] The remaining three exhibits were planted by the police and thus corrupted by police fraud [239] The defense also questioned the timeline, claiming the murders happened around 11:00 pm that night when Simpson has an alibi [240]\n\n\nTimeline\nThe physician Robert Huizenga testified in July 1995 [241] that Simpson was not physically capable of carrying out the murders due to chronic arthritis and old football injuries During cross-examination, the prosecution produced an exercise video that Simpson had made a few weeks before the murders titled O.J Simpson Minimum Maintenance: Fitness for Men, which demonstrated that Simpson was anything but frail [242] Huizenga admitted afterwards that Simpson could have committed the murders if he was in \"the throes of an adrenaline-rush\" [243]\n\n\nCompromised and contaminated\nBarry Scheck and Peter Neufeld argued that the results from the DNA testing were not reliable because the police were \"sloppy\" in collecting and preserving it from the crime scene [62] [262] Fung and Mazzola did admit to making several mistakes during evidence collection, which included not always changing gloves between handling evidence items, packaging and storing the evidence items using plastic bags rather than paper bags as recommended, and storing evidence in the police van, which was not refrigerated, for up to seven hours after collection [149] [150] [151] [152] [263] This, the defense argued, would allow bacteria to degrade the DNA and thus make the samples more susceptible to cross-contamination in the LAPD crime lab [264]\n\n\nPolice conspiracy allegation\nThe defense initially only claimed that three exhibits were planted by the police [285] but eventually argued that virtually all of the blood evidence against Simpson was planted in a police conspiracy [286] [287] [288] They accused prison nurse Thano Peratis, [289] criminalists Dennis Fung, [150] Andrea Mazzola, [152] and Colin Yamauchi, [238] and Vannatter [290] and Fuhrman, [291] of participating in a plot to frame Simpson In closing arguments, Cochran called Fuhrman and Vannatter \"twins of deception\", [292] Vannatter \"the man who carried the blood\" [293] and Fuhrman \"the man who found the glove\" [294]\n\n\nEDTA\nThe only physical evidence offered by the defense that the police tried to frame Simpson was the allegation that two of the 108 DNA evidence samples tested in the case contained the preservative Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) However, it was the prosecution who asked to have the samples tested for the preservative, not the defense [295] The defense alleged that the drop of blood on the back gate at the Bundy crime scene, which matched Simpson, and the blood found on a pair of socks in Simpson's bedroom, which matched Brown, were planted by the police In order to support this claim, the defense pointed to the presence in the blood samples of EDTA, a preservative found in the purple-topped collection tubes used for police reference vials In July 1995, Fredric Rieders, a forensic toxicologist who had analysed the FBI's results, testified that the level of EDTA in the evidence samples was higher than that which is normally found in blood: this appeared to support the defense's claim that the blood came from the reference vials [296] [297] During cross-examination, Clark asked Rieders to read out loud the portion of the EPA article that stated what the normal levels of EDTA in blood are, which he had referenced during his testimony [298] This demonstrated that he had misread the article and that the levels found in the evidence samples were consistent with those found in blood that was not preserved in a police reference vial [299] Rieders then claimed it was a \"typo\", [300] [301] but the prosecution produced a direct copy from the EPA confirming the normal amounts of EDTA found in unpreserved blood [299] [302] The prosecution also had Rieders admit that EDTA is found in food [303] and specifically the ingredients used in the McDonald's Big Mac and french fries [298] that Simpson had eaten earlier that night [302]\n\n\nBack gate\nThe defense alleged that Simpson's blood on the back gate at the Bundy crime scene was planted by the police The blood on the back gate was collected on July 3, 1994, rather than June 13 [310] The volume of DNA in that blood was significantly higher than the other blood evidence collected on June 13 The volume of DNA was so high that the defense conceded that it could not be explained by contamination in the lab However, they noted that it was unusual for that blood to have more DNA in it than the other samples collected at the crime scene, especially since it had been left exposed to the elements for several weeks and was collected after the crime scene had supposedly been washed over In March 1995, Vannatter testified that he instructed Fung to collect the blood on the gate on June 13 and Fung admitted he had not done so [311] The defense suggested the reason why Fung did not collect the blood is because it was not there that day; when shown a blown-up photograph taken of the back gate on June 13, he admitted he could not see the blood [312]\n\n\nBronco\nBarry Scheck alleged the police had twice planted the victims' blood inside Simpson's Bronco An initial collection was made on June 13; the defense accused Vannatter of planting the victims' blood in the Bronco when he returned to Simpson's home later that evening The prosecution responded that the Bronco had already been impounded by the time Vannatter returned and was not even at Rockingham [317]\n\n\nSocks\nThe defense alleged that the police had planted Brown's blood on the socks found in Simpson's bedroom The socks were collected on June 13 and had blood from both Simpson and Brown, but her blood on the socks was not identified until August 4 [318] The socks were found by Fuhrman, but the defense suggested Vannatter planted the blood He had received both blood reference vials from the victims earlier that day from the coroner and booked them immediately into evidence Vannatter then drove back to Rockingham later that evening to hand-deliver the reference vial for Simpson to Fung, which the defense alleged gave him opportunity to plant the blood Fung testified he could not see blood on the socks he collected from Simpson's bedroom, [150] and the prosecution later demonstrated that those blood stains were only visible underneath a microscope.\n\n\nGlove\nThe last exhibit allegedly planted was the bloody glove found at Simpson's property by Fuhrman [320] Unlike the sock and the back gate, the defense provided no physical or eyewitness evidence to support their claim that the prosecution could then refute [321] [322] The New Yorker published an article months before the trial began which cited a source in Simpson's defense team as saying that they intended to accuse Fuhrman of planting the glove, with the motive being racism Robert Shapiro later admitted he was the magazine's source [323]\n\n\nSummation\nIn closing arguments, Darden ridiculed the notion that police officers might have wanted to frame Simpson [2] He questioned why, if the LAPD was against Simpson, they went to his house eight times on domestic violence calls against Brown between 1986 and 1988 but did not arrest him; they only arrested him on charges of abuse in January 1989 Darden noted the police did not arrest Simpson for five days after the 1994 murders [2] During the prosecution's closing argument, Cochran and Scheck very notably objected seventy-one times in order to lessen its effect on the jury, [citation needed] and though Ito overruled sixty-nine of them, he did not once admonish Cochran or Scheck or threaten them with contempt of court for their behavior [citation needed]\n\n\nVerdict\nFears grew that race riots, similar to the riots in 1992, would erupt across Los Angeles and the rest of the country if Simpson were convicted of the murders As a result, all Los Angeles police officers were put on 12-hour shifts The police arranged for more than 100 police officers on horseback to surround the Los Angeles County courthouse on the day the verdict was announced, in case of rioting by the crowd President Bill Clinton was briefed on security measures if rioting were to occur nationwide.\n\n\nAcquittal and aftermath\nAfrican-American LAPD Police Chief Willie Williams indicated that he had no plans to reopen the investigation, saying of the acquittals, \"It doesn't mean there's another murderer\" The LAPD has also declined to reexamine the evidence with modern methods in recent years because Simpson could not be tried for the same crime again under the Fifth Amendment [355] [356]\n\n\nFate of the Broncos\nSimpson's 1993 Ford Bronco was never returned to him and was destroyed by the LAPD shortly after the trial ended [357] [358]\n\n\nLegislative changes\nThe strong public reaction to Brown's letters and statements describing her abuse [360] spurred passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, which Clark and Douglas referred to as the \"O.J rule\" [361] [362] [363] After the trial, researchers reported increased reporting, arrests, and harsher sentences for those convicted of domestic violence [364]\n\n\nAnalysis of polling data\nAfter the verdict, polling showed that 75 percent of White Americans thought Simpson was guilty while 70 percent of Black Americans thought he was innocent [365] [366] An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported 87 percent of Whites believed Simpson was guilty, compared to only 27 percent of Black respondents [367] In the 2010s, polling showed the gap had narrowed, with a majority of both now believing he was guilty: 83 percent of White and 57 percent of Black Americans [368] [369]\n\n\nPolitical impact and civil rights\nScholarly consensus is that the trial damaged race relations in America [370] and point to polling which shows that belief in Simpson's guilt depended on the race of the individual and not on the evidence against him [371] Analysis of the \"racial gap\" in polling shows that it did not cross the political spectrum Conservatives regardless of race or gender thought Simpson was guilty Where the gap emerged was among liberals – with black liberals believing Simpson was innocent, while white liberals thought he was guilty [372] Stanford University Law Professor Richard Thompson Ford wrote that this made the verdict a wedge issue that divided liberals along racial lines as white liberals felt the verdict was a racially motivated jury nullification and resented the images of African Americans celebrating the verdict [373] Led by Ward Connerly, opponents of affirmative action, seized upon the division and rebranded as advocating race neutrality, which appealed to white liberals now due to their perceived unjustness of the verdict [374] and in 1996 voters in California passed Proposition 209, which ended affirmative action programs in the state [375] [376] [377] A historic drop in diversity at the University of California system followed [378] which resulted in a similar drop in diversity that still remains [379] in the state's white-collar job market, especially in the high-tech hub of Silicon Valley [380] [381] A further initiative rejected by voters, Proposition 54 in 2003, would have further increased the impact of Prop 209 by abolishing racial classifications so the drop in diversity couldn't be quantified [382] [383] [384] The murder of George Floyd revived empathy for racial injustice among white liberals [385] [386] [387] but the unsuccessful attempt to repeal Proposition 209 in 2020 was credited to the trial's legacy of undermining race relations [388] [389] [390] [391]\n\n\nPublications\nSeveral jurors together published Madame Foreman in 1995 to respond to allegations the verdict was racially motivated They concluded that Simpson probably was guilty but the prosecution failed to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\nIf I Did It\nIn 2006, ReganBooks announced a book ghostwritten by Pablo Fenjves based on interviews with Simpson titled If I Did It, an account which the publisher said was a hypothetical confession The book's release was planned to coincide with a Fox interview featuring Simpson The project was cancelled due to public criticism Later, the Goldman family was awarded the rights to the book and published it under the title If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer In 2018, Fox broadcast Simpson's previously unaired interview in a special titled O.J Simpson: The Lost Confession? [400] The interview was widely interpreted as being a form of implied confession because Simpson used first person language (\"Obviously I must have  [removed the glove]\") [401] in explaining how he would have committed the murders [402] [403] [404] [405]\n\n\nPost-trial interviews\nIn an interview with Barbara Walters, Shapiro said he was offended by Cochran comparing Fuhrman to Adolf Hitler, and said he would never work with Bailey or Cochran again He also said the defense played the \"race card\" [406] [407] [408] Robert Kardashian admitted that, prior to the jurors visiting Simpson's home, the defense team had switched out his photos of white women for photos of his children and switched out a picture of a nude Paula Barbieri (Simpson's white then-girlfriend) for a Norman Rockwell painting from Cochran's office [409] [410] [411] [412] [413]\n\n\nCivil trial\nIn 1996, Fred Goldman and Sharon Rufo, the parents of Ron Goldman, and Lou Brown, father of Nicole Brown filed a civil suit against Simpson for wrongful death [435] The plaintiffs were represented by Daniel Petrocelli and Simpson by Robert Baker [436] Presiding Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki did not allow the trial to be televised, did not sequester the jury, and prohibited the defense from alleging racism by the LAPD and from condemning the crime lab [437] The physical evidence did not change but additional evidence of domestic violence was presented as well as 31 pre-1994 photos of Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes, [438] including one that was published 6 months before the murders, proving it could not be a forgery [439] Results from a polygraph test that Simpson denied taking showed \"extreme deception\" when he denied committing the murders Fuhrman did not testify but Simpson did on his own behalf and lied several times [440]\n\n\nAlternate theories and suspects\nWhile Bailey and several members of Simpson's family still advocated for Simpson's innocence, [452] [453] such theories have been rejected by prosecutors, witnesses and the families of Brown and Goldman, who have expressed the belief that Simpson committed the murders and was the sole perpetrator, [454] [455] [456] with Hunt opining that these claims were attempts to tap into the public interest in the case and were never meant to be taken seriously [457]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nLost Highway was partially inspired by the case In the film, a man is imprisoned for his wife's murder, which he does not remember, and is released after he transforms into a different man Director David Lynch  found it remarkable that Simpson, who he believed committed the murders, could continue a casual lifestyle afterward [483]\n\n\nMedia adaptations\nLost Highway was partially inspired by the case In the film, a man is

specifically, Simpson himself [486] Saturday Night Live Weekend Update host Norm Macdonald frequently made jokes about O. J Simpson's trial, such as the iconic line \"Well, it is finally official: Murder is legal in the state of California\" after Simpson's acquittal It is rumored that the constant Simpson jokes were the cause for then NBC President Don Ohlmeyer to remove Macdonald from the Weekend Update segment and eventually from the show altogether [487] [better source needed]\n\n\nMusic\nThe heavy-metal band Body Count recorded the song \"I Used to Love Her\", sung from the perspective of O. J Simpson murdering his wife, on their 1997 album Violent Demise: The Last Days A 2021 article in Metal Hammer described the song as \"jaw-droppingly offensive\" [490] In Good Charlotte's song, \"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous\", they reference the case in the second verse: \"Well did you know when you were famous you could kill you wife And there's no such thing as 25 to life As long as you've got the cash, to pay for Cochran.\" [491]\n\n\nVideo games\nDuke Nukem 3D has several allusions to the Simpson trial, including a television playing the Bronco chase [498]\n\n\nExhibits\nThe suit Simpson wore when he was acquitted was donated by Simpson's former agent Mike Gilbert to the Newseum in 2010 The Newseum had multiple trial-related items in their collection, including press passes, newspapers and the mute button that Superior Court Judge Lance Ito used when he wanted to shut off the live microphone in court so lawyers could talk privately during the trial The museum's acquisition of the suit ended the legal battle between Gilbert and Fred Goldman, both of whom claimed the right to the clothing [499]\n\n\nSee

Simpson Murder Case**\n\nThe O.J. Simpson murder case was a highly publicized and infamous trial that took place in 1995, in which former American football player and actor O.J. Simpson was accused of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman. The trial was one of the most-watched and sensationalized in American history, with millions of people tuning in to watch the drama unfold.\n\n**Background**\n\nO.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson met in 1977 when O.J. was 30 and Nicole was 18. They began dating, despite the fact that O.J. was still married at the time. In March 1979, O.J. filed for divorce from his first wife. Nicole and O.J. eventually married in 1985, but their relationship was marked by domestic violence and infidelity. Nicole had filed a police report against O.J. in 1989, alleging that he had physically abused her.\n\n**Simpson-Brown Marriage**\n\nThe marriage between O.J. and Nicole was rocky from the start. O.J. was known to be possessive and", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"O._J._Simpson_murder_case\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nBrown met Simpson in 1977 [22] when he was 30 and she was 18, working as a waitress at the Daisy (a Beverly Hills private club) [23] [24] They began dating although Simpson was married; he filed for divorce from his first wife in March 1979.\n\n\nSimpson–Brown marriage\nBrown met Simpson in 1977 [22] when he was 30 and she was 18, working as a waitress at the Daisy (a Beverly Hills private club) [23] [24] They began dating although Simpson was married; he filed for divorce from his first wife in March 1979.\n\n\nFrogmen\nA few months before the killings, Simpson finished filming a pilot for Frogmen, an adventure series comparable to The A-Team Simpson played the primary character, \"Bullfrog\" Burke, who led a gang of former US Navy SEALs He underwent \"a fair amount of\" military training for Frogmen, including the use of a knife, and in one scene, he held a knife to the throat of a woman playing his daughter Investigators discovered a 25-minute tape of the pilot, which did not feature the knife scene, and viewed it on Simpson's television while searching his home The defense attempted to prevent its use on these grounds, but Judge Ito permitted it to be shown [47] \"Bullfrog\" Burke was skilled at night killings, [48] and the \"silent kill\" technique of slashing the throat [49] SEALs also regularly wear knit \"watch caps\" like the one found at the scene [50]\n\n\nMurders\nOn the evening of June 12, 1994, Brown and Simpson both attended their daughter Sydney's dance recital at Paul Revere Middle School Afterward, Brown and her family went to eat at Mezzaluna restaurant One of the waiters at the restaurant was Ron Goldman, who had become close friends with Brown in recent weeks, [51] but was not assigned to the Brown family's table [52]\n\n\nFlight to Chicago\nOn the night of June 12, Simpson was scheduled to board a red-eye flight from Los Angeles International Airport to Chicago, where he was due to play golf the following day at a convention with representatives of The Hertz Corporation, for whom he was a spokesman [68] The flight was due to leave at 11:45 pm Limousine driver Allan Park arrived early at Simpson's Rockingham estate to pick him up at around 10:25 pm [69] [70] Park drove around the estate to make sure he could navigate the area with the stretch limousine properly and to see which driveway would have the best access for the car He began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, but got no response He noted the house was dark, and nobody appeared to be home as he smoked a cigarette and made several calls to his boss to get Simpson's home phone number He testified that he saw a \"shadowy African-American figure\", the same size as Simpson, enter the front door from where the driveway starts, before the lights came on; he did not see what direction the figure came from [71] [72] He testified that he saw Simpson's house number on the curb outside the estate, but no car was parked outside The prosecution presented exhibits showing the position next to the house number on the curb in which Simpson's Ford Bronco was found the next morning, implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there when he arrived to pick up Simpson [71] [69]\n\n\nInitial investigation and arrest\nAfter learning that Brown was the female victim, LAPD commander Keith Bushey ordered detectives Tom Lange, Philip Vannatter, Ron Phillips, and Mark Fuhrman to notify Simpson of her death and to escort him to the police station to pick up the former couple's children, who were asleep in Brown's condominium at the time of the murders The detectives buzzed the intercom at Simpson's estate for over 30 minutes but received no response They noted that Simpson's car was parked at an awkward angle, with its back end out more than the front, and that there was blood on the door, which they feared meant someone inside might be hurt Vannatter instructed Fuhrman to scale the wall and unlock the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter The detectives would argue they entered without a search warrant because of exigent circumstances – specifically out of fear that someone inside might be injured [82] Fuhrman briefly interviewed Kaelin, who told the detective that the car belonged to Simpson and that earlier that night he had heard thumps on his wall In a walk around the premises to inspect what may have caused the thumps, Fuhrman discovered a blood-stained right-hand glove, which was determined to be the mate of the left-hand glove found next to the body of Goldman This evidence along with the presence of blood in the driveway of the Rockingham estate and on Simpson's vehicle constituted probable cause and a search warrant for the location was applied for and granted [83]\n\n\n\"Suicide note\"\nAt 5 pm, Kardashian and one of his defense lawyers read Simpson's public letter [87] [91] [92] In the letter, Simpson sent greetings to 24 friends and wrote, \"First everyone understand I had nothing to do with Nicole's murder\" He described the fights with Brown and their decision not to reconcile their relationship, and asked the media \"as a last wish\" not to bother his children He wrote to his former girlfriend Paula Barbieri, who had broken up with him hours before the double murder, \"I'm sorry .. we're not going to have, our chance ..  [sic] As I leave, you'll be in my thoughts\" It also included \"I can't go on\" and an apology to the Goldman family The letter concluded, \"Don't feel sorry for me I have had a great life, great friends Please think of the real O J and not this lost person\" [87] [91] [89] [93] [92] Most interpreted this as a suicide note; Simpson's mother collapsed after hearing it, [87] [94] [63] [95] [96] and reporters joined the search for Simpson At Kardashian's press conference, Shapiro said that he and Simpson's psychiatrists agreed with the suicide note interpretation Through television, Shapiro appealed to Simpson to surrender [97] [87]\n\n\nBronco chase\nNews helicopters searched the Los Angeles highway system for Al Cowlings's automobile, a white 1993 Ford Bronco [95] [92] At 5:51 pm, Simpson reportedly called 9-1-1; the call was traced to the Santa Ana Freeway, near Lake Forest At around 6:20 pm, a motorist in Orange County notified California Highway Patrol after seeing someone believed to be Simpson in a Bronco on the I-5 freeway heading north The police tracked calls placed by Simpson on his cell phone At 6:45 pm, police officer Ruth Dixon saw the Bronco heading north on Interstate 405; when she caught up to it, Cowlings yelled out that Simpson was in the back seat of the vehicle and was pointing a gun at his own head [97] [87] [92] The officer backed off, but followed the vehicle [100] at 35 miles per hour (56 km/h), [9] with up to 20 police cars following her in the chase [87] [101] [102] Bob Tur [94] of KCBS-TV was the first to find Simpson from a news helicopter, after colleagues heard that the FBI's mobile phone tracking had located Simpson at the El Toro Y More than nine news helicopters eventually joined the pursuit; Tur compared the fleet to Apocalypse Now, and the high degree of media participation caused camera signals to appear on incorrect television channels [97] [92] The chase was so long that one helicopter ran out of fuel, forcing its station to ask another for a camera feed [63]\n\n\nPreliminary hearing\nOn June 20, Simpson was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to both murders and was held without bail The following day, a grand jury was called to determine whether to indict him for the two murders but was dismissed on June 23, as a result of excessive media coverage that could have influenced its neutrality Instead, authorities held a probable cause hearing to determine whether to bring Simpson to trial California Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell ruled on July 7 that there was sufficient evidence to bring Simpson to trial for the murders At his second arraignment on July 22, when asked how he pleaded to the murders, Simpson firmly stated: \"Absolutely, one hundred percent, not guilty.\" [112]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nWhen the trial began, all of the networks were getting these hate-mail letters because people's soap operas were being interrupted for the Simpson trial But then what happened was the people who liked soap operas got addicted to the Simpson trial And they got really upset when the Simpson trial was over, and people would come up to me on the street and say, 'God, I loved your show.'\n\nTrial\nSimpson wanted a speedy trial, and the defense and prosecuting attorneys worked around the clock for several months to prepare their cases The trial began on January 24, 1995, seven months after the murders, and was televised by closed-circuit TV camera via Court TV, and in part by other cable and network news outlets, for 134 days Judge Lance Ito presided over the trial in the C.S Foltz Criminal Courts Building.\n\n\nJury\nDistrict Attorney Gil Garcetti elected to file charges in downtown Los Angeles, as opposed to Santa Monica, in which jurisdiction the crimes took place [143] The Los Angeles Superior Court then decided to hold the trial in Downtown Los Angeles instead of Santa Monica due to safety issues at the Santa Monica Court house owing to the 1994 Northridge earthquake [144] The decision may have impacted the trial's outcome as it resulted in a jury pool that mainly consisted of African Americans [145] Richard Gabriel, a jury consultant noted that African Americans were far more likely than other minorities to be receptive to claims of racially motivated fraud by the police and were less likely to be familiar with and thus accept DNA evidence [143]\n\n\nProsecution case\nThe two lead prosecutors were Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark and William Hodgman, who was replaced as lead prosecutor by Christopher Darden Clark was designated as the lead prosecutor and Darden became Clark's co-counsel Prosecutors Hank Goldberg and Hodgman, who had successfully prosecuted high-profile cases in the past, assisted Clark and Darden Two prosecutors who were DNA experts, Rockne Harmon and George \"Woody\" Clarke, were brought in to present the DNA evidence in the case and were assisted by Prosecutor Lisa Kahn [156] [157] [158]\n\n\nTheory\nThe prosecution argued that the domestic violence within the Simpson-Brown marriage culminated in her murder [159] Simpson's history of abusing Brown resulted in their divorce and his pleading guilty to one count of domestic violence in 1989 [160] On the night of the murders, Simpson attended a dance recital for his daughter and was reportedly angry with Brown because of a black dress that she wore, which he said was \"tight\" Simpson's then girlfriend, Paula Barbieri, wanted to attend the recital with Simpson but he did not invite her After the recital, Simpson returned home to a voicemail from Barbieri ending their relationship.\n\n\nDomestic violence\nThe prosecution opened its case by calling LAPD 911 dispatcher Sharon Gilbert and playing a 9-1-1 call from Brown on January 1, 1989, in which she expressed fear that Simpson would physically harm her; Simpson himself is even heard in the background yelling at her and possibly hitting her as well The officer who responded to that call, Detective John Edwards, testified next that when he arrived, a severely beaten Brown ran from the bushes where she was hiding and to the detective screaming \"He's going to kill me, he's going to kill me\", referring to Simpson Pictures of Brown's face from that night were then shown to the jury to confirm his testimony That incident led to Simpson's arrest and eventual pleading of no contest to one count of domestic violence for which he received probation for one year [164]\n\n\nTimeline\nThe physician Robert Huizenga testified in July 1995 [241] that Simpson was not physically capable of carrying out the murders due to chronic arthritis and old football injuries During cross-examination, the prosecution produced an exercise video that Simpson had made a few weeks before the murders titled O.J Simpson Minimum Maintenance: Fitness for Men, which demonstrated that Simpson was anything but frail [242] Huizenga admitted afterwards that Simpson could have committed the murders if he was in \"the throes of an adrenaline-rush\" [243]\n\n\nDNA evidence and blood trail\nThe prosecution presented a total of 108 exhibits, including 61 drops of blood, [197] of DNA evidence to link Simpson to the murders With no witnesses to the crime, the prosecution was dependent on DNA as the only physical evidence linking Simpson to the crime [158] The volume of DNA evidence in this case was unique and the prosecution believed they could reconstruct how the crime was committed with enough accuracy to resemble an eyewitness account [197] [198] Marcia Clark stated in her opening statements that there was a \"trail of blood from the Bundy Crime scene through Simpson's Ford Bronco to his bedroom at Rockingham\" [199]\n\n\nHair and fiber evidence\nLAPD criminalist and hair fiber expert Susan Brockbank testified on June 27, 1995, and FBI Special Agent and fiber expert Doug Deedrick testified on June 29, 1995, to the following findings: [207] [208]\n\n\nShoeprint analysis\nIn June, FBI shoeprint expert William J Bodziak testified that the bloody shoeprints found at the crime scene and inside Simpson's Bronco were made from a rare and expensive pair of Bruno Magli Italian shoes He determined the shoes were a size 12, the same size that Simpson wore, and are only sold at Bloomingdales Only 299 pairs of that size were sold in the US and one of them was sold at the same store that Simpson often buys his shoes from Bodziak also testified that, despite two sets of footprints at the crime scene, only one attacker was present because they were all made by the same shoes During cross-examination Bailey suggested the murderer deliberately wore shoes that were the wrong size, which Bodziak dismissed as \"ridiculous\" [168] [224] [225] [226] [227]\n\n\nDefense case\nSimpson hired a team of high-profile defense lawyers, initially led by Robert Shapiro, who was previously a civil lawyer known for settling, and then subsequently by Johnnie Cochran, who at that point was known for police brutality and civil rights cases [232] The team included noted defense attorney F Lee Bailey, Robert Kardashian, Harvard appeals lawyer Alan Dershowitz, his student Robert Blasier, and Dean of Santa Clara University School of Law Gerald Uelmen Assisting Cochran were Carl E Douglas and Shawn Holley Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld were also hired; they headed the Innocence Project and specialized in DNA evidence Simpson's defense was said to have cost between US$3-6 million; the media dubbed the talented attorneys the Dream Team, [233] [234] while the taxpayer cost of prosecution was over US$9 million [235]\n\n\nPostulate\nThe defense team's reasonable doubt angle was summarized as \"compromised, contaminated, corrupted\" in opening statements [236] [164] They argued the DNA evidence against Simpson was compromised by mishandling by Dennis Fung and Andrea Mazzola during the collection phase of evidence gathering, and that 100% of the DNA of the real killer(s) had vanished from the evidence samples [237] The defense argued that evidence was then contaminated in the LAPD crime lab by criminalist Collin Yamauchi and that Simpson's DNA from his reference vial was transferred to all but three exhibits [238] The remaining three exhibits were planted by the police and thus corrupted by police fraud [239] The defense also questioned the timeline, claiming the murders happened around 11:00 pm that night when Simpson has an alibi [240]\n\n\nTimeline\nThe physician Robert Huizenga testified in July 1995 [241] that Simpson was not physically capable of carrying out the murders due to chronic arthritis and old football injuries During cross-examination, the prosecution produced an exercise video that Simpson had made a few weeks before the murders titled O.J Simpson Minimum Maintenance: Fitness for Men, which demonstrated that Simpson was anything but frail [242] Huizenga admitted afterwards that Simpson could have committed the murders if he was in \"the throes of an adrenaline-rush\" [243]\n\n\nCompromised and contaminated\nBarry Scheck and Peter Neufeld argued that the results from the DNA testing were not reliable because the police were \"sloppy\" in collecting and preserving it from the crime scene [62] [262] Fung and Mazzola did admit to making several mistakes during evidence collection, which included not always changing gloves between handling evidence items, packaging and storing the evidence items using plastic bags rather than paper bags as recommended, and storing evidence in the police van, which was not refrigerated, for up to seven hours after collection [149] [150] [151] [152] [263] This, the defense argued, would allow bacteria to degrade the DNA and thus make the samples more susceptible to cross-contamination in the LAPD crime lab [264]\n\n\nPolice conspiracy allegation\nThe defense initially only claimed that three exhibits were planted by the police [285] but eventually argued that virtually all of the blood evidence against Simpson was planted in a police conspiracy [286] [287] [288] They accused prison nurse Thano Peratis, [289] criminalists Dennis Fung, [150] Andrea Mazzola, [152] and Colin Yamauchi, [238] and Vannatter [290] and Fuhrman, [291] of participating in a plot to frame Simpson In closing arguments, Cochran called Fuhrman and Vannatter \"twins of deception\", [292] Vannatter \"the man who carried the blood\" [293] and Fuhrman \"the man who found the glove\" [294]\n\n\nEDTA\nThe only physical evidence offered by the defense that the police tried to frame Simpson was the allegation that two of the 108 DNA evidence samples tested in the case contained the preservative Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) However, it was the prosecution who asked to have the samples tested for the preservative, not the defense [295] The defense alleged that the drop of blood on the back gate at the Bundy crime scene, which matched Simpson, and the blood found on a pair of socks in Simpson's bedroom, which matched Brown, were planted by the police In order to support this claim, the defense pointed to the presence in the blood samples of EDTA, a preservative found in the purple-topped collection tubes used for police reference vials In July 1995, Fredric Rieders, a forensic toxicologist who had analysed the FBI's results, testified that the level of EDTA in the evidence samples was higher than that which is normally found in blood: this appeared to support the defense's claim that the blood came from the reference vials [296] [297] During cross-examination, Clark asked Rieders to read out loud the portion of the EPA article that stated what the normal levels of EDTA in blood are, which he had referenced during his testimony [298] This demonstrated that he had misread the article and that the levels found in the evidence samples were consistent with those found in blood that was not preserved in a police reference vial [299] Rieders then claimed it was a \"typo\", [300] [301] but the prosecution produced a direct copy from the EPA confirming the normal amounts of EDTA found in unpreserved blood [299] [302] The prosecution also had Rieders admit that EDTA is found in food [303] and specifically the ingredients used in the McDonald's Big Mac and french fries [298] that Simpson had eaten earlier that night [302]\n\n\nBack gate\nThe defense alleged that Simpson's blood on the back gate at the Bundy crime scene was planted by the police The blood on the back gate was collected on July 3, 1994, rather than June 13 [310] The volume of DNA in that blood was significantly higher than the other blood evidence collected on June 13 The volume of DNA was so high that the defense conceded that it could not be explained by contamination in the lab However, they noted that it was unusual for that blood to have more DNA in it than the other samples collected at the crime scene, especially since it had been left exposed to the elements for several weeks and was collected after the crime scene had supposedly been washed over In March 1995, Vannatter testified that he instructed Fung to collect the blood on the gate on June 13 and Fung admitted he had not done so [311] The defense suggested the reason why Fung did not collect the blood is because it was not there that day; when shown a blown-up photograph taken of the back gate on June 13, he admitted he could not see the blood [312]\n\n\nBronco\nBarry Scheck alleged the police had twice planted the victims' blood inside Simpson's Bronco An initial collection was made on June 13; the defense accused Vannatter of planting the victims' blood in the Bronco when he returned to Simpson's home later that evening The prosecution responded that the Bronco had already been impounded by the time Vannatter returned and was not even at Rockingham [317]\n\n\nSocks\nThe defense alleged that the police had planted Brown's blood on the socks found in Simpson's bedroom The socks were collected on June 13 and had blood from both Simpson and Brown, but her blood on the socks was not identified until August 4 [318] The socks were found by Fuhrman, but the defense suggested Vannatter planted the blood He had received both blood reference vials from the victims earlier that day from the coroner and booked them immediately into evidence Vannatter then drove back to Rockingham later that evening to hand-deliver the reference vial for Simpson to Fung, which the defense alleged gave him opportunity to plant the blood Fung testified he could not see blood on the socks he collected from Simpson's bedroom, [150] and the prosecution later demonstrated that those blood stains were only visible underneath a microscope.\n\n\nGlove\nThe last exhibit allegedly planted was the bloody glove found at Simpson's property by Fuhrman [320] Unlike the sock and the back gate, the defense provided no physical or eyewitness evidence to support their claim that the prosecution could then refute [321] [322] The New Yorker published an article months before the trial began which cited a source in Simpson's defense team as saying that they intended to accuse Fuhrman of planting the glove, with the motive being racism Robert Shapiro later admitted he was the magazine's source [323]\n\n\nSummation\nIn closing arguments, Darden ridiculed the notion that police officers might have wanted to frame Simpson [2] He questioned why, if the LAPD was against Simpson, they went to his house eight times on domestic violence calls against Brown between 1986 and 1988 but did not arrest him; they only arrested him on charges of abuse in January 1989 Darden noted the police did not arrest Simpson for five days after the 1994 murders [2] During the prosecution's closing argument, Cochran and Scheck very notably objected seventy-one times in order to lessen its effect on the jury, [citation needed] and though Ito overruled sixty-nine of them, he did not once admonish Cochran or Scheck or threaten them with contempt of court for their behavior [citation needed]\n\n\nVerdict\nFears grew that race riots, similar to the riots in 1992, would erupt across Los Angeles and the rest of the country if Simpson were convicted of the murders As a result, all Los Angeles police officers were put on 12-hour shifts The police arranged for more than 100 police officers on horseback to surround the Los Angeles County courthouse on the day the verdict was announced, in case of rioting by the crowd President Bill Clinton was briefed on security measures if rioting were to occur nationwide.\n\n\nAcquittal and aftermath\nAfrican-American LAPD Police Chief Willie Williams indicated that he had no plans to reopen the investigation, saying of the acquittals, \"It doesn't mean there's another murderer\" The LAPD has also declined to reexamine the evidence with modern methods in recent years because Simpson could not be tried for the same crime again under the Fifth Amendment [355] [356]\n\n\nFate of the Broncos\nSimpson's 1993 Ford Bronco was never returned to him and was destroyed by the LAPD shortly after the trial ended [357] [358]\n\n\nLegislative changes\nThe strong public reaction to Brown's letters and statements describing her abuse [360] spurred passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, which Clark and Douglas referred to as the \"O.J rule\" [361] [362] [363] After the trial, researchers reported increased reporting, arrests, and harsher sentences for those convicted of domestic violence [364]\n\n\nAnalysis of polling data\nAfter the verdict, polling showed that 75 percent of White Americans thought Simpson was guilty while 70 percent of Black Americans thought he was innocent [365] [366] An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported 87 percent of Whites believed Simpson was guilty, compared to only 27 percent of Black respondents [367] In the 2010s, polling showed the gap had narrowed, with a majority of both now believing he was guilty: 83 percent of White and 57 percent of Black Americans [368] [369]\n\n\nPolitical impact and civil rights\nScholarly consensus is that the trial damaged race relations in America [370] and point to polling which shows that belief in Simpson's guilt depended on the race of the individual and not on the evidence against him [371] Analysis of the \"racial gap\" in polling shows that it did not cross the political spectrum Conservatives regardless of race or gender thought Simpson was guilty Where the gap emerged was among liberals – with black liberals believing Simpson was innocent, while white liberals thought he was guilty [372] Stanford University Law Professor Richard Thompson Ford wrote that this made the verdict a wedge issue that divided liberals along racial lines as white liberals felt the verdict was a racially motivated jury nullification and resented the images of African Americans celebrating the verdict [373] Led by Ward Connerly, opponents of affirmative action, seized upon the division and rebranded as advocating race neutrality, which appealed to white liberals now due to their perceived unjustness of the verdict [374] and in 1996 voters in California passed Proposition 209, which ended affirmative action programs in the state [375] [376] [377] A historic drop in diversity at the University of California system followed [378] which resulted in a similar drop in diversity that still remains [379] in the state's white-collar job market, especially in the high-tech hub of Silicon Valley [380] [381] A further initiative rejected by voters, Proposition 54 in 2003, would have further increased the impact of Prop 209 by abolishing racial classifications so the drop in diversity couldn't be quantified [382] [383] [384] The murder of George Floyd revived empathy for racial injustice among white liberals [385] [386] [387] but the unsuccessful attempt to repeal Proposition 209 in 2020 was credited to the trial's legacy of undermining race relations [388] [389] [390] [391]\n\n\nPublications\nSeveral jurors together published Madame Foreman in 1995 to respond to allegations the verdict was racially motivated They concluded that Simpson probably was guilty but the prosecution failed to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\nIf I Did It\nIn 2006, ReganBooks announced a book ghostwritten by Pablo Fenjves based on interviews with Simpson titled If I Did It, an account which the publisher said was a hypothetical confession The book's release was planned to coincide with a Fox interview featuring Simpson The project was cancelled due to public criticism Later, the Goldman family was awarded the rights to the book and published it under the title If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer In 2018, Fox broadcast Simpson's previously unaired interview in a special titled O.J Simpson: The Lost Confession? [400] The interview was widely interpreted as being a form of implied confession because Simpson used first person language (\"Obviously I must have  [removed the glove]\") [401] in explaining how he would have committed the murders [402] [403] [404] [405]\n\n\nPost-trial interviews\nIn an interview with Barbara Walters, Shapiro said he was offended by Cochran comparing Fuhrman to Adolf Hitler, and said he would never work with Bailey or Cochran again He also said the defense played the \"race card\" [406] [407] [408] Robert Kardashian admitted that, prior to the jurors visiting Simpson's home, the defense team had switched out his photos of white women for photos of his children and switched out a picture of a nude Paula Barbieri (Simpson's white then-girlfriend) for a Norman Rockwell painting from Cochran's office [409] [410] [411] [412] [413]\n\n\nCivil trial\nIn 1996, Fred Goldman and Sharon Rufo, the parents of Ron Goldman, and Lou Brown, father of Nicole Brown filed a civil suit against Simpson for wrongful death [435] The plaintiffs were represented by Daniel Petrocelli and Simpson by Robert Baker [436] Presiding Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki did not allow the trial to be televised, did not sequester the jury, and prohibited the defense from alleging racism by the LAPD and from condemning the crime lab [437] The physical evidence did not change but additional evidence of domestic violence was presented as well as 31 pre-1994 photos of Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes, [438] including one that was published 6 months before the murders, proving it could not be a forgery [439] Results from a polygraph test that Simpson denied taking showed \"extreme deception\" when he denied committing the murders Fuhrman did not testify but Simpson did on his own behalf and lied several times [440]\n\n\nAlternate theories and suspects\nWhile Bailey and several members of Simpson's family still advocated for Simpson's innocence, [452] [453] such theories have been rejected by prosecutors, witnesses and the families of Brown and Goldman, who have expressed the belief that Simpson committed the murders and was the sole perpetrator, [454] [455] [456] with Hunt opining that these claims were attempts to tap into the public interest in the case and were never meant to be taken seriously [457]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nLost Highway was partially inspired by the case In the film, a man is imprisoned for his wife's murder, which he does not remember, and is released after he transforms into a different man Director David Lynch  found it remarkable that Simpson, who he believed committed the murders, could continue a casual lifestyle afterward [483]\n\n\nMedia adaptations\nLost Highway was partially inspired by the case In the film, a man is

afterward [483]\n\n\nTV\nEpisodes of sitcoms such as The Simpsons, South Park, Roseanne, New Girl, Family Guy, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and Seinfeld have mocked the case, or more specifically, Simpson himself [486] Saturday Night Live Weekend Update host Norm Macdonald frequently made jokes about O. J Simpson's trial, such as the iconic line \"Well, it is finally official: Murder is legal in the state of California\" after Simpson's acquittal It is rumored that the constant Simpson jokes were the cause for then NBC President Don Ohlmeyer to remove Macdonald from the Weekend Update segment and eventually from the show altogether [487] [better source needed]\n\n\nMusic\nThe heavy-metal band Body Count recorded the song \"I Used to Love Her\", sung from the perspective of O. J Simpson murdering his wife, on their 1997 album Violent Demise: The Last Days A 2021 article in Metal Hammer described the song as \"jaw-droppingly offensive\" [490] In Good Charlotte's song, \"Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous\", they reference the case in the second verse: \"Well did you know when you were famous you could kill you wife And there's no such thing as 25 to life As long as you've got the cash, to pay for Cochran.\" [491]\n\n\nVideo games\nDuke Nukem 3D has several allusions to the Simpson trial, including a television playing the Bronco chase [498]\n\n\nExhibits\nThe suit Simpson wore when he was acquitted was donated by Simpson's former agent Mike Gilbert to the Newseum in 2010 The Newseum had multiple trial-related items in their collection, including press passes, newspapers and the mute button that Superior Court Judge Lance Ito used when he wanted to shut off the live microphone in court so lawyers could talk privately during the trial The museum's acquisition of the suit ended the legal battle between Gilbert and Fred Goldman, both of whom claimed the right to the clothing [499]\n\n\nSee

about casting Shraddha Srinath as the lead actress, as she had already been paired with Madhavan in Vikram Vedha (2017), but finalised her because Maara was in a different genre [14] The director also

Siddharth to play the titular role [4] [5] In April 2016, R Madhavan was signed on to play the lead role, while Prakkat agreed to also direct the Tamil version of the film [6] [7] The director later opted out and A L Vijay was signed in June 2016 to helm the project, and agreed in principle to take up the project after the completion of his commitments on Devi (2016) and Vanamagan (2017) [8] [9]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn June 2018, Pramod Films announced that they would make the film under the title of Maara with director Dhilip Kumar (of Kalki fame) signed on to replace Vijay Dhilip confirmed that the makers were keen to retain Madhavan for the film despite the change of crew, believing that only the actor had the \"innate charm\" meant for the character of the lead protagonist Dhilip stated that the makers were initially apprehensive about casting Shraddha Srinath as the lead actress, as she had already been paired with Madhavan in Vikram Vedha (2017), but finalised her because Maara was in a different genre [14] The director also suggested that he felt both Madhavan and Shraddha shared the real-life characteristics of their on-screen roles Ghibran was signed as the film's music composer, and cinematographers Dinesh Krishnan and Karthik Muthukumar, editor Bhuvan Srinivasan, Malayali art director Ajayan Challisery was also picked to join the crew [15]\n\n\nFilming\nThe actors completed a week-long rehearsal before the start of shoot, with production beginning in Pondicherry on 18 June 2018 [16] [17] The film was subsequently put on hold and Madhavan later became busy with the production of his first directorial venture, Rocketry: The Nambi Effect (2020), meaning that there was a schedule break of over a year In October 2019, production restarted in Kochi with child actor Minon and comedian Alexander Babu joining the cast [18] [19] [20] In June 2020, the film's production house Pramod Films, stated that 50% of the film's shooting was completed in March 2020, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India [21] The makers subsequently planned to wrap the pending portions in a single stretch, [22] adhering to the safety guidelines imposed by the government, to curb the COVID-19 spread [23] The film entered post-production in June 2020 [24]\n\n\nMusic\nThe film's music and background score were composed by Ghibran, with lyrics written by Thamarai On 28 October 2020, Think Music India released the lyrical video of the first single \"Yaar Azhaippadhu\", [25] sung by Sid Sriram [citation needed] The second single \"Oru Arai Unathu\", sung by Yazin Nizar and Sanah Moidutty was released on 20 November 2020 [26] The third single \"Oh Azhage\" sung by Benny Dayal, was released on 4 December 2020 The full album was released on 30 December 2020 [27]\n\n\nRelease\nThe film was scheduled to release directly through Amazon Prime Video, skipping theatrical release, as a result of theatres being shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India [29] On 9 October 2020, [30] Amazon Prime announced the release date of 9 original films, [31] which included Maara scheduled for a release on 17 December 2020 [32] [33] However, a new release date of 8 January 2021 was announced later [34] [35]\n\n\nReception\nThe film opened with mixed-to-positive response from critics The general audience, however, have given it a more favourable rating [36] [37] [38] M Suganth, editor-in-chief of The Times of India gave 3 out of 5 stars stating \"The additional focus on this track results in an increased running time, and also takes the spotlight away from the Paru-Maara romance, leading to an ending that doesn’t leave you on a high that the initial moments promised.\" [39] Logesh Balachandran, writing for India Today, gave 3 out of 5 and stated \"Though it's difficult to recreate the magic of the original film Charlie, Dhilip has managed to retain its essence and delivered a film that leaves a lasting impact.\" [40] Film critic Shubham Kulkarni, writing for the website Koimoi, gave 3 out of 5 stating \"Maara is not for the ones who cannot have a bit suspension of disbelief But if you have an imagination that can travel far, go for it There are flaws and a lot of them, but there is a lot of hope too, let’s see at the greener side this time.\" [41]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

While modeling overseas, Jung periodically returned to South Korea to take acting lessons, eventually completing three months' worth of courses. Jung also improved her English skills to enhance her acting abilities.\n\nIn 2020, Jung made her acting debut in the Netflix series \"Squid Game,\" playing the lead role of Kang Sae-byeok. Her performance in the series earned her critical acclaim and widespread recognition, propelling her to international stardom.\n\n**Public Image**\n\nJung's public image has undergone significant transformation over the years.

Jung's social media following has also grown significantly, with her becoming the most-followed South Korean actress on Instagram in 2021.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nJung has been in a relationship with actor Lee Dong-hwi since 2015. The couple keeps their relationship relatively private, but their love for each other is evident in their public appearances together.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* **Film**\n\t+ \"The Truth\" (2021)\n\t+ \"Squid Game: The Special Season\" (2022)\n* **Television**\n\t+ \"Squid Game\" (2021)\n\t+ \"The Confession\" (2021)\n* **Music Videos**\n\t+ \"Move\" by Kim Yeon-woo (2014)\n\t+ \"Down by the Bay\" by Dean (2018)\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\n* **Listicles**\n\t+ \"The 100 Most Beautiful People in the World\" by Time Magazine (2021)\n\t+ \"The 50 Most Influential People in the World\" by Time Magazine (2022)\n\n**Notes**\n\nHoYeon Jung's rise to international stardom is a testament to her hard work, dedication, and natural talent.

Born on April 23, 1997, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he grew up in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. Callaghan's early life and career have been marked by a unique blend of journalism, activism, and creative endeavors.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nAndrew Thomas Callaghan was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on April 23, 1997. He grew up in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, where he developed an interest in journalism and storytelling from an early age. Callaghan has said that he \"hated every class from the first day of kindergarten to [his] last day of college\" except for a journalism class he took in his junior year of high school. This class, taught by a dedicated instructor, convinced him to pursue his passion for journalism.\n\nDuring high school and a gap year before college, Callaghan interviewed people associated with the darknet market Silk Road, Occupy Seattle protesters, and juggalos. These experiences not only honed his journalistic skills but also introduced him to the complexities of online communities and social movements.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter relocating to New Orleans, Louisiana, Callaghan studied journalism on a full scholarship at Loyola University. During his time at Loyola, he worked as a doorman on Bourbon Street to support himself. This experience provided him with a unique perspective on the city's nightlife and its inhabitants. Callaghan has said that he saw \"hellish scenes\" while working on Bourbon Street and wanted to find a funny or clever way to document them.\n\nIn response, Callaghan began interviewing people on the streets of New Orleans about their darkest secrets while they were intoxicated. This project, which he compiled into a YouTube and Instagram series called Quarter Confessions, would eventually lead to a partnership with Doing Things Media.\n\n**Quarter Confessions**\n\nQuarter Confessions is a YouTube and Instagram series created by Andrew Callaghan. The series features interviews with people on the streets of New Orleans about their darkest secrets while they are intoxicated. Callaghan has said that he was drawn to this project because it allowed him to explore the complexities of human behavior and the ways in which people reveal their true selves when they are under the influence of substances.\n\nThe series has been praised for its raw and unflinching portrayal of human vulnerability. However, it has also been criticized for its potential to exploit or manipulate its subjects. Callaghan has responded to these criticisms by emphasizing the importance of consent and respect in his interactions with his subjects.\n\n**All Gas No Brakes**\n\nIn 2019, Callaghan published All Gas, No Brakes: A Hitchhiker's Diary, a memoir-zine recounting stories from a 70-day hitchhiking trip across America that he undertook two years prior at the age of 19. The idea for the YouTube series All Gas No Brakes was conceived from this memoir, before beginning his journalism studies at university.\n\nAll Gas No Brakes is a YouTube series that features Callaghan and his friends embarking on road trips and exploring the American wilderness. The series has been praised for its humor, wit, and beautiful cinematography. However, it has also been criticized for its potential to perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce existing power dynamics.\n\n**Abso Lutely Productions and This Place Rules**\n\nIn May 2020, Doing Things Media and Abso Lutely Productions entered a deal to develop a television series based on All Gas No Brakes. Callaghan said the partnership began when Eric Wareheim, one half of the comedy duo Tim & Eric alongside Tim Heidecker, privately messaged him on Twitter to ask about creating a television series. As the co-founders of Abso Lutely, Wareheim, Heidecker, and Dave Kneebone would serve as executive producers; Callaghan, Reid Hailey, and Max Benator would serve as executive producers for Doing Things Media.\n\nFollowing Callaghan's departure from Doing Things Media, Heidecker confirmed that Abso Lutely would still be working with Callaghan on \"something major.\"\n\n**Channel 5**\n\nOn April 5, 2021, Callaghan released the first content for Channel 5 through Patreon. The show is created by the same core members of the crew in a similar style to All Gas No Brakes. The first episode was uploaded to YouTube on April 11, 2021, and documented spring breakers in Miami. However, it was removed by YouTube shortly thereafter due to being accused of spreading COVID-19 misinformation. It was reinstated five days later. His next episode was released on April 29 and was about the trial of Derek Chauvin.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nCallaghan has said that he excessively used psilocybin around the age of 13 and suffers from hallucinogen persisting perception disorder as a result. This experience has had a lasting impact on his life and has shaped his perspective on mental health and substance use.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nIn January 2023, two women posted TikTok videos accusing Callaghan of trying to pressure them into having sex with him. A reporter at The Stranger then interviewed two other women who alleged that Callaghan tried to pressure them into having sex with him and made them uncomfortable. On January 12, his legal representative responded to the allegations in a statement released to Variety, saying in part: \"Conversations about pressure and consent are extremely important and Andrew wants to have these conversations, so he can continue to learn and grow.

Her name, ꜥm-mwt, translates to \"Devourer of the Dead\" or \"Swallower of the Dead\", highlighting her role as a symbol of death and destruction.\n\nNomenclature\n------------\n\nThe name Ammit is derived from the ancient Egyptian words \"ꜥm\" meaning \"to swallow\" and \"mwt\" signifying \"the dead\". In this context, Ammit was not referred to as a deity, but rather as a demon or a creature that embodied the concept of death. The name Ammit has been translated in various ways, including \"Devoureress of the Dead\" and \"Swallower of the Dead\", emphasizing her role as a formidable force in ancient Egyptian mythology.\n\nIconography\n------------\n\nAmmit was often depicted in ancient Egyptian art as a hybrid creature, combining the body of a crocodile, lion, or jackal with the head of a human or a falcon. This unique depiction was meant to convey her role as a guardian demon, tasked with protecting the gates of the underworld and devouring the souls of the unworthy. The iconography of Ammit varied across different regions and time periods, reflecting the diverse artistic styles and traditions of ancient Egypt.\n\nRole in ancient Egyptian religion\n--------------------------------\n\nUnlike other gods featured in ancient Egyptian religion, Ammit was not worshipped or revered as a deity. Instead, she was feared and viewed as a demon or a creature, rather than a benevolent being. This distinction was significant, as deities and demons were differentiated by the presence or absence of a cult or center of worship. Ammit's role as a guardian demon was tied to a specific place, such as the underworld or the gates of the afterlife, and her appearance was meant to be feared and recognized by the dead.\n\nDuring the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptian pantheon was characterized by a complex system of deities and demons, each with their own roles and responsibilities. Ammit's position as a guardian demon was unique, as she was tasked with protecting the gates of the underworld and devouring the souls of the unworthy. This role was reflected in her depiction as a fearsome creature, with the body of a crocodile or lion and the head of a human or falcon.\n\nWeighing of the Heart\n---------------------\n\nThe weighing of the heart was an ancient Egyptian ritual, where the heart of the deceased was weighed against the feather of truth (Ma'at). If the heart was found to be lighter than the feather, the soul was deemed worthy and allowed to enter the afterlife. If the heart was heavier, the soul was devoured by Ammit, signifying its unworthiness. This ritual was a key aspect of ancient Egyptian funerary practices, reflecting the importance of moral accountability and the pursuit of justice in the afterlife.\n\nIn popular culture\n-------------------\n\nAmmit has appeared in various forms of media, including television series, cartoons, and literature. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series Moon Knight (2022), Ammit is portrayed by actress Saba Mubarak. In the Mummies Alive! cartoon series, Ammit is depicted as a dog-like creature who becomes the pet of the main villain, Scarab. In Rick Riordan's series The Kane Chronicles, Ammit is portrayed as a powerful and fearsome creature, tasked with devouring the souls of the unworthy. In the television series Primeval, Ammit is depicted as a prehistoric creature that travels through time to ancient Egypt.\n\nGallery\n--------\n\n*   Ammit, depicted as a hybrid creature with the body of a crocodile and the head of a human, from an ancient Egyptian tomb painting\n*   Ammit, depicted as a fearsome creature with the body of a lion and the head of a falcon, from an ancient Egyptian relief\n*   Ammit, depicted as a guardian demon, from an ancient Egyptian funerary text\n*   Ammit, depicted as a powerful and fearsome creature, from Rick Riordan's series The Kane Chronicles\n\nSee also\n----------\n\n*   Ancient Egyptian mythology\n*   Guardian demon\n*   Weighing of the heart\n*   Ma'at\n*   The Kane Chronicles\n\nExplanatory notes\n-------------------\n\n*   The name Ammit is derived from the ancient Egyptian words \"ꜥm\" meaning \"to swallow\" and \"mwt\" signifying \"the dead\".\n*   Ammit was often depicted in ancient Egyptian art as a hybrid creature, combining the body of a crocodile, lion, or jackal with the head of a human or a falcon.\n*   Unlike other gods featured in ancient Egyptian religion, Ammit was not worshipped or revered as a deity.

mother was a homemaker The family moved from Plattsburgh, New York, to Littleton, Colorado, in July 1993, when his father retired from military service [15]\n\n\nDylan Klebold\nDylan Bennet Klebold (/ˈkliːboʊld/ KLEE-bohld; September 11, 1981 – April 20, 1999) was born in Lakewood, Colorado [15] His parents were pacifists and attended a Lutheran church with their children Both Dylan and his older brother, Byron, attended confirmation classes in accordance with the Lutheran tradition [19] As had been the case with his older brother, Klebold was named after a renowned poet—in his case, the playwright Dylan Thomas [20]\n\n\nBackground\nIn 1996, 15-year-old Eric Harris created a private website on America Online (AOL) [e] It was initially to host levels (also known as WADs) Harris created for use in the first-person shooter video games Doom, Doom II, and Quake [22] [23] [f] On the site, Harris began a blog, which included details about Harris sneaking out of the house to cause mischief and vandalism, such as lighting fireworks with Klebold and others [25] These were known as \"Rebel Missions\", [26] and Harris's blog primarily consisted of \"mission logs\" Beginning in early 1997, the blog postings began to show the first signs of Harris's anger against society [27] By the end of the year, the site contained instructions on how to make explosives [28] Harris's site attracted few visitors and caused no concern until August 1997, after Harris ended a blog post detailing murderous fantasies with \"All I want to do is kill and injure as many of you as I can, especially a few people Like Brooks Brown.\" Brown was a classmate of his [29] [g] After Brown's parents viewed the site, they contacted the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office on August 7, 1997 An investigator wrote a draft affidavit to request a search warrant for the Harris household, but it was never submitted to a judge [31] [17] [32]\n\n\nCriminal history\nIn 1996, 15-year-old Eric Harris created a private

never submitted to a judge [31] [17] [32]\n\n\nWritings\nShortly after the court hearing for the van break-in, Harris reverted his website back to just hosting user-created levels of Doom He began to write his thoughts down in a journal Klebold had already been keeping a personal journal since March 1997; as early as November of that year, Klebold had mentioned going on a killing spree Klebold used his journal to vent about his personal problems as well as what he'd wear and use during the attack [36] In both their journals, Harris and Klebold would later plot the attack Soon after beginning his journal, Harris typed out a plan for an attack which included possibly escaping to a foreign country after the massacre, or hijacking an aircraft at Denver International Airport and crashing it into New York City [17]\n\n\nTapes\nHarris and Klebold were both enrolled in video-production classes and kept five video tapes that were recorded with school video equipment [53] Only two of these, \"Hitmen for Hire\" and \"Rampart Range\", and part of a third known as \"Radioactive Clothing\", have been released [j] The remaining three tapes detailed their plans and reasons for the massacre, including the ways they hid their weapons and deceived their parents [55] Most were shot in the Harris family basement, and are thus known as the Basement Tapes Thirty minutes before the attack, they made a final video saying goodbye and apologizing to their friends and families [56]\n\n\nBasement tapes\nHarris and Klebold were both enrolled in video-production classes and kept five

and are thus known as the Basement Tapes Thirty minutes before the attack, they made a final video saying goodbye and apologizing to their friends and families [56]\n\n\nNixon tape\nBefore the massacre, Harris left a micro cassette labeled \"Nixon\" on the kitchen table On it Harris said \"It is less than nine hours now,\" placing the recording at some time around 2:30 a.m He went on to say \"People will die because of me,\" and \"It will be a day that will be remembered forever.\" [70]\n\n\nWeaponry\nIn the months prior to the attacks, Harris and Klebold acquired two 9mm firearms and two 12-gauge shotguns Harris had a Hi-Point 995 carbine with thirteen 10-round magazines and a Savage-Springfield 67H pump shotgun Klebold used a 9mm Intratec TEC-DC9 semi-automatic handgun with one 52-, one 32-, and one 28-round magazine and a Stevens 311D double-barreled shotgun Harris' shotgun was sawed-off to around 26 inches (0.66 m) and Klebold shortened his shotgun's length to 23 inches (0.58 m), a felony under the National Firearms Act [71] [72]\nOn November 22, 1998, their friend Robyn Anderson purchased a carbine rifle and the two shotguns for the pair at the Tanner Gun Show, as they were too young to legally purchase the guns themselves After the attack, she told investigators that she had believed the pair wanted the weapons for target shooting and denied that she had prior knowledge of their plans [20] Anderson was not charged [73] [74] [l]\n\n\nGuns\nIn the months prior to the attacks, Harris and Klebold acquired two 9mm firearms and two 12-gauge shotguns Harris had a

Anderson was not charged [73] [74] [l]\n\n\nExplosives\nIn addition to the firearms, the complex and highly planned attack involved several improvised explosive devices Harris and Klebold constructed a total of 99 bombs [79] These included pipe bombs, carbon-dioxide cartridges filled with gunpowder (called \"crickets\" [80]), Molotov cocktails, and propane tanks converted to bombs The propane bombs were used in the cafeteria, the shooters' cars, and in another location intended as a diversion For ignition, they used storm matches, cannon fuses, and model rocket igniters as well as timing devices built from mechanical alarm clocks for the propane bombs [81] During the massacre, they carried match strikers taped to their forearms for easy ignition of the pipe bombs and CO2 bombs.\n\n\nPipe bombs\nHarris's website contained instructions on making pipe bombs and Molotovs, and the extensive use of shrapnel [28] Harris's father once discovered one of his pipe bombs [83] Harris's journal logged the creation of 25 pipe bombs [79]\n\n\nCafeteria bombs\nThey had in their possession eight propane tanks all converted into bombs The weekend before the shooting, Harris and Klebold bought two propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store They bought six propane tanks on the morning of the attack [86] Harris was caught on a Texaco gas station security camera at 9:12 a.m buying a Blue Rhino propane tank [87] Both cafeteria bombs included a single 20-pound tank, attached pipe bombs, and supporting gasoline canisters alongside [88]\n\n\nCar bombs\nBoth car bombs were made from two 20-pound propane tanks, pipe bombs, and various containers filled with gasoline were spread throughout the vehicles [88] Eight pipe bombs were placed in Klebold's car, and one in Harris' [79]\n\n\nKnives\nHarris and Klebold were both equipped with knives, but investigators do not believe they ever utilized them during the massacre Harris had a boot knife on his belt and a \"Khyber-pass\" machete bowie knife taped to the back of his ankle Both had an \"R\", referencing Harris's alias \"REB\", etched into the handle, and the machete had a swastika on the sheath Klebold had a \"Cobra\" knife mounted to his belt on the left side as well as a switchblade in his right pocket [89]\n\n\nThe massacre\nAccording to the shooters' respective journals and video tapes, it is believed by investigators that the pair intended to detonate their propane bombs in the cafeteria at the busiest lunch hour, [90] killing hundreds of students After this, they would shoot and stab survivors, as well as lob bombs Bombs set in their cars in the parking lot would also eventually detonate, killing more students as well as possibly any police officers, paramedics, firemen, or reporters who had come to the school [37] [91] [m] However, the bombs in the cafeteria and cars failed to detonate [93]\n\n\nPlanting the bombs\nOn Tuesday morning, April 20, 1999, Harris and Klebold placed two duffel bags in the cafeteria Each bag contained propane bombs, set to detonate during the \"A\" lunch shift, which began at 11:15 a.m [o]\n\n\n11:19 a.m.: Shooting begins\nAt 11:19 a.m., 17-year-old Rachel Scott and her friend Richard Castaldo were having lunch and sitting on the grass next to the west entrance of the school Klebold threw a pipe bomb towards the parking lot; the bomb only partially detonated, causing it to give off smoke Castaldo thought it was no more than a crude senior prank Likewise, several students during the incident first thought that they were watching a prank [111] [112]\n\n\n11:22 a.m.: Police response and West Entrance shootouts\nAt 11:22 a.m., a custodian called Deputy Neil Gardner, the assigned resource officer to Columbine, on the school radio, requesting assistance in the senior parking lot The only paved route took him around the school to the east and south on Pierce Street, where at 11:23 a.m., he heard on his police radio that a female was down, and assumed she had been struck by a car While exiting his patrol car in the senior lot at 11:24, he heard another call on the school radio, \"Neil, there's a shooter in the school.\" [104]\n\n\n11:29–11:36 a.m.: Library massacre\n\nAt 11:29 a.m., Harris and Klebold entered the library Fifty-two students, two teachers and two librarians were inside [131]\n\n12:08 p.m.: Suicides\nAfter leaving the library, Harris and Klebold entered the science area, where they caused a fire in an empty storage closet It was extinguished by a teacher who had hidden in an adjacent room [148] The gunmen then proceeded toward the south hallway, where they shot into an empty science room At 11:44 a.m., they were captured on the school security cameras as they re-entered the cafeteria The recording shows Harris crouching against the rail on the staircase and firing toward the propane bombs left in the cafeteria, in an unsuccessful attempt to detonate them [149] As Klebold approached the propane bomb and examined it, Harris took a drink from one of the cups left behind Klebold lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it at the propane bomb About a minute later, the gallon of fuel attached to the bomb ignited, causing a fire that was extinguished by the fire sprinklers a few minutes later [150] They left the cafeteria at 11:46.\n\n\nCrisis ends\nBy 12:00 p.m., SWAT teams were stationed outside the school, and ambulances started taking the wounded to local hospitals A call for additional ammunition for police officers in case of a shootout came at 12:20 Authorities reported pipe bombs by 1:00, and two SWAT teams entered the school at 1:09, moving from classroom to classroom, discovering hidden students and faculty [155] They entered at the end of the school opposite the library, hampered by old maps and unaware a new wing had recently been added They were also hampered by the sound of the fire alarms [156]\n\n\nSWAT response\nBy 12:00 p.m., SWAT teams were stationed outside the school, and ambulances started taking the wounded to local hospitals A call for additional ammunition for police officers in case of a shootout came at 12:20 Authorities reported pipe bombs by 1:00, and two SWAT teams entered the school at 1:09, moving from classroom to classroom, discovering hidden students and faculty [155] They entered at the end of the school opposite the library, hampered by old maps and unaware a new wing had recently been added They were also hampered by the sound of the fire alarms [156]\n\n\nLeawood Elementary\nMeanwhile, families of students and staff were asked to gather at nearby Leawood Elementary School to await information All students, teachers, and school employees were taken away, questioned, and offered medical care in small holding areas before being bussed to meet with their family members at Leawood Elementary In his book Walking in Daniel's Shoes, Tom Mauser, father of victim Daniel Mauser, recounts how several families who'd still been waiting on word of the status of their children were informed by law enforcement that another bus from the school was on its way However, this bus never arrived, and whether the comments from police stemmed from miscommunication or were an attempt to give distraught parents hope is unknown [157]\n\n\nThe boy in the window\nPatrick Ireland had regained and lost consciousness several times after being shot by Klebold Paralyzed on his right side, he crawled to the library windows where, on live television, at 2:38 p.m., he stretched out the window, intending to fall into the arms of two SWAT team members standing on the roof of an emergency vehicle, but instead falling directly onto the vehicle's roof in a pool of blood He became known as \"the boy in the window.\" [119] [158] The team members, Donn Kraemer and John Ramoniec, were later criticized for allowing Ireland to drop more than seven feet to the ground while doing nothing to try to ensure he could be lowered to the ground safely or break his fall.\n\n\n\"1 bleeding to death\"\nAt 2:15 p.m., students placed a sign in the window: \"1 bleeding to death\", in order to alert police and medical personnel of Dave Sanders' location in the science room [111] [125] Police initially feared it was a ruse by the shooters A shirt was also tied to the doorknob At 2:30, this was spotted, and by 2:40, SWAT officers evacuated the room of students and called for a paramedic [155] Hancey and Starkey were reluctant to leave Sanders behind [125] [127] By 3:00, the SWAT officers had moved Sanders to a storage room, which was more easily accessible [159] As they did so, a paramedic arrived and found Sanders had no pulse [125] [155] He had died of his injuries in the storage room before he could receive medical care He was the only teacher to die in the shooting.\n\n\nSuicide mission; estimated 25 dead\nLisa Kreutz, shot in the shoulder, arms, hand, and thigh, remained lying in the library She had tried to move but became light-headed Kreutz kept track of time by the sound of the school's bells until police arrived [citation needed] Kreutz was finally evacuated at 3:22 p.m., along with Patti Nielson, Brian Anderson, and the three library staff who had hidden in the rooms adjacent to the library Officials found the bodies in the library by 3:30 [155]\n\n\nBomb squad response\nStone said that police officers were searching the bodies of the gunmen They feared they had used their pipe bombs to booby-trap corpses, including their own At 4:30 p.m., the school was declared safe At 5:30, additional officers were called in, as more explosives were found in the parking lot and on the roof By 6:15, officials had found a bomb in Klebold's car in the parking lot, set to detonate the gas tank [161] Stone then marked the entire school as a crime scene [citation needed]\n\n\nImmediate aftermath\nOn the morning of April 21, bomb squads combed the high school By 8:30 a.m., the official death toll of 15 was released [163] The earlier estimate was ten over the true death toll count, but close to the total count of wounded students The total count of deaths was 12 students (14 including the shooters) and one teacher; 20 students and one teacher were injured as a result of the shootings Three more victims were injured indirectly as they tried to escape the school.\n\n\nSearch warrant press conference\nAlso on April 30, high-ranking officials of Jefferson County and the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office met to decide if they should reveal that Michael Guerra had drafted an affidavit for a search warrant of Harris's residence more than a year before the shootings, based on his previous investigation of Harris's website and activities [35] Since the affidavit's contents lacked the necessary probable cause, they decided not to disclose this information at a press conference held on April 30, nor did they mention it in any other way [167]\n\n\nChristian martyrdom\nIn the wake of the shooting, victims Rachel Scott and Cassie Bernall came to be regarded as Christian martyrs by Evangelical Christians [138] [169] [170] [171]\n\n\nWe are Columbine\nClasses at Columbine were held at nearby Chatfield Senior High for the remaining three weeks of the 1999 school year [176] In August 1999, students returned to the school, and principal Frank DeAngelis led a rally of students clad in \"We are Columbine\" shirts [177]\n\n\nSecondary casualties\nSix months after the shootings, Anne Marie Hochhalter's mother killed herself [118] [119] Several former students and teachers had PTSD [178] Greg Barnes, a 17-year-old student who had witnessed Sanders' shooting, died by suicide in May 2000 [179] Survivor Austin Eubanks, who was injured during the shooting, became heavily medicated, developing an opioid addiction [180] He eventually overcame and later spoke publicly about the addiction, but died from an accidental overdose in 2019 at the age of 37 [181]\n\n\nConspiracy theories and misinformation\nIn the immediate aftermath, conspiracy theories and unfounded claims were made by several anti-government movements and extremist religious and political movements, such as the Westboro Baptist Church and televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr.\n\n\nMotive\nThe shooting was planned as a terrorist attack that would cause \"the most deaths in U.S history\", [190] but the motive has never been ascertained with any degree of certainty In a letter provided with the May 15 report on the Columbine attack, Sheriff John Stone and Undersheriff John A Dunaway wrote they \"cannot answer the most fundamental question—why?\" [69] [97] In the days following the event, media speculation regarding the killers' motive was rife Media reports were disseminated suggesting various motives of the killers, although all theories were largely unsubstantiated and turned out to be myths [191] These reports included blaming bullying, goth culture, video games, Marilyn Manson, [192] and targeting jocks and minorities [193] Other rumors were spread in the local area but not largely disseminated by the media, such as the false claim spread by some students that the killers were bullied because they were homosexual [194]\n\n\nMental disorder\nThe FBI concluded that the killers had mental illnesses, that Harris was a clinical psychopath, and Klebold had depression [55] Dwayne Fuselier, the supervisor in charge of the Columbine investigation, would later remark: \"I believe Eric went to the school to kill and didn't care if he died, while Dylan wanted to die and didn't care if others died as well.\" [195]\n\n\nThe FBI's theory\nThe FBI concluded that the killers had mental illnesses, that Harris was a clinical psychopath, and Klebold had depression [55] Dwayne Fuselier, the supervisor in charge of the Columbine investigation, would later remark: \"I believe Eric went to the school to kill and didn't care if he died, while Dylan wanted to die and didn't care if others died as well.\" [195]\n\n\nMedication\nOpponents of contemporary psychiatry like Peter Breggin claim that the psychiatric medications prescribed to Harris may have exacerbated his aggressiveness [203] [204]\nHarris had complained of depression, anger, and suicidal thoughts, for which he was prescribed antidepressants [16] [205] Toxicology reports confirmed that Harris had Luvox in his bloodstream at the time of the shootings, [206] whereas Klebold had no medications in his system [207]\nHarris continued his scheduled meetings with his psychologist until a few months before the massacre [208] [209]\n\n\nOther theories\nThere have been other attempts to diagnose Harris and Klebold with mental illness Peter Langman believes Harris was a psychopath and Klebold was schizotypal [210] Professor Aubrey Immelman published a personality profile of Harris, based on journal entries and personal communication, and believes the materials suggested behavior patterns consistent with a \"malignant narcissism…pathological narcissistic personality disorder with borderline and antisocial features, along with some paranoid traits, and unconstrained aggression.\" [s]\n\n\nMedia speculation\nEarly stories following the massacre charged that school administrators and teachers at Columbine had long condoned bullying by jocks and this explained the motive [212] [213] The link between bullying and school violence has attracted increasing attention since [214] [215]\n\n\nBullying\nEarly stories following the massacre charged that school administrators and teachers at Columbine had long condoned bullying by jocks and this explained the motive [212] [213] The link between bullying and school violence has attracted increasing attention since [214] [215]\n\n\nIsolation\nRejection was also highlighted as a cause Social cliques within high schools such as the Trench Coat Mafia were widely discussed One perception formed was that Harris and Klebold were both outcasts who had been isolated from their classmates, prompting feelings of helplessness, insecurity, and depression, as well as a strong need for power and attention [1] [233] Harris's last journal entry reads, \"I hate you people for leaving me out of so many fun things\", [234] while Klebold wrote \"The lonely man strikes with absolute rage.\" [235] In an interview, Brown described them as the school's worst outcasts, \"the losers of the losers\" [236] [237]\n\n\nPolitical terrorism\nSome peers, such as Robyn Anderson, stated that the pair were not interested in Nazism, and they did not worship or admire Hitler in any way However, in retrospect, Anderson also stated that there were many things the pair did not tell friends Harris at least did revere the Nazis, often praising them in his journal [50] [16]\nWhile some sources claim that there is a connection to Hitler's birthday (20th of April 1889), the theory is dismissed by others since the date of the attack had been delayed due to a munitions problem [243]\n\n\nMarilyn Manson\nIn the late 1990s, Marilyn Manson and his band established themselves as a household name, [246] and as one of the most controversial rock acts in music history [247] Their two album releases prior to the massacre were both critical and commercial successes, [248] and by the time of their Rock Is Dead Tour in 1999, the frontman had become a culture war iconoclast and a rallying icon for alienated youth [249]\n\n\nVideo games\nThey are able to hook into the Internet and play video games that are extraordinarily violent, that cause the blood pressure to rise and the adrenaline level to go up, games that cause people to be killed and the players to die themselves It is a very intense experience They are able to get into Internet chat rooms and, if there are no nuts or people of the same mentality in their hometown, hook up with people around the country They are able to rent from the video store—not just go down and see Natural Born Killers or The Basketball Diaries—but they are able to bring it home and watch it repeatedly In this case, even maybe make their own violent film Many have said this murder was very much akin to The Basketball Diaries, in which a student goes in and shoots others in the classroom I have seen a video of that, and many others may have.\n\n\nDoom\nThey were avid fans of Doom especially [64] [280] [281] Harris said of the massacre, \"It's going to be like...Doom.\" [282] He also wrote \"I must not be sidetracked by my feelings of sympathy...so I will force myself to believe that everyone is just another monster from Doom.\" [283] In Harris's yearbook, Klebold wrote \"I find a similarity between people and Doom zombies.\" [284] Harris named his shotgun Arlene after a character in the Doom novels [285] [286] The TEC-9 Klebold used resembled an AB-10, a weapon from the Doom novels that Harris referenced several times [62] [287]\n\n\nDuke Nukem 3D\nThe other game mentioned specifically by Harris for what the massacre would be like was Duke Nukem 3D The game has pipe bombs and one of the enemies is the \"pig cop\" [278] Brooks Brown wrote that pipe bombs were set in the halls of the school with the intention of causing a chain reaction, because that's what happens in Duke Nukem 3D Brown also wrote they shot wildly because it works in Duke Nukem 3D [275]\n\n\nLegacy\nFollowing the Columbine shooting, schools across the United States instituted new security measures such as see-through backpacks, metal detectors, school uniforms, and security guards Some schools implemented the numbering of school doors in order to improve public safety response Several schools throughout the country resorted to requiring students to wear computer-generated IDs [289]\n\n\nPolice tactics\nPolice departments reassessed their tactics and now train for Columbine-like situations after criticism over the slow response and progress of the SWAT teams during the shooting [295] [296]\n\n\nLawsuits\nAfter the massacre, many survivors and relatives of deceased victims filed lawsuits [140] Under Colorado state law at the time, the maximum a family could receive in a lawsuit against a government agency was $600,000 [298] Most cases against the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office and school district were dismissed by the federal court on the grounds of government immunity [299] The case against the sheriff's office regarding the death of Dave Sanders was not dismissed due to the police preventing paramedics from going to his aid for hours after they knew the gunmen were dead The case was settled out of court in August 2002 for $1,500,000 [300]\n\n\nMemorials\nMany impromptu memorials were created after the massacre, including victims Rachel Scott's car and John Tomlin's truck [307]\n\n\nGun control\nThe shooting resulted in calls for more gun control measures The gun show loophole and background checks became a focus of a national debate [315] [316] [317] It was the deadliest mass shooting during the era of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban Victim Daniel Mauser's father Tom Mauser has become a gun control advocate [318]\n\n\nPopular culture\n\"Columbine\" has since become a euphemism for a school shooting, similar to how \"going postal\" is for workplace violence [325]\n\n\nCopycats\nThe Columbine shootings influenced subsequent school shootings, with several such plots mentioning it [57] [332] Fear of copycats has sometimes led to the closing of entire school districts [333] Since Columbine, over 74 copycat cases have been reported, 21 of which resulted in attacks, while the rest were thwarted by law enforcement In many of them, the perpetrators cited Harris and Klebold as heroes or martyrs [334]\n\n\nAnalysis\nHarris and Klebold have become what the Napa Valley Register have called \"cultural icons\" for troubled youth [335] According to psychiatrist E Fuller Torrey of the Treatment Advocacy Center, a legacy of the Columbine shootings is its \"allure to disaffected youth\" [336]\n\n\nSee

attended a Lutheran church with their children Both Dylan and his older brother, Byron, attended confirmation classes in accordance with the Lutheran tradition [19] As had been the case with his older brother, Klebold was named after a renowned poet—in his case, the playwright Dylan Thomas [20]\n\n\nBackground\nIn 1996, 15-year-old Eric Harris created a private website on America Online (AOL) [e] It was initially to host levels (also known as WADs) Harris created for use in the first-person shooter video games Doom, Doom II, and Quake [22] [23] [f] On the site, Harris began a blog, which included details about Harris sneaking out of the house to cause mischief and vandalism, such as lighting fireworks with Klebold and others [25] These were known as \"Rebel Missions\", [26] and Harris's blog primarily consisted of \"mission logs\" Beginning in early 1997, the blog postings began to show the first signs of Harris's anger against society [27] By the end of the year, the site contained instructions on how to make explosives [28] Harris's site attracted few visitors and caused no concern until August 1997, after Harris ended a blog post detailing murderous fantasies with \"All I want to do is kill and injure as many of you as I can, especially a few people Like Brooks Brown.\" Brown was a classmate of his [29] [g] After Brown's parents viewed the site, they contacted the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office on August 7, 1997 An investigator wrote a draft affidavit to request a search warrant for the Harris household, but it was never submitted to a judge [31] [17]

draft affidavit to request a search warrant for the Harris household, but it was never submitted to a judge [31] [17] [32]\n\n\nWritings\nShortly after the court hearing for the van break-in, Harris reverted his website back to just hosting user-created levels of Doom He began to write his thoughts down in a journal Klebold had already been keeping a personal journal since March 1997; as early as November of that year, Klebold had mentioned going on a killing spree Klebold used his journal to vent about his personal problems as well as what he'd wear and use during the attack [36] In both their journals, Harris and Klebold would later plot the attack Soon after beginning his journal, Harris typed out a plan for an attack which included possibly escaping to a foreign country after the massacre, or hijacking an aircraft at Denver International Airport and crashing it into New York City [17]\n\n\nTapes\nHarris and Klebold were both enrolled in video-production classes and kept five video tapes that were recorded with school video equipment [53] Only two of these, \"Hitmen for Hire\" and \"Rampart Range\", and part of a third known as \"Radioactive Clothing\", have been released [j] The remaining three tapes detailed their plans and reasons for the massacre, including the ways they hid their weapons and deceived their parents [55] Most were shot in the Harris family basement, and are thus known as the Basement Tapes Thirty minutes before the attack, they made a final video saying goodbye and apologizing to their friends and families [56]\n\n\nBasement tapes\nHarris and

apologizing to their friends and families [56]\n\n\nNixon tape\nBefore the massacre, Harris left a micro cassette labeled \"Nixon\" on the kitchen table On it Harris said \"It is less than nine hours now,\" placing the recording at some time around 2:30 a.m He went on to say \"People will die because of me,\" and \"It will be a day that will be remembered forever.\" [70]\n\n\nWeaponry\nIn the months prior to the attacks, Harris and Klebold acquired two 9mm firearms and two 12-gauge shotguns Harris had a Hi-Point 995 carbine with thirteen 10-round magazines and a Savage-Springfield 67H pump shotgun Klebold used a 9mm Intratec TEC-DC9 semi-automatic handgun with one 52-, one 32-, and one 28-round magazine and a Stevens 311D double-barreled shotgun Harris' shotgun was sawed-off to around 26 inches (0.66 m) and Klebold shortened his shotgun's length to 23 inches (0.58 m), a felony under the National Firearms Act [71] [72]\nOn November 22, 1998, their friend Robyn Anderson purchased a carbine rifle and the two shotguns for the pair at the Tanner Gun Show, as they were too young to legally purchase the guns themselves After the attack, she told investigators that she had believed the pair wanted the weapons for target shooting and denied that she had prior knowledge of their plans [20] Anderson was not charged [73] [74] [l]\n\n\nGuns\nIn the months prior to the attacks, Harris and Klebold acquired two 9mm firearms and two 12-gauge shotguns Harris had a Hi-Point 995 carbine with thirteen 10-round magazines and a Savage-Springfield 67H pump shotgun Klebold used a 9mm Intratec TEC-DC9 semi-automatic handgun with one 52-, one 32-, and one 28-round magazine and a Stevens 311D double-barreled shotgun Harris' shotgun was sawed-off to around 26 inches (0.66 m) and Klebold

for target shooting and denied that she had prior knowledge of their plans [20] Anderson was not charged [73] [74] [l]\n\n\nExplosives\nIn addition to the firearms, the complex and highly planned attack involved several improvised explosive devices Harris and Klebold constructed a total of 99 bombs [79] These included pipe bombs, carbon-dioxide cartridges filled with gunpowder (called \"crickets\" [80]), Molotov cocktails, and propane tanks converted to bombs The propane bombs were used in the cafeteria, the shooters' cars, and in another location intended as a diversion For ignition, they used storm matches, cannon fuses, and model rocket igniters as well as timing devices built from mechanical alarm clocks for the propane bombs [81] During the massacre, they carried match strikers taped to their forearms for easy ignition of the pipe bombs and CO2 bombs.\n\n\nPipe bombs\nHarris's website contained instructions on making pipe bombs and Molotovs, and the extensive use of shrapnel [28] Harris's father once discovered one of his pipe bombs [83] Harris's journal logged the creation of 25 pipe bombs [79]\n\n\nCafeteria bombs\nThey had in their possession eight propane tanks all converted into bombs The weekend before the shooting, Harris and Klebold bought two propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store They bought six propane tanks on the morning of the attack [86] Harris was caught on a Texaco gas station security camera at 9:12 a.m buying a Blue Rhino propane tank [87] Both cafeteria bombs included a single 20-pound tank, attached pipe bombs, and supporting gasoline canisters alongside [88]\n\n\nCar bombs\nBoth car bombs were made from two 20-pound propane tanks, pipe bombs, and various containers filled with gasoline were spread throughout the vehicles [88] Eight pipe bombs were placed in Klebold's car, and one in Harris' [79]\n\n\nKnives\nHarris and Klebold were both equipped with knives, but investigators do not believe they ever utilized them during the massacre Harris had a boot knife on his belt and a \"Khyber-pass\" machete bowie knife taped to the back of his ankle Both had an \"R\", referencing Harris's alias \"REB\", etched into the handle, and the machete had a swastika on the sheath Klebold had a \"Cobra\" knife mounted to his belt on the left side as well as a switchblade in his right pocket [89]\n\n\nThe massacre\nAccording to the shooters' respective journals and video tapes, it is believed by investigators that the pair intended to detonate their propane bombs in the cafeteria at the busiest lunch hour, [90] killing hundreds of students After this, they would shoot and stab survivors, as well as lob bombs Bombs set in their cars in the parking lot would also eventually detonate, killing more students as well as possibly any police officers, paramedics, firemen, or reporters who had come to the school [37] [91] [m] However, the bombs in the cafeteria and cars failed to detonate [93]\n\n\nPlanting the bombs\nOn Tuesday morning, April 20, 1999, Harris and Klebold placed two duffel bags in the cafeteria Each bag contained propane bombs, set to detonate during the \"A\" lunch shift, which began at 11:15 a.m [o]\n\n\n11:19 a.m.: Shooting begins\nAt 11:19 a.m., 17-year-old Rachel Scott and her friend Richard Castaldo were having lunch and sitting on the grass next to the west entrance of the school Klebold threw a pipe bomb towards the parking lot; the bomb only partially detonated, causing it to give off smoke Castaldo thought it was no more than a crude senior prank Likewise, several students during the incident first thought that they were watching a prank [111] [112]\n\n\n11:22 a.m.: Police response and West Entrance shootouts\nAt 11:22 a.m., a custodian called Deputy Neil Gardner, the assigned resource officer to Columbine, on the school radio, requesting assistance in the senior parking lot The only paved route took him around the school to the east and south on Pierce Street, where at 11:23 a.m., he heard on his police radio that a female was down, and assumed she had been struck by a car While exiting his patrol car in the senior lot at 11:24, he heard another call on the school radio, \"Neil, there's a shooter in the school.\" [104]\n\n\n11:29–11:36 a.m.: Library massacre\n\nAt 11:29 a.m., Harris and Klebold entered the library Fifty-two students, two teachers and two librarians were inside [131]\n\n12:08 p.m.: Suicides\nAfter leaving the library, Harris and Klebold entered the science area, where they caused a fire in an empty storage closet It was extinguished by a teacher who had hidden in an adjacent room [148] The gunmen then proceeded toward the south hallway, where they shot into an empty science room At 11:44 a.m., they were captured on the school security cameras as they re-entered the cafeteria The recording shows Harris crouching against the rail on the staircase and firing toward the propane bombs left in the cafeteria, in an unsuccessful attempt to detonate them [149] As Klebold approached the propane bomb and examined it, Harris took a drink from one of the cups left behind Klebold lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it at the propane bomb About a minute later, the gallon of fuel attached to the bomb ignited, causing a fire that was extinguished by the fire sprinklers a few minutes later [150] They left the cafeteria at 11:46.\n\n\nCrisis ends\nBy 12:00 p.m., SWAT teams were stationed outside the school, and ambulances started taking the wounded to local hospitals A call for additional ammunition for police officers in case of a shootout came at 12:20 Authorities reported pipe bombs by 1:00, and two SWAT teams entered the school at 1:09, moving from classroom to classroom, discovering hidden students and faculty [155] They entered at the end of the school opposite the library, hampered by old maps and unaware a new wing had recently been added They were also hampered by the sound of the fire alarms [156]\n\n\nSWAT response\nBy 12:00 p.m., SWAT teams were stationed outside the school, and ambulances started taking the wounded to local hospitals A call for additional ammunition for police officers in case of a shootout came at 12:20 Authorities reported pipe bombs by 1:00, and two SWAT teams entered the school at 1:09, moving from classroom to classroom, discovering hidden students and faculty [155] They entered at the end of the school opposite the library, hampered by old maps and unaware a new wing had recently been added They were also hampered by the sound of the fire alarms [156]\n\n\nLeawood Elementary\nMeanwhile, families of students and staff were asked to gather at nearby Leawood Elementary School to await information All students, teachers, and school employees were taken away, questioned, and offered medical care in small holding areas before being bussed to meet with their family members at Leawood Elementary In his book Walking in Daniel's Shoes, Tom Mauser, father of victim Daniel Mauser, recounts how several families who'd still been waiting on word of the status of their children were informed by law enforcement that another bus from the school was on its way However, this bus never arrived, and whether the comments from police stemmed from miscommunication or were an attempt to give distraught parents hope is unknown [157]\n\n\nThe boy in the window\nPatrick Ireland had regained and lost consciousness several times after being shot by Klebold Paralyzed on his right side, he crawled to the library windows where, on live television, at 2:38 p.m., he stretched out the window, intending to fall into the arms of two SWAT team members standing on the roof of an emergency vehicle, but instead falling directly onto the vehicle's roof in a pool of blood He became known as \"the boy in the window.\" [119] [158] The team members, Donn Kraemer and John Ramoniec, were later criticized for allowing Ireland to drop more than seven feet to the ground while doing nothing to try to ensure he could be lowered to the ground safely or break his fall.\n\n\n\"1 bleeding to death\"\nAt 2:15 p.m., students placed a sign in the window: \"1 bleeding to death\", in order to alert police and medical personnel of Dave Sanders' location in the science room [111] [125] Police initially feared it was a ruse by the shooters A shirt was also tied to the doorknob At 2:30, this was spotted, and by 2:40, SWAT officers evacuated the room of students and called for a paramedic [155] Hancey and Starkey were reluctant to leave Sanders behind [125] [127] By 3:00, the SWAT officers had moved Sanders to a storage room, which was more easily accessible [159] As they did so, a paramedic arrived and found Sanders had no pulse [125] [155] He had died of his injuries in the storage room before he could receive medical care He was the only teacher to die in the shooting.\n\n\nSuicide mission; estimated 25 dead\nLisa Kreutz, shot in the shoulder, arms, hand, and thigh, remained lying in the library She had tried to move but became light-headed Kreutz kept track of time by the sound of the school's bells until police arrived [citation needed] Kreutz was finally evacuated at 3:22 p.m., along with Patti Nielson, Brian Anderson, and the three library staff who had hidden in the rooms adjacent to the library Officials found the bodies in the library by 3:30 [155]\n\n\nBomb squad response\nStone said that police officers were searching the bodies of the gunmen They feared they had used their pipe bombs to booby-trap corpses, including their own At 4:30 p.m., the school was declared safe At 5:30, additional officers were called in, as more explosives were found in the parking lot and on the roof By 6:15, officials had found a bomb in Klebold's car in the parking lot, set to detonate the gas tank [161] Stone then marked the entire school as a crime scene [citation needed]\n\n\nImmediate aftermath\nOn the morning of April 21, bomb squads combed the high school By 8:30 a.m., the official death toll of 15 was released [163] The earlier estimate was ten over the true death toll count, but close to the total count of wounded students The total count of deaths was 12 students (14 including the shooters) and one teacher; 20 students and one teacher were injured as a result of the shootings Three more victims were injured indirectly as they tried to escape the school.\n\n\nSearch warrant press conference\nAlso on April 30, high-ranking officials of Jefferson County and the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office met to decide if they should reveal that Michael Guerra had drafted an affidavit for a search warrant of Harris's residence more than a year before the shootings, based on his previous investigation of Harris's website and activities [35] Since the affidavit's contents lacked the necessary probable cause, they decided not to disclose this information at a press conference held on April 30, nor did they mention it in any other way [167]\n\n\nChristian martyrdom\nIn the wake of the shooting, victims Rachel Scott and Cassie Bernall came to be regarded as Christian martyrs by Evangelical Christians [138] [169] [170] [171]\n\n\nWe are Columbine\nClasses at Columbine were held at nearby Chatfield Senior High for the remaining three weeks of the 1999 school year [176] In August 1999, students returned to the school, and principal Frank DeAngelis led a rally of students clad in \"We are Columbine\" shirts [177]\n\n\nSecondary casualties\nSix months after the shootings, Anne Marie Hochhalter's mother killed herself [118] [119] Several former students and teachers had PTSD [178] Greg Barnes, a 17-year-old student who had witnessed Sanders' shooting, died by suicide in May 2000 [179] Survivor Austin Eubanks, who was injured during the shooting, became heavily medicated, developing an opioid addiction [180] He eventually overcame and later spoke publicly about the addiction, but died from an accidental overdose in 2019 at the age of 37 [181]\n\n\nConspiracy theories and misinformation\nIn the immediate aftermath, conspiracy theories and unfounded claims were made by several anti-government movements and extremist religious and political movements, such as the Westboro Baptist Church and televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr.\n\n\nMotive\nThe shooting was planned as a terrorist attack that would cause \"the most deaths in U.S history\", [190] but the motive has never been ascertained with any degree of certainty In a letter provided with the May 15 report on the Columbine attack, Sheriff John Stone and Undersheriff John A Dunaway wrote they \"cannot answer the most fundamental question—why?\" [69] [97] In the days following the event, media speculation regarding the killers' motive was rife Media reports were disseminated suggesting various motives of the killers, although all theories were largely unsubstantiated and turned out to be myths [191] These reports included blaming bullying, goth culture, video games, Marilyn Manson, [192] and targeting jocks and minorities [193] Other rumors were spread in the local area but not largely disseminated by the media, such as the false claim spread by some students that the killers were bullied because they were homosexual [194]\n\n\nMental disorder\nThe FBI concluded that the killers had mental illnesses, that Harris was a clinical psychopath, and Klebold had depression [55] Dwayne Fuselier, the supervisor in charge of the Columbine investigation, would later remark: \"I believe Eric went to the school to kill and didn't care if he died, while Dylan wanted to die and didn't care if others died as well.\" [195]\n\n\nThe FBI's theory\nThe FBI concluded that the killers had mental illnesses, that Harris was a clinical psychopath, and Klebold had depression [55] Dwayne Fuselier, the supervisor in charge of the Columbine investigation, would later remark: \"I believe Eric went to the school to kill and didn't care if he died, while Dylan wanted to die and didn't care if others died as well.\" [195]\n\n\nMedication\nOpponents of contemporary psychiatry like Peter Breggin claim that the psychiatric medications prescribed to Harris may have exacerbated his aggressiveness [203] [204]\nHarris had complained of depression, anger, and suicidal thoughts, for which he was prescribed antidepressants [16] [205] Toxicology reports confirmed that Harris had Luvox in his bloodstream at the time of the shootings, [206] whereas Klebold had no medications in his system [207]\nHarris continued his scheduled meetings with his psychologist until a few months before the massacre [208] [209]\n\n\nOther theories\nThere have been other attempts to diagnose Harris and Klebold with mental illness Peter Langman believes Harris was a psychopath and Klebold was schizotypal [210] Professor Aubrey Immelman published a personality profile of Harris, based on journal entries and personal communication, and believes the materials suggested behavior patterns consistent with a \"malignant narcissism…pathological narcissistic personality disorder with borderline and antisocial features, along with some paranoid traits, and unconstrained aggression.\" [s]\n\n\nMedia speculation\nEarly stories following the massacre charged that school administrators and teachers at Columbine had long condoned bullying by jocks and this explained the motive [212] [213] The link between bullying and school violence has attracted increasing attention since [214] [215]\n\n\nBullying\nEarly stories following the massacre charged that school administrators and teachers at Columbine had long condoned bullying by jocks and this explained the motive [212] [213] The link between bullying and school violence has attracted increasing attention since [214] [215]\n\n\nIsolation\nRejection was also highlighted as a cause Social cliques within high schools such as the Trench Coat Mafia were widely discussed One perception formed was that Harris and Klebold were both outcasts who had been isolated from their classmates, prompting feelings of helplessness, insecurity, and depression, as well as a strong need for power and attention [1] [233] Harris's last journal entry reads, \"I hate you people for leaving me out of so many fun things\", [234] while Klebold wrote \"The lonely man strikes with absolute rage.\" [235] In an interview, Brown described them as the school's worst outcasts, \"the losers of the losers\" [236] [237]\n\n\nPolitical terrorism\nSome peers, such as Robyn Anderson, stated that the pair were not interested in Nazism, and they did not worship or admire Hitler in any way However, in retrospect, Anderson also stated that there were many things the pair did not tell friends Harris at least did revere the Nazis, often praising them in his journal [50] [16]\nWhile some sources claim that there is a connection to Hitler's birthday (20th of April 1889), the theory is dismissed by others since the date of the attack had been delayed due to a munitions problem [243]\n\n\nMarilyn Manson\nIn the late 1990s, Marilyn Manson and his band established themselves as a household name, [246] and as one of the most controversial rock acts in music history [247] Their two album releases prior to the massacre were both critical and commercial successes, [248] and by the time of their Rock Is Dead Tour in 1999, the frontman had become a culture war iconoclast and a rallying icon for alienated youth [249]\n\n\nVideo games\nThey are able to hook into the Internet and play video games that are extraordinarily violent, that cause the blood pressure to rise and the adrenaline level to go up, games that cause people to be killed and the players to die themselves It is a very intense experience They are able to get into Internet chat rooms and, if there are no nuts or people of the same mentality in their hometown, hook up with people around the country They are able to rent from the video store—not just go down and see Natural Born Killers or The Basketball Diaries—but they are able to bring it home and watch it repeatedly In this case, even maybe make their own violent film Many have said this murder was very much akin to The Basketball Diaries, in which a student goes in and shoots others in the classroom I have seen a video of that, and many others may have.\n\n\nDoom\nThey were avid fans of Doom especially [64] [280] [281] Harris said of the massacre, \"It's going to be like...Doom.\" [282] He also wrote \"I must not be sidetracked by my feelings of sympathy...so I will force myself to believe that everyone is just another monster from Doom.\" [283] In Harris's yearbook, Klebold wrote \"I find a similarity between people and Doom zombies.\" [284] Harris named his shotgun Arlene after a character in the Doom novels [285] [286] The TEC-9 Klebold used resembled an AB-10, a weapon from the Doom novels that Harris referenced several times [62] [287]\n\n\nDuke Nukem 3D\nThe other game mentioned specifically by Harris for what the massacre would be like was Duke Nukem 3D The game has pipe bombs and one of the enemies is the \"pig cop\" [278] Brooks Brown wrote that pipe bombs were set in the halls of the school with the intention of causing a chain reaction, because that's what happens in Duke Nukem 3D Brown also wrote they shot wildly because it works in Duke Nukem 3D [275]\n\n\nLegacy\nFollowing the Columbine shooting, schools across the United States instituted new security measures such as see-through backpacks, metal detectors, school uniforms, and security guards Some schools implemented the numbering of school doors in order to improve public safety response Several schools throughout the country resorted to requiring students to wear computer-generated IDs [289]\n\n\nPolice tactics\nPolice departments reassessed their tactics and now train for Columbine-like situations after criticism over the slow response and progress of the SWAT teams during the shooting [295] [296]\n\n\nLawsuits\nAfter the massacre, many survivors and relatives of deceased victims filed lawsuits [140] Under Colorado state law at the time, the maximum a family could receive in a lawsuit against a government agency was $600,000 [298] Most cases against the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office and school district were dismissed by the federal court on the grounds of government immunity [299] The case against the sheriff's office regarding the death of Dave Sanders was not dismissed due to the police preventing paramedics from going to his aid for hours after they knew the gunmen were dead The case was settled out of court in August 2002 for $1,500,000 [300]\n\n\nMemorials\nMany impromptu memorials were created after the massacre, including victims Rachel Scott's car and John Tomlin's truck [307]\n\n\nGun control\nThe shooting resulted in calls for more gun control measures The gun show loophole and background checks became a focus of a national debate [315] [316] [317] It was the deadliest mass shooting during the era of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban Victim Daniel Mauser's father Tom Mauser has become a gun control advocate [318]\n\n\nPopular culture\n\"Columbine\" has since become a euphemism for a school shooting, similar to how \"going postal\" is for workplace violence [325]\n\n\nCopycats\nThe Columbine shootings influenced subsequent school shootings, with several such plots mentioning it [57] [332] Fear of copycats has sometimes led to the closing of entire school districts [333] Since Columbine, over 74 copycat cases have been reported, 21 of which resulted in attacks, while the rest were thwarted by law enforcement In many of them, the perpetrators cited Harris and Klebold as heroes or martyrs [334]\n\n\nAnalysis\nHarris and Klebold have become what the Napa Valley Register have called \"cultural icons\" for troubled youth [335] According to psychiatrist E Fuller Torrey of the Treatment Advocacy Center, a legacy of the Columbine shootings is its \"allure to disaffected youth\" [336]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nCited works\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nVideos\n\n\nExternal

The shooting resulted in the deaths of four people, including two students and two teachers, and injured nine others.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2024 Apalachee High School shooting was a tragic event that shook the community of Barrow County, Georgia. The incident has raised concerns about gun violence, school safety, and mental health. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the events leading up to the shooting, the incident itself, and the aftermath.\n\n**Background**\n\nApalachee High School is a public high school located in Barrow County, Georgia, about 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Atlanta. The school has a student body of approximately 1,900 students and is part of the Barrow County School District. As with all Georgia schools, Apalachee High School is required to complete at least one active shooter drill by October 1 each academic year.\n\n**Shooting**\n\nBefore the shooting, a call from an unknown source was placed to Apalachee High School stating that five schools would be targeted and that Apalachee would be the first. A second call, from Gray's mother, lasted about 10 minutes and warned of an \"extreme emergency\" and requested administrators locate Gray, but they were unable to do so. On the morning of the shooting, Gray asked in his first-period class how Apalachee High would respond to an active shooter. This comment caused the teacher to report the comment via email to some school staff, not including the algebra teacher where the shooting would begin.\n\n**Victims**\n\nFour people were killed in the shooting: students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both aged 14; math teacher Cristina Irimie, 53; and math teacher and assistant football coach Richard Aspinwall, 39. Nine people, including one teacher and eight students, were injured in the shooting, with seven of them being shot.

Prosecutors plan to try Gray as an adult. Gray is accused of using a semi-automatic AR-15 style rifle in the shooting.\n\n**Prior investigations and concerns of violence**\n\nIn May 2023, FBI agents from the Atlanta field office, along with local officers from the Jackson County Sheriff's Office, visited Gray and his family in Jefferson to investigate school shooting threats allegedly made by Gray on Discord. The visit was prompted by anonymous tips received by the FBI's National Threat Operations Center. When questioned, then-13-year-old Gray denied making the threats, and a deputy sheriff told him he was going to take Gray \"at your word.\" Gray also denied knowing what Discord was at the time. Colin Gray acknowledged that he owned hunting guns but told investigators that his son did not have \"unfettered access\" to them. During the visit, pictures from the Discord account of the two weapons were not shown to Colin Gray to authenticate if they were his or not. In a statement issued after the September 2024 shooting, the FBI said, \"At the time, there was no probable cause for an arrest or to take any additional law enforcement action on the local, state, or federal levels.\"\n\n**Abuse and home environment**\n\nAccording to Gray's lawyers, his household was at one time visited by the Georgia Department of Family and Children Services.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Atlanta office confirmed that its agents were on the scene. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is also involved in the investigation.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nOn September 6, Winder, Georgia hosted a memorial for the victims of the shooting with multiple politicians and about 1,000 people in attendance. A memorial was created outside the school with students, their parents, and members of the community leaving items such as flowers, balloons, and notes.

he was told by a deputy sheriff that he was going to take Gray \"at your word\"; Gray also denied knowing what Discord was at that time [17] At the same time, Colin Gray acknowledged that he owned hunting guns, but told investigators that his son did not have \"unfettered access\" to them [34] [38] During the visit, pictures from the Discord account of the two weapons were not shown to Colin Gray to authenticate if they were his or not [17] In a statement issued after the September 2024 shooting, the FBI said, \"At the time, there was no probable cause for an arrest or to take any additional law enforcement action on the local, state or federal levels.\" [38]\n\n\nAbuse and home environment\nAccording to Gray's lawyers, his household was at one time visited by the Georgia Department of Family and Children Services [37] According to The Washington Post, for the three years before the shooting, Gray and his family interacted with multiple Georgia child welfare workers, four school systems, three county sheriff's departments, and two local police agencies, with many of them ignoring or not responding to reported child abuse Gray was allegedly experiencing at the hands of his parents [17]\n\n\nInvestigation\nThe U.S Attorney General, Merrick Garland, said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene [4] The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Atlanta office confirmed that its agents were on scene [4] The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is also involved in the investigation [4]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn September 6, Winder, Georgia hosted a memorial for the victims of the shooting with multiple politicians and about 1,000 people in attendance [42] A memorial was created outside the school with students, their parents and members of the community leaving items such as flowers, balloons and notes The school's high school football team was scheduled to play at another area school on September 6, but the game was canceled and a prayer vigil scheduled in its place [43]\n\n\nResponse\nThe White House issued a statement confirming that President Joe Biden was briefed by Liz Sherwood-Randall, the Homeland Security Advisor, on the shooting and that his administration will continue coordinating with federal, state, and local officials as they receive more information [4] Vice President Kamala Harris thanked first responders and stated that it \"doesn't have to be this way\" [48] Attorney General Merrick Garland expressed his devastation with regards to the shooting and to anyone affected by it [49] White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre commented on the shooting during the afternoon press briefing, discussing the concern for gun control in the form of universal background checks and other programs [22]\n\n\nPolitical reaction\nThe White House issued a statement confirming that President Joe Biden was briefed by Liz Sherwood-Randall, the Homeland Security Advisor, on the shooting and that his administration will continue coordinating with federal, state, and local officials as they receive more information [4] Vice President Kamala Harris thanked first responders and stated that it \"doesn't have to be this way\" [48] Attorney General Merrick Garland expressed his devastation with regards to the shooting and to anyone affected by it [49] White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre commented on the shooting during the afternoon press briefing, discussing the concern for gun control in the form of universal background checks and other programs [22]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest English strikers of all time, known for his prolific goal-scoring and clinical finishing.\n\nEarly Life and Club Career\n-------------------------\n\nJimmy Greaves was born on February 20, 1940, in Manor Park, London, England. He grew up in Hainault, Essex, and developed a passion for football at a young age. Greaves was scouted by Chelsea's Jimmy Thompson and joined the club's youth team, where he quickly made a name for himself as a prolific goal-scorer. In 1955, he was signed on as an apprentice to become one of \"Drake's Ducklings,\" a group of young players mentored by manager Ted Drake.\n\nGreaves spent several years in Chelsea's youth team, during which he scored 51 goals in the 1955-56 season and 122 goals in the 1956-57 season. He made his professional debut for Chelsea in 1957 and quickly established himself as a regular member of the first team. In 1961, Greaves was signed by AC Milan for a fee of £80,000, but his time at the club was cut short due to disagreements with the team's management.\n\nAC Milan\n---------\n\nGreaves's time at AC Milan was marked by controversy and disappointment. He was signed in 1961 for a fee of £80,000, but his playing style and off-field behavior caused tension with the team's management. Greaves was unhappy with the strict training regime imposed by coach Nereo Rocco and felt stifled by the team's playing style. Despite this, he managed to score nine goals in 14 appearances for the club, including one against Inter Milan in the Milan derby.\n\nGreaves's stint at AC Milan was marked by a series of incidents, including a confrontation with a Sampdoria player who spat in his face.

At the end of the season, English won the NBA scoring title, becoming the only Nugget to win the award despite the heavily favored offensive play of Doug Moe In 1984–85, they made it to the Western Conference finals after being perennial playoff contenders, and they lost in five games to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\n1989–1991: A period of decline\nMoe left the team in 1990, and was replaced by Paul Westhead Westhead also believed in a \"run and gun\" style of play allowing players to speed down the court to shoot rather than creating set plays [25]\n\n\n1991–1996: The Dikembe Mutombo era\nDenver took a positive step in rebuilding by drafting Georgetown University center Dikembe Mutombo in 1991 Mutombo finished runner-up to Larry Johnson for the NBA rookie of the year that season Denver finished 24–58 that year.\n\n\n1996–2003: Another period of struggle\nAfter finishing the 1996–97 season with the fourth-worst record in the league (21–61), the Nuggets sent Antonio McDyess to the Phoenix Suns, and Dale Ellis returned to Seattle Denver flirted with history in the 1997–98, by nearly setting the mark for fewest wins in an 82-game season (11) They tied the then-NBA's all-time worst single-season losing streak at 23—only one game shy of the overall worst mark of 24 by the Cleveland Cavaliers of the early 1980s The losing streak was later broken by the Cavaliers in 2011 and the Philadelphia 76ers in 2014 with 26 consecutive losses Several years later, the Nuggets tied for the worst record in the NBA in 2002–03, also with the Cavaliers.\n\n\nNew ownerships\nThe team's struggles in the late 1990s were due in part to ownership instability COMSAT bought the NHL's Quebec Nordiques in 1995 and moved them to Denver as the Colorado Avalanche However, its diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company In particular, cost overruns associated with the construction of Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent Entertainment Group, the umbrella corporation for its sporting assets, to Liberty Media [19] However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought the Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets [26]\n\n\n2003–2011: The Carmelo Anthony era\nIn 2003, the Nuggets drafted future All-Star Carmelo Anthony with the third overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft [30] That same year, the team also updated their logos and uniforms, with a new color scheme of powder blue, gold and royal blue; the latter color was changed to navy blue in 2008 [31] In just two months of the season, the Nuggets recorded more wins than they had in 5½ months of play in 2002–03 Much of the reason for this incredible turnaround were the front-office moves of general manager Kiki Vandeweghe, a former Nuggets player who assumed general manager duties on August 9, 2001 [32] In April, the turnaround was complete as they became the first franchise in NBA history to qualify for the postseason following a sub-20-win campaign the previous year since the NBA went to an 82-game schedule [32] They were eliminated in the first round four games to one by the Minnesota Timberwolves [33]\n\n\n2006–2008: The Anthony and Iverson duo\nOn December 19, 2006, the Nuggets traded Joe Smith, Andre Miller and two first-round draft picks of the 2007 NBA draft to the Philadelphia 76ers for Ivan McFarlin and superstar Allen Iverson (McFarlin was waived immediately following the trade's approval) The moves gave the Nuggets the top two scorers in the league at the time in Anthony and Iverson, who were both scoring over 30 points per game at the time of the trade On January 11, 2007, Earl Boykins, Julius Hodge and cash considerations were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, in exchange for point guard Steve Blake With Iverson, many considered the Nuggets as one of the elite in the West However, chemistry was an issue, as the Nuggets finished the season with the sixth seed, giving them a first-round matchup against the San Antonio Spurs In the playoffs, the Nuggets took Game 1 and home-court advantage away from the Spurs However, as had occurred in the 2005 playoffs, the Spurs bounced back to sweep the next four, as the Nuggets were eliminated in the first round in five games for the fourth straight year.\n\n\n2008–2011: The Anthony and Billups duo\nOn July 16, 2008, at the end of the 2007–08 NBA season, the Nuggets traded former NBA Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Camby to the Los Angeles Clippers for a second-round draft pick (that was then traded to the New York Knicks for Renaldo Balkman).\n\n\n2011–2015: The departure of Carmelo Anthony, team concept, post–Karl and pre–Jokić seasons\nOn February 22, 2011, after months of speculation that he wanted to leave the Nuggets, Carmelo Anthony was traded along with Chauncey Billups, Anthony Carter, Shelden Williams and Renaldo Balkman to the New York Knicks in a multi-player deal also involving the Minnesota Timberwolves in which the Nuggets received Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Timofey Mozgov and Kosta Koufos On the day when the trade was done, the Nuggets were left with nine players to play against the Memphis Grizzlies The Nuggets won 120–107, where they led by as many as 27 points In the closing minutes of the game, the arena resounded with chants of \"Who needs Melo?\" George Karl said after the game, \"Our guys, when their backs are confronted with a difficult situation, they usually play at a high level We always react to tough situations in a very positive way.\" However, the trade only seemed to make them better Post-trade, the Nuggets averaged 24.1 assists, showing their newfound teamwork The defense of the Nuggets also improved, from allowing 105.2 points per game before the trade to 97.1 points per game for the remainder of the season  [54] Despite the franchise-changing trade which saw eighteen different starting lineups through the whole season, Denver finished with 50 wins (fourth consecutive 50 win seasons for the first time in Nuggets history), clinching the fifth seed of the Western Conference They met the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the playoffs and lost four games to one.\n\n\n2015–present: The Nikola Jokić era and first NBA championship\nOn June 15, 2015, at the end of the 2014–15 season, Michael Malone was named as the new head coach of the Denver Nuggets [61] Entering the 2015 NBA draft with their lowest draft pick (seventh overall) since 2003, the Nuggets drafted Emmanuel Mudiay who was widely regarded as the top point guard of the draft, leading to speculation that current starting point guard, Ty Lawson, would be traded [62] On July 14, 2015, Lawson was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of driving under the influence, his second in six months [63] The Nuggets traded Lawson a week later to the Houston Rockets along with a second round draft pick for Joey Dorsey, Nick Johnson, Kostas Papanikolaou, Pablo Prigioni (all of whom were waived), and a first round pick that was used to draft Juan Hernangómez [64]\n\n\n2015–2018: Early years\nOn June 15, 2015, at the end of the 2014–15 season, Michael Malone was named as the new head coach of the Denver Nuggets [61] Entering the 2015 NBA draft with their lowest draft pick (seventh overall) since 2003, the Nuggets drafted Emmanuel Mudiay who was widely regarded as the top point guard of the draft, leading to speculation that current starting point guard, Ty Lawson, would be traded [62] On July 14, 2015, Lawson was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of driving under the influence, his second in six months [63] The Nuggets traded Lawson a week later to the Houston Rockets along with a second round draft pick for Joey Dorsey, Nick Johnson, Kostas Papanikolaou, Pablo Prigioni (all of whom were waived), and a first round pick that was used to draft Juan Hernangómez [64]\n\n\n2018–2020: Pre-championship years and Jokic's rise to stardom\nIn the 2018 NBA draft, the Nuggets drafted Michael Porter Jr and traded with the Magic to get Jarred Vanderbilt On January 31, 2019, Jokić received his first All-Star selection as a Western Conference reserve for the 2019 NBA All-Star Game, becoming the Nuggets' first All-Star since Carmelo Anthony in 2011 [75] The Nuggets finished the 2018–2019 season with 54 wins, first in their division and second in the Western Conference, and made the playoffs for the first time since 2012–2013 [76] [77] In the first round, the Nuggets played against the San Antonio Spurs, winning the round in game seven The Nuggets were eliminated in the second round by the Portland Trail Blazers in 7 games [76] Game three of the second round had four overtimes, tying a 1953 game for the longest NBA playoff game [78]\n\n\n2020–22: Jokic wins back to back MVP awards\nIn the 2020–21 NBA season, Jokić was named the NBA Most Valuable Player, becoming the first center since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000 and the first player in Nuggets franchise history to win the award He also became the first Serbian player, third European player overall (along with Dirk Nowitzki of Germany and Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece), and sixth international player to ever win the award (along with Hakeem Olajuwon of Nigeria, Tim Duncan of the U.S Virgin Islands, Steve Nash of Canada, Nowitzki of Germany, and Antetokounmpo of Greece) Jokić also became the lowest ever drafted player at #41, and the first player in NBA history to be selected in the second round of the common era draft, to win the MVP award [82] [83] Although the Nuggets finished the season with the third seed in the Western Conference and beat their first round opponents, the Portland Trail Blazers, in six games, the loss of starting guard Jamal Murray to an ACL tear contributed to the team's sweep by the eventual Western Conference champions, the second-seeded Phoenix Suns [84]\n\n\n2022–2023: First NBA title\nIn the 2022–23 season, elevated by the offseason acquisitions of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Bruce Brown, the Nuggets secured the top seed in the Western Conference with 53 wins and 29 losses, two games ahead of the Memphis Grizzlies The Nuggets defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 4–1 in the first round of the 2023 playoffs, before defeating the Phoenix Suns 4–2 in the Conference Semifinals The Nuggets' playoff dominance continued in the Conference Finals; spearheaded by outstanding play from Jokić, who was named the Western Conference Finals Most Valuable Player, the team swept the Los Angeles Lakers in four games to advance to their first ever NBA Finals [87] This also marked the first time that the Nuggets had beaten the Lakers in a playoff series (having previously been 0–7 against them), as well as the first playoff series sweep in franchise history [88] In the NBA Finals, on June 12, 2023, the Nuggets would beat the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat 4–1 to win their first NBA championship, with Jokić receiving the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award [89] [90]\n\n\n2023–2024: Dethroned and Joker's third MVP season\nIn the 2023–24 season, the first season in league history with the Nuggets as defending champions, Denver finished with the 2nd seed in the Western Conference with a 57–25 record, tying with the Oklahoma City Thunder and finishing 1 game ahead of the Minnesota Timberwolves On May 8, 2024, Nikola Jokić won his third Most Valuable Player Award, becoming the ninth player to do so and tying with other greats such as Moses Malone and Larry Bird In the first round of the playoffs against the Lakers, the Nuggets won the series 4–1, with Jamal Murray hitting several game-winning shots to pull out a win However, in the conference semifinals against the Timberwolves, the Nuggets lost in Game 7 from a comeback after being up by 20 points in the 3rd quarter, and ultimately losing the game 98–90 [91]\n\n\nSeason-by-season record\nList of the last five seasons completed by the Nuggets For the full season-by-season history, see List of Denver Nuggets seasons.\n\n\nHead

(ABA) as the \"Denver Rockets.\"\n\n\nColors, logos and uniforms\nThe Nuggets have displayed numerous color schemes, logos, and uniforms throughout their franchise history, including their days in the American Basketball Association (ABA) as the \"Denver Rockets.\"\n\n\n1967–1974: Denver Rockets (ABA)\nFrom 1967–68 through 1970–71, the Denver Rockets' logos, uniforms, and colors were black, orange, and white From 1971–72 through 1973–74, the Rockets wore gold and purple (Columbine blue) uniforms, and their logo featured a cartoonish rocket bouncing a gold and purple basketball, with a purple and white snow-capped mountain in the background [93]\n\n\n1974–1981: Maxie The Miner\nDuring the Nuggets' final two seasons in the ABA, the team's logo featured a cartoonish miner known as \"Maxie The Miner,\" with a large red beard, a pick-axe in one hand and a red and blue basketball in the other hand When the Nuggets joined the NBA in the 1976–77 season, they retained the pick-axe logo on their jerseys from the ABA days The home uniforms feature \"Nuggets\" in red, with a red pick-axe inside a blue oval, and gold numbers with blue trim in front, blue numbers and letters at the back The road uniforms were blue, with \"Denver\" in blue with a blue pick-axe in a red oval, and gold numbers in front, white numbers and letters at the back The Nuggets simplified their uniforms following their inaugural season in the NBA From 1977 to 1982, their home uniforms were white, with a \"Nuggets\" script written across the chest in a darker royal blue, with gold trim around the script and jersey numbers The royal blue away jersey had \"Denver\" written across the chest in white, with gold trim.\n\n\n1982–1993: Rainbow City Skyline\nFrom 1982–83 through 1992–93, the Nuggets wore the Denver \"rainbow city\" skyline across the chest and back on both the home and away uniforms Some fans also call the iconic 1980s logo the \"Tetris\" logo, due to the buildings that shadow the mountains on the logo which are in the shape of squares The initial home uniforms were white with navy and green trim, with \"Nuggets\" and the uniform number in gold with blue trim The player names were written in block lettering and in a straight position In 1985, they changed the shade of blue to royal and eliminated green, and in 1986, changed the back numbers to royal blue In 1991, coinciding with the debut of Dikembe Mutombo, the word \"Nuggets\" became white with royal blue and gold trim The road uniforms were initially navy blue with green trim, with \"Denver\" and the uniform number in white with gold trim, before likewise changing it to royal blue, with gold serifed block letters for player names in an arch (royal blue in home uniforms) The font and \"skyline\" logo were later reintroduced on alternate jerseys beginning with the 2012–13 season.\n\n\n1993–2003: Navy blue, metallic gold and maroon\nFor the 1993–94 season, the Nuggets drastically changed their look, with a navy blue, metallic gold and maroon color scheme on their uniforms The \"rainbow city skyline,\" which had been synonymous with the team since 1981, was replaced with a logo that featured a navy blue snow-capped mountain above an enlarged western-style \"Nuggets\" wordmark in metallic gold, and a curved maroon ribbon with a \"Denver\" wordmark positioned in between the mountain and the \"Nuggets\" wordmark The home jerseys had a \"Nuggets\" script in a modified version of the typeface Aachen across the chest in navy blue, with maroon and metallic gold trim around the script and numbers, while the navy blue away jerseys had the same script in metallic gold, with maroon and white trim The Nuggets wore these uniforms for a decade, until the end of the 2002–03 season.\n\n\n2003–2018: Powder blue, navy blue and gold\nFor the 2003–04 season, the Nuggets made another uniform change, coinciding with Carmelo Anthony's debut, with a color scheme of powder blue, gold (yellow) and royal blue The primary logo, featuring a snow-capped mountain, curved ribbon with a \"Denver\" wordmark and an enlarged western-style \"Nuggets\" workmark (see previous section), was modified, with the mountain royal blue, the ribbon powder blue and the \"Nuggets\" wordmark a golden yellow Like the 1990s uniforms, the Nuggets' revised jerseys also had the \"Aachen\" typeface across the chest—it was \"Nuggets\" in powder blue, with royal blue and gold trim on the home white jersey, while the powder blue road jerseys had \"Denver\" in white, with gold and royal blue trim These jerseys, along with the team logo, were tweaked prior to the 2008–09 season, with the royal blue replaced by the shade of navy blue that was part of the team's color scheme from 1993 to 2003 These jerseys were used until the 2014–15 season, while the snow-capped mountain logo would serve as the team's primary logo until the 2017–18 season.\nIn the 2005–06 season, the Nuggets also introduced an alternate logo, as well as an alternate navy blue uniform The alternate logo featured twin intersecting gold pick-axes in a powder blue circle, with a half-white/half-yellow \"mountain peaks\" at the top of the circle and a basketball with gold outlining and navy blue accents at the bottom of the circle The navy blue jersey featured an alternate \"Nuggets\" script in gold, with navy blue interior trim and powder blue outlining This uniform was used until the end of the 2011–12 season, while the circular \"pick axe\" logo would become the team's new primary logo for the 2018–19 season.\n\n\n2018–present: Evolved new identity\nFor the 2018–19 season, the Nuggets modified their logos and uniforms, featuring various color schemes that the team has worn in their history The current color scheme consists of midnight blue (navy), sunshine yellow, flatirons red (maroon) and skyline blue (royal)—the latter color is only featured on the \"Statement\" jersey and two of the team's new alternate logos Powder blue, which had been part of the team's color scheme since 2003, was eliminated from all logos and uniforms The white \"Association\" jersey features \"Nuggets\" in flatirons red, with sunshine yellow trim and midnight blue numbers with sunshine yellow trim, while the midnight blue \"Icon\" jersey features \"Denver\" in sunshine yellow, with flatirons red trim and white numbers with flatirons red trim Both sets also include mountain peak striping on the shorts and the pick axe logo on the waistline The skyline blue \"Statement\" jersey features \"Mile High City\" in white surrounding sunshine yellow numbers, plus a midnight blue mountain peak silhouette and a sunshine yellow pick axe logo on the sides of the shorts A modernized version of the skyline logo adorns the waistline The circular \"pick axe logo,\" which had served as the Nuggets' alternate logo since 2005, became the team's new primary logo, replacing the snow-capped mountain/enlarged western-style wordmark logo that had served as the team's primary logo (in three different versions) since 1993 The colors on the circular pick axe logo were also modified with the team's new color scheme [6] [99]\n\n\nCity Edition uniforms\nIn the 2017–18 season, Nike released a fourth uniform option known as the \"City\" series, which is updated annually The Nuggets' first \"City\" uniform had a navy base, highlighting the pick-axe and mountain logo in front and incorporating sublimated mountain peak patterns on the shorts [101]\n\n\n2020 Earned Edition uniforms\nAs a reward for making the NBA playoffs the previous season, 16 teams were given an exclusive fifth or sixth uniform option: the \"Earned\" uniform The Nuggets, having qualified for the 2020 NBA playoffs, were given this option in the 2020–21 season The white-based design featured a modified pickaxe logo, with the top half in skyline blue and the bottom half in flatirons red Names are written in blue and numbers are written in red with gold trim

Basketball Association (NBA). The team was founded in 1967 as the Denver Rockets in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and was one of the original teams in the ABA. They joined the NBA in 1976 after the ABA-NBA merger.\n\n**History**\n\nPrior to the 1948–49 National Basketball League (NBL) season, the original Denver Nuggets were founded. Following that season, the NBL merged with the Basketball Association of America (BAA), with the newly unified circuit named the National Basketball Association to reflect the merger. The Denver Nuggets played the 1949–50 season as one of the charter NBA teams before folding. This franchise's records and statistics remain separate from the modern-day Denver Nuggets.\n\n**1967–1969: Franchise background and founding**\n\nPrior to the 1948–49 National Basketball League (NBL) season, the original Denver Nuggets were founded. Following that season, the NBL merged with the Basketball Association of America (BAA), with the newly unified circuit named the National Basketball Association to reflect the merger. The Denver Nuggets played the 1949–50 season as one of the charter NBA teams before folding. This franchise's records and statistics remain separate from the modern-day Denver Nuggets.\n\n**1969–1976: ABA years**\n\nPlaying at the Denver Auditorium Arena, the Rockets had early successes on the court, developing a strong fan base along the way. However, the team had a history of early playoff exits and only once played in the ABA championship series.\n\n**Becoming the Denver Nuggets**\n\nRingsby sold the team to San Diego businessmen Frank Goldberg and Bud Fischer in 1972. In 1974, in anticipation of moving into the NBA, and the new McNichols Arena, the franchise held a contest to choose a new team nickname, as \"Rockets\" was already in use by the Houston Rockets. The winning choice was \"Nuggets,\" in honor of the original Denver Nuggets team from 1948 to 1950, the last year as a charter member of the NBA. Their new logo was a miner \"discovering\" an ABA ball.\n\n**1976–1982: Early NBA years**\n\nThe Nuggets and Nets had actually applied to join the NBA in 1975, but were forced to stay in the ABA by a court order. The Nuggets continued their strong play early on in the NBA, as they won division titles in their first two seasons in the league, and missed a third by a single game. However, neither of these teams were ultimately successful in the postseason.\n\n**1982–1989: The Alex English era**\n\nAnchored by scoring machines Alex English and Kiki Vandeweghe at the two forward spots, and Dan Issel at center, Denver led the league in scoring, with English and Vandeweghe both averaging above 25 points per game. It was a novel strategy, allowing the Nuggets to top the Midwest Division and qualify for the playoffs during that span.\n\n**1989–1991: A period of decline**\n\nMoe left the team in 1990, and was replaced by Paul Westhead. Westhead also believed in a \"run and gun\" style of play allowing players to speed down the court to shoot rather than creating set plays.\n\n**1991–1996: The Dikembe Mutombo era**\n\nDenver took a positive step in rebuilding by drafting Georgetown University center Dikembe Mutombo in 1991.

COMSAT bought the NHL's Quebec Nordiques in 1995 and moved them to Denver as the Colorado Avalanche. However, its diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent Entertainment Group, the umbrella corporation for its sporting assets, to Liberty Media.\n\n**2003–2011: The Carmelo Anthony era**\n\nIn 2003, the Nuggets drafted future All-Star Carmelo Anthony with the third overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft.

At the end of the season, English won the NBA scoring title, becoming the only Nugget to win the award despite the heavily favored offensive play of Doug Moe In 1984–85, they made it to the Western Conference finals after being perennial playoff contenders, and they lost in five games to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\n1989–1991: A period of decline\nMoe left the team in 1990, and was replaced by Paul Westhead Westhead also believed in a \"run and gun\" style of play allowing players to speed down the court to shoot rather than creating set plays [25]\n\n\n1991–1996: The Dikembe Mutombo era\nDenver took a positive step in rebuilding by drafting Georgetown University center Dikembe Mutombo in 1991 Mutombo finished runner-up to Larry Johnson for the NBA rookie of the year that season Denver finished 24–58 that year.\n\n\n1996–2003: Another period of struggle\nAfter finishing the 1996–97 season with the fourth-worst record in the league (21–61), the Nuggets sent Antonio McDyess to the Phoenix Suns, and Dale Ellis returned to Seattle Denver flirted with history in the 1997–98, by nearly setting the mark for fewest wins in an 82-game season (11) They tied the then-NBA's all-time worst single-season losing streak at 23—only one game shy of the overall worst mark of 24 by the Cleveland Cavaliers of the early 1980s The losing streak was later broken by the Cavaliers in 2011 and the Philadelphia 76ers in 2014 with 26 consecutive losses Several years later, the Nuggets tied for the worst record in the NBA in 2002–03, also with the Cavaliers.\n\n\nNew ownerships\nThe team's struggles in the late 1990s were due in part to ownership instability COMSAT bought the NHL's Quebec Nordiques in 1995 and moved them to Denver as the Colorado Avalanche However, its diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company In particular, cost overruns associated with the construction of Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent Entertainment Group, the umbrella corporation for its sporting assets, to Liberty Media [19] However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought the Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets [26]\n\n\n2003–2011: The Carmelo Anthony era\nIn 2003, the Nuggets drafted future All-Star Carmelo Anthony with the third overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft [30] That same year, the team also updated their logos and uniforms, with a new color scheme of powder blue, gold and royal blue; the latter color was changed to navy blue in 2008 [31] In just two months of the season, the Nuggets recorded more wins than they had in 5½ months of play in 2002–03 Much of the reason for this incredible turnaround were the front-office moves of general manager Kiki Vandeweghe, a former Nuggets player who assumed general manager duties on August 9, 2001 [32] In April, the turnaround was complete as they became the first franchise in NBA history to qualify for the postseason following a sub-20-win campaign the previous year since the NBA went to an 82-game schedule [32] They were eliminated in the first round four games to one by the Minnesota Timberwolves [33]\n\n\n2006–2008: The Anthony and Iverson duo\nOn December 19, 2006, the Nuggets traded Joe Smith, Andre Miller and two first-round draft picks of the 2007 NBA draft to the Philadelphia 76ers for Ivan McFarlin and superstar Allen Iverson (McFarlin was waived immediately following the trade's approval) The moves gave the Nuggets the top two scorers in the league at the time in Anthony and Iverson, who were both scoring over 30 points per game at the time of the trade On January 11, 2007, Earl Boykins, Julius Hodge and cash considerations were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, in exchange for point guard Steve Blake With Iverson, many considered the Nuggets as one of the elite in the West However, chemistry was an issue, as the Nuggets finished the season with the sixth seed, giving them a first-round matchup against the San Antonio Spurs In the playoffs, the Nuggets took Game 1 and home-court advantage away from the Spurs However, as had occurred in the 2005 playoffs, the Spurs bounced back to sweep the next four, as the Nuggets were eliminated in the first round in five games for the fourth straight year.\n\n\n2008–2011: The Anthony and Billups duo\nOn July 16, 2008, at the end of the 2007–08 NBA season, the Nuggets traded former NBA Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Camby to the Los Angeles Clippers for a second-round draft pick (that was then traded to the New York Knicks for Renaldo Balkman).\n\n\n2011–2015: The departure of Carmelo Anthony, team concept, post–Karl and pre–Jokić seasons\nOn February 22, 2011, after months of speculation that he wanted to leave the Nuggets, Carmelo Anthony was traded along with Chauncey Billups, Anthony Carter, Shelden Williams and Renaldo Balkman to the New York Knicks in a multi-player deal also involving the Minnesota Timberwolves in which the Nuggets received Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Timofey Mozgov and Kosta Koufos On the day when the trade was done, the Nuggets were left with nine players to play against the Memphis Grizzlies The Nuggets won 120–107, where they led by as many as 27 points In the closing minutes of the game, the arena resounded with chants of \"Who needs Melo?\" George Karl said after the game, \"Our guys, when their backs are confronted with a difficult situation, they usually play at a high level We always react to tough situations in a very positive way.\" However, the trade only seemed to make them better Post-trade, the Nuggets averaged 24.1 assists, showing their newfound teamwork The defense of the Nuggets also improved, from allowing 105.2 points per game before the trade to 97.1 points per game for the remainder of the season  [54] Despite the franchise-changing trade which saw eighteen different starting lineups through the whole season, Denver finished with 50 wins (fourth consecutive 50 win seasons for the first time in Nuggets history), clinching the fifth seed of the Western Conference They met the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the playoffs and lost four games to one.\n\n\n2015–present: The Nikola Jokić era and first NBA championship\nOn June 15, 2015, at the end of the 2014–15 season, Michael Malone was named as the new head coach of the Denver Nuggets [61] Entering the 2015 NBA draft with their lowest draft pick (seventh overall) since 2003, the Nuggets drafted Emmanuel Mudiay who was widely regarded as the top point guard of the draft, leading to speculation that current starting point guard, Ty Lawson, would be traded [62] On July 14, 2015, Lawson was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of driving under the influence, his second in six months [63] The Nuggets traded Lawson a week later to the Houston Rockets along with a second round draft pick for Joey Dorsey, Nick Johnson, Kostas Papanikolaou, Pablo Prigioni (all of whom were waived), and a first round pick that was used to draft Juan Hernangómez [64]\n\n\n2015–2018: Early years\nOn June 15, 2015, at the end of the 2014–15 season, Michael Malone was named as the new head coach of the Denver Nuggets [61] Entering the 2015 NBA draft

[77] In the first round, the Nuggets played against the San Antonio Spurs, winning the round in game seven The Nuggets were eliminated in the second round by the Portland Trail Blazers in 7 games [76] Game three of the second round had four overtimes, tying a 1953 game for the longest NBA playoff game [78]\n\n\n2020–22: Jokic wins back to back MVP awards\nIn the 2020–21 NBA season, Jokić was named the NBA Most Valuable Player, becoming the first center since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000 and the first player in Nuggets franchise history to win the award He also became the first Serbian player, third European player overall (along with Dirk Nowitzki of Germany and Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece), and sixth international player to ever win the award (along with Hakeem Olajuwon of Nigeria, Tim Duncan of the U.S Virgin Islands, Steve Nash of Canada, Nowitzki of Germany, and Antetokounmpo of Greece) Jokić also became the lowest ever drafted player at #41, and the first player in NBA history to be selected in the second round of the common era draft, to win the MVP award [82] [83] Although the Nuggets finished the season with the third seed in the Western Conference and beat their first round opponents, the Portland Trail Blazers, in six games, the loss of starting guard Jamal Murray to an ACL tear contributed to the team's sweep by the eventual Western Conference champions, the second-seeded Phoenix Suns [84]\n\n\n2022–2023: First NBA title\nIn the 2022–23 season, elevated by the offseason acquisitions of Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Bruce Brown, the Nuggets secured the top seed in the Western Conference with 53 wins and 29 losses, two games ahead of the Memphis Grizzlies The Nuggets defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 4–1 in the first round of the 2023 playoffs, before defeating the Phoenix Suns 4–2 in the Conference Semifinals The Nuggets' playoff dominance continued in the Conference Finals; spearheaded by outstanding play from Jokić, who was named the Western Conference Finals Most Valuable Player, the team swept the Los Angeles Lakers in four games to advance to their first ever NBA Finals [87] This also marked the first time that the Nuggets had beaten the Lakers in a playoff series (having previously been 0–7 against them), as well as the first playoff series sweep in franchise history [88] In the NBA Finals, on June 12, 2023, the Nuggets would beat the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat 4–1 to win their first NBA championship, with Jokić receiving the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award [89] [90]\n\n\n2023–2024: Dethroned and Joker's third MVP season\nIn the 2023–24 season, the first season in league history with the Nuggets as defending champions, Denver finished with the 2nd seed in the Western Conference with a 57–25 record,

jerseys from the ABA days The home uniforms feature \"Nuggets\" in red, with a red pick-axe inside a blue oval, and gold numbers with blue trim in front, blue numbers and letters at the back The road uniforms were blue, with \"Denver\" in blue with a blue pick-axe in a red oval, and gold numbers in front, white numbers and letters at the back The Nuggets simplified their uniforms following their inaugural season in the NBA From 1977 to 1982, their home uniforms were white, with a \"Nuggets\" script written across the chest in a darker royal blue, with gold trim around the script and jersey numbers The royal blue away jersey had \"Denver\" written across the chest in white, with gold trim.\n\n\n1982–1993: Rainbow City Skyline\nFrom 1982–83 through 1992–93, the Nuggets wore the Denver \"rainbow city\" skyline across the chest and back on both the home and away uniforms Some fans also call the iconic 1980s logo the \"Tetris\" logo, due to the buildings that shadow the mountains on the logo which are in the shape of squares The initial home uniforms were white with navy and green trim, with \"Nuggets\" and the uniform number in gold with blue trim The player names were written in block lettering and in a straight position In 1985, they changed the shade of blue to royal and eliminated green, and in 1986, changed the back numbers to royal blue In 1991, coinciding with the

new identity\nFor the 2018–19 season, the Nuggets modified their logos and uniforms, featuring various color schemes that the team has worn in their history The current color scheme consists of midnight blue (navy), sunshine yellow, flatirons red (maroon) and skyline blue (royal)—the latter color is only featured on the \"Statement\" jersey and two of the team's new alternate logos Powder

The company was founded in 2019 by a group of professional wrestlers, including Cody Rhodes, Nick Jackson, Matt Jackson, and Kenny Omega. AEW is known for its high-flying action, exciting matches, and diverse roster of talent.\n\n## History\n\n### Mid 20th Century\n\nProfessional wrestling has a long and storied history, dating back to the early 20th century. In the mid-20th century, professional wrestling was dominated by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and the American Wrestling Association (AWA). However, in the 1990s, a new player entered the scene: World Championship Wrestling (WCW). WCW, led by Eric Bischoff, began to challenge the NWA and AWA for dominance in the professional wrestling world.\n\n### Background and formation (2017–2019)\n\nIn 2017, a group of professional wrestlers, including Cody Rhodes, Nick Jackson, Matt Jackson, and Kenny Omega, began to discuss the possibility of creating a new professional wrestling promotion. The group, which would come to be known as All Elite Wrestling (AEW), was formed in response to the decline of WCW and the perceived lack of innovation in the professional wrestling industry.\n\n### Early history and TNT debut (2019–2020)\n\nIn May 2019, AEW and WarnerMedia announced a deal for a weekly primetime show airing live on TNT. The show, which would be called Dynamite, was set to debut in the fall of 2019. AEW's debut was highly anticipated, and the company was seen as a potential challenger to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) for dominance in the professional wrestling world.\n\n### Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2021)\n\nIn March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic began to affect the professional wrestling industry. AEW's Dynamite was among the first professional wrestling shows to be impacted by the pandemic, with the March 18 episode being held without spectators. The pandemic also caused the cancellation of AEW's Double or Nothing pay-per-view event, which was scheduled to take place in May 2020.\n\n### Return to live touring and ROH purchase (2021–2022)\n\nIn May 2021, AEW announced that it would be returning to live touring, with a special episode of Dynamite titled Road Rager. The event, which took place in Miami, Florida, was the first major professional wrestling promotion to resume live touring during the COVID-19 pandemic. AEW's return to live touring was followed by a series of special Dynamite episodes, including Fyter Fest and Fight for the Fallen. In June 2021, AEW announced that it had purchased Ring of Honor (ROH), a professional wrestling promotion that had been a major player in the industry since the 2000s.\n\n### Expansion of live and broadcast events (2022–present)\n\nIn 2022, AEW continued to expand its live and broadcast events. The company held its first full event in a stadium, Grand Slam, which took place in New York City. The event was a huge success, with over 20,000 spectators in attendance. AEW also continued to hold its pay-per-view events, including All Out and Full Gear. In November 2022, AEW announced that it had signed a new deal with WarnerMedia, which would see Dynamite continue to air on TNT through 2025.\n\n## Programming\n\nBefore Dynamite and pay-per-view events, AEW releases a \"Road to...\" and \"Countdown to...\" series of videos on its official YouTube channel. The videos consist of interviews, video packages, and backstage segments that hype upcoming matches and create new rivalries.\n\n## Events\n\nAEW pay-per-view events are available on Triller TV in other international markets. They are also available via traditional PPV outlets in the U.S and Canada, and carried by all major satellite providers.\n\n## International rights\n\nIn May 2019, AEW reached a media rights deal with British media company ITV plc to broadcast AEW shows on ITV4. However, after ITV Box Office ceased operations in January 2020, ITV no longer broadcasts AEW pay-per-views in the UK.\n\n## Partnerships\n\nAEW has partnership agreements with several promotions around the world. The company also has a close relationship with Ring of Honor (ROH), with wrestlers from both promotions frequently appearing on each other's shows.\n\n## Contracts and roster\n\nAEW signs most of its talent to exclusive contracts, under which they can appear or perform only on AEW programming and events (which includes ROH) or AEW-approved independent events. The company also allows periodic appearances from wrestlers and personalities from partner promotions, including Japan's New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), DDT Pro-Wrestling (DDT), Tokyo Joshi Pro Wrestling (TJPW), Pro Wrestling Noah, and World Wonder Ring Stardom, and Mexico's Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL).\n\n## Video games\n\nAs of November 19, 2024, AEW has partnered with several video game developers to create games featuring its wrestlers and storylines.\n\n## Championships and accomplishments\n\nAs of November 19, 2024, AEW has established several championships, including the AEW World Championship, the AEW World Tag Team Championship, and the AEW World Women's Championship.\n\n## Current champions\n\n### Singles\n\n* Men's

Earth thousands of years ago and settled on Saturn's moon of Titan Eros is the youngest son of A'lars (also known as Mentor) and Sui-San, the nephew of Zuras, and the grandnephew of Uranos He grew up on Titan to be a fun-loving, carefree womanizer and adventurer in contrast to his brother Thanos, a power-hungry, nihilistic conqueror Only when Thanos launched his first major attack on Titan did Eros begin to take life a bit more seriously.\n\n\nAllegations of sexual assault\nStarfox was put on trial for sexual assault, accused of using his powers to seduce a happily married woman  He was defended by lawyer Jennifer Walters, the She-Hulk The law firm which employed her, Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway, was contracted by Mentor to defend his son from the allegations In the course of the trial, Ms Walters came to suspect that Starfox had used his powers on her during their time in the Avengers, resulting in a brief sexual interaction By this time, Starfox had been banned from the courtroom after it was determined that he was using his special abilities to influence the witnesses When Jennifer Walters confronted Starfox with her suspicions via closed-circuit video link, he evaded her questions and then cut the video feed Walters angrily charged out of the courtroom, transformed into She-Hulk, and caught Starfox as he was attempting to escape from Earth She-Hulk dealt Starfox a savage beating, giving him no chance to defend his actions, knocked him unconscious, finally duct-taping his mouth shut to ensure that he could not use his abilities to elude punishment However, Mentor, Starfox's father, effected his son's release by teleporting Starfox away to Titan [49]\n\n\nReturn\nStarfox is later seen living on Titan again, with his abilities restored He is shown flirting with a number of women, but states that he will not use his powers to woo them Ultron soon attacks Titan and assimilates the entire population (including Mentor) via a robotic virus, transforming the moon into Planet Ultron Starfox flees to Earth and meets with the current team of Avengers (now led by the new Captain America), and teams up with them to liberate his world He plays a key role in the Avengers' victory, using his powers on the half-organic Ultron to force the villain to have an emotional breakdown [52]\n\n\nInfinity Conflict\nIn Thanos: The Infinity Siblings, after sleeping with different women on Titan, Eros is suddenly teleported into the future by his future self and is left stranded on a prehistoric world Following a number of years, in the year 2079, his handmade radio finally caught a signal of a ship which rescued Eros Then in the year 2125 Eros is forced to do an emergency landing due to his ship being damaged He landed on the planet Zelchia which is ten times the size of Earth with a much higher gravity Being unable to fly Eros is knocked out by the savage natives who plan to eat him Thankfully, he is saved by the owl-like mutant native with teleporting powers named only Ghost Ghost took Eros to his tribe, with the latter promising Ghost to technologically advance his people After a year Eros bid them farewell and left Zelchia and went to the planet of Shangranna He trained on the planet for a number of years until in the year 3812 he set this entire world ablaze Then, in the year 4012, he encounters Kang the Conqueror, whose ship was partially destroyed by the stygian darkness of an omnipotent Thanos from the year 4657 After some negotiating, Kang tells Eros about the omnipotent Thanos losing to Hunger Eros uses Kang time traveling technology to go back to the point he was originally transported to the future and sending his past self to the same future After recruiting Pip to this cause, he then goes to Thanos and tells him about his omnipotent future self He then proposes to Thanos a plan to avoid the darkness from destroying all of reality After that, Eros and Pip go through time and arrived to the point where Eros first met Kang and stole some of Kang's time-travelling technology They use the technology to go to the point where Eros departed Zelchia and offers Ghost and his people even more advanced weaponry from the Shi'ar After a year, Eros manages to unite the planet's three main races to fight the threat of Thanos and his army, which was really all part of his plan As Thanos and his army are about to attack the people of Zelchia, Eros teleports in front of Thanos and uses some drug to make him appear like Thanos killed him After regaining himself and berating Thanos for the change of plans, he, Pip, and Ghost return to the present, not knowing that he was secretly manipulated by the future Omnipotent Thanos this whole time [53]\n\n\nForming the Dark Guardians\nIn the aftermath of the \"Infinity Wars\" story line, Starfox is present at Thanos' funeral He shows all the guests a recording of Thanos stating that he uploaded his consciousness into a new body before his death The funeral is attacked by the Black Order, who steals Thanos's body and rips open a hole in space, sending everyone into the rip [56] Everyone is saved by the arrival of Gladiator and the Shi'ar Empire Starfox begins to recruit warriors to find Gamora, the most likely candidate to be Thanos's new body, as they form the Dark Guardians, which causes Cosmic Ghost Rider to side with them Wraith brings up the issue of the Black Order, but Starfox assures they are searching for them, and Nebula states that the team should track down Nova to find Gamora's location [57] The Dark Guardians find Nova and ambush him, wounding him enough to crash land onto a planet Wraith demands Nova to tell Gamora's location, stating the fact he does not want to harm him if does not have to When Gladiator and Cosmic Ghost Rider order him to back off, Nova takes the chance to fly off, but the team plans to track him down again [58]\n\n\nDeath\nAfter finding Gamora by following Nova and fighting off the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Dark Guardians captured her and brought her to Starfox who ordered Gladiator to kill her However, Gamora's execution was interrupted by the Asgardian goddess of death Hela and the Black Order who subdued the Dark Guardians in short time [59] Hela then reveals that Thanos is not going to come back in Gamora but in Starfox Moments later, Thanos' consciousness takes over Starfox's body and goes with Hela and the Black Order to Knowhere, where his body is being kept Thanos laments that Starfox would not survive the transference of his consciousness into his body [60]\n\n\nRebirth\nStarfox is later revealed to have been resurrected but kept as an inmate in the Exclusion, a key location for the Eternals, located beneath the South Pole in Antarctica Sersi employs Jack of Knives to free Starfox and battle the Progenitor's judgment of Earth [62]\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nEros, like other Eternals, possesses superhuman strength, agility, durability, and longevity [63] He is also immune to disease and has the power of flight [64] He also has the ability to psychically control people's emotions, allowing him to essentially compel anyone to act according to his will, though Eros typically uses his abilities for good [65] He can also utilize psionics to fly at great speeds and manipulate the gravity of people and objects [66] His psionic abilities give him considerable control over his body's cellular structure and the matter around him, allowing Eros to enhance the durability of his own cells or make minor transmutations to nearby objects [67] Furthermore, Eros possesses a powerful healing factor, allowing him to recover rapidly from damage, and is virtually immortal [68]\n\n\nReception\nMarc Buxton of Den of Geek stated that Eros is recognized for his charm, roguish nature, and adventurous spirit They found that, as a love god with an appreciation for the finer things in life, Starfox stands out as a distinctive figure They also suggested that, as Marvel continues to expand its Cinematic Universe, Eros should not be overlooked, as he has the potential to become a key figure—whether as a romantic foil in the Star-Lord and Gamora relationship or as a pivotal character linked to the threat of Thanos [69]\n\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\nHarry Styles appears as Eros in the mid-credits scene of Eternals (2021) The announcement of casting Styles as Eros elicited mixed reactions from fans, [70] [71] although his appearance was met with \"deafening screams and cheers\" from the crowd at the premiere of the film on October 18, according to Business Insider [72] Patrick J Hetherington of Screen Rant noted that the scene sparked considerable interest, not only due to Styles' fame, but also because it explicitly mentioned Thanos and highlighted Eros' fraternal connection with him [73]\n\n\nOther versions\nA zombified alternate universe variant of Eros from Earth-2149 appears in Marvel Zombies vs

After recruiting Pip to this cause, he then goes to Thanos and tells him about his omnipotent future self. He then proposes to Thanos a plan to avoid the darkness from destroying all of reality. After that, Eros and Pip go through time and arrived to the point where Eros first met Kang and stole some of Kang's time-travelling technology. They use the technology to go to the point where Eros departed Zelchia and offers Ghost and his people even more advanced weaponry from the Shi'ar. After a year, Eros manages to unite the planet's three main races to fight the threat of Thanos and his army, which was really all part of his plan. As Thanos and his army are about to attack the people of Zelchia, Eros teleports in front of Thanos and uses some drug to make him appear like Thanos killed him. After regaining himself and berating Thanos for the change of plans, he, Pip, and Ghost return to the present, not knowing that he was secretly manipulated by the future Omnipotent Thanos this whole time.\n\n**Forming the Dark Guardians**\n\nIn the aftermath of the \"Infinity Wars\" story line, Starfox is present at Thanos' funeral. He shows all the guests a recording of Thanos stating that he uploaded his consciousness into a new body before his death. The funeral is attacked by the Black Order, who steals Thanos's body and rips open a hole in space, sending everyone into the rip. Everyone is saved by the arrival of Gladiator and the Shi'ar Empire. Starfox begins to recruit warriors to find Gamora, the most likely candidate to be Thanos's new body, as they form the Dark Guardians, which causes Cosmic Ghost Rider to side with them. Wraith brings up the issue of the Black Order, but Starfox assures they are searching for them, and Nebula states that the team should track down Nova to find Gamora's location. The Dark Guardians find Nova and ambush him, wounding him enough to crash land onto a planet. Wraith demands Nova to tell Gamora's location, stating the fact he does not want to harm him if does not have to. When Gladiator and Cosmic Ghost Rider order him to back off, Nova takes the chance to fly off, but the team plans to track him down again.\n\n**Death**\n\nAfter finding Gamora by following Nova and fighting off the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Dark Guardians captured her and brought her to Starfox who ordered Gladiator to kill her. However, Gamora's execution was interrupted by the Asgardian goddess of death Hela and the Black Order who subdued the Dark Guardians in short time. Hela then reveals that Thanos is not going to come back in Gamora but in Starfox. Moments later, Thanos' consciousness takes over Starfox's body and goes with Hela and the Black Order to Knowhere, where his body is being kept. Thanos laments that Starfox would not survive the transference of his consciousness into his body.\n\n**Rebirth**\n\nStarfox is later revealed to have been resurrected but kept as an inmate in the Exclusion, a key location for the Eternals, located beneath the South Pole in Antarctica. Sersi employs Jack of Knives to free Starfox and battle the Progenitor's judgment of Earth.\n\n**Powers and Abilities**\n\nEros, like other Eternals, possesses superhuman strength, agility, durability, and longevity. He is also immune to disease and has the power of flight. He also has the ability to psychically control people's emotions, allowing him to essentially compel anyone to act according to his will, though Eros typically uses his abilities for good. He can also utilize psionics to fly at great speeds and manipulate the gravity of people and objects. His psionic abilities give him considerable control over his body's cellular structure and the matter around him, allowing Eros to enhance the durability of his own cells or make minor transmutations to nearby objects. Furthermore, Eros possesses a powerful healing factor, allowing him to recover rapidly from damage, and is virtually immortal.\n\n**Reception**\n\nMarc Buxton of Den of Geek stated that Eros is recognized for his charm, roguish nature, and adventurous spirit. They found that, as a love god with an appreciation for the finer things in life, Starfox stands out as a distinctive figure. They also suggested that, as Marvel continues to expand its Cinematic Universe, Eros should not be overlooked, as he has the potential to become a key figure—whether as a romantic foil in the Star-Lord and Gamora relationship or as a pivotal character linked to the threat of Thanos.\n\n**Marvel Cinematic Universe**\n\nHarry Styles appears as Eros in the mid-credits scene of Eternals (2021). The announcement of casting Styles as Eros elicited mixed reactions from fans, although his appearance was met with \"deafening screams and cheers\" from the crowd at the premiere of the film on October 18, according to Business Insider. Patrick J Hetherington of Screen Rant noted that the scene sparked considerable interest, not only due to Styles' fame, but also because it explicitly mentioned Thanos and highlighted Eros' fraternal connection with him.\n\n**Other Versions**\n\nA zombified alternate universe variant of Eros from Earth-2149 appears in Marvel Zombies vs The Army of Darkness.\n\n**References**\n\nExternal links",

of Zuras, and the grandnephew of Uranos He grew up on Titan to be a fun-loving, carefree womanizer and adventurer in contrast to his brother Thanos, a power-hungry, nihilistic conqueror Only when

interaction By this time, Starfox had been banned from the courtroom after it was determined that he was using his special abilities to influence the witnesses When Jennifer Walters confronted Starfox with her suspicions via closed-circuit video link, he evaded her questions and then cut the video feed Walters angrily charged out of the courtroom, transformed into She-Hulk, and caught Starfox as he was attempting to escape from Earth She-Hulk dealt Starfox a savage beating, giving him no chance to defend his actions, knocked him unconscious, finally duct-taping his mouth shut to ensure that he

people After a year Eros bid them farewell and left Zelchia and went to the planet of Shangranna He trained on the planet for a number of years until in the year 3812 he set this entire world ablaze

was fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks [28] Narendra was mischievous and restless as a child, and his parents often had difficulty controlling him His mother said, \"I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has sent me one of his demons\" [26]\n\n\nEducation\nIn 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877 [30] In 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination  [31] He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and literature [32] He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas Narendra was trained in Indian classical music, [33] and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the General Assembly's Institution (now known as the Scottish Church College) [34] In 1881, he passed the Fine Arts examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884 [35] [36] Narendra studied the works of David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Baruch Spinoza, Georg W F Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin [37] [38] He became fascinated with the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer and corresponded with him, [39] [40] translating Herbert Spencer's book Education (1861) into Bengali [41] While studying Western philosophers, he also learned Sanskrit scriptures and Bengali literature [38]\n\n\nInitial spiritual forays\nIn 1880, Narendra joined Keshab Chandra Sen's Nava Vidhan, which was established by Sen after meeting Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism [45] Narendra became a member of a Freemasonry lodge \"at some point before 1884\" [46] and of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the Brahmo Samaj led by Keshab Chandra Sen and Debendranath Tagore [45] [34] [47] [48] From 1881 to 1884, he was also active in Sen's Band of Hope, which tried to discourage youths from smoking and drinking [45]\n\n\nMeeting Ramakrishna\nIn 1881, Narendra first met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after his own father had died in 1884 [61]\n\n\nFounding of Ramakrishna Math\nAfter Ramakrishna's death, his devotees and admirers stopped supporting his disciples [82] Unpaid rent accumulated, and Narendra and the other disciples had to find a new place to live [83] Many returned home, adopting a Grihastha (family-oriented) way of life [84] Narendra decided to convert a dilapidated house at Baranagar into a new math (monastery) for the remaining disciples Rent for the Baranagar Math was low, raised by \"holy begging\" (mādhukarī) The math became the first building of the Ramakrishna Math: the monastery of the monastic order of Ramakrishna [68] Narendra and other disciples used to spend many hours in practising meditation and religious austerities every day [85] Narendra later reminisced about the early days of the monastery: [86]\n\n\nMonastic vows\nIn December 1886, the mother of Baburam [note 2] invited Narendra and his other brother monks to Antpur village Narendra and the other aspiring monks accepted the invitation and went to Antpur to spend a few days In Antpur, on the Christmas Eve of 1886, Narendra, aged 23, and eight other disciples took formal monastic vows at the Radha Gobinda Jiu temple [88] [85] They decided to live their lives as their master lived [85] Narendranath took the name \"Swami Vivekananda\" [89]\n\n\nTravels in India (1888–1893)\nIn 1888, Narendra left the monastery as a Parivrâjaka— the Hindu religious life of a wandering monk, \"without fixed abode, without ties, independent and strangers wherever they go\" [90] His sole possessions were a kamandalu (water pot), staff and his two favourite books: the Bhagavad Gita and The Imitation of Christ [91] Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns [92] [93] He developed sympathy for the suffering and poverty of the people, and resolved to uplift the nation [92] [94] Living primarily on bhiksha (alms), Narendra travelled on foot and by railway (with tickets bought by admirers) During his travels he met, and stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life: scholars, dewans, rajas, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, paraiyars (low-caste workers) and government officials [94] On 31 May 1893, Narendra left Bombay for Chicago with the name, as suggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri, \"Vivekananda\"–a conglomerate of the Sanskrit words: viveka and ānanda, meaning \"the bliss of discerning wisdom\" [95] [96]\n\n\nFirst visit to the West (1893–1897)\nVivekananda started his journey to the West on 31 May 1893 [97] and visited several cities in Japan (including Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama, Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo), [98] China and Canada en route to the United States, [97] reaching Chicago on 30 July 1893, [99] [97] where the \"Parliament of Religions\" took place in September 1893 [100] The Congress was an initiative of the Swedenborgian layman, and judge of the Illinois Supreme Court, Charles C Bonney, [101] [102] to gather all the religions of the world, and show \"the substantial unity of many religions in the good deeds of the religious life.\" [101] It was one of the more than 200 adjunct gatherings and congresses of the Chicago's World's Fair, [101] and was \"an avant-garde intellectual manifestation of  [...] cultic milieus, East and West,\" [103] with the Brahmo Samaj and the Theosophical Society being invited as representative of Hinduism [104]\n\n\nParliament of the World's Religions\nThe Parliament of the World's Religions opened on 11 September 1893 at the Art Institute of Chicago, as part of the World's Columbian Exposition [108] [109] [110] On this day, Vivekananda gave a brief speech representing India and Hinduism [111] He was initially nervous, bowed to Saraswati (the Hindu goddess of learning) and began his speech with \"Sisters and brothers of America!\" [112] [110] At these words, Vivekananda received a two-minute standing ovation from the crowd of seven thousand [113] According to Sailendra Nath Dhar, when silence was restored he began his address, greeting the youngest of the nations on behalf of \"the most ancient order of monks in the world, the Vedic order of sannyasins, a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance\" [114] [note 4] Vivekananda quoted two illustrative passages from the \"Shiva mahimna stotram\": \"As the different streams having their sources in different places all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord, the different paths which men take, through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee!\" and \"Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through paths that in the end lead to Me.\" [117] According to Sailendra Nath Dhar, \"it was only a short\nspeech, but it voiced the spirit of the Parliament.\" [117] [118]\n\n\nLecture tours in the UK and US\n\"I do not come\", said Swamiji on one occasion in America, \"to convert you to a new belief I want you to keep your own belief; I want to make the Methodist a better Methodist; the Presbyterian a better Presbyterian; the Unitarian a better Unitarian I want to teach you to live the truth, to reveal the light within your own soul.\" [124]\n\n\nBack in India (1897–1899)\nThe ship from Europe arrived in Colombo, British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) on 15 January 1897, [149] and Vivekananda received a warm welcome In Colombo, he gave his first public speech in the East From there on, his journey to Calcutta was triumphant Vivekananda travelled from Colombo to Pamban, Rameswaram, Ramnad, Madurai, Kumbakonam and Madras, delivering lectures Common people and rajas gave him an enthusiastic reception During his train travels, people often sat on the rails to force the train to stop, so they could hear him [149] From Madras (now Chennai), he continued his journey to Calcutta and Almora While in the West, Vivekananda spoke about India's great spiritual heritage; in India, he repeatedly addressed social issues: uplifting the people, eliminating the caste system, promoting science and industrialisation, addressing widespread poverty and ending colonial rule These lectures, published as Lectures from Colombo to Almora, demonstrate his nationalistic fervour and spiritual ideology [151]\n\n\nSecond visit to the West and final years (1899–1902)\nDespite declining health, Vivekananda left for the West for a second time in June 1899 [162] accompanied by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United States During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California [163] He then went to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900 [164] His lectures in Paris concerned the worship of the lingam and the authenticity of the Bhagavad Gita [163] Vivekananda then visited Brittany, Vienna, Istanbul, Athens and Egypt The French philosopher Jules Bois was his host for most of this period, until he returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900 [163]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 4 July 1902 (the day of his death), [167] Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur Math and meditated for three hours He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to pupils, [168] [169] later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math At 7:00 pm Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; [168] he died at 9:20 p.m while meditating [170] According to his disciples, Vivekananda attained mahasamādhi; [171] the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death [172] His disciples believed that the rupture was due to his brahmarandhra (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when he attained mahasamādhi Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy that he would not live forty years [173] He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre on the bank of the Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier [174]\n\n\nTeachings and philosophy\nShaivism/Tantra/Nath\n\n\nInfluence and legacy\nVivekananda was one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers in his contemporary India and the most successful and influential missionaries of Vedanta to the Western world [206] [207]\n\n\nNeo-Vedanta\nVivekananda was one of the main representatives of Neo-Vedanta, a modern interpretation of selected aspects of Hinduism in line with western esoteric traditions, especially Transcendentalism, New Thought and Theosophy [3] His reinterpretation was, and is, very successful, creating a new understanding and appreciation of Hinduism within and outside India, [3] and was the principal reason for the enthusiastic reception of yoga, Transcendental Meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self-improvement in the West [208] Agehananda Bharati explained, \"...modern Hindus derive their knowledge of Hinduism from Vivekananda, directly or indirectly\" [209] Vivekananda espoused the idea that all sects within Hinduism (and all religions) are different paths to the same goal [210] However, this view has been criticised as an oversimplification of Hinduism [210]\n\n\nIndian nationalism\nIn the background of emerging nationalism in British-ruled India, Vivekananda crystallised the nationalistic ideal In the words of social reformer Charles Freer Andrews, \"The Swami's intrepid patriotism gave a new colour to the national movement throughout India More than any other single individual of that period Vivekananda had made his contribution to the new awakening of India\" [211] Vivekananda drew attention to the extent of poverty in the country, and maintained that addressing such poverty was a prerequisite for national awakening [212] His nationalistic ideas influenced many Indian thinkers and leaders Sri Aurobindo regarded Vivekananda as the one who awakened India spiritually [213] Mahatma Gandhi counted him among the few Hindu reformers \"who have maintained this Hindu religion in a state of splendor by cutting down the dead wood of tradition\" [214]\n\n\nName-giving\nIn September 2010, the then Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, who subsequently became President of India from 2012 to 2017, approved in principle the Swami Vivekananda Values Education Project at a cost of ₹1 billion (US$12 million), with objectives including: involving youth with competitions, essays, discussions and study circles and publishing Vivekananda's works in a number of languages [215] In 2011, the West Bengal Police Training College was renamed the Swami Vivekananda State Police Academy, West Bengal [216] The state technical university in Chhattisgarh has been named the Chhattisgarh Swami Vivekanand Technical University [217] In 2012, the Raipur airport was renamed Swami Vivekananda Airport [218]\n\n\nCelebrations\nNational Youth Day in India is observed on Vivekananda's birthday (12 January) The day he delivered his speech at the Parliament of Religions (11 September) is observed as \"World Brotherhood Day\" [219] [220] The 150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated in India and abroad The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports in India, officially observed 2013 as the occasion in a declaration [221]\n\n\nMovies\nIndian film director Utpal Sinha made a film, The Light: Swami Vivekananda as a tribute for his 150th birth anniversary [222] Other Indian films about his life include: Swamiji (1949) by Amar Mullick, Swami Vivekananda (1955) by Amar Mullick, Birieswar Vivekananda (1964) by Modhu Bose, Life and Message of Swami Vivekananda (1964) documentary film by Bimal Roy, Swami Vivekananda (1998) by G V Iyer, Swamiji (2012) laser light film

Animation Film in 2014 [224]\n\n\nWorks\nAlthough Vivekananda was a powerful orator and writer in English and Bengali, [225] he was not a thorough scholar, [226] and most of his published works were compiled from lectures given around the world which were \"mainly delivered  [...] impromptu and with little preparation\" [226] His main work, Raja Yoga, consists of talks he delivered in New York

Born Narendra Nath Datta on January 12, 1863, in Calcutta, India, he was a charismatic orator, philosopher, and advocate of Indian culture and spirituality. Through his teachings and writings, Vivekananda sought to promote a sense of national pride and self-awareness among Indians, while also inspiring people worldwide to adopt a more spiritual and introspective approach to life.\n\n**Early Life (1863–1888)**\n\nVivekananda was born into a Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, the capital of British India. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta High Court, and his mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife. Vivekananda was one of nine siblings, and his childhood was marked by a strong interest in spirituality and a fascination with wandering ascetics and monks. He was also known for his mischievous and restless nature, which often led to difficulties with his parents.\n\n**Education**\n\nIn 1871, at the age of eight, Vivekananda enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, where he studied until his family moved to Raipur in 1877. After returning to Calcutta in 1879, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination. Vivekananda was an avid reader, with interests in philosophy, religion, history, social science, art, and literature. He was particularly drawn to Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, and the Mahabharata. He also studied Western logic, Western philosophy, and European history at the General Assembly's Institution (now known as the Scottish Church College).\n\n**Initial Spiritual Forays**\n\nIn 1880, Vivekananda joined Keshab Chandra Sen's Nava Vidhan, a breakaway faction of the Brahmo Samaj led by Keshab Chandra Sen and Debendranath Tagore. He became a member of a Freemasonry lodge and the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in his twenties. From 1881 to 1884, he was active in Sen's Band of Hope, which aimed to discourage youths from smoking and drinking.\n\n**Meeting Ramakrishna**\n\nIn 1881, Vivekananda first met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after his father's death in 1884. Ramakrishna was a mystic and a spiritual leader who taught Vivekananda the importance of devotion and selfless service.\n\n**Founding of Ramakrishna Math**\n\nAfter Ramakrishna's death, his devotees and admirers stopped supporting his disciples. Unpaid rent accumulated, and Narendra and the other disciples had to find a new place to live. Many returned home, adopting a Grihastha (family-oriented) way of life. Narendra decided to convert a dilapidated house at Baranagar into a new math (monastery) for the remaining disciples. Rent for the Baranagar Math was low, raised by \"holy begging\" (mādhukarī). The math became the first building of the Ramakrishna Math: the monastery of the monastic order of Ramakrishna.\n\n**Monastic Vows**\n\nIn December 1886, the mother of Baburam invited Narendra and his other brother monks to Antpur village. Narendra and the other aspiring monks accepted the invitation and went to Antpur to spend a few days. On the Christmas Eve of 1886, Narendra, aged 23, and eight other disciples took formal monastic vows at the Radha Gobinda Jiu temple. Narendranath took the name \"Swami Vivekananda.\"\n\n**Travels in India (1888–1893)**\n\nIn 1888, Narendra left the monastery as a Parivrâjaka—the Hindu religious life of a wandering monk, \"without fixed abode, without ties, independent and strangers wherever they go.\" His sole possessions were a kamandalu (water pot), staff, and his two favorite books: the Bhagavad Gita and The Imitation of Christ. Narendra traveled extensively in India for five years, visiting centers of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns. He developed sympathy for the suffering and poverty of the people and resolved to uplift the nation.\n\n**First Visit to the West (1893–1897)**\n\nVivekananda started his journey to the West on May 31, 1893, and visited several cities in Japan, China, and Canada en route to the United States, reaching Chicago on July 30, 1893. The \"Parliament of Religions\" took place in September 1893, where Vivekananda gave a brief speech representing India and Hinduism. He received a two-minute standing ovation from the crowd of seven thousand.\n\n**Lecture Tours in the UK and US**\n\nVivekananda's speech at the Parliament of Religions was a turning point in his career. He traveled extensively throughout the UK and US, lecturing on Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism. He established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California.\n\n**Back in India (1897–1899)**\n\nThe ship from Europe arrived in Colombo, British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), on January 15, 1897. Vivekananda received a warm welcome, and from there on, his journey to Calcutta was triumphant. He traveled from Colombo to Pamban, Rameswaram, Ramnad, Madurai, Kumbakonam, and Madras, delivering lectures to common people and rajas. During his train travels, people often sat on the rails to force the train to stop, so they could hear him.\n\n**Second Visit to the West and Final Years (1899–1902)**\n\nDespite declining health, Vivekananda left for the West for a second time in June 1899, accompanied by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. He established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn July 4, 1902, Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur Math, and meditated for three hours. He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar, and the philosophy of yoga to pupils. At 7:00 p.m., Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed. He died at 9:20 p.m. while meditating.\n\n**Teachings and Philosophy**\n\nVivekananda's teachings emphasized the importance of self-realization, selfless service, and the unity of all existence. He saw the ultimate goal of human life as the realization of the divine within oneself and the recognition of the unity of all existence.\n\n**Influence and Legacy**\n\nVivekananda was one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers in his contemporary India and the most successful and influential missionaries of Vedanta to the Western world. He was a key figure in the Indian independence movement and a leading exponent of Vedanta philosophy. His teachings and writings continue to inspire people worldwide to adopt a more spiritual and introspective approach to life.\n\n**Neo-Vedanta**\n\nVivekananda was one of the main representatives of Neo-Vedanta, a modern interpretation of selected aspects of Hinduism in line with Western esoteric traditions, especially Transcendentalism, New Thought, and Theosophy. His reinterpretation of Hinduism was very successful, creating a new understanding and appreciation of Hinduism within and outside India.\n\n**Indian Nationalism**\n\nIn the background of emerging nationalism in British-ruled India, Vivekananda crystallized the nationalistic ideal. He drew attention to the extent of poverty in the country and maintained that addressing such poverty was a prerequisite for national awakening. His nationalistic ideas influenced many Indian thinkers and leaders.\n\n**Name-Giving**\n\nIn September 2010, the then Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee approved in principle the Swami Vivekananda Values Education Project at a cost of ₹1 billion (US$12 million), with objectives including involving youth with competitions, essays, discussions, and study circles and publishing Vivekananda's works in a number of languages.\n\n**Celebrations**\n\nNational Youth Day in India is observed on Vivekananda's birthday (January 12). The day he delivered his speech at the Parliament of Religions (September 11) is observed as \"World Brotherhood Day.\" The 150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated in India and abroad.\n\n**Movies**\n\nIndian film director Utpal Sinha made a film, \"The Light: Swami Vivekananda,\" as a tribute for his 150th birth anniversary. Other Indian films about his life include \"Swamiji\" (1949), \"Swami Vivekananda\" (1955), \"Biriwar Vivekananda\" (1964), \"Life and Message of Swami Vivekananda\" (1964) documentary film, \"Swami Vivekananda\" (1998), and \"Swamiji\" (2012).\n\n**Works**\n\nAlthough Vivekananda was a powerful orator and writer in English and Bengali, he was not a thorough scholar, and most of his published works were compiled from lectures given around the world. His main work, \"Raja Yoga,\" consists of talks he delivered in New York.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Swami_Vivekananda\" following this

[89]\n\n\nTravels in India (1888–1893)\nIn 1888, Narendra left the monastery as a Parivrâjaka— the Hindu religious life of a wandering monk, \"without fixed abode, without ties, independent and strangers wherever they go\" [90] His sole possessions were a kamandalu (water pot), staff and his two favourite books: the Bhagavad Gita and The Imitation of Christ [91] Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns [92] [93] He developed sympathy for the suffering and poverty of the people, and resolved to uplift the nation [92] [94] Living primarily on bhiksha (alms), Narendra travelled on foot and by railway (with tickets bought by admirers) During his travels he met, and stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life: scholars, dewans, rajas, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, paraiyars (low-caste workers) and government officials [94] On 31 May 1893, Narendra left Bombay for Chicago with the name, as suggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri, \"Vivekananda\"–a conglomerate of the Sanskrit words: viveka and ānanda, meaning \"the bliss of discerning wisdom\" [95] [96]\n\n\nFirst visit to the West (1893–1897)\nVivekananda started his journey to the West on 31 May 1893 [97] and visited several cities in Japan (including Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama,

The Congress was an initiative of the Swedenborgian layman, and judge of the Illinois Supreme Court, Charles C Bonney, [101] [102] to gather all the religions of the world, and show \"the substantial unity of many religions in the good deeds of the religious life.\" [101] It was one of the more than 200 adjunct gatherings and congresses of the Chicago's World's Fair, [101] and was \"an avant-garde intellectual manifestation of  [...] cultic milieus, East and West,\" [103] with the Brahmo Samaj and the Theosophical Society being invited as representative of Hinduism [104]\n\n\nParliament of the World's Religions\nThe Parliament of the World's Religions opened on 11 September 1893 at the Art Institute of Chicago, as part of the World's Columbian Exposition [108] [109] [110] On this day, Vivekananda gave a brief speech representing India and Hinduism [111] He was initially nervous, bowed to Saraswati (the Hindu goddess of learning) and began his speech with \"Sisters and brothers of America!\" [112] [110] At these words, Vivekananda received a two-minute standing ovation from the crowd of seven thousand [113] According to Sailendra Nath Dhar, when silence was restored he began his address, greeting the youngest of the nations on behalf of \"the most ancient order of monks in the world, the Vedic order of sannyasins, a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance\" [114] [note 4] Vivekananda quoted two illustrative passages from the \"Shiva mahimna stotram\": \"As the different streams having their sources in different places all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord, the different paths which men take, through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee!\" and \"Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through paths that in the end lead to Me.\" [117] According to Sailendra Nath Dhar, \"it was only a short\nspeech, but it voiced the spirit of the Parliament.\" [117] [118]\n\n\nLecture tours in the UK and US\n\"I do not come\", said Swamiji on one occasion in America, \"to convert you to a new belief I want you to keep your own belief; I want to make the Methodist a better Methodist; the Presbyterian a better Presbyterian; the Unitarian a better Unitarian I want to teach you to live the truth, to reveal the light within your own soul.\" [124]\n\n\nBack in India (1897–1899)\nThe ship from Europe arrived in Colombo, British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) on 15 January 1897, [149] and Vivekananda received a warm welcome In Colombo, he gave his first public speech in the East From there on, his journey to Calcutta was triumphant Vivekananda travelled from Colombo to Pamban, Rameswaram, Ramnad, Madurai, Kumbakonam and Madras, delivering lectures Common people and rajas gave him an enthusiastic reception During his train travels, people often sat on the rails to force the train to stop, so they could hear him [149] From Madras (now Chennai), he continued his journey to Calcutta and Almora While in the West, Vivekananda spoke about India's great spiritual heritage; in India, he repeatedly addressed social issues: uplifting the people, eliminating the caste system, promoting science and industrialisation, addressing widespread poverty and ending colonial rule These lectures, published as Lectures from Colombo to Almora, demonstrate his nationalistic fervour and spiritual ideology [151]\n\n\nSecond visit to the West and final years (1899–1902)\nDespite declining health, Vivekananda left for the West for a second time in June 1899 [162] accompanied by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United States During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California [163] He then went to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900 [164] His lectures in Paris concerned the worship of the lingam and the authenticity of the Bhagavad Gita [163] Vivekananda then visited Brittany, Vienna, Istanbul, Athens and Egypt The French philosopher Jules Bois was his host for most of this period, until he returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900 [163]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 4 July 1902 (the day of his death), [167] Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur Math

Ramakrishna Math At 7:00 pm Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; [168] he died at 9:20 p.m while meditating [170] According to his disciples, Vivekananda attained mahasamādhi; [171] the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death [172] His disciples believed that the rupture was due to his brahmarandhra (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when he attained mahasamādhi Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy that he would not live forty years [173] He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre on the bank of the Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier [174]\n\n\nTeachings and philosophy\nShaivism/Tantra/Nath\n\n\nInfluence and legacy\nVivekananda was one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers in his contemporary India and the most successful and influential missionaries of Vedanta to the Western world [206] [207]\n\n\nNeo-Vedanta\nVivekananda was one of the main representatives of Neo-Vedanta, a modern interpretation of selected aspects of Hinduism in line with western esoteric traditions, especially Transcendentalism, New Thought and Theosophy [3]

of yoga, Transcendental Meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self-improvement in the West [208] Agehananda Bharati explained, \"...modern Hindus derive their knowledge of Hinduism from Vivekananda, directly or indirectly\" [209] Vivekananda espoused the idea that all sects within Hinduism (and all religions) are different paths to the same goal [210] However, this view has been criticised as an oversimplification of Hinduism [210]\n\n\nIndian nationalism\nIn the background of emerging nationalism in British-ruled India, Vivekananda crystallised the nationalistic ideal In the words of social reformer Charles Freer Andrews, \"The Swami's intrepid patriotism gave a new colour to the national movement throughout India More than any other single individual of that period Vivekananda had made his contribution to the new awakening of India\" [211] Vivekananda drew attention to the extent of poverty in the country, and maintained that addressing such poverty was a prerequisite for national awakening [212] His nationalistic ideas influenced many Indian thinkers and leaders Sri Aurobindo regarded Vivekananda as the one who awakened India spiritually [213] Mahatma Gandhi counted him among the few Hindu reformers \"who have maintained this Hindu religion in a state of splendor by cutting down the dead wood of tradition\" [214]\n\n\nName-giving\nIn September 2010, the then Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, who subsequently became President of India from 2012 to 2017, approved in principle the Swami Vivekananda Values Education Project at a cost of

from 2004 to 2006. The team was founded by James Galante, a garbage disposal mogul, who paid a $500,000 franchise fee to the league. Galante's son, A.J., was just 17 years old at the time and was named president and general manager of the team.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Danbury Trashers were founded as an expansion team in the United Hockey League (UHL) on April 1, 2004. James Galante, a successful businessman with a background in the waste management industry, saw an opportunity to bring professional hockey to Danbury, Connecticut. Galante's vision was to create a team that would not only compete on the ice but also become a staple in the community. He invested heavily in the team, hiring experienced coaches and players, and building a state-of-the-art facility, the Danbury Ice Arena.\n\n**Founding**\n\nThe Trashers' first season began with the team playing around .500 hockey. However, a quarter of the way through the 2004-05 season, they went on a seven-game unbeaten streak that moved them into first place in the Eastern Division. This streak was part of a nine-game stretch without a regulation loss, which lifted the Trashers into a tie for first place in the league. The team's success on the ice was mirrored by their popularity in the community, with fans packing the Danbury Ice Arena to watch the Trashers play.\n\n**UHL Seasons (2004-2006)**\n\nDuring their inaugural season, the Trashers were known for their physical play and willingness to engage in fights. In a game against the Kalamazoo Wings on December 1, 2004, the Trashers' Bryan Ndur was involved in a brawl that resulted in a 20-game suspension for him. James Galante, the team's owner, was also fined by the UHL for leaving the owner's box to voice his opinion on the officiating. The incident sparked a heated debate about the role of fighting in hockey and the need for stricter penalties.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the team, the Trashers continued to find success on the ice. In a game against the Adirondack Frostbite on February 23, 2005, the Trashers' Chad Wagner was involved in a brawl that resulted in a season-ending suspension for him. The team's head coach, Stirling, was also suspended for three games for failing to control his players.\n\nThe Trashers' struggles with discipline continued throughout the season, with several players receiving suspensions for their actions on the ice. However, the team's success on the ice was not affected, and they went on to win the Eastern Division title with 95 points.\n\n**Controversy and End of the Trashers**\n\nIn June 2006, James Galante was charged with 72 various charges, including racketeering and wire fraud. The charges were related to the Trashers' salary cap circumvention, which resulted in the team exceeding the UHL's $275,000 annual salary cap by an estimated $475,000.

were founded as an expansion team in the United Hockey League (UHL) on April 1, 2004, by James Galante, a garbage disposal mogul, who paid a $500,000 franchise fee to the league [1] [2] Galante had

games He also wanted to give A.J experience in how to manage a professional sports franchise, naming him president and General Manager [1] [3] A.J was a 17-year-old high school student at the time and according to UHL commissioner Richard Brosal, some around the league thought it was an April Fools' Day joke After graduating high school, Galante attended Manhattanville College while maintaining his organizational duties [1]\n\n\nUHL seasons (2004–2006)\nThe Trashers first season began with the team playing around .500 hockey Then a quarter of the way through the 2004–05 season they went on a seven-game unbeaten streak that moved them into first place in the Eastern Division [6] [7] The streak was part of nine consecutive games without a regulation loss This lifted the Trashers into a tie for first place in the league [8] During the winning streak one of two brawls of the season occurred In a game against the Kalamazoo Wings on December 1, Wingfield attempted to instigate a fight after an altercation with a Wings player The player refused to fight, but as Wingfield skated away the player grabbed Wingfield's jersey and pulled him back over an outstretched leg Wingfield's skate caught on the ice as he fell backwards breaking his ankle The play incited a brawl, in which Ndur fought with two players, attempted to kick a linesman, and charged the Wings bench, before the officials were able to subdue him [2] His actions led to a 20-game suspension by the league, while the Kalamazoo player received five games [9] Upset with the officiating, James Galante went down to ice level to voice his opinion Galante entered the ice via the penalty box where he got into a shouting match with a linesman and allegedly punched him [2] [10] For his actions Galante was charged with misdemeanor assault and fined by the UHL for leaving the owner's box The UHL stated that because of the disturbances on the ice they could not determine what actually happened The linesman was suspended for five games for his part in the altercation [10] He later asked that the assault charges against Galante be dropped After this request, prosecutors still intended to pursue the charges, but eventually dropped them citing a lack of evidence [2] [9] After the brawl, the Trashers went 8–2–0 in their next 10 games [6] A second brawl occurred months later in a game versus the Adirondack Frostbite At the end of the brawl, the Trashers' Chad Wagner was being removed from the ice by the linesmen when he broke away, and attacked the Adirondack bench, grabbing their head coach, Marc Potvin Compounding the issue, two other Trashers players left the penalty box and skated towards the bench A third player sucker punched an opponent, breaking his nose For his part in the brawl, Wagner was banned from the UHL while the two players, who left the penalty box, received 5 and 10 game suspensions, respectively, and the third player was suspended for the remainder of the season and playoffs Head coach Stirling was also suspended three games for not being able to control his players It was the sixteenth time the league had suspended a Trashers player [11] [12] Danbury again found success after the brawl going 8–3–0 in their next 11 games [6]\nOn February 23, 2005, the Trashers again hosted the Adirondack Frostbite World Wrestling Entertainment superstar John Cena was on hand for what resembled more of a WWE event than a hockey game The teams combined for 106 penalty minutes in the first period and 6 game-misconducts were issued in the first 10 minutes of the game The Trashers would go on to win the game 4–2 [13]\nThe Trashers struggled towards the end of the season having both a four and three game losing streak and posting a 2–6–2 record [6] Danbury finished the regular season with 95 points, second place in the Eastern Division, nine points behind Adirondack [14] They also set a UHL record PIMs at 2,776 [15] In the first round of the playoffs, they faced off against the Frostbite, winning the series in six games [16] In the second round, Danbury faced the Muskegon Fury, who led the Central Division with 111 points [14] The Trashers were eliminated in five games by Muskegon, who went on to win the league championship, the Colonial Cup [16] At season's end the Trashers were announced the winners of the UHL's Merchandiser of the Year Award [17]\n\n\nControversy and end of the Trashers\nIn June 2006, James Galante was charged with 72 various charges including racketeering [31] [32] One of the charges that pertained directly to the Trashers was wire fraud, which resulted from the interstate faxing of fraudulent salary cap documents [2] The Trashers had circumvented the UHLs $275,000 annual salary cap by giving players or their wives no-show positions within one of the disposal companies or giving them housing allowance checks for sums which had already been paid [2] [32] Estimates were that the Trashers had exceeded the salary cap by $475,000 making the total payroll closer to $750,000 [32] For his part in aiding with violating the salary cap, former head coach Stirling was also charged with wire fraud He pleaded guilty and was given five years probation [33] Galante pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to violate the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), one count of conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service, and one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud He was sentenced to 87 months of imprisonment and had to forfeit his ownership interests in 25 trash hauling companies, a Southbury residence, six racing cars, a trailer used to haul them, and $448,153.10 in cash seized from his business office and home [32]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe story of James Galante and the Danbury Trashers was covered in the 2021 Netflix documentary Untold: Crimes & Penalties It will be the subject of a feature film, titled The Trashers, from director Cooper Raiff, with David Harbour and Cooper Hoffman set to star as James and AJ Galante [36] [37] [38]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Bahrain", "content": "\nEtymology\nBahrain is the dual form of Arabic word Bahr (meaning literally \"sea\"), so al-Bahrayn originally means literally \"the two seas\" However, the name has been lexicalised as a feminine proper noun and does not follow the grammatical rules for duals; thus its form is always Bahrayn and never Bahrān, the expected nominative form Endings are added to the word with no changes, as in the name of the national anthem Bahraynunā (\"our Bahrain\") or the demonym Bahraynī The medieval grammarian al-Jawahari commented on this, saying that the more formally correct term Bahrī (lit \"belonging to the sea\") would have been misunderstood and so was unused [25]\n\n\nHistory\nBahrain was home to Dilmun, an important Bronze Age trade centre linking Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley [33] Bahrain was later ruled by the Assyrians and Babylonians [34]\n\n\nAntiquity\nBahrain was home to Dilmun, an important Bronze Age trade centre linking Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley [33] Bahrain was later ruled by the Assyrians and Babylonians [34]\n\n\nArrival of Islam\nMuhammad's first interaction with the people of Bahrain was the Al Kudr Invasion Muhammad ordered a surprise attack on the Banu Salim tribe for plotting to attack Medina He had received news that some tribes were assembling an army in Bahrain and preparing to attack the mainland, but the tribesmen retreated when they learned Muhammad was leading an army to do battle with them [57] [58]\n\nMiddle Ages\nIn the year 899, the Qarmatians, a millenarian Ismaili Muslim sect, seized Bahrain, seeking to create a utopian society based on reason and redistribution of property among initiates Thereafter, the Qarmatians demanded tribute from the caliph in Baghdad, and in 930 sacked Mecca, bringing the sacred Black Stone back to their base in Ahsa, in medieval Bahrain, for ransom According to historian Al-Juwayni, the stone was returned 22 years later in 951 under mysterious circumstances Wrapped in a sack, it was thrown into the Great Mosque of Kufa in Iraq, accompanied by a note saying \"By command we took it, and by command, we have brought it back.\" The theft and removal of the Black Stone caused it to break into seven pieces [63] [64] [65]\n\n\nPortuguese and early modern era\nIn 1521, the Portuguese Empire allied with Hormuz and seized Bahrain from the Jabrid ruler Muqrin ibn Zamil, who was killed during the takeover Portuguese rule lasted for around 80 years, during which time they depended mainly on Sunni Persian governors [30] The Portuguese were expelled from the islands in 1602 by Abbas I of the Safavid Iran, [70] which gave impetus to Shia Islam [71] For the next two centuries, Persian rulers retained control of the archipelago, interrupted by the 1717 and 1738 invasions of the Ibadis of Oman [72] During most of this period, they resorted to governing Bahrain indirectly, either through the city of Bushehr or through immigrant Sunni Arab clans The latter were tribes returning to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf from Persian territories in the north who were known as Huwala [30] [73] [74] In 1753, the Huwala clan of Nasr Al-Madhkur invaded Bahrain on behalf of the Iranian Zand leader Karim Khan Zand and restored direct Iranian rule [74]\n\n\n19th century and later\nIn the early 19th century, Bahrain was invaded by both the Omanis and the Al Sauds In 1802 it was governed by a 12-year-old child, when the Omani ruler Sayyid Sultan installed his son, Salim, as governor in the Arad Fort [83] In 1816, the British political resident in the Persian Gulf, William Bruce, received a letter from the Sheikh of Bahrain who was concerned about a rumour that Britain would support an attack on the island by the Imam of Muscat He sailed to Bahrain to reassure the Sheikh that this was not the case and drew up an informal agreement assuring the Sheikh that Britain would remain a neutral party [84]\n\n\nIndependence\nOn 15 August 1971, [104] [105] though the Shah of Iran was claiming historical sovereignty over Bahrain, he accepted a referendum held by the United Nations and eventually Bahrain declared independence and signed a new treaty of friendship with the United Kingdom Bahrain joined the United Nations and the Arab League later in the year [106] The oil boom of the 1970s benefited Bahrain greatly, although the subsequent downturn hurt the economy The country had already begun diversification of its economy and benefited further from the Lebanese Civil War in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bahrain replaced Beirut as the Middle East's financial hub after Lebanon's large banking sector was driven out of the country by the war [107]\n\n\n2011 Bahraini protests\nInspired by the regional Arab Spring, Bahrain's Shia majority started large protests against its Sunni rulers in early 2011 [120] [121] The government initially allowed protests following a pre-dawn raid on protesters camped in Pearl Roundabout [122] A month later it requested security assistance from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries and declared a three-month state of emergency [123] The government then launched a crackdown on the opposition that included conducting thousands of arrests and systematic torture [124] [125] [126] Almost daily clashes between protesters and security forces led to dozens of deaths [127] Protests, sometimes staged by opposition parties, were ongoing [128] [129] [130] More than 80 civilians and 13 policemen have been killed as of March 2014 [update] [131]\nAccording to Physicians for Human Rights, 34 of these deaths were related to government usage of tear gas originally manufactured by U.S.-based Federal Laboratories [132] [133] The lack of coverage by Arab media in the Persian Gulf, [134] as compared to other Arab Spring uprisings, has sparked several controversies Iran is alleged by United States and others to have a hand in the arming of Bahraini militants [135]\n\n\nPost-Arab Spring years\nThe Saudi-led Intervention of Bahrain issued swift suppression of widespread government protests through military assistance from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nGeography\nBahrain is a generally flat and arid archipelago in the Persian Gulf It consists of a low desert plain rising gently to a low central escarpment with the highest point the 134 m (440 ft) Mountain of Smoke (Jabal ad Dukhan) [139] [140] Bahrain had a total area of 665 km2 (257 sq mi) but due to land reclamation, the area increased to 780 km2 (300 sq mi) [140]\n\n\nClimate\nThe Zagros Mountains across the Persian Gulf in Iran cause low-level winds to be directed toward Bahrain Dust storms from Iraq and Saudi Arabia transported by northwesterly winds, locally called shamal wind, cause reduced visibility in the months of June and July [147]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nMore than 330 species of birds were recorded in the Bahrain archipelago, 26 species of which breed in the country Millions of migratory birds pass through the Arabian Gulf region in the winter and autumn months [149] One globally endangered species, Chlamydotis undulata, is a regular migrant in the autumn [149] The many islands and shallow seas of Bahrain are globally important for the breeding of the Socotra cormorant; up to 100,000 pairs of these birds were recorded over the Hawar Islands [149] Bahrain's national bird is the bulbul while its national animal is the Arabian oryx And the national flower of Bahrain is the beloved Deena.\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nBahrain under the Al Khalifa is a semi-constitutional monarchy headed by the king, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa King Hamad enjoys wide executive powers which include appointing the prime minister and his ministers, commanding the army, chairing the Higher Judicial Council, appointing the parliament's upper house and dissolving its elected lower house [152] The head of government is the prime minister In 2010, about half of the cabinet was composed of the Al Khalifa family [153]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe kingdom has a small but professional and well-equipped military called the Bahrain Defence Force (BDF), numbering around 8,200 personnel, including 6,000 in the Royal Bahraini Army, 700 in the Royal Bahraini Naval Force, and 1,500 in the Royal Bahraini Air Force The BDF command structure also includes the Bahrain Royal Guard, which is the size of one battalion and has its own armored vehicles and artillery The Bahrain National Guard is separate from the BDF, though it is tasked with assisting it in defense from external threats, and it has about 2,000 personnel [168] [169] The supreme commander of the Bahraini military is King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and the deputy supreme commander is the Crown Prince, Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa [170] [171] The Commander-in-Chief of the BDF has been Field Marshal Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa since 2008 [172]\n\n\nForeign relations\nBahrain has established bilateral relations with 190 countries worldwide [186] As of 2012 [update], Bahrain maintains a network of 25 embassies, three consulates and four permanent missions to the Arab League, United Nations and European Union respectively [187] Bahrain also hosts 36 embassies The United States designated Bahrain a major non-NATO ally in 2001 [188] Bahrain plays a modest, moderating role in regional politics and adheres to the views of the Arab League on Middle East peace and Palestinian rights by supporting the two state solution [189] Bahrain is also one of the founding members of the Gulf Cooperation Council [190] Relations with Iran tend to be tense as a result of a failed coup in 1981 which Bahrain blames Iran for and occasional claims of Iranian sovereignty over Bahrain by ultra-conservative elements in the Iranian public [191] [192] In 2016, following the storming of the Saudi embassy in Tehran, both Saudi Arabia and Bahrain cut diplomatic relations with Iran Bahrain and Israel established bilateral relations in 2020 under the Bahrain–Israel normalization agreement [193]\n\n\nHuman rights\nThe period between 1975 and 1999, known as the \"State Security Law Era\", saw wide range of human rights violations including arbitrary arrests, detention without trial, torture and forced exile [195] [196] After Emir (now King) Hamad Al Khalifa succeeded his father Isa Al Khalifa in 1999, he introduced wide reforms and human rights improved significantly [197] These moves were described by Amnesty International as representing a \"historic period of human rights\" [113]\n\n\nWomen's rights\nWomen in Bahrain acquired voting rights and the right to stand in national elections in the 2002 election [226] However, no women were elected to office in that year's polls [227] In response to the failure of women candidates, six were appointed to the Shura Council, which also includes representatives of the Kingdom's indigenous Jewish and Christian communities [228] Nada Haffadh became the country's first female cabinet minister on her appointment as Minister of Health in 2004 The quasi-governmental women's group, the Supreme Council for Women, trained female candidates to take part in the 2006 general election When Bahrain was elected to head the United Nations General Assembly in 2006 it appointed lawyer and women's rights activist Haya bint Rashid Al Khalifa President of the United Nations General Assembly, only the third woman in history to head the world body [229] Female activist Ghada Jamsheer said \"The government used women's rights as a decorative tool on the international level.\" She referred to the reforms as \"artificial and marginal\" and accused the government of \"hinder [ing] non-governmental women societies\" [165]\n\n\nMedia\nThe music style in Bahrain is similar to that of its neighbours The Khaliji style of music, which is folk music, is popular in the country The sawt style of music, which involves a complex form of urban music, performed by an Oud (plucked lute), a violin and mirwas (a drum), is also popular in Bahrain [343] Ali Bahar was one of the most famous singers in Bahrain He performed his music with his Band Al-Ekhwa (The Brothers) Bahrain was also the site of the first recording studio amongst the Persian Gulf states [343]\n\n\nGovernorates\nBahrain is divided into four governorates: [237]\n\n\nEconomy\nAccording to a January 2006 report by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, Bahrain has the fastest-growing economy in the Arab world [238] Bahrain also has the freest economy in the Middle East and is twelfth-freest overall in the world based on the 2011 Index of Economic Freedom, published by The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal [239]\n\n\nTourism\nAs a tourist destination, Bahrain received over eleven million visitors in 2019 [257] Most of these are from the surrounding Arab states, although an increasing number hail from outside the region due to growing awareness of the kingdom's heritage and partly due to its higher profile as a result of the Bahrain Grand Prix.\n\n\nValue Added Tax (VAT)\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain introduced the Value Added Tax with effect from 1 January 2019 [265] This is a multipoint tax on the sale of goods and services in Kingdom of Bahrain This has been managed by the government through the national bureau of revenue The ultimate burden of this tax is passed on the consumer To start with the maximum rate of VAT was 5% which is increased to 10% with effect from 1 January 2022 [266] The government of Bahrain is assuring compliance through high penalties on defaults and tighter audits This first of its kind VAT has invited qualified chartered accounting firms mainly from India to advise on VAT matters Firms like KPMG, KeyPoint, Assure Consulting and APMH have set up offices looking at the need for consulting in this domain of VAT.\n\n\nInfrastructure\nBahrain has one main international airport, the Bahrain International Airport (BAH) which is located on the island of Muharraq, in the north-east The airport handled almost 100,000 flights and more than 9.5 million passengers in 2019 [267] On January 28, 2021, Bahrain opened its new airport terminal as part of its economic vision 2030 [268] The new airport terminal is capable of handling 14 million passengers and is a big boost to the country's aviation sector [268] Bahrain's national carrier, Gulf Air operates and bases itself in the BIA.\n\n\nTelecommunications\nThe telecommunications sector in Bahrain officially started in 1981 with the establishment of Bahrain's first telecommunications company, Batelco and until 2004, it monopolised the sector In 1981, there were more than 45,000 telephones in use in the country By 1999, Batelco had more than 100,000 mobile contracts [276] In 2002, under pressure from international bodies, Bahrain implemented its telecommunications law which included the establishment of an independent Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) [276] In 2004, Zain (a rebranded version of MTC Vodafone) started operations in Bahrain and in 2010 VIVA (owned by STC Group) became the third company to provide mobile services [277]\n\n\nScience and technology\nThe Bahraini Economic Vision 2030 published in 2008 does not indicate how the stated goal of shifting from an economy built on oil wealth to a productive, globally competitive economy will be attained Bahrain has already diversified its exports to some extent, out of necessity It has the smallest hydrocarbon reserves of any Arabian Gulf state, producing 48,000 barrels per day from its one onshore field [282] The bulk of the country's revenue comes from its share in the offshore field administered by Saudi Arabia The gas reserve in Bahrain is expected to last for less than 27 years, leaving the country with few sources of capital to pursue the development of new industries Investment in research and development remained very low in 2013 [283]\n\n\nPolicy framework\nThe Bahraini Economic Vision 2030 published in 2008

development of new industries Investment in research and development remained very low in 2013 [283]\n\n\nNew infrastructure for science and education\nBahrain hopes to build a science culture within the kingdom and to encourage technological innovation, among other goals In 2013, the Bahrain Science Centre was launched as an interactive educational facility targeting 6- to 18-year-olds The topics covered by current exhibitions include junior engineering, human health, the five senses, Earth sciences and biodiversity [283]\n\n\nInvestment in education and research\nIn 2012, the government devoted 2.6% of GDP to education, one of the lowest ratios in the Arab world This ratio was on a par with investment in education in Lebanon and higher only than that in Qatar (2.4% in 2008) and Sudan (2.2% in 2009) [283] Bahrain was ranked 72nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [284]\nBahrain invests little in research and development In 2009 and 2013, this investment reportedly amounted to 0.04% of GDP, although the data were incomplete, covering only the higher education sector The lack of comprehensive data on research and development poses a challenge for policymakers, as data inform evidence-based policymaking [283]\n\n\nTrends in research output\nIn 2014, Bahraini scientists published 155 articles in internationally catalogued journals, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded) This corresponds to 15 articles per million inhabitants, compared to a global average of 176 per million inhabitants in 2013 Scientific output has risen slowly from 93 articles in 2005 and remains modest By 2014, only Mauritania and Palestine had a smaller output in this database among Arab states [285] [283]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn 2010, Bahrain's population grew to 1.2 million, of which 568,399 were Bahraini and 666,172 were non-nationals [286] It had risen from 1.05 million (517,368 non-nationals) in 2007, the year when Bahrain's population crossed the one million mark [287] Though a majority of the population is Middle Eastern, a sizeable number of people from South Asia live in the country In 2008, approximately 290,000 Indian nationals lived in Bahrain, making them the single largest expatriate community in the country, the majority of which hail from the south Indian state of Kerala [288] [289] Bahrain is the fourth most densely populated sovereign state in the world with a population density of 1,646 people per km2 in 2010 [286] The only sovereign states with larger population densities are city states Much of this population is concentrated in the north of the country with the Southern Governorate being the least densely populated part [286] The north of the country is so urbanized that it is considered by some to be one large metropolitan area [290]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nBahraini people are ethnically diverse Shia Bahrainis are divided into two main ethnic groups: Baharna and Ajam The Shia Bahrainis are Baharna (Arab), and the Ajam are Persian Shias Shia Persians form large communities in Manama and Muharraq A small minority of Shia Bahrainis are ethnic Hasawis from Al-Hasa.\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Bahrain (2020) by Pew Research [4]\n\n\nLanguages\nArabic is the official language of Bahrain, though English is widely used [308] Bahrani Arabic is the most widely spoken dialect of the Arabic language, though it differs widely from standard Arabic, like all Arabic dialects Arabic plays an important role in political life, as, according to article 57 (c) of Bahrain's constitution, an MP must be fluent in Arabic to stand for parliament [309] In addition, Balochi is the second largest and widely spoken language in Bahrain The Baloch are fluent in Arabic and Balochi Among the Bahraini and non-Bahraini population, many people speak Persian, the official language of Iran, or Urdu, an official language in Pakistan and a regional language in India [308] Nepali is also widely spoken in the Nepalese workers and Gurkha Soldiers community Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Bangla and Hindi are spoken among significant Indian communities [308] All commercial institutions and road signs are bilingual, displaying both English and Arabic [310]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 14 [311] Education is free for Bahraini citizens in government schools, with the Bahraini Ministry of Education providing free textbooks Coeducation is not used in government schools, with boys and girls segregated into separate schools [312]\n\n\nHealth\nBahrain has a universal health care system, dating back to 1960 [319] Government-provided health care is free to Bahraini citizens and heavily subsidised for non-Bahrainis Healthcare expenditure accounted for 4.5% of Bahrain's GDP, according to the World Health Organization Bahraini physicians and nurses form a majority of the country's workforce in the health sector, unlike neighbouring Gulf states [320] The first hospital in Bahrain was the American Mission Hospital, which opened in 1893 as a dispensary [321] The first public hospital, and also tertiary hospital, to open in Bahrain was the Salmaniya Medical Complex, in the Salmaniya district of Manama, in 1957 [322] Private hospitals are also present throughout the country, such as the International Hospital of Bahrain.\n\n\nCulture\nIslam is the main religion, and Bahrainis are known for their tolerance towards the practice of other faiths [329] Intermarriages between Bahrainis and expatriates are not uncommon—there are many Filipino Bahrainis like Filipino child actress Mona Marbella Al-Alawi [330]\n\n\nArt\nThe modern art movement in the country officially emerged in the 1950s, culminating in the establishment of an art society Expressionism and surrealism, as well as calligraphic art are the popular forms of art in the country Abstract expressionism has gained popularity in recent decades [334] Pottery-making and textile-weaving are also popular products that were widely made in Bahraini villages [334] Arabic calligraphy grew in popularity as the Bahraini government was an active patron in Islamic art, culminating in the establishment of an Islamic museum, Beit Al Quran [334] The Bahrain national museum houses a permanent contemporary art exhibition [335] The annual Spring of Culture [336] festival run by the Bahrain Authority for Culture and Antiquities [337] has become a popular event promoting performance arts in the Kingdom The architecture of Bahrain is similar to that of its neighbours in

"article": "Bahrain\n================\n\n### Introduction\n\nBahrain, officially known as the Kingdom of Bahrain, is a small island country located in the Persian Gulf. It is the third-largest country in the Arabian Peninsula and is known for its rich history, cultural heritage, and stunning natural beauty. With a population of over 1.2 million people, Bahrain is a diverse and vibrant nation that has a unique blend of traditional and modern culture.\n\n### Etymology\n\nBahrain is the dual form of the Arabic word \"Bahr,\" which means \"sea.\" The name originally means \"the two seas,\" but it has been lexicalized as a feminine proper noun and does not follow the grammatical rules for duals. The name has been used to refer to the country since ancient times, and it is believed to have been derived from the name of the sea that surrounds the island.\n\n### History\n\nBahrain has a long and rich history that dates back to the Bronze Age. It was an important center of trade and commerce, linking Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley. The island was later ruled by the Assyrians and Babylonians, and it was also a major center of the ancient Dilmun civilization. In the 7th century, Bahrain was conquered by the Arabs, who introduced Islam to the island and established a thriving Islamic culture.\n\n### Antiquity\n\nBahrain was home to the important Dilmun civilization, which was a major center of trade and commerce in the ancient world. The Dilmun civilization was known for its sophisticated culture, which was characterized by its use of advanced irrigation systems and its development of a complex system of writing. The island was also an important center of the worship of the Mesopotamian god Enki, who was revered as the god of wisdom and magic.\n\n### Arrival of Islam\n\nMuhammad's first interaction with the people of Bahrain was the Al Kudr Invasion, in which he ordered a surprise attack on the Banu Salim tribe for plotting to attack Medina. He had received news that some tribes were assembling an army in Bahrain and preparing to attack the mainland, but the tribesmen retreated when they learned Muhammad was leading an army to do battle with them.\n\n### Middle Ages\n\nIn the year 899, the Qarmatians, a millenarian Ismaili Muslim sect, seized Bahrain, seeking to create a utopian society based on reason and redistribution of property among initiates. Thereafter, the Qarmatians demanded tribute from the caliph in Baghdad, and in 930 sacked Mecca, bringing the sacred Black Stone back to their base in Ahsa, in medieval Bahrain, for ransom. According to historian Al-Juwayni, the stone was returned 22 years later in 951 under mysterious circumstances.\n\n### Portuguese and early modern era\n\nIn 1521, the Portuguese Empire allied with Hormuz and seized Bahrain from the Jabrid ruler Muqrin ibn Zamil, who was killed during the takeover. Portuguese rule lasted for around 80 years, during which time they depended mainly on Sunni Persian governors. The Portuguese were expelled from the islands in 1602 by Abbas I of the Safavid Iran, which gave impetus to Shia Islam. For the next two centuries, Persian rulers retained control of the archipelago, interrupted by the 1717 and 1738 invasions of the Ibadis of Oman.\n\n### 19th century and later\n\nIn the early 19th century, Bahrain was invaded by both the Omanis and the Al Sauds. In 1802 it was governed by a 12-year-old child, when the Omani ruler Sayyid Sultan installed his son, Salim, as governor in the Arad Fort. In 1816, the British political resident in the Persian Gulf, William Bruce, received a letter from the Sheikh of Bahrain who was concerned about a rumour that Britain would support an attack on the island by the Imam of Muscat. He sailed to Bahrain to reassure the Sheikh that this was not the case and drew up an informal agreement assuring the Sheikh that Britain would remain a neutral party.\n\n### Independence\n\nOn 15 August 1971, Bahrain declared independence and signed a new treaty of friendship with the United Kingdom. Bahrain joined the United Nations and the Arab League later in the year. The oil boom of the 1970s benefited Bahrain greatly, although the subsequent downturn hurt the economy. The country had already begun diversification of its economy and benefited further from the Lebanese Civil War in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bahrain replaced Beirut as the Middle East's financial hub after Lebanon's large banking sector was driven out of the country by the war.\n\n### 2011 Bahraini protests\n\nInspired by the regional Arab Spring, Bahrain's Shia majority started large protests against its Sunni rulers in early 2011. The government initially allowed protests following a pre-dawn raid on protesters camped in Pearl Roundabout. A month later it requested security assistance from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries and declared a three-month state of emergency. The government then launched a crackdown on the opposition that included conducting thousands of arrests and systematic torture. Almost daily clashes between protesters and security forces led to dozens of deaths.\n\n### Geography\n\nBahrain is a generally flat and arid archipelago in the Persian Gulf. It consists of a low desert plain rising gently to a low central escarpment with the highest point the 134m Mountain of Smoke (Jabal ad Dukhan). Bahrain had a total area of 665km2 but due to land reclamation, the area increased to 780km2.\n\n### Climate\n\nThe Zagros Mountains across the Persian Gulf in Iran cause low-level winds to be directed toward Bahrain. Dust storms from Iraq and Saudi Arabia transported by northwesterly winds, locally called shamal wind, cause reduced visibility in the months of June and July.\n\n### Biodiversity\n\nMore than 330 species of birds were recorded in the Bahrain archipelago, 26 species of which breed in the country. Millions of migratory birds pass through the Arabian Gulf region in the winter and autumn months. One globally endangered species, Chlamydotis undulata, is a regular migrant in the autumn. The many islands and shallow seas of Bahrain are globally important for the breeding of the Socotra cormorant; up to 100,000 pairs of these birds were recorded over the Hawar Islands.\n\n### Government and politics\n\nBahrain under the Al Khalifa is a semi-constitutional monarchy headed by the king, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. King Hamad enjoys wide executive powers which include appointing the prime minister and his ministers, commanding the army, chairing the Higher Judicial Council, appointing the parliament's upper house and dissolving its elected lower house.\n\n### Military\n\nThe kingdom has a small but professional and well-equipped military called the Bahrain Defence Force (BDF), numbering around 8,200 personnel, including 6,000 in the Royal Bahraini Army, 700 in the Royal Bahraini Naval Force, and 1,500 in the Royal Bahraini Air Force.\n\n### Foreign relations\n\nBahrain has established bilateral relations with 190 countries worldwide. As of 2012, Bahrain maintains a network of 25 embassies, three consulates and four permanent missions to the Arab League, United Nations and European Union respectively. Bahrain also hosts 36 embassies.\n\n### Human rights\n\nThe period between 1975 and 1999, known as the \"State Security Law Era\", saw wide range of human rights violations including arbitrary arrests, detention without trial, torture and forced exile. After Emir (now King) Hamad Al Khalifa succeeded his father Isa Al Khalifa in 1999, he introduced wide reforms and human rights improved significantly. These moves were described by Amnesty International as representing a \"historic period of human rights\".\n\n### Women's rights\n\nWomen in Bahrain acquired voting rights and the right to stand in national elections in the 2002 election. However, no women were elected to office in that year's polls. In response to the failure of women candidates, six were appointed to the Shura Council, which also includes representatives of the Kingdom's indigenous Jewish and Christian communities. Nada Haffadh became the country's first female cabinet minister on her appointment as Minister of Health in 2004.\n\n### Media\n\nThe music style in Bahrain is similar to that of its neighbours. The Khaliji style of music, which is folk music, is popular in the country. The sawt style of music, which involves a complex form of urban music, performed by an Oud (plucked lute), a violin and mirwas (a drum), is also popular in Bahrain. Ali Bahar was one of the most famous singers in Bahrain. He performed his music with his Band Al-Ekhwa (The Brothers). Bahrain was also the site of the first recording studio amongst the Persian Gulf states.\n\n### Entertainment\n\nWith regards to cultural and tourism activities, the Ministry of Culture organizes a number of annual festivals such as the Spring of Culture in March and April, the Bahrain Summer Festival and Ta'a Al-Shabab from August to September, and the Bahrain International Music Festival in October which features musical and theatrical performances, lectures, and much more.\n\n### Sports\n\nBahrain is the first nation other than United States of America to host International Mixed Martial Arts Federation World Championships of Amateur MMA in partnership with Brave Combat Federation. Bahrain have recorded an influx in global athletes visiting the nation for Mixed Martial Arts training during 2017. Brave Combat Federation is a Bahrain-based Mixed Martial Arts promotion that has hosted events in 30 nations which is a record for hosting events in most number of nations by an MMA promotion.\n\n### See also\n\n* History of Bahrain\n* Culture of Bahrain\n* Economy of Bahrain\n* Geography of Bahrain\n* Politics of Bahrain\n* Military of Bahrain\n* Foreign relations of Bahrain\n* Human rights in Bahrain\n* Women in Bahrain\n\n### References\n\n* \"Bahrain\".

is always Bahrayn and never Bahrān, the expected nominative form Endings are added to the word with no changes, as in the name of the national anthem Bahraynunā (\"our Bahrain\") or the demonym Bahraynī The medieval grammarian al-Jawahari commented on this, saying that the more formally correct term Bahrī (lit \"belonging to the sea\") would have been misunderstood and so was unused

accompanied by a note saying \"By command we took it, and by command, we have brought it back.\" The theft and removal of the Black Stone caused it to break into seven pieces [63] [64] [65]\n\n\nPortuguese and early modern era\nIn 1521, the Portuguese Empire allied with Hormuz and seized Bahrain from the Jabrid ruler Muqrin ibn Zamil, who was killed during the takeover Portuguese rule lasted for around 80 years, during which time they depended mainly on Sunni Persian governors [30] The Portuguese were expelled from the islands in 1602 by Abbas I of the Safavid Iran, [70] which gave impetus to Shia Islam [71] For the next two centuries, Persian rulers retained control of the archipelago, interrupted by the 1717 and 1738 invasions of the Ibadis of Oman [72] During most of this period, they resorted to governing Bahrain indirectly, either through the city of Bushehr or through immigrant Sunni Arab clans The latter were tribes returning to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf from Persian territories in the north who were known as Huwala [30] [73] [74] In 1753, the Huwala clan of Nasr Al-Madhkur invaded Bahrain on behalf of the Iranian Zand leader Karim Khan Zand and restored direct Iranian rule [74]\n\n\n19th century and later\nIn the early 19th century, Bahrain was invaded by both the Omanis and the Al Sauds In 1802 it was governed by a 12-year-old child, when

[129] [130] More than 80 civilians and 13 policemen have been killed as of March 2014 [update] [131]\nAccording to Physicians for Human Rights, 34 of these deaths were related to government usage of tear gas originally manufactured by U.S.-based Federal Laboratories [132] [133] The lack of coverage by Arab media in the Persian Gulf, [134] as compared to other Arab Spring uprisings, has sparked several controversies Iran is alleged by United States and others to have a hand in the arming of Bahraini militants [135]\n\n\nPost-Arab Spring years\nThe Saudi-led Intervention of Bahrain issued swift suppression of widespread government protests through military assistance from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\nGeography\nBahrain is a generally flat and arid archipelago in the Persian Gulf It consists of a low desert plain rising gently to a low central escarpment with the highest point the 134 m (440 ft) Mountain of Smoke (Jabal ad Dukhan) [139] [140] Bahrain had a total

hosts 36 embassies The United States designated Bahrain a major non-NATO ally in 2001 [188] Bahrain plays a modest, moderating role in regional politics and adheres to the views of the Arab League on Middle East peace and Palestinian rights by supporting the two state solution [189] Bahrain is also one of the founding members of the Gulf Cooperation Council [190] Relations with Iran tend to be tense as a result of a failed coup in 1981 which Bahrain blames Iran for and occasional claims of Iranian sovereignty over Bahrain by ultra-conservative elements in the Iranian public [191] [192] In 2016, following the storming of the Saudi embassy in Tehran, both Saudi Arabia and Bahrain cut diplomatic relations with Iran Bahrain and Israel established bilateral relations in 2020 under the Bahrain–Israel normalization agreement [193]\n\n\nHuman rights\nThe period between 1975 and 1999, known as the \"State Security Law Era\", saw wide range of human rights violations including arbitrary

Bahrain was elected to head the United Nations General Assembly in 2006 it appointed lawyer and women's rights activist Haya bint Rashid Al Khalifa President of the United Nations General Assembly, only the third woman in history to head the world body [229] Female activist Ghada Jamsheer said \"The government used women's rights as a decorative tool on the international level.\" She referred to the reforms as \"artificial and marginal\" and accused the government of \"hinder [ing] non-governmental women societies\" [165]\n\n\nMedia\nThe music style in Bahrain is similar to that of its neighbours The Khaliji style of music, which is folk music, is popular in the country The sawt style of music, which involves a complex form of urban music, performed by an Oud (plucked lute), a violin and mirwas (a drum), is also popular in Bahrain [343] Ali Bahar was one of the most famous singers in Bahrain He performed his music with his Band Al-Ekhwa (The Brothers) Bahrain was also the

received over eleven million visitors in 2019 [257] Most of these are from the surrounding Arab states, although an increasing number hail from outside the region due to growing awareness of the kingdom's heritage and partly due to its higher profile as a result of the Bahrain Grand Prix.\n\n\nValue Added Tax (VAT)\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain introduced the Value Added Tax with effect from 1 January 2019 [265] This is a multipoint tax on the sale of goods and services in Kingdom of Bahrain This has been managed by the government through the national bureau of revenue The ultimate burden of this tax is passed on the consumer To start with the maximum rate of VAT was 5% which is increased to 10% with effect from 1 January 2022 [266] The government of Bahrain is assuring compliance through high penalties on defaults and tighter audits This first of its kind VAT has invited qualified chartered accounting firms mainly from India to advise on VAT matters Firms like KPMG, KeyPoint, Assure Consulting and APMH have set up offices looking at the need for consulting in this domain of VAT.\n\n\nInfrastructure\nBahrain has one main international airport, the Bahrain International Airport (BAH) which is located on the island of Muharraq, in the north-east The airport handled almost 100,000 flights and more than 9.5 million passengers in 2019 [267] On January 28, 2021, Bahrain opened its new airport terminal as part of its economic vision 2030 [268] The new airport terminal is capable of handling 14 million passengers and is a big boost to the country's aviation sector

Bahrain's first telecommunications company, Batelco and until 2004, it monopolised the sector In 1981, there were more than 45,000 telephones in use in the country By 1999, Batelco had more than 100,000 mobile contracts [276] In 2002, under pressure from international bodies, Bahrain implemented its telecommunications law which included the establishment of an independent Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) [276] In 2004, Zain (a rebranded version of MTC Vodafone) started operations in Bahrain and in 2010 VIVA (owned by STC Group) became the third company to provide mobile services [277]\n\n\nScience and technology\nThe Bahraini Economic Vision 2030 published in 2008 does not indicate how the stated goal of shifting from an economy built on oil wealth to a productive, globally competitive economy will be attained Bahrain has already diversified its exports to some extent, out of necessity It has the smallest hydrocarbon reserves of any Arabian Gulf state, producing 48,000 barrels per day from its one onshore field [282] The bulk of the country's revenue comes from its share in the offshore field administered by Saudi Arabia The gas reserve in Bahrain is expected to last for less than 27 years, leaving the country with few sources of capital to pursue the development of new industries Investment in research and development remained very low in 2013

biodiversity [283]\n\n\nInvestment in education and research\nIn 2012, the government devoted 2.6% of GDP to education, one of the lowest ratios in the Arab world This ratio was on a par with investment in education in Lebanon and higher only than that in Qatar (2.4% in 2008) and Sudan (2.2% in 2009) [283] Bahrain was ranked 72nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [284]\nBahrain invests little in research and development In 2009 and 2013, this investment reportedly amounted to 0.04% of GDP, although the data were incomplete, covering only the higher education sector The lack of comprehensive data on research and development poses a challenge for policymakers, as data inform evidence-based policymaking [283]\n\n\nTrends in research output\nIn 2014, Bahraini scientists published 155 articles in internationally catalogued journals, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded) This corresponds to 15 articles per million inhabitants, compared to a global average of 176 per million inhabitants in 2013 Scientific output has risen slowly from 93 articles in 2005 and remains modest By 2014, only Mauritania and Palestine had a smaller output in this database among Arab states [285] [283]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn 2010, Bahrain's population grew to 1.2 million, of which 568,399 were Bahraini and 666,172 were non-nationals [286] It had risen from 1.05 million (517,368 non-nationals) in 2007, the year when Bahrain's population crossed the one million mark [287] Though a majority of the population is Middle Eastern, a sizeable number of people from South Asia live in the country In 2008, approximately 290,000 Indian nationals lived in Bahrain, making them the single largest expatriate community in the country, the majority of which hail from the south Indian state of Kerala [288] [289] Bahrain is the fourth most densely populated sovereign state in the world with a population density of 1,646 people per km2 in 2010 [286] The only sovereign states with larger population densities are city states Much of this population is concentrated in the north of the country with the Southern Governorate being the least densely populated part [286] The north of the country is so urbanized that it is considered by some to be one large metropolitan area [290]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nBahraini people are ethnically diverse Shia Bahrainis are divided into two main ethnic groups: Baharna and Ajam The Shia Bahrainis are Baharna (Arab), and the Ajam are Persian Shias Shia Persians form large communities in Manama and Muharraq A small minority of Shia Bahrainis are ethnic Hasawis from Al-Hasa.\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Bahrain (2020) by Pew Research [4]\n\n\nLanguages\nArabic is the official language of Bahrain, though English is widely used [308] Bahrani Arabic is the most widely spoken dialect of the Arabic language, though it differs widely from standard Arabic, like all Arabic dialects Arabic plays an important role in political life, as, according to article 57 (c) of Bahrain's constitution, an MP must be fluent in Arabic to stand for parliament [309] In addition, Balochi is the second largest and widely spoken language in Bahrain The Baloch are fluent in Arabic and Balochi Among the Bahraini and non-Bahraini population, many people speak Persian, the official language of Iran, or Urdu, an official language in Pakistan and a regional language in India [308] Nepali is also widely spoken in the Nepalese workers and Gurkha Soldiers community Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Bangla and Hindi are spoken among significant Indian communities [308] All commercial institutions and road signs are bilingual, displaying both English and Arabic [310]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 14 [311] Education is free for Bahraini citizens in government schools, with the Bahraini Ministry of Education providing free textbooks Coeducation is not used in government schools, with boys and girls segregated into separate schools [312]\n\n\nHealth\nBahrain has a universal health care system, dating back to 1960 [319] Government-provided health care is free to Bahraini citizens and heavily subsidised for non-Bahrainis Healthcare expenditure accounted for 4.5% of Bahrain's GDP, according to the World Health Organization Bahraini physicians and nurses form a majority of the country's workforce in the health sector, unlike neighbouring Gulf states [320] The first hospital in Bahrain was the American Mission Hospital, which opened in 1893 as a dispensary [321] The first public hospital, and also tertiary hospital, to open in Bahrain was the Salmaniya Medical Complex, in the Salmaniya district of Manama, in 1957 [322] Private hospitals are also present throughout the country, such as the International Hospital of Bahrain.\n\n\nCulture\nIslam is the main religion, and Bahrainis are known for their tolerance towards the practice of other faiths [329] Intermarriages between Bahrainis and expatriates are not uncommon—there are many Filipino Bahrainis like Filipino child actress Mona Marbella Al-Alawi [330]\n\n\nArt\nThe modern art movement in the country officially emerged in the 1950s, culminating in the establishment of an art society Expressionism and surrealism, as well as calligraphic art are the popular forms of art in the country Abstract expressionism has gained popularity in recent decades [334] Pottery-making and textile-weaving are also popular products that were widely made in Bahraini villages [334] Arabic calligraphy grew in popularity as the Bahraini government was an active patron in Islamic art, culminating in the establishment of an Islamic museum, Beit Al Quran [334] The Bahrain national museum houses a permanent contemporary art exhibition [335] The annual Spring of Culture [336] festival run by the Bahrain Authority for Culture and Antiquities [337] has become a popular event promoting performance arts in the Kingdom The architecture of Bahrain is similar to that of its neighbours in the Arabian Gulf The wind tower, which generates natural ventilation in a house, is a common sight on old buildings, particularly in the old districts of Manama and Muharraq [338]\n\n\nLiterature\nLiterature retains a strong tradition in the country; most traditional writers and poets write in the classical Arabic style In recent years, the number of younger poets influenced by western literature are rising, most writing in free verse and often including political or personal content [339] Ali Al Shargawi, a decorated longtime poet, was described in 2011 by Al Shorfa as the literary icon of Bahrain [340]\n\n\nMedia\nThe music style in Bahrain is similar to that of its neighbours The Khaliji style of music, which is folk music, is popular in the country The sawt style of music, which involves a complex form of urban music, performed by an Oud (plucked lute), a violin and mirwas (a drum), is also popular in Bahrain [343] Ali Bahar was one of the most famous singers in Bahrain He performed his music with his Band Al-Ekhwa (The Brothers) Bahrain was also the site of the first recording studio amongst the Persian Gulf states [343]\n\n\nMusic\nThe music style in Bahrain is similar to that of its neighbours The Khaliji style of music, which is folk music, is popular in the country The

that government should \"build park benches and that is it They should leave us alone.\" [48] He has a particular contempt for the Health and Safety Executive He often criticised the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, especially what he calls the \"ban\" culture, frequently fixating on the bans on smoking and 2004 ban on fox hunting In April 2013, Clarkson was among 2,000 invited guests to the funeral of Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher [49]\n\n\nPolitics\nClarkson is in favour of personal freedom and against government regulation, stating that government

funeral of Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher [49]\n\n\nEnvironment\nClarkson is critical of the green movement and environmentalism, including groups such as Greenpeace—he has called them \"eco-mentalists\" and \"old trade unionists and CND lesbians\" [71] He also said that, although he \"hate [s] the movement,  [he] loves the destination\" of environmentalism and believes that people should quietly strive to be more eco-friendly [72] He has been dismissive of windfarms and renewable energy [73] [better source needed] and has spoken in support of hydrogen cars [48]\n\n\nHimself\nWhilst Clarkson states such views as described above in his columns and in public appearances, his public persona does not necessarily represent his personal views, as he acknowledged whilst interviewing Alastair Campbell on Top Gear, saying \"I don't believe what I write, any more than you  [Campbell] believe what you say\" [83]\n\n\nMedia\nResponses to Clarkson's comments are often directed personally, with derogatory comments about residents of Norfolk leading to some residents organising a \"We hate Jeremy Clarkson\" club In The Guardian's 2007 'Media 100' list, which lists the top 100 most \"powerful people in the  [media] industry\", based on cultural, economic and political influence in the UK, Clarkson was listed as a new entrant at 74th Some

presenter, and writer. He is best known for co-presenting the BBC television show Top Gear, which he left in 2015 after a fracas with a producer.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJeremy Clarkson was born on 11 April 1960 in Tickhill, West Riding of Yorkshire. He is the son of Shirley Gabrielle Clarkson (née Ward), a teacher, and Edward Grenville Clarkson, a travelling salesman. Clarkson's parents ran a business selling tea cosies, which, although unsuccessful, provided the family with a modest income. When Clarkson was 13, his parents made two Paddington Bear stuffed toys, which proved so popular that they started selling them through the business. Clarkson's parents traveled to London to meet with Michael Bond's lawyer, and, by coincidence, Clarkson met Bond in the lift. The two struck up an immediate rapport, and Bond awarded the Clarksons the licensing of the bear rights throughout the world, which they eventually sold to Britain's leading toy store, Hamleys. The income from this success enabled the Clarksons to pay for Jeremy to attend Hill House School, Doncaster, and later Repton School.\n\n**Childhood**\n\nJeremy Clarkson was born on 11 April 1960 in Tickhill, West Riding of Yorkshire.

{"title": "Foveaux_Strait", "content": "\nGeography\nFoveaux Strait is a seaway separating Stewart Island (Rakiura) from the South Island (Te Wai Pounamu) in New Zealand The width of the strait ranges from about 23 to 53 km (14 to 33 mi) There is no formal definition of the eastern and western boundaries of the strait — different sources set the eastern boundary of the strait at Waipapa Point, or alternatively further east at Waikawa Harbour The western boundary has been defined as a line at 167° 43'E, or further west at Sand Hill Point Depending on the definition of eastern and western boundaries, the area of the strait is approximately 2,460 km2 (950 sq mi) [1] [2]\n\n\nScope\nFoveaux Strait is a seaway separating Stewart Island (Rakiura) from the South Island (Te Wai Pounamu) in New Zealand The width of the strait ranges from about 23 to 53 km (14 to 33 mi) There is no formal definition of the eastern and western boundaries of the strait — different sources set the eastern boundary of the strait at Waipapa Point, or alternatively further east at Waikawa Harbour The western boundary has been defined as a line at 167° 43'E, or further west at Sand Hill Point Depending on the definition of eastern and western boundaries, the area of the strait is approximately 2,460 km2 (950 sq mi) [1] [2]\n\n\nPhysical geography and climate\nThere are a large number of small islands in the strait, including Raratoka Island, Dog Island, the Muttonbird Islands and Ruapuke Island The Solander Islands lie to the west; they are outside of the area usually defined as Foveaux Strait Major landforms on the northern coast of the strait include three large bays, Te Waewae Bay, Oreti Beach, Toetoes Bay and Bluff Harbour \n\n\nSea conditions\nThe sea conditions and tidal currents in Foveaux Strait are influenced by the sub-tropical convergence zone (STCZ) This is a frontal zone between subantarctic waters to the south, and subtropical waters to the north The southern boundary of the STCZ lies at around 46 °S, and runs eastwards from Tasmania It gives rise to the Southland Current that flows from the continental shelf west of Stewart Island, through Foveaux Strait and then north along the coast of the South Island The Southland Current carries a mixture of sub-tropical water and some sub-antarctic waters from the Australasian region, and it has a major influence on ocean conditions in Foveaux Strait and the south-east coast of the South Island [11] [12]\n\n\nToponymy\nThe Māori name for the strait is Te Ara a Kiwa, meaning the pathway of Kiwa A less common alternative is Te Ara a Kewa [23] There are numerous stories in Māori mythology about the origin of the names In one account, Kiwa became exhausted from crossing the isthmus which connected Murihiku (Southland) and Rakiura He asked the whale Kewa to chew through the isthmus to create a waterway, so he could travel to Rakiura using a waka [24] [25] [26]\n\n\nHistory\nIn Māori oral tradition, their history in the Southland region is traced to the arrival of two chiefs, Rākaihautū and Tamatea Rākaihautū is a tīpuna (ancestor) of the Waitaha people, and was the captain of the Uruao waka (canoe) The waka Tākitimu, captained by Tamatea, was wrecked near Te Waewae Bay on the shores of what is now called Foveaux Strait In the traditional account, the Tākitimu Mountains in Southland are the overturned hull of the canoe The name given to the lower parts of the South Island was Murihiku, a name that is loosely translated as 'the tail end' of the land [40]\n\n\nMāori settlement\nIn Māori

Southland are the overturned hull of the canoe The name given to the lower parts of the South Island was Murihiku, a name that is loosely translated as 'the tail end' of the land [40]\n\n\nCook's passage around Stewart Island\nIn March 1770, Captain James Cook, a British explorer, circumnavigated the South Island on the HMS Endeavour during his first voyage to New Zealand He passed around the southern tip of Stewart Island during this voyage, and sighted the area of Foveaux Strait, but did not record the presence of a passage [28] It is also possible that Cook genuinely made an error, as his focus was on finding the southern extent of New Zealand, and conditions were unfavourable for more closely exploring the possible strait [28] [48]\n\n\nSealing\nMāori living around Foveaux Strait hunted seals for food, and used seal skin for clothing and seal teeth for fishing hooks The first Europeans known to have hunted seals in Southland were the crew of James Cook's vessel, the HMS Resolution, during her stay in Dusky Sound in 1773 An Australian-based commercial sealing gang was dropped off in Dusky Sound in 1792 to gather seal skins However, new opportunities for sealing in Bass Strait made New Zealand less attractive, and there was little further seal hunting by Europeans until renewed activity at Dusky Sound in 1803 Between 1805 and 1808, there were large scale seal hunting campaigns in the Antipodes Islands, Bounty Island and the Auckland Islands From around 1808, sealing took place around Foveaux Strait In one voyage to the strait from their base at Port Jackson (Sydney) in September 1808, the Governor Bligh, captained by John Grono, returned with 10,000 skins [49] Some sealing gangs spent months or years in the region and there was increased contact and trade between sealers and Māori living in the area In one incident, a sealing gang was dropped off from the brig Fox onto Solander Island They were left there for over four years until being picked up by the Perserverance in 1813 [37] A few sealers took up living with Māori, and some earned high status through marriage to the daughters of chiefs From around 1810 onwards, the seal colonies around Foveaux Strait were so depleted that large scale commercial sealing was no longer economically viable [50] [51]\n\n\nWhaling\nOver the 40 year period 1844–1885, there were at least 187 separate visits by whaling ships to Foveaux Strait, with a peak from 1856–62 An estimated 600 sperm whales were killed [52] Numerous shore-based whaling stations operated along the coastline of the strait [53] [54] The western entrance of the Foveaux Strait (near the Solander Islands) was formerly described as \"one of the world's prime sperm whale fishing ground\" [55]\n\n\nShipwrecks\nThere is a long history of shipwrecks and vessels capsizing in Foveaux Strait The worst incident was on 29 April 1881, when the SS Tararua struck Otara reef 13 km (8.1 mi) off Waipapa Point [56] [57] [58] Of the ship's 151 passengers, only 20 survived This incident is the worst maritime disaster for civilian vessels in New Zealand's history [59] The disaster led to the establishment of a lighthouse at Waipapa Point [60] [61] Serious incidents with multiple fatalities have continued into the 21st century, and the Bluff Coastguard is often called upon to assist vessels in distress in Foveaux Strait.\n\n\nLighthouses\nFrom the early days of European settlement it was clear that a lighthouse was needed in Foveaux Strait However, there were protracted debates in the 1860s about where one would be located Captains with local experience were asked for their opinion, and they suggested possible sites on Raratoka Island, Ruapuke Island, Stewart Island, Solander Islands, and Dog Island [62]\nCaptain Thomas Robertson visited Dog Island in 1863 and stated that the north-eastern edge of the island was an ideal place for a boat harbour, Robertson spoke with a local Māori chief, Tōpi Pātuki, assured Captain Robertson that there was a good water supply on the island [63] Later, it was chosen as Southland's first site for a lighthouse; the recommendation was made by the Invercargill Harbour Master to James Menzies, the first Superintendent of the Southland Province [64]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nNew Zealand has been described as the seabird capital of the world because of the large number of seabird species that breed on its territory, and the high diversity of species, including albatross,  penguins, petrels and shags [71] Foveaux Strait is one of the key locations in New Zealand for seabirds and seabird conservation [72] [73] [74] A wide array of seabirds have been recorded in the strait, including approximately 54 different species in various families: penguins (4 species), albatrosses and mollymawks (7 species), shearwaters, petrels, and prions (25 species), gannets and shags (6 species), skuas, gulls and terns (12 species) [75] Most notable among the penguins are the strait's population of yellow-eyed penguins [76]\n\n\nSeabirds\nNew Zealand has been described as the seabird capital of the world because of the large number of seabird species that breed on

yellow-eyed penguins [76]\n\n\nMuttonbirding\nThe northern Tītī / Muttonbird Islands in Foveaux Strait are one of the main locations around Stewart Island for the annual cultural harvest of chicks of tītī (sooty shearwater) by Rakiura Māori [81] [82] [83] In 2018, muttonbirders expressed concern about the impact of increasing populations of New Zealand fur seal on the annual harvest [84]\n\n\nMarine mammals\nApproximately 50 species of cetaceans (porpoises, dolphins and whales) and pinnipeds (sea lions and seals) are found in New Zealand waters Of these, at least 24 species of cetacean, and four species of pinniped have been observed in the Foveaux Strait region Some are resident throughout the year, while others, such as baleen whales, pass through Foveaux Strait in winter and spring on migration Species of whale observed in the strait include orca, humpback whales and southern right whales The strait is a mating area for southern right whales during winter The wider Southland region also has small populations of nationally endangered dolphins including bottlenose and Hector's dolphin [85] A breeding colony of the endanged New Zealand sea lion has recently established at the southern end of Stewart Island [86] [87] The New Zealand fur seal is present year-round in significant numbers [88] On land, sea lions are generally found on sandy beaches, but fur seals are more likely to be found on rocky shorelines [89]\n\n\nCatlins Coast Marine Mammal Sanctuary\nMarine mammals in New Zealand waters are protected under the Marine Mammals Protection Act Additional protection has been provided in some areas with the establishment of marine mammal sanctuaries One of these is Catlins Coast Marine Mammal Sanctuary established in 2008 that lies mostly within the area of Foveaux Strait Seismic surveying is strictly limited in this sanctuary, and seabed mining is prohibited The sanctuary extends from a line north of Ruapuke Island eastwards to the Brothers Point east of Waikawa Harbour [90]\n\n\nInsects\nThe Foveaux wētā (Deinacrida carinata) is a species of giant wētā that is endemic to New Zealand and is currently restricted to a few offshore predator-free islands including Herekopare Island in the Muttonbird Islands group in Foveaux Strait [92] Another endemic insect in the region is the Foveaux looper moth (Asaphodes frivola) which is a critically endangered moth, occurring in a very narrow and specialised habitat at just two small coastal sites near Invercargill, it occurs along a small area of the Southland coast, in fragmented strips of short tussock grassland right next to shell or gravel beaches [93] [94]\n\n\nFishing and aquaculture\nThe Foveaux Strait region has a nationally significant fishery for Bluff oysters and blue cod  Around half of total New Zealand catch of blue cod comes from Stewart Island or Foveaux Strait The fish is generally caught in cod pots The wider Southland region is also a major commercial fishery for crayfish (known elsewhere as rock lobster or spiny lobster) and pāua (known elsewhere as abalone) [95] [96] [97]\n\n\nCommercial fishing\nThe Foveaux Strait region has a nationally significant fishery for Bluff oysters and blue cod  Around half of total New Zealand catch of blue cod comes from Stewart Island or Foveaux Strait The fish is generally caught in cod pots The wider Southland region is also a major commercial fishery for crayfish (known elsewhere as rock lobster or spiny lobster) and pāua (known elsewhere as abalone) [95] [96] [97]\n\n\nBluff oyster fishery\nBluff oysters are considered a delicacy in New Zealand, particularly in the southern parts of the country Oysters found in Foveaux Strait are also found around other parts of New Zealand However, only in Foveaux Strait are the quantities of Bluff oyster sufficient to sustain a commercial fishery It is one of the oldest industries in New Zealand [5] [16] The Bluff oyster fishery is nationally significant and provides socio-economic benefit to neighbouring settlements [98] The oysters are harvested by a fleet of dredging boats—mostly operating from Bluff Harbour—between March and August each year [99] [100] Oystering began on Stewart Island in the 1860s, and gradually moved into the strait with the discovery of larger oyster beds there in 1879 [101] [5] The oyster quota was severely reduced in recent years due to the effects of phytoplankton variability on the oyster beds, [102] and the effects of toxic protozoan parasites such as Bonamia ostreae These issues led to a rāhui being placed by local iwi in 2021 [103] [104]\n\n\nCustomary fisheries management areas\nUnder the Treaty of Waitangi, tangata whenua (people of the land), are guaranteed customary fishing rights For the Foveaux Strait region, these rights are protected by regulations that provide for areas of traditional fishing grounds to be declared as a mātaitai reserve, where tangata whenua are guardians and may issue bylaws, and commercial fishing is not normally permitted [105] [106] [107] Mātaitai reserves within Foveaux Strait include:\n\n\nAquaculture\nA land-based aquaculture facility operates at Ocean Beach near Bluff, on the shores of Foveaux Strait It has large tanks, and uses water from the strait to raise popular New Zealand species including hāpuku, kingfish, whitebait and pāua The facility was developed from 2018 using a collection of buildings that were originally a large abbatoir and meat processing factory that closed in 1991 [116] In May 2021, a seafood company owned by Ngāi Tahu applied for consents to establish salmon farms in Foveaux Strait The proposal covered an area of 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres), located 2 to 6 km (1.2 to 3.7 mi) off the north–east coast of Stewart Island The consent application was reviewed by an independent panel under \"fast-track\" legislation and was declined in August 2023, based on the likely environmental impact [117]\n\n\nTransport\nThe ferry journey across Foveaux Strait between Bluff Harbour on the South Island and Oban in Stewart Island is about 39 km (21 nmi) long [118] The first scheduled service across Foveaux Strait began in 1877 for weekly mail delivery, but soon also carried passengers and general cargo [119] The Bluff Harbour Board and central government provided subsidised ferry services to Stewart Island for 100 years from 1885 through until 1985, [120] [119] [121] when private operators took over the service [122] The present high speed catamaran service typically takes one hour [119] [123] As of 2024, the ferry service is operated by the tourism company RealNZ (formerly Real Journeys) [124]\n\n\nFerry services\nThe ferry journey across Foveaux Strait between Bluff Harbour on the

between international ports may pass through Foveaux Strait based on the rights of innocent passage defined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea Most vessels transiting through the strait pass to the north of Ruapuke Island [125]\n\n\nAir services\nStewart Island Flights provides air services across Foveaux Strait between Invercargill Airport and Ryan's Creek Aerodrome on Stewart Island Their aircraft also land on the sand at Mason Bay, Doughboy Bay, and West Ruggedy Beach [128] [129]\n\n\nSwimming\nFew people have swum across the Foveaux Strait, mostly due to the unpredictable weather conditions and great white sharks residing in the area [137] The strait crossing distance is roughly 30 km (19 mi) [138] The first known person to swim across the strait was John van Leeuwen, who completed it on 7 February 1963 in a time of 13 hours 40 minutes [139] [140] The first woman to swim the strait was New Zealander Meda McKenzie who completed the crossing on 20 March 1979 [141]\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Foveaux Strait is a seaway separating Stewart Island (Rakiura) from the South Island (Te Wai Pounamu) in

Depending on the definition of eastern and western boundaries, the area of the strait is approximately 2,460 km2 (950 sq mi).\n\n## Geography\n\nThe geography of Foveaux Strait is characterized by its narrow and winding shape, with a series of small islands and rocky outcrops scattered throughout. The strait is bounded by the rugged coastline of Stewart Island to the east and the South Island to the west. The northern coast of the strait features three large bays, Te Waewae Bay, Oreti Beach, and Toetoes Bay, while the southern coast is marked by the Bluff Harbour and the Solander Islands. The strait is also home to a number of smaller islands, including Raratoka Island, Dog Island, and the Muttonbird Islands.\n\n## Physical Geography and Climate\n\nThe physical geography of Foveaux Strait is influenced by the sub-tropical convergence zone (STCZ), which runs eastwards from Tasmania and gives rise to the Southland Current.

Captains with local experience were asked for their opinion, and they suggested possible sites on Raratoka Island, Ruapuke Island, Stewart Island, Solander Islands, and Dog Island.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nNew Zealand has been described as the seabird capital of the world because of the large number of seabird species that breed on its territory, and the high diversity of species, including albatross, penguins, petrels, and shags. Foveaux Strait is one of the key locations in New Zealand for seabirds and seabird conservation. A wide array of seabirds have been recorded in the strait, including approximately 54 different species in various families.\n\n## Seabirds\n\nNew Zealand has been described as the seabird capital of the world because of the large number of seabird species that breed on its territory, and the high diversity of species, including albatross, penguins, petrels, and shags. Foveaux Strait is one of the key locations in New Zealand for seabirds and seabird conservation.\n\n## Muttonbirding\n\nThe northern Tītī / Muttonbird Islands in Foveaux Strait are one of the main locations around Stewart Island for the annual cultural harvest of chicks of tītī (sooty shearwater) by Rakiura Māori.\n\n## Marine Mammals\n\nApproximately 50 species of cetaceans (porpoises, dolphins, and whales) and pinnipeds (sea lions and seals) are found in New Zealand waters. Of these, at least 24 species of cetacean, and four species of pinniped, have been observed in the Foveaux Strait region.\n\n## Catlins Coast Marine Mammal Sanctuary\n\nMarine mammals in New Zealand waters are protected under the Marine Mammals Protection Act. Additional protection has been provided in some areas with the establishment of marine mammal sanctuaries. One of these is the Catlins Coast Marine Mammal Sanctuary, established in 2008, which lies mostly within the area of Foveaux Strait.\n\n## Insects\n\nThe Foveaux wētā (Deinacrida carinata) is a species of giant wētā that is endemic to New Zealand and is currently restricted to a few offshore predator-free islands, including Herekopare Island in the Muttonbird Islands group in Foveaux Strait.\n\n## Fishing and Aquaculture\n\nThe Foveaux Strait region has a nationally significant fishery for Bluff oysters and blue cod. Around half of the total New Zealand catch of blue cod comes from Stewart Island or Foveaux Strait. The fish is generally caught in cod pots.\n\n## Commercial Fishing\n\nThe Foveaux Strait region has a nationally significant fishery for Bluff oysters and blue cod. Around half of the total New Zealand catch of blue cod comes from Stewart Island or Foveaux Strait. The fish is generally caught in cod pots.\n\n## Bluff Oyster Fishery\n\nBluff oysters are considered a delicacy in New Zealand, particularly in the southern parts of the country. Oysters found in Foveaux Strait are also found around other parts of New Zealand. However, only in Foveaux Strait are the quantities of Bluff oyster sufficient to sustain a commercial fishery.\n\n## Customary Fisheries Management Areas\n\nUnder the Treaty of Waitangi, tangata whenua (people of the land) are guaranteed customary fishing rights. For the Foveaux Strait region, these rights are protected by regulations that provide for areas of traditional fishing grounds to be declared as a mātaitai reserve, where tangata whenua are guardians and may issue bylaws, and commercial fishing is not normally permitted.\n\n## Aquaculture\n\nA land-based aquaculture facility operates at Ocean Beach near Bluff, on the shores of Foveaux Strait. It has large tanks and uses water from the strait to raise popular New Zealand species, including hāpuku, kingfish, whitebait, and pāua.\n\n## Transport\n\nThe ferry journey across Foveaux Strait between Bluff Harbour on the South Island and Oban in Stewart Island is about 39 km (21 nmi) long. The first scheduled service across Foveaux Strait began in 1877 for weekly mail delivery, but soon also carried passengers and general cargo.\n\n## Ferry Services\n\nThe ferry journey across Foveaux Strait between Bluff Harbour on the South Island and Oban in Stewart Island is about 39 km (21 nmi) long. The first scheduled service across Foveaux Strait began in 1877 for weekly mail delivery, but soon also carried passengers and general cargo.\n\n## Shipping\n\nA wide range of vessels travel through Foveaux Strait, ranging from small fishing vessels through to cruise ships, large cargo ships, and tankers. Vessels traveling between international ports may pass through Foveaux Strait based on the rights of innocent passage defined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\n## Air Services\n\nStewart Island Flights provides air services across Foveaux Strait between Invercargill Airport and Ryan's Creek Aerodrome on Stewart Island. Their aircraft also land on the sand at Mason Bay, Doughboy Bay, and West Ruggedy Beach.\n\n## Swimming\n\nFew people have swum across the Foveaux Strait, mostly due to the unpredictable weather conditions and great white sharks residing in the area. The strait crossing distance is roughly 30 km (19 mi).", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Foveaux_Strait\" following this outline:\n\n\nGeography\nFoveaux Strait is a seaway separating Stewart Island (Rakiura) from the South Island (Te Wai Pounamu) in New Zealand The width of the strait ranges from about 23 to 53 km (14 to 33 mi) There is no formal definition of the eastern and western boundaries of the strait — different sources set the eastern boundary of the strait at Waipapa Point, or alternatively further east at Waikawa Harbour The western boundary has been defined as a line at 167° 43'E, or further west at Sand Hill Point Depending on the definition of eastern and western boundaries, the area of the strait is approximately 2,460 km2 (950 sq mi) [1] [2]\n\n\nScope\nFoveaux Strait is a seaway separating Stewart Island (Rakiura) from the South Island (Te Wai Pounamu) in New Zealand The width of the strait ranges from about 23 to 53 km (14 to

is approximately 2,460 km2 (950 sq mi) [1] [2]\n\n\nPhysical geography and climate\nThere are a large number of small islands in the strait, including Raratoka Island, Dog Island, the Muttonbird Islands and Ruapuke Island The Solander Islands lie to the west; they are outside of the area usually defined as Foveaux Strait Major landforms on the northern coast of the strait include three large bays, Te Waewae Bay, Oreti Beach, Toetoes Bay and Bluff Harbour \n\n\nSea conditions\nThe sea conditions and tidal currents in Foveaux Strait are influenced by the sub-tropical convergence zone (STCZ) This is a frontal zone between subantarctic waters to the south, and subtropical waters to the north The southern boundary of the STCZ lies at around 46 °S, and runs eastwards from Tasmania It gives rise to the Southland Current that flows from the continental shelf west of Stewart Island, through Foveaux Strait and then north along the coast of the South Island The Southland Current carries a mixture of sub-tropical water and some sub-antarctic waters from the Australasian region, and it has a major influence on ocean conditions in Foveaux Strait and the south-east coast of the South Island [11] [12]\n\n\nToponymy\nThe Māori name for the strait is Te Ara a Kiwa, meaning the pathway of Kiwa A less common alternative is Te Ara a Kewa [23] There are numerous stories in Māori mythology about the origin of the names In one account, Kiwa became exhausted from crossing the isthmus which connected Murihiku (Southland) and Rakiura He asked the whale Kewa to chew through the isthmus to create a waterway, so he could travel to Rakiura using a waka [24] [25] [26]\n\n\nHistory\nIn Māori oral tradition, their history in the Southland region is traced to the arrival of two chiefs, Rākaihautū and Tamatea Rākaihautū is a tīpuna (ancestor) of the Waitaha people, and was the captain of the Uruao waka (canoe) The waka Tākitimu, captained by Tamatea, was wrecked near Te Waewae Bay on the shores of what is now called Foveaux Strait In the traditional account, the Tākitimu Mountains in Southland are the overturned hull of the canoe The name given to the lower parts of the South Island was Murihiku, a name that is loosely translated as 'the tail end' of the land [40]\n\n\nMāori settlement\nIn Māori oral tradition, their history in the Southland region is traced to

lower parts of the South Island was Murihiku, a name that is loosely translated as 'the tail end' of the land [40]\n\n\nCook's passage around Stewart Island\nIn March 1770, Captain James Cook, a British explorer, circumnavigated the South Island on the HMS Endeavour during his first voyage to New Zealand He passed around the southern tip of Stewart Island during this voyage, and sighted the area of Foveaux Strait, but did not record the presence of a passage [28] It is also possible that Cook genuinely made an error, as his focus was on finding the southern extent of New Zealand, and conditions were unfavourable for more closely exploring the possible strait [28] [48]\n\n\nSealing\nMāori living around Foveaux Strait hunted seals for food, and used seal skin for clothing and seal teeth for fishing hooks The first Europeans known to have hunted seals in Southland were the crew of James Cook's vessel, the HMS Resolution, during her stay in Dusky Sound in 1773 An Australian-based commercial sealing gang was dropped off in Dusky Sound in 1792 to gather seal skins However, new opportunities for sealing in Bass Strait made New Zealand less attractive, and there was little further seal hunting by Europeans until renewed activity at Dusky Sound in 1803 Between 1805 and 1808, there were large scale seal hunting campaigns in the Antipodes Islands, Bounty Island and the Auckland Islands From around 1808, sealing took place around Foveaux Strait In one voyage to the strait from their base at Port Jackson (Sydney) in September 1808, the Governor Bligh, captained by John Grono, returned with 10,000 skins [49] Some sealing gangs spent months or years in the region and there was increased contact and trade between sealers and Māori living in the area In one incident, a sealing gang was dropped off from the brig Fox onto Solander Island They were left there for over four years until being picked up by the Perserverance in 1813 [37] A few sealers took up living with Māori, and some earned high status through marriage to the daughters of chiefs From around 1810 onwards, the seal colonies around Foveaux Strait were so depleted that large scale commercial sealing was no longer economically viable [50] [51]\n\n\nWhaling\nOver the 40 year period 1844–1885, there were at least 187 separate visits by whaling ships to Foveaux Strait, with a peak from 1856–62 An estimated 600 sperm whales were killed [52] Numerous shore-based whaling stations operated along the coastline of the strait [53] [54] The western entrance of the Foveaux Strait (near the Solander Islands) was formerly described as \"one of the world's prime sperm whale fishing ground\" [55]\n\n\nShipwrecks\nThere is a long history of shipwrecks and vessels capsizing in Foveaux Strait The worst incident was on 29 April 1881, when the SS Tararua struck Otara reef 13 km (8.1 mi) off Waipapa Point [56] [57] [58] Of the ship's 151 passengers, only 20 survived This incident is the worst maritime disaster for civilian vessels in New Zealand's history [59] The disaster led to the establishment of a lighthouse at Waipapa Point [60] [61] Serious incidents with multiple fatalities have continued into the 21st century, and the Bluff Coastguard is often called upon to assist vessels in distress in Foveaux Strait.\n\n\nLighthouses\nFrom the early days of European settlement it was clear that a lighthouse was needed in Foveaux Strait However, there were protracted debates in the 1860s about where one would be located Captains with local experience were asked for their opinion, and they suggested possible sites on Raratoka Island, Ruapuke Island, Stewart Island, Solander Islands, and Dog Island [62]\nCaptain Thomas Robertson visited Dog Island in 1863 and stated that the north-eastern edge of the island was an ideal place for a boat harbour, Robertson spoke with a local Māori chief, Tōpi Pātuki, assured Captain Robertson that there was a good water supply on the island [63] Later, it was chosen as Southland's first site for a lighthouse; the recommendation was made by the Invercargill Harbour Master to James Menzies, the first Superintendent of the Southland Province [64]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nNew Zealand has been described as the seabird capital of the world because of the large number of seabird species that breed on its territory, and the high diversity of species, including albatross,  penguins, petrels and shags [71] Foveaux Strait is one of the key locations in New Zealand for seabirds and seabird conservation [72] [73] [74] A wide array of seabirds have been recorded in the strait, including approximately 54 different species in various families: penguins (4 species), albatrosses and mollymawks (7 species), shearwaters, petrels, and prions (25 species), gannets and shags (6 species), skuas, gulls and terns (12 species) [75] Most notable among the penguins are the strait's population of yellow-eyed penguins [76]\n\n\nSeabirds\nNew Zealand

in Foveaux Strait are one of the main locations around Stewart Island for the annual cultural harvest of chicks of tītī (sooty shearwater) by Rakiura Māori [81] [82] [83] In 2018, muttonbirders expressed concern about the impact of increasing populations of New Zealand fur seal on the annual harvest [84]\n\n\nMarine mammals\nApproximately 50 species of cetaceans (porpoises, dolphins and whales) and pinnipeds (sea lions and seals) are found in New Zealand waters Of these, at least 24 species of cetacean, and four species of pinniped have been observed in the Foveaux Strait region Some are resident throughout the year, while others, such as baleen whales, pass through Foveaux Strait in winter and spring on migration Species of whale observed in the strait include orca, humpback whales and southern right whales The strait is a mating area for southern right whales during winter The wider Southland region also has small populations of nationally endangered dolphins including bottlenose and Hector's dolphin [85] A breeding colony of the endanged New Zealand sea lion has recently established at the southern end of Stewart Island [86] [87] The New Zealand fur seal is present year-round in significant numbers [88] On land, sea lions are generally found on sandy beaches, but fur seals are more likely to be found on rocky shorelines [89]\n\n\nCatlins Coast Marine Mammal Sanctuary\nMarine mammals in New Zealand waters are protected under the Marine Mammals Protection Act Additional protection has been provided in some areas with the establishment of marine mammal sanctuaries One of these is Catlins Coast Marine Mammal Sanctuary established in 2008 that lies mostly within the area of Foveaux Strait Seismic surveying is strictly limited in this sanctuary, and seabed mining is prohibited The sanctuary extends from a line north of Ruapuke Island eastwards to the Brothers Point east of Waikawa Harbour [90]\n\n\nInsects\nThe Foveaux wētā (Deinacrida carinata) is a species of giant wētā that is endemic to New Zealand and is currently restricted to a few offshore predator-free islands including Herekopare Island in the Muttonbird Islands group in Foveaux Strait [92] Another endemic insect in the region is the Foveaux looper moth (Asaphodes frivola) which is a critically endangered moth, occurring in a very narrow and specialised habitat at just two small coastal sites near Invercargill, it occurs along a small area of the Southland coast, in fragmented strips of short tussock grassland right next to shell or gravel beaches [93] [94]\n\n\nFishing and aquaculture\nThe Foveaux Strait region has a nationally significant fishery for Bluff oysters and blue cod  Around half of total New Zealand catch of blue cod comes from Stewart Island or Foveaux Strait The fish is generally caught in cod pots The wider Southland region is also a major commercial fishery for crayfish (known elsewhere as rock lobster or spiny lobster) and pāua (known elsewhere as abalone) [95] [96] [97]\n\n\nCommercial fishing\nThe Foveaux Strait region has a nationally significant fishery for Bluff oysters and blue cod  Around half of total New Zealand catch of blue cod

Oysters found in Foveaux Strait are also found around other parts of New Zealand However, only in Foveaux Strait are the quantities of Bluff oyster sufficient to sustain a commercial fishery It is one of the oldest industries in New Zealand [5] [16] The Bluff oyster fishery is nationally significant and provides socio-economic benefit to neighbouring settlements [98] The oysters are harvested by a fleet of dredging boats—mostly operating from Bluff Harbour—between March and August each year [99] [100] Oystering began on Stewart Island in the 1860s, and gradually moved into the strait with the discovery of larger oyster beds there in 1879 [101] [5] The oyster quota was severely reduced in recent years due to the effects of phytoplankton variability on the oyster beds, [102] and the effects of toxic protozoan parasites such as Bonamia ostreae These issues led to a rāhui being placed by local iwi in 2021 [103] [104]\n\n\nCustomary fisheries management areas\nUnder the Treaty of Waitangi, tangata whenua (people of the land), are guaranteed customary fishing rights For the Foveaux Strait region, these rights are protected by regulations that provide for areas of traditional fishing grounds to be declared as a mātaitai reserve, where tangata whenua are guardians and may issue bylaws, and commercial fishing is not normally permitted [105] [106] [107] Mātaitai reserves within Foveaux Strait include:\n\n\nAquaculture\nA land-based aquaculture facility operates at Ocean Beach near Bluff, on the shores of Foveaux Strait It has large tanks, and uses water from the strait to raise popular New Zealand species including hāpuku, kingfish, whitebait and pāua The facility was developed from 2018 using a collection of buildings that were originally a large abbatoir and meat processing factory that closed in 1991 [116] In May 2021, a seafood company owned by Ngāi Tahu applied for consents to establish salmon farms in Foveaux Strait The proposal covered an area of 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres), located 2 to 6 km (1.2 to 3.7 mi) off the north–east coast of Stewart Island The consent application was reviewed by an independent panel under \"fast-track\" legislation and was declined in August 2023, based on the likely environmental impact [117]\n\n\nTransport\nThe ferry journey across Foveaux Strait between Bluff Harbour on the South Island and Oban in Stewart Island is about 39 km (21 nmi) long [118] The first scheduled service across Foveaux Strait began in 1877 for weekly mail delivery, but soon also carried passengers and general cargo [119] The Bluff Harbour Board and central government provided subsidised ferry services to Stewart Island for 100 years from 1885 through until 1985, [120] [119] [121] when private operators took over the service [122] The present high speed catamaran service typically takes one hour [119] [123] As of 2024, the ferry service is operated by the tourism company RealNZ (formerly Real Journeys) [124]\n\n\nFerry

in Paris – and by the early 1860s Cowper was keen to sell the estate [11]\n\n\nEdward VII\nIn 1861 Queen Victoria's eldest son and heir, Albert Edward, was approaching his twentieth birthday Edward's dissipated lifestyle had been disappointing to his parents, and his father, Prince Albert, thought that marriage and the purchase of a suitable establishment were necessary to ground the prince in country life and pursuits and lessen the influence of the \"Marlborough House set\" [a] with which he was involved [13] Albert had his staff investigate 18 possible country estates that might be suitable, including Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire and Houghton Hall in Norfolk [14] The need to act quickly was reinforced by the Nellie Clifden affair, when Edward's fellow officers smuggled the actress into his quarters The possibility of a scandal was deeply concerning to his parents [13] Sandringham Hall was on the list of the estates considered, and a personal recommendation to the Prince Consort from the prime minister Lord Palmerston, stepfather to the owner, swayed Prince Albert Negotiations were only slightly delayed by Albert's death in December 1861—his widow declared, \"His wishes – his plans – about everything are to be my law\" [15] Edward visited in February 1862, and a sale was agreed for the house and just under 8,000 acres (3,200 ha) of land, [16] which was finalised that October [17] Queen Victoria only twice visited the house she had paid for [18] [b] Over the course of the next forty years, and with considerable expenditure, Edward was to create a house and country estate that his friend Charles Carington [1] called \"the most comfortable in England\" [22]\n\n\nGeorge V\nIn his will Edward VII left his widow £200,000 and a lifetime interest in the Sandringham estate [60] Queen Alexandra's continued occupancy of the \"big house\" compelled George V, his wife, Queen Mary, and their expanding family to remain at York Cottage in the grounds, in rather \"cramped\" conditions [61] Suggestions from courtiers that Queen Alexandra might move out were firmly rebuffed by the King; \"It is my mother's house, my father built it for her\" [62] The King also lacked the sociability of his father, and the shortage of space at York Cottage enabled him to limit the entertaining he undertook, with the small rooms reportedly reminding him of the onboard cabins of his naval career [63]\n\n\nEdward VIII\nOn the night of his father's death, Edward VIII summarily ordered that the clocks at Sandringham be returned to Greenwich Mean Time, ending the tradition of Sandringham time begun by his grandfather over 50 years earlier [78] Edward had rarely enjoyed his visits to Sandringham, either in his father's time or that of his grandfather He described a typical dinner at the house in a letter to his then mistress Freda Dudley Ward, dated 26 December 1919; \"it's too dull and boring for words Christ how any human beings can ever have got themselves into this pompous secluded and monotonous groove I just can't imagine\" In another letter, evenings at the \"big house\"—Edward stayed at York Cottage with his father—were recorded as \"sordidly dull and boring\" [l] [80] His antipathy to the house was unlikely to have been lessened by his late father's will, which was read to the family in the saloon at the house His brothers were each left £750,000 while Edward was bequeathed no monetary assets beyond the revenues from the Duchy of Cornwall A codicil also prevented him from selling the late King's personal possessions; Lascelles described the inheritance as \"the Kingship without the cash\" [81] [m]\n\n\nGeorge VI\nGeorge VI had been born at Sandringham on 14 December 1895 [91] A keen follower of country pursuits, he was as devoted to the estate as his father, writing to his mother, Queen Mary, \"I have always been so happy here\" [92] The deep retrenchment he had proposed when commissioned by his brother to review the estate was not enacted, but economies were still made [93] His mother was at church at Sandringham on Sunday 3 September 1939, when the outbreak of the Second World War was declared [94] The house was shut up during the war, but occasional visits were made to the estate, with the family staying at outlying cottages After the war the King made improvements to the gardens surrounding the house but, as traditionalist as his father, he made few other changes [95] December 1945 saw the first celebration of Christmas at the house since 1938 [96] Lady Airlie recorded her impressions at dinner: \"I sat next to the King His face was tired and strained and he ate practically nothing Looking at him I felt the cold fear of the probability of another short reign\" [97]\n\n\nElizabeth II\nAs with her predecessors, the house remained one of the two homes owned by the Sovereign in her private capacity, rather than as head of state, the other being Balmoral Castle [102] Following King George VI's death, Queen Elizabeth II's custom was to spend the anniversary of that and of her own accession privately with her family at Sandringham House, and, toward the end of her reign, to use it as her official base from Christmas until February [n] [104] In celebrating Christmas at Sandringham, the Queen followed the tradition of her last three predecessors, whereas her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, held her celebrations at Windsor Castle [105] The taxation arrangements of the monarch meant that no inheritance tax was paid on the Sandringham or Balmoral estates when they passed to the Queen, at a time when it was having a deleterious effect on other country estates [106] On her accession, the Queen asked her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, to take on the responsibility for the management of the estate [107] The Duke worked to move towards self-sufficiency, [108] generating additional income streams, taking more of the land in hand, and amalgamating many of the smaller tenant farms [109]\n\n\nCharles III\nOn the death of his mother in September 2022, the Sandringham estate passed to King Charles He has spent the subsequent two Christmases at Sandringham, continuing a tradition followed by Elizabeth II until 2020 [119] [120] [121] [122]\n\n\nArchitecture and description\nThe house is mainly constructed of red brick with limestone dressings; Norfolk Carrstone is also prevalent, particularly in Edis's additions [123] The tiled roof contains nine separate clusters of chimneystacks [124] The style is Jacobethan, with inspiration drawn principally from nearby Blickling Hall [34] [o] Construction was undertaken by Goggs Brothers of Swaffham [92] The principal rooms of the house are the saloon, the drawing room, the dining room and the ballroom, together with rooms devoted to sports, such as the gun room, or leisure, such as the bowling alley, now a library, and the billiard room [126] The walls of the corridors connecting the principal rooms display a collection of Oriental and Indian arms and armour, [127] gathered by Edward VII on his tour of the East in 1875–1876 [128] Decoration of the house and the provision of furniture and fittings was undertaken by Holland and Sons in the 1870 rebuilding [92]\n\n\nSaloon\nThe largest room in the house, the saloon is used as the main reception room [126] The arrangement of entry under the porte-cochère direct into the saloon proved problematic, with no ante-room in which guests could remove their hats and coats [32] Jenkins describes the decorative style, here and elsewhere in the house, as \"Osbert Lancaster's Curzon Street Baroque\" [2] The room contains portraits of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert by their favourite artist Franz Xaver Winterhalter [126] The saloon functioned as a venue for dances, until the construction of the new ballroom by Edis, [129] and has a minstrels' gallery to accommodate musicians [32] The room contains a weighing machine; Edward VII was in the habit of requiring his guests to be weighed on their arrival, and again on their departure, to establish that his lavish hospitality had caused them to put on weight [32]\n\n\nDrawing room\nThe drawing room is described by Jenkins as \"the nearest Sandringham gets to pomp\" [2] On one of her two visits to the house, Victoria recorded in her journal that, after dinner, the party adjourned to \"the very long and handsome drawing room with painted ceiling and two fireplaces\" [128] The room contains portraits of Queen Alexandra and her daughters, Princess Louise, Princess Victoria, and Princess Maud of Wales, by Edward Hughes [130] White marble statues complete what has been described as a \"tour de force of fashionable late-Victorian decoration\" [92]\n\n\nBallroom\nThe ballroom was added by Edis in 1884, to overcome the inconvenience of having only the saloon as the major room for entertaining As this was also the main family living room, it had previously been necessary to remove the furniture when the saloon was required for dances and large entertainments Alexandra recorded her delight at the result, \"Our new ballroom is beautiful I think & a great success & avoids pulling the hall to pieces each time there is a ball or anything\" [131] At the time of Queen Victoria's visit in 1889, the room was used for a theatrical performance given by Sir Henry Irving and Ellen Terry [132] Queen Elizabeth II used the room for entertainments and as a cinema [131]\n\n\nDining room\nThe walls of the dining room are decorated with Spanish tapestries including some by Goya which were a gift from Alfonso XII of Spain [133] The walls are panelled in oak, painted light green for Queen Mary who had been inspired by a visit to a Scottish castle [85] [p] Jill Franklin's study of the planning of Victorian country houses includes a photograph of the dining room at Sandringham with the table laid for dinner for twenty-four, a \"very usual\" number to seat for dinner in a major country house of the time [134]\n\n\nAppreciation\nSandringham House has not been admired by critics Its chief fault is the lack of harmony between Humbert's original building and Edis's extensions, \"a contrast between the northern and southern halves of the house (that) has been much criticised ever since\" [37] The architectural historian John Martin Robinson wrote in 1982, \"Sandringham, the latest in date of the houses of the British monarchy, is the least distinguished architecturally\" [34] In his biography of Queen Mary, James Pope-Hennessy compared the house unfavourably to \"a golf-hotel at St Andrews or a station-hotel at Strathpeffer\" [46] Simon Jenkins considered Sandringham \"unattractive\", with a \"grim, institutional appearance\" [2] Nikolaus Pevsner described the architectural style as \"frenetic\"; [28] Girouard expressed himself perplexed as to the preference shown by the royal family for A J Humbert, [29] a patronage the writer Adrian Tinniswood described as \"the Victorian Royal Family's knack for choosing second-rate architects\" [135] An article on the house in the June 1902 edition of Country Life opined, \"of mere splendour there is not much, but of substantial comfort a good deal\" [19] The writer Clive Aslet suggests that the sporting opportunities offered by the estate were the main attraction for its royal owners, rather than \"the house itself, which even after rebuilding was never beguiling\" [q] [61]\n\n\nGardens\nThe gardens and country park comprise 600 acres (240 ha) of the estate [142] with the gardens extending to 49 acres (20 ha) [143] They were predominantly laid out from the 1860s, with later alterations and simplifications Edward VII sought advice from William Broderick Thomas and Ferdinand de Rothschild, a friend and adviser to the King throughout his life The original lake was filled and replaced with the elaborate parterres fashionable at the time [144] These have since been removed [145] Two new lakes were dug further from the house, and bordered by rockeries constructed of Pulhamite stone [146] A summerhouse, called The Nest, stands above the Upper Lake, a gift in 1913 to Queen Alexandra from the comptroller of her household, General Sir Dighton Probyn [147] [s] The gardens to the north of the house, which are overlooked by the suite of rooms used by George VI, were remodelled and simplified by Geoffrey Jellicoe for the King and his wife after the Second World War [148] [149] A statue of Father Time, dating from the 18th century, was purchased by the Queen Mother and installed in 1951 [150] [t] Further areas of the gardens were remodelled by Sir Eric Savill in the 1960s for Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip [154] The extensive kitchen gardens, which in Edward VII's time included carriage drives to allow guests to view the \"highly ornamental\" arrangements, [124] [u] were also laid to lawn during Queen Elizabeth II's reign, having proved uneconomic to maintain [156]\n\n\nWider estate\nThe 20,000-acre (8,100 ha) [142] Sandringham estate has some of the finest shoots in England, and is used for royal shooting parties [61] Covering seven villages, the estate's other main activities, aside from tourism, are arable crops and forestry [157] The grounds provided room for Queen Alexandra's menagerie of horses, dogs, cats, and other animals [158] In 1886 a racing pigeon loft was constructed for birds given to the Duke of York by King Leopold II of Belgium and one or more lofts for pigeons have been maintained ever since The Norwich Gates, designed by Thomas Jeckyll [159] and made by the local firm of Barnard, Bishop and Barnard, were a wedding present for Edward and Alexandra from \"the gentry of Norfolk\" [29]\n\n\nAnmer Hall\nAnmer Hall is a Georgian house on the grounds, purchased by the Prince of Wales in 1896 [162] Formerly occupied by the Duke of Kent, [163] it was the main country home of the Prince and Princess of Wales, [164] until their move to Adelaide Cottage at Windsor [165]\n\n\nAppleton House\nWhen Prince Carl of Denmark (later King Haakon VII of Norway) and Princess Maud were married in July 1896, Appleton House was a wedding gift to them from the bride's parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales Queen Maud became fond of Appleton, \"our little house is a perfect paradise\", [166] and their son, Prince Alexander (the future King Olav V of Norway), was born at the house in 1903 [167] After Queen Maud died in 1938, King Haakon returned the property [166] The last inhabitants were King George VI and Queen Elizabeth who stayed there during a visit to Norfolk during World War II, when Sandringham was closed [166] Lascelles considered it \"an ugly villa, but not uncomfortable\" [168] The house was demolished in 1984 [166]\n\n\nPark House\nConstructed by Edward VII, [169] Park House has been owned by the royal family for many years [170] The birthplace of Diana, Princess of Wales, [171] when the house was let to her father, it was subsequently run as a hotel managed by the Leonard Cheshire charity [172] In 2019, the charity developed plans for a £2.3m refurbishment programme, which were deferred because of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic The charity has since decided to discontinue the redevelopment and work with the Sandringham Estate to exit the lease [173]\n\n\nWood Farm\nWood Farm has been part of the Sandringham Estate since the time of Edward VII In the early 20th century, it was home to Prince John, the youngest of the six children of King George V and Queen Mary Born in 1905, the Prince was epileptic, and spent much of his short life in relative seclusion at Sandringham [174] He died at Wood Farm, his home for the last two years of his life, on 18 January 1919 [175] Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, lived at Wood Farm after retiring from royal duties [176] [177]\n\n\nYork Cottage\nYork Cottage, originally known as Bachelors' Cottage, was built by Edward, Prince of Wales, soon after he acquired Sandringham, in order to provide further accommodation for guests [178] It was home to George V from 1893 until his mother's death enabled him to move into the main house in 1925 [147] Edward VIII, by then Duke of Windsor, told his father's biographer Harold Nicolson, \"Until you have seen York Cottage you will never understand my father\" [179] The cottage was no more highly regarded architecturally than the main house; James Pope-Hennessy, the official biographer of Queen Mary, called it, \"tremendously vulgar and emphatically, almost defiantly hideous\" [v] [181] Nicolson described it as a \"glum little villa (with) rooms indistinguishable from those of any Surbiton or Upper Norwood home\" [182] He was particularly dismissive of the royal bathing arrangements: \"Oh my God! what a place The King's and Queen's baths had lids that shut down so that when not in use they could be used as tables\" [65] \"It is almost incredible that the heir to so vast a heritage lived in this horrible little house.\" [179] Nicolson's strictures did not appear in his official biography of the King York Cottage as of 2000 [update] is the estate office for the Sandringham Estate [183]\n\n\nPublic access\nThe country park and the visitors' centre are normally open throughout the year The house, gardens and museum were usually opened annually from the end of March until the end of October, [184] but COVID-19 led to the closure of much of the estate Staged re-opening took place from February 2022 [185] Following the death of Elizabeth II, Sandringham was closed for a period of official mourning [186] The country park subsequently reopened, but the house and garden remained closed to the public until April 2023 [187]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Introduction\n\nSandringham House is a country estate located in Norfolk, England, and has been a private residence of the British royal family for over a century. The estate was purchased by King Edward VII in 1862, and has since been used as a weekend retreat and hunting lodge for the royal family. The house itself is a large, red-brick mansion with a complex history, having undergone several renovations and expansions over the years. This article will provide an overview of the history of Sandringham House and the Sandringham estate, as well as its architecture, gardens, and public access.\n\n## History\n\n### Early History\n\nSandringham is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \"sant-Dersingham\" (the sandy part of Dersingham) and the land was awarded to a Norman knight, Robert Fitz-Corbun after the Norman Conquest. The local antiquarian Claude Messent, in his study The Architecture on the Royal Estate of Sandringham, records the discovery of evidence of the pavements of a Roman villa near Appleton farm. In the 15th century, it was held by Anthony Woodville, Lord Scales, brother-in-law to Edward IV. In the Elizabethan era, a manor was built on the site of the present house, which, by the 18th century, came into the possession of the Hoste Henley family, descendants of Dutch refugees. In 1771, Cornish Henley cleared the site to build a Georgian mansion, Sandringham Hall.\n\n### Edward VII\n\nIn 1861, King Edward VII's dissipated lifestyle had been disappointing to his parents, and his father, Prince Albert, thought that marriage and the purchase of a suitable establishment were necessary to ground the prince in country life and pursuits. Edward VII's grandfather, Prince Albert, had his staff investigate 18 possible country estates that might be suitable, including Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire and Houghton Hall in Norfolk. The possibility of a scandal was deeply concerning to his parents. Sandringham Hall was on the list of the estates considered, and a personal recommendation to the Prince Consort from the prime minister Lord Palmerston, stepfather to the owner, swayed Prince Albert. Negotiations were only slightly delayed by Albert's death in December 1861 - his widow declared, \"His wishes - his plans - about everything are to be my law.\" Edward visited in February 1862, and a sale was agreed for the house and just under 8,000 acres (3,200 ha) of land, which was finalised that October.\n\n### George V\n\nIn his will, Edward VII left his widow £200,000 and a lifetime interest in the Sandringham estate. Queen Alexandra's continued occupancy of the \"big house\" compelled George V, his wife, Queen Mary, and their expanding family to remain at York Cottage in the grounds, in rather \"cramped\" conditions. The King also lacked the sociability of his father, and the shortage of space at York Cottage enabled him to limit the entertaining he undertook.\n\n### Edward VIII\n\nOn the night of his father's death, Edward VIII summarily ordered that the clocks at Sandringham be returned to Greenwich Mean Time, ending the tradition of Sandringham time begun by his grandfather over 50 years earlier. Edward VIII had rarely enjoyed his visits to Sandringham, either in his father's time or that of his grandfather. He described a typical dinner at the house in a letter to his then mistress Freda Dudley Ward, dated 26 December 1919; \"it's too dull and boring for words Christ how any human beings can ever have got themselves into this pompous secluded and monotonous groove I just can't imagine.\"\n\n### George VI\n\nGeorge VI had been born at Sandringham on 14 December 1895. A keen follower of country pursuits, he was as devoted to the estate as his father, writing to his mother, Queen Mary, \"I have always been so happy here.\" The deep retrenchment he had proposed when commissioned by his brother to review the estate was not enacted, but economies were still made. His mother was at church at Sandringham on Sunday 3 September 1939, when the outbreak of the Second World War was declared. The house was shut up during the war, but occasional visits were made to the estate, with the family staying at outlying cottages.\n\n### Elizabeth II\n\nAs with her predecessors, the house remained one of the two homes owned by the Sovereign in her private capacity, rather than as head of state, the other being Balmoral Castle. Following King George VI's death, Queen Elizabeth II's custom was to spend the anniversary of that and of her own accession privately with her family at Sandringham House, and, toward the end of her reign, to use it as her official base from Christmas until February.\n\n## Architecture and Description\n\nThe house is mainly constructed of red brick with limestone dressings; Norfolk Carrstone is also prevalent, particularly in Edis's additions.

Covering seven villages, the estate's other main activities, aside from tourism, are arable crops and forestry. The grounds provided room for Queen Alexandra's menagerie of horses, dogs, cats, and other animals. In 1886 a racing pigeon loft was constructed for birds given to the Duke of York by King Leopold II of Belgium and one or more lofts for pigeons have been maintained ever since.\n\n## Public Access\n\nThe country park and the visitors' centre are normally open throughout the year. The house, gardens and museum were usually opened annually from the end of March until the end of October, but COVID-19 led to the closure of much of the estate. Staged re-opening took place from February 2022. Following the death of Elizabeth II, Sandringham was closed for a period of official mourning.

without issue, and the estate was bought at auction by John Motteux, a London merchant [7] Motteux was also without heirs and bequeathed Sandringham, together with another Norfolk estate and a property in Surrey, to the third son of his close friend, Emily Lamb, the wife of Lord Palmerston [8] At the time of his inheritance in 1843, Charles Spencer Cowper was a bachelor diplomat, resident in Paris On succeeding to Motteux's estates, he sold the other properties and based himself at Sandringham [9] He undertook extensions to the hall, employing Samuel Sanders Teulon to add an elaborate porch and conservatory [10] Cowper's style of living was extravagant – he and his wife spent much of their time on the Continent – and within 10 years the estate was mortgaged for £89,000 [9] The death in 1854, from cholera, of their only child Mary Harriette, led the couple to spend even more time abroad – mainly in Paris – and by the early 1860s Cowper was keen to sell the estate

parents, and his father, Prince Albert, thought that marriage and the purchase of a suitable establishment were necessary to ground the prince in country life and pursuits and lessen the influence of the \"Marlborough House set\" [a] with which he was involved [13] Albert had his staff investigate 18 possible country estates that might be suitable, including Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire and Houghton Hall in Norfolk [14] The need to act quickly was reinforced by the Nellie Clifden affair, when Edward's fellow officers smuggled the actress into his quarters The possibility of a scandal was deeply concerning to his parents [13] Sandringham Hall was on the list of the estates considered, and a personal recommendation to the Prince Consort from the prime minister Lord Palmerston,

visited the house she had paid for [18] [b] Over the course of the next forty years, and with considerable expenditure, Edward was to create a house and country estate that his friend Charles Carington [1] called \"the most comfortable in England\" [22]\n\n\nGeorge V\nIn his will Edward VII left his widow £200,000 and a lifetime interest in the Sandringham estate [60] Queen Alexandra's continued occupancy of the \"big house\" compelled George V, his wife, Queen Mary, and their expanding family to remain at York Cottage in the grounds, in rather \"cramped\" conditions [61] Suggestions from courtiers that Queen Alexandra might move out were firmly rebuffed by the King; \"It is my mother's house, my father built it for her\" [62] The King also lacked the sociability of his father, and the shortage of space at York Cottage enabled him to limit the entertaining he undertook, with the small rooms reportedly reminding him of the onboard cabins of his naval career [63]\n\n\nEdward VIII\nOn the night of his father's death, Edward VIII summarily ordered that the clocks at Sandringham be returned to Greenwich Mean Time, ending the tradition of Sandringham time begun by his grandfather over 50 years earlier [78] Edward had rarely enjoyed his visits to Sandringham, either in his father's time or that of his grandfather He described a typical dinner at the

secluded and monotonous groove I just can't imagine\" In another letter, evenings at the \"big house\"—Edward stayed at York Cottage with his father—were recorded as \"sordidly dull and boring\" [l] [80] His antipathy to the house was unlikely to have been lessened by his late father's will, which was read to the family in the saloon at the house His brothers were each left £750,000 while Edward was bequeathed no monetary assets beyond the revenues from the Duchy of Cornwall A codicil also prevented him from selling the late King's personal possessions; Lascelles described the inheritance as \"the Kingship without the cash\" [81] [m]\n\n\nGeorge VI\nGeorge VI had been born at Sandringham on 14 December 1895 [91] A keen follower of country pursuits, he was as devoted to the estate as his

father, he made few other changes [95] December 1945 saw the first celebration of Christmas at the house since 1938 [96] Lady Airlie recorded her impressions at dinner: \"I sat next to the King His face was tired and strained and he ate practically nothing Looking at him I felt the cold fear of the probability of another short reign\" [97]\n\n\nElizabeth II\nAs with her predecessors, the house remained one of the two homes owned by the Sovereign in her private capacity, rather than as head of state, the other being Balmoral Castle [102] Following King George VI's death, Queen Elizabeth II's custom was to spend the anniversary of that and of her own accession privately with her family at Sandringham House, and, toward the end of her reign, to use it as her official base from Christmas until February [n] [104] In celebrating Christmas at Sandringham, the Queen followed the tradition of her last three predecessors, whereas her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, held her celebrations at Windsor Castle [105] The taxation arrangements of the monarch meant that no inheritance tax was paid on the Sandringham or Balmoral estates when they passed to the Queen, at a time when it was having a deleterious effect on other country estates [106] On her accession, the Queen asked her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, to take on the responsibility for the management of the estate [107] The Duke worked to move towards self-sufficiency, [108] generating additional income streams, taking more of the land in hand, and amalgamating many of the smaller tenant farms [109]\n\n\nCharles III\nOn the death of his mother in September 2022, the Sandringham estate passed to King Charles He has spent the subsequent two Christmases at Sandringham, continuing a tradition followed by Elizabeth II until 2020 [119] [120] [121] [122]\n\n\nArchitecture and description\nThe house is mainly constructed of red brick with limestone dressings; Norfolk Carrstone is also prevalent, particularly in Edis's additions [123] The tiled roof contains nine separate clusters of chimneystacks [124] The style is Jacobethan, with inspiration drawn principally from nearby Blickling Hall [34] [o] Construction was undertaken by Goggs Brothers of Swaffham [92] The principal rooms of the house are the saloon, the drawing room, the dining room and the ballroom, together with rooms devoted to sports, such as the gun room, or leisure, such as the bowling alley, now a library, and the billiard room [126] The walls of the corridors connecting the principal rooms display a collection of Oriental and Indian arms and armour, [127] gathered by Edward VII on his tour of the East in 1875–1876 [128] Decoration of the house and the provision of furniture and fittings was undertaken by Holland and Sons in the 1870 rebuilding [92]\n\n\nSaloon\nThe largest room in the house, the saloon is used as the main reception room [126] The arrangement of entry under the porte-cochère direct into the saloon proved problematic, with no ante-room in which guests could remove their hats and coats [32] Jenkins describes the decorative style, here and elsewhere in the house, as \"Osbert Lancaster's Curzon Street Baroque\" [2] The room contains portraits of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert by their favourite artist Franz Xaver Winterhalter [126] The saloon functioned as a venue for dances, until the construction of the new ballroom by Edis, [129] and has a minstrels' gallery to accommodate musicians [32] The room contains a weighing machine; Edward VII was in the habit of requiring his guests to be weighed on their arrival, and again on their departure, to establish that his lavish hospitality had caused them to put on weight [32]\n\n\nDrawing room\nThe drawing room is described by Jenkins as \"the nearest Sandringham gets to pomp\" [2] On one of her two visits to the house, Victoria recorded in her journal that, after dinner, the party adjourned to \"the very long and handsome drawing room with painted ceiling and two fireplaces\" [128] The room contains portraits of Queen Alexandra and her daughters, Princess Louise, Princess Victoria, and Princess Maud of Wales, by Edward Hughes [130] White marble statues complete what has been described as a \"tour de force of fashionable late-Victorian decoration\" [92]\n\n\nBallroom\nThe ballroom was added by Edis in 1884, to overcome the inconvenience of having only the saloon as the major room for entertaining As this was also the main family living room, it had previously been necessary to remove the furniture when the saloon was required for dances and large entertainments Alexandra recorded her delight at the result, \"Our new ballroom is beautiful I think & a great success & avoids pulling the hall to pieces each time there is a ball or anything\" [131] At the time of Queen Victoria's visit in 1889, the room was used for a theatrical performance given by Sir Henry Irving and Ellen Terry [132] Queen Elizabeth II used the room for entertainments and as a cinema [131]\n\n\nDining room\nThe walls of the dining room are decorated with Spanish tapestries including some by Goya which were a gift from Alfonso XII of Spain [133] The walls are panelled in oak, painted light green for Queen Mary who had been inspired by a visit to a Scottish castle [85] [p] Jill Franklin's study of the planning of Victorian country houses includes a photograph of the dining room at Sandringham with the table laid for dinner for twenty-four, a \"very usual\" number to seat for dinner in a major country house of the time [134]\n\n\nAppreciation\nSandringham House has not been admired by critics Its chief fault is the lack of harmony between Humbert's original building and Edis's extensions, \"a contrast between the northern and southern halves of the house (that) has been much criticised ever since\" [37] The architectural historian John Martin Robinson wrote in 1982, \"Sandringham, the latest in date of the houses of the British monarchy, is the least distinguished architecturally\" [34] In his biography of Queen Mary, James Pope-Hennessy compared the house unfavourably to \"a golf-hotel at St Andrews or a station-hotel at Strathpeffer\" [46] Simon Jenkins considered Sandringham \"unattractive\", with a \"grim, institutional appearance\" [2] Nikolaus Pevsner described the architectural style as \"frenetic\"; [28] Girouard expressed himself perplexed as to the preference shown by the royal family for A J Humbert, [29] a patronage the writer Adrian Tinniswood described as \"the Victorian Royal Family's knack for choosing second-rate architects\" [135] An article on the house in the June 1902 edition of Country Life opined, \"of mere splendour there is not much, but of substantial comfort a good deal\" [19] The writer Clive Aslet suggests that the sporting opportunities offered by the estate were the main attraction for its royal owners, rather than \"the house itself, which even after rebuilding was never beguiling\" [q] [61]\n\n\nGardens\nThe gardens and country park comprise 600 acres (240 ha) of the estate [142] with the gardens extending to 49 acres (20 ha) [143] They were predominantly laid out from the 1860s, with later alterations and simplifications Edward VII sought advice from William Broderick Thomas and Ferdinand de Rothschild, a friend and adviser to the King throughout his life The original lake was filled and replaced with the elaborate parterres fashionable at the time [144] These have since been removed [145] Two new lakes were dug further from the house, and bordered by rockeries constructed of Pulhamite stone [146] A summerhouse, called The Nest, stands above the Upper Lake, a gift in 1913 to Queen Alexandra from the comptroller of her household, General Sir Dighton Probyn [147] [s] The gardens to the north of the house, which are overlooked by the suite of rooms used by George VI, were remodelled and simplified by Geoffrey Jellicoe for the King and his wife after the Second World War [148] [149] A statue of Father Time, dating from the 18th century, was purchased by the Queen Mother and installed in 1951 [150] [t] Further areas of the gardens were remodelled by Sir Eric Savill in the 1960s for Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip [154] The extensive kitchen gardens, which in Edward VII's time included carriage drives to allow guests to view the \"highly ornamental\" arrangements, [124] [u] were also laid to lawn during Queen Elizabeth II's reign, having proved uneconomic to maintain [156]\n\n\nWider estate\nThe 20,000-acre (8,100 ha) [142] Sandringham estate has some of the finest shoots in England, and is used for royal shooting parties [61] Covering seven villages, the estate's other main activities, aside from tourism, are arable crops and forestry [157] The grounds provided room for Queen Alexandra's menagerie of horses, dogs, cats, and other animals [158] In 1886 a racing pigeon loft was constructed for birds given to the Duke of York by King Leopold II of Belgium and one or more lofts for pigeons have been maintained ever since The Norwich Gates, designed by Thomas Jeckyll [159] and made by the local firm of Barnard, Bishop and Barnard, were a wedding present for Edward and Alexandra from \"the gentry of Norfolk\" [29]\n\n\nAnmer Hall\nAnmer Hall is a Georgian house on the grounds, purchased by the Prince of Wales in 1896 [162] Formerly occupied by the Duke of Kent, [163] it was the main country home of the Prince and Princess of Wales, [164] until their move to Adelaide Cottage at Windsor [165]\n\n\nAppleton House\nWhen Prince Carl of Denmark (later King Haakon VII of Norway) and Princess Maud were married in July 1896, Appleton House was a wedding gift to them from the bride's parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales Queen Maud became fond of Appleton, \"our little house is a perfect paradise\", [166] and their son, Prince Alexander (the future King Olav V of Norway), was born at the house in 1903 [167] After Queen Maud died in 1938, King Haakon returned the property [166] The last inhabitants were King George VI and Queen Elizabeth who stayed there during a visit to Norfolk during World War II, when Sandringham was closed [166] Lascelles considered it \"an ugly villa, but not uncomfortable\" [168] The house was demolished in 1984 [166]\n\n\nPark House\nConstructed by Edward VII, [169] Park House has been owned by the royal family for many years [170] The birthplace of Diana, Princess of Wales, [171] when the house was let to her father, it was subsequently run as a hotel managed by the Leonard Cheshire charity [172] In 2019, the charity developed plans for a £2.3m refurbishment programme, which were deferred because of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic The charity has since decided to discontinue the redevelopment and work with the Sandringham Estate to exit the lease [173]\n\n\nWood Farm\nWood Farm has been part of the Sandringham Estate since the time of Edward VII In the early 20th century, it was home to Prince John, the youngest of the six children of King George V and Queen Mary Born in 1905, the Prince was epileptic, and spent much of his short life in relative seclusion at Sandringham [174] He died at Wood Farm, his home for the last two years of his life, on 18 January 1919 [175] Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, lived at Wood Farm after retiring from royal duties [176] [177]\n\n\nYork Cottage\nYork Cottage, originally known as Bachelors' Cottage, was built by Edward, Prince of Wales, soon after he acquired Sandringham, in order to provide further accommodation for guests [178] It was home to George V from 1893 until his mother's death enabled him to move into the main house in 1925 [147] Edward VIII, by then Duke of Windsor, told his father's biographer Harold Nicolson, \"Until you have seen York Cottage you will never understand my father\" [179] The cottage was no more highly regarded architecturally than the main house; James Pope-Hennessy, the official biographer of Queen Mary, called it, \"tremendously vulgar and emphatically, almost defiantly hideous\" [v] [181] Nicolson described it as a \"glum little villa (with) rooms indistinguishable from those of any Surbiton or Upper Norwood home\" [182] He was particularly dismissive of the royal bathing arrangements: \"Oh my God! what a place The King's and Queen's baths had lids that shut down so that when not in use they could be used as tables\" [65] \"It is almost incredible that the heir to so vast a heritage lived in this horrible little house.\" [179] Nicolson's strictures did not appear in his official biography of the King York Cottage as of 2000 [update] is the estate office for the Sandringham Estate [183]\n\n\nPublic access\nThe country park and the visitors' centre are normally open throughout the year The house, gardens and museum were usually opened annually from the end of March until the end of October, [184] but COVID-19 led to the closure of much of the estate Staged re-opening took place from February 2022 [185] Following the death of Elizabeth II, Sandringham was closed for a period of official mourning [186] The country park subsequently reopened, but the house and garden remained closed to the public until April 2023 [187]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

[18]\n\n\nWriting\nA long running story arc is the unknown identity of \"H\", a suspected corrupt police officer believed to be the highest connection to the organised crime group [19] Despite not introducing this storyline until the end of the third series, [20] Mercurio stated that he had crafted it from the beginning, and purposefully gave multiple characters names beginning with \"H\" so he could re-craft portions of the story if needed [21] He added that this also allowed him to intentionally mislead viewers [22] Mercurio wrote many characters to be morally grey so that they would feel more relatable [23] He attributed this to his belief that the world is \"more complicated\" than good versus evil [24] Mercurio also frequently kills off key characters to keep the audience engaged [25] [26] Some of the storylines have been loosely based on true stories [27] The opening scene of the programme featured the shooting death of a man mistaken to be a suicide bomber, this was credited to the 2005 police shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes in which a man was incorrectly believed to be part of bombings in London [28] Additionally the story surrounding the Sands View Boys' Home in the third series included references to the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal [29] The BBC was initially uncomfortable at mention of Savile and wished to exclude it, but were persuaded by Mercurio to keep it [23] The series six murder of Gail Vella was based on the 2017 assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia [30] This series also featured an 18-month time jump from the conclusion of the fifth [31] Many of the colloquialisms that Hastings uses were inspired by Mercurio's Italian father and Dunbar's Irish dad [32] Mercurio opted not to incorporate COVID-19 into the programme as four episodes of the sixth series had already been filmed when lockdown, face mask, and social distancing guidelines were introduced and it would have been too expensive to re-film [22]\n\n\nCasting\nLeading the main cast across the six series are Martin Compston and Vicky McClure, who portrayed Steve Arnott and Kate Fleming respectively, two officers in AC-12 [33] Adrian Dunbar also appeared in the first series in a supporting role as Ted Hastings, and was promoted to the main cast beginning with the second series [34] Each series features an additional actor as part of the main cast who portrays a police officer who is being investigated by AC-12 [35] These roles were performed by Lennie James in series one, [36] Keely Hawes in series two, [37] Daniel Mays in the third series, [38] Thandie Newton in series four, [39] Stephen Graham in series five, [40] and Kelly Macdonald in the sixth and final series [41] Craig Parkinson also held a supporting role in the first series and joined the main cast for the second and third [42] [43] [44] Parkinson originally auditioned for the role of Arnott but ultimately portrayed Matthew Cottan [45] Mercurio also decided to bring Hawes back for the third series as a result of her character's positive reception, and made changes to the script [46] Mercurio killed off both Parkinson's and Hawes's characters at the conclusion of the third series [46] Despite this, Parkinson filmed new footage for flashback scenes in the fourth and fifth series [47] Jessica Raine and Jason Watkins each appeared briefly in the second and fourth series, respectively, and were both credited within the main cast [48] [49] Anna Maxwell Martin was also featured as part of the starring cast in the fifth and sixth series, but only appeared in the latter portion of each series [50] Line of Duty features a large supporting cast of recurring characters and guest stars [33]\n\n\nProduction design\nPeter Anderson designed Line of Duty's opening title sequence [51] From series two onwards Maggie Donnelly worked as the costume designer [52] She gave Hawes lower-end outfits to reflect \"how far  [Denton] had sunk in her grief\", but also included power suits to show where \"she would have been in her career if fate hadn't dealt her that hand\" [53] Other outfits included pieces from high-end designers, such as A.P.C., Marks & Spencer, and Tommy Hilfiger for McClure, Theory for Newton, and ME+EM for both Macdonald and McClure [52] [53] Compston regularly wears three-piece suits and his character became notable for the waistcoats [54] Compston attributed this idea to a friend's experience working in a call centre [55]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography for the first series began in August 2011 [58] Five hour-long episodes were directed by David Caffrey and Douglas Mackinnon [42] It was filmed over 11 weeks in Birmingham and utilised two cameras [59] The setting was later changed to the Midlands on the advice of the BBC [60] For the second series, filming moved to Belfast and began in mid-2013 [61] The six episodes were split into two filming blocks with Mackinnon returning to direct the first block of episodes and Daniel Nettheim directing the second [62] The headquarters of Invest Northern Ireland doubled as Anti-Corruption Unit 12's office building while the exterior of Belfast Central Library served as the police headquarters' facade [63]\n\n\nMusic\nCarly Paradis was Line of Duty's composer for incidental music [77] She credited \"Heaven\" by Emeli Sandé and the theme song from The X-Files as inspirations for the theme music, stating that she \"wanted to touch a little bit on the 1980s, the 1990s and the 2000s, so that it sounds contemporary but still harks back to cop series from the past\" [78] The opening and closing themes are designed around a four-note motif Paradis also said she thought of the words \"Line of Duty\" when composing the theme [79]\n\n\nSoundtrack\nA soundtrack album titled Line of Duty (Music from the Original Series) containing tracks from the first two series was released on 1 April 2014 [80]\n\n\nFuture\nSince 2021 there has been interest in producing a seventh series [81] [82] Mercurio stated that he concluded many of the loose threads during the sixth series, as a seventh had not been commissioned He also said the BBC was \"very supportive\" of the series and that \"conversations have been very reassuring from the standpoint of not having to wrap things up\" [22] Dunbar said in 2022 that he didn't expect a full seventh series but anticipated the possibility of a three to four part mini-series or two 90-minute episodes [83] Compston, McClure, and Dunbar all expressed interest in returning, if asked [84] [85] [86] Compston explained that there would only be a seventh series if Mercurio had a story to tell [87] Later reports suggested a three-episode series was set to air in 2023 [88] [89] In April 2024 Compston confirmed that there were no immediate plans for a seventh series [90]\n\n\nRelease\nThe series was first broadcast on BBC Two beginning on 26 June 2012 [91] Additional series followed in 2014 [92]

was produced in support of Sport Relief [17] The special was promoted as a \"deleted scene\" from the fifth series and starred Compston, McClure, and Dunbar along with Jason Isaacs and Lee Mack [18]\n\n\nWriting\nA long running story arc is the unknown identity of \"H\", a suspected corrupt police officer believed to be the highest connection to the organised crime group [19] Despite not introducing this storyline until the end of the third series, [20] Mercurio stated that he had crafted it from the beginning, and purposefully gave multiple characters names beginning with \"H\" so he could re-craft portions of the story if needed [21] He added that this also allowed him to intentionally mislead viewers [22] Mercurio wrote many characters to be morally grey so that they would feel more relatable [23] He attributed this to his belief that the world is \"more complicated\" than good versus evil [24] Mercurio also frequently kills off key characters to keep the audience engaged [25] [26] Some of the storylines have been loosely based on true stories [27] The opening scene of the programme featured the shooting death of a man mistaken to be a suicide bomber, this was credited to the 2005 police shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes in which a man was incorrectly believed to be part of bombings in London [28] Additionally the story surrounding the Sands View Boys' Home in the third series included references to the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal [29] The BBC was initially uncomfortable at mention of Savile and wished to exclude it, but were persuaded by Mercurio to keep it [23] The series six murder of Gail Vella was based on the 2017 assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia [30] This series also featured an 18-month time jump from the conclusion of the fifth [31] Many of the colloquialisms that Hastings uses were inspired by Mercurio's Italian father and Dunbar's Irish dad [32] Mercurio opted not to incorporate COVID-19 into the programme as four episodes of the sixth series had already been filmed when lockdown, face mask, and social distancing guidelines were introduced and it would have been too expensive to re-film [22]\n\n\nCasting\nLeading the main cast across the six series are Martin Compston and Vicky McClure, who portrayed Steve Arnott and Kate Fleming respectively, two officers in AC-12 [33] Adrian Dunbar also appeared in the first series in a supporting role as Ted Hastings, and was promoted to the main cast beginning with the second series [34] Each series features an additional actor as part of the main cast who portrays a police officer who is being investigated by AC-12 [35] These roles were performed by Lennie James in series one, [36] Keely Hawes in series two, [37] Daniel Mays in the third series, [38] Thandie Newton in series four, [39] Stephen Graham in series five, [40] and Kelly Macdonald in the sixth and final series [41] Craig Parkinson also held a supporting role in the first series and joined the main cast for the second and third [42] [43] [44] Parkinson originally auditioned for the role of Arnott but ultimately portrayed Matthew Cottan [45] Mercurio also decided to bring Hawes back for the third series as a result of her character's positive reception, and made changes to the script [46] Mercurio killed off both Parkinson's and Hawes's characters at the conclusion of the third series [46] Despite this, Parkinson filmed new footage for flashback scenes in the fourth and fifth series [47] Jessica Raine and Jason Watkins each appeared briefly in the second and fourth series, respectively, and were both credited within the main cast [48] [49] Anna Maxwell Martin was also featured as part of the starring cast in the fifth and sixth series, but only appeared in the latter portion of each series [50] Line of Duty features a large supporting cast of recurring characters and guest stars [33]\n\n\nProduction design\nPeter Anderson designed Line of Duty's opening title sequence [51] From series two onwards Maggie Donnelly worked as the costume designer [52] She gave Hawes lower-end outfits to reflect \"how far  [Denton] had sunk in her grief\", but also included power suits to show where \"she would have been in her career if fate hadn't dealt her that hand\" [53] Other outfits included pieces from high-end designers, such as A.P.C., Marks & Spencer, and Tommy Hilfiger for McClure, Theory for Newton, and ME+EM for both Macdonald and McClure [52] [53] Compston regularly wears three-piece suits and his character became notable for the waistcoats [54] Compston attributed this idea to a friend's experience working in a call centre [55]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography for the first series began in August 2011 [58] Five hour-long episodes were directed by David Caffrey and Douglas Mackinnon [42] It was filmed over 11 weeks in Birmingham and utilised two cameras [59] The setting was later changed to the Midlands on the advice of the BBC [60] For the second series, filming moved to Belfast and began in mid-2013 [61] The six episodes were split into two filming blocks with Mackinnon returning to direct the first block of episodes and Daniel Nettheim directing the second [62] The headquarters of Invest Northern Ireland doubled as Anti-Corruption Unit 12's office building while the exterior of Belfast Central Library served as the police headquarters' facade [63]\n\n\nMusic\nCarly Paradis was Line of Duty's composer for incidental music [77] She credited \"Heaven\" by Emeli Sandé and the theme song from The X-Files as inspirations for the theme music, stating that she \"wanted to touch a little bit on the 1980s, the 1990s and the 2000s, so that it sounds contemporary but still harks back to cop series from the past\" [78] The opening and closing themes are designed around a four-note motif Paradis also said she thought of the words \"Line of Duty\" when composing the theme [79]\n\n\nSoundtrack\nA soundtrack album titled Line of Duty (Music from the Original Series) containing tracks from the first two series was released on 1 April 2014 [80]\n\n\nFuture\nSince 2021 there has been interest in producing a seventh series [81] [82] Mercurio stated that he concluded many of the loose threads during the sixth series, as a seventh had not been commissioned He also said the BBC was \"very supportive\" of the series and that \"conversations have been very reassuring from the standpoint of not having to wrap things up\" [22] Dunbar said in 2022 that he didn't expect a full seventh series but anticipated the possibility of a three to four part mini-series or two 90-minute episodes [83] Compston, McClure, and Dunbar all expressed interest in returning, if asked [84] [85] [86] Compston explained that there would only be a seventh series if Mercurio had a story to tell [87] Later reports suggested a three-episode series was set to air in 2023 [88] [89] In April 2024 Compston confirmed that there were no immediate plans for a seventh series [90]\n\n\nRelease\nThe series was first broadcast on BBC Two beginning on 26 June 2012 [91] Additional series followed in 2014 [92]

{"title": "Elgin_Baylor", "content": "\nEarly life\nElgin \"Rabbit\" Baylor was born in Washington, D.C., on September 16, 1934, [6] [7] the son of Uzziel (Lewis) and John Wesley Baylor [8] He began playing basketball when he was 14 [9] Although he grew up near a D.C city recreation center, African Americans were banned from using the facilities, and Baylor had limited access to basketball courts growing up [10] He had two basketball-playing brothers, Sal and Kermit [11] After stints at Southwest Boys Club and Brown Jr High, Baylor was a three-time All-City player in high school [12]\n\n\nCollege career\nDespite his success as a high school basketball player, no major college recruited Baylor because at the time, college scouts did not recruit at black high schools [6] While some colleges were willing to accept Baylor, he did not qualify academically [9] A friend of Baylor's who attended the College of Idaho helped arrange a football scholarship for Baylor for the 1954–55 academic year [6] [9] Baylor never played football for the school, however; instead, he was accepted to the college's basketball team without having to try out [6] He outperformed the other players on the team that season, averaging over 31 points and 20 rebounds per game [6] [9]\n\n\nProfessional career\nThe Minneapolis Lakers used the No 1 overall pick in the 1958 NBA draft to select Baylor, then convinced him to skip his senior year at SU and instead join the pro ranks The team had been unsuccessful since the retirement of its star center George Mikan in 1954 The year prior to Baylor's arrival, the team finished 19–53 – the worst record in the league – with a squad that was slow, bulky and aging It had no permanent home arena to play in, was losing popularity, and in financial trouble Owner Bob Short, who was ready to sell the team, believed Baylor's star athletic talents and all-around game could save the franchise Short told the Los Angeles Times in a 1971 interview: \"If he had turned me down then, I would have been out of business The club would have gone bankrupt.\" [6] [18] Baylor signed with the Lakers for $20,000 per year (equivalent to $210,000 in 2023), a large sum in the NBA at the time [9] According to basketball historian James Fisher, by virtue of his exceptional skills and his central role in the team's business plan, Baylor became the NBA's first franchise player [6]\n\n\nMinneapolis / Los Angeles Lakers (1958–1971)\nThe Minneapolis Lakers used the No 1 overall pick in the 1958 NBA draft to select Baylor, then convinced him to skip his senior

to basketball historian James Fisher, by virtue of his exceptional skills and his central role in the team's business plan, Baylor became the NBA's first franchise player [6]\n\n\nRookie of the Year (1958–1959)\nThe Minneapolis Lakers used the No 1 overall pick in the 1958 NBA draft to select Baylor, then convinced him to skip his senior year at SU and instead join the pro ranks The team had been unsuccessful since the retirement of its star center George Mikan in 1954 The year prior to Baylor's arrival, the team finished 19–53 – the worst record in the league – with a squad that was slow,

exceptional skills and his central role in the team's business plan, Baylor became the NBA's first franchise player [6]\n\n\nPeak years (1959–1965)\nIn 1960, the Lakers moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles, drafted Jerry West to play point guard, and hired Fred Schaus who was also the coach during West's college career The duo of Baylor and West, joined in 1968 by center Wilt Chamberlain, led the Lakers to success in the Western Division throughout the 1960s [7] [13] [20]\n\n\nKnee injury and later seasons (1965–1971)\nBaylor suffered a severe knee injury during the opening game of the 1965 Western Division playoffs, which required surgery and left him unable to play in the remainder of the playoffs Although he scored more than 24 points in each of the next four seasons despite his injury, the limitations of knee surgery at the time and the lack of meaningful rehab left him with nagging knee problems, ultimately resulting in surgery on both knees, which impaired his playing ability for the rest of his career [7] [13] [20]\n\n\nCoaching career\nIn 1974, Baylor was hired to be an assistant coach and later the head coach for the New Orleans Jazz, but had a lackluster 86–135 record and was fired following the 1978–79 season, shortly before the team moved to Salt Lake City, Utah [7] [13]\n\n\nExecutive career\nIn 1986, Baylor was hired by the Los Angeles Clippers as the team's vice president of basketball operations He was selected as the NBA Executive of the Year in 2006 [22] During his tenure, the Clippers managed only two winning seasons and amassed a win–loss record of 607–1153 [23] They made the playoffs only four times, [13] and won only one playoff series [23] He stayed in that capacity for 22 years until October 2008 [7]\n\n\nLater life and death\nIn 2009 Baylor filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against the Clippers, team owner Donald Sterling, team president Andy Roeser, and the NBA He alleged that he was underpaid during his tenure with the team and then fired because of his age and race [24] [25] Baylor later dropped the racial discrimination claims in the suit [26] In 2011, a jury decided in the Clippers' favor on Baylor's remaining claims, finding Baylor's termination was based on the team's poor performance [13] [27] However, Baylor felt vindicated when Sterling was banned for life from the NBA in 2014 after recordings of him making racist comments were publicized by the press [7] [13]\n\n\nPlayer profile\nBaylor was known as an all-around player, excelling at defense, offense, rebounding, and passing At 6'5\", 225lbs, he was short for a forward even for the time period in which he played, but he had the strength to \"muscle through\" defenders, and the finesse and creativity to  maneuver around them, including to rebound missed shots and score second chance points.\n\n\nLegacy\nSince the beginning of his NBA career, Baylor has been considered one of the best basketball players in the world, and his reputation as one of the greatest in history has endured Before Baylor joined the NBA in 1958, the league's play was methodical but mechanical, dominated by set jump shots and running hook shots Baylor introduced a creative and acrobatic playing style that would later be emulated by other NBA superstars such as Julius Erving and Michael Jordan [6] [13] Bill Simmons wrote, \"Along with Russell, Elgin turned a horizontal game into a vertical one.\" [7] Baylor's skill was esteemed by his contemporaries: Oscar Robertson wrote Baylor \"was the first and original high flier\"; Bill Sharman said Baylor was \"the greatest cornerman who ever played pro basketball\"; Tom Heinsohn said, \"Baylor as forward beats out Bird, Julius Erving and everybody else\" [13]\n\n\nNBA career

about \"Elgin_Baylor\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nElgin \"Rabbit\" Baylor was born in Washington, D.C., on September 16, 1934, [6] [7] the son of Uzziel (Lewis) and John Wesley Baylor [8] He began playing basketball when he was 14 [9] Although he grew up near a D.C city recreation center, African Americans were banned from using the facilities, and Baylor had limited access to basketball courts growing up [10] He had two basketball-playing brothers, Sal and Kermit [11] After stints at Southwest Boys Club and Brown Jr High, Baylor was a three-time All-City player in high school [12]\n\n\nCollege career\nDespite his success as a high school basketball player, no major college recruited Baylor because at the time, college scouts did not recruit at black high schools [6] While some colleges were willing to accept Baylor, he did not qualify academically [9] A friend of Baylor's who attended the College of Idaho helped arrange a football scholarship for Baylor for the 1954–55 academic year [6] [9] Baylor never played football for the school, however; instead, he was accepted to the college's basketball team without having to try out [6] He outperformed the other players on the team that season, averaging over 31 points and 20 rebounds per game [6] [9]\n\n\nProfessional career\nThe Minneapolis Lakers used the No 1 overall pick in the 1958 NBA draft to select Baylor, then convinced him to skip his senior year at SU and instead join the pro ranks The team had been unsuccessful since the retirement of its star center George Mikan in 1954 The year prior to Baylor's arrival, the team finished 19–53 – the worst record in the league – with a squad that was slow, bulky and aging It had no permanent home arena to play in, was losing popularity, and in financial trouble Owner Bob Short, who was ready to sell the team, believed Baylor's star athletic talents and all-around game could save the franchise Short told the Los Angeles Times in a 1971 interview: \"If he had turned me down then, I would have been out of business The club would have gone bankrupt.\" [6] [18] Baylor signed with the Lakers for $20,000 per year (equivalent to $210,000 in 2023), a large sum in the NBA at the time [9] According to basketball historian James Fisher, by virtue of his exceptional skills and his central role in the team's business plan, Baylor became the NBA's first franchise player [6]\n\n\nMinneapolis / Los Angeles Lakers (1958–1971)\nThe Minneapolis Lakers used the No 1 overall pick in the 1958 NBA draft to select Baylor, then convinced him to skip his senior year at SU and instead join the pro ranks The team had been unsuccessful since the retirement of its star center George Mikan in 1954 The year prior to Baylor's arrival, the team finished 19–53 – the worst record in the league – with a squad that was slow, bulky and aging It had no permanent home arena to play in, was losing popularity, and in financial trouble Owner Bob Short, who was

[9] According to basketball historian James Fisher, by virtue of his exceptional skills and his central role in the team's business plan, Baylor became the NBA's first franchise player [6]\n\n\nRookie of the Year (1958–1959)\nThe Minneapolis Lakers used the No 1 overall pick in the 1958 NBA draft to select Baylor, then convinced him to skip his senior year at SU and instead join the pro ranks The team had been unsuccessful since the retirement of its star center George Mikan in 1954 The year prior to Baylor's arrival, the team finished 19–53 – the worst record in the league – with a squad that was slow, bulky and aging It had no permanent home arena to play in, was losing popularity, and in financial trouble Owner Bob Short, who was ready to sell the team, believed Baylor's star athletic

virtue of his exceptional skills and his central role in the team's business plan, Baylor became the NBA's first franchise player [6]\n\n\nPeak years (1959–1965)\nIn 1960, the Lakers moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles, drafted Jerry West to play point guard, and hired Fred Schaus who was also the coach during West's college career The duo of Baylor and West, joined in 1968 by center Wilt Chamberlain, led the Lakers to success in the Western Division throughout the 1960s [7] [13] [20]\n\n\nKnee injury and later seasons (1965–1971)\nBaylor suffered a severe knee injury during the opening game of the 1965 Western Division playoffs, which required surgery and left him unable to play in the remainder of the playoffs Although he scored more than 24 points in each of the next four seasons despite his injury, the limitations of knee surgery at the time and the lack of meaningful rehab left him with nagging knee problems, ultimately resulting in surgery on both knees, which impaired his playing ability for the rest of his career [7] [13] [20]\n\n\nCoaching career\nIn 1974, Baylor was hired to be an assistant coach and later the head coach for the New Orleans Jazz, but had a lackluster 86–135 record and was fired following the 1978–79 season, shortly before the team moved to Salt Lake City, Utah [7] [13]\n\n\nExecutive career\nIn 1986, Baylor was hired by the Los Angeles Clippers as the team's vice president of basketball operations He was selected as the NBA Executive of the Year in 2006 [22] During his tenure, the Clippers managed only two winning seasons and amassed a win–loss record of 607–1153 [23] They made the playoffs only four times, [13] and won only one playoff series [23] He stayed in that capacity for 22 years until October 2008 [7]\n\n\nLater life and death\nIn 2009 Baylor filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against the Clippers, team owner Donald Sterling, team president Andy Roeser, and the NBA He alleged that he was underpaid during his tenure with the team and then fired because of his age and race [24] [25] Baylor later dropped the racial discrimination claims in the suit [26] In 2011, a jury decided in the Clippers' favor on Baylor's remaining claims, finding Baylor's termination was based on the team's poor performance [13] [27] However, Baylor felt vindicated when Sterling was banned for life from the NBA in 2014 after recordings of him making racist comments were publicized by the press [7] [13]\n\n\nPlayer profile\nBaylor was known as an all-around player, excelling at defense, offense, rebounding, and passing At 6'5\", 225lbs, he was short for a forward even for the time period in which he played, but he had the strength to \"muscle through\" defenders, and the finesse and creativity to  maneuver around them, including to rebound missed shots and score second chance points.\n\n\nLegacy\nSince the beginning of his NBA career, Baylor has been considered one of the best basketball players in the world, and his reputation as one of the greatest in history has endured Before Baylor joined the NBA in 1958, the league's play was methodical but mechanical, dominated by set jump shots and running hook shots Baylor introduced a creative and acrobatic playing style that would later be emulated by other NBA superstars such as Julius Erving and Michael Jordan [6] [13] Bill Simmons wrote, \"Along with Russell, Elgin turned a horizontal game into a vertical one.\" [7] Baylor's skill was esteemed by his contemporaries: Oscar Robertson wrote Baylor \"was the first and original high flier\"; Bill Sharman said Baylor was \"the greatest cornerman who ever played pro basketball\"; Tom Heinsohn said, \"Baylor as forward beats out Bird, Julius Erving and everybody else\"

{"title": "John_Carpenter", "content": "\nEarly life\nJohn Howard Carpenter was born in Carthage, New York, on January 16, 1948, the son of Milton Jean (née Carter) and music professor Howard Ralph Carpenter [5] In 1953, after his father accepted a job at Western Kentucky University, the family relocated to Bowling Green, Kentucky [6] For much of his childhood, he and his family lived in a log cabin on the university's campus [7] [8] He was interested in films from an early age, particularly the westerns of Howard Hawks and John Ford, as well as 1950s low-budget horror films such as The Thing from Another World (which he would remake as The Thing in 1982) and high-budget sci-fi like Godzilla and Forbidden Planet [9] [10]\n\n\nCareer\nIn a beginning film course at USC Cinema during 1969, Carpenter wrote and directed an 8-minute short film, Captain Voyeur The film was rediscovered in the USC archives in 2011 and proved interesting because it revealed elements that would appear in his later film, Halloween (1978) [15]\n\n\n1960s: Student films and Academy Award\nIn a beginning film course at USC Cinema during 1969, Carpenter wrote and directed an 8-minute short film, Captain Voyeur The film was rediscovered in the USC archives in 2011 and proved interesting because it revealed elements that would appear in his later film, Halloween (1978) [15]\n\n\n1970s: From student films to theatrical releases\nCarpenter's first major film as director, Dark Star (1974), was a science-fiction comedy that he co-wrote with Dan O'Bannon (who later went on to write Alien, borrowing freely from much of Dark Star) The film reportedly cost only $60,000 and was difficult to make as both Carpenter and O'Bannon completed the film by multitasking, with Carpenter doing the musical score as well as the writing, producing, and directing, while O'Bannon acted in the film and did the special effects (which caught the attention of George Lucas who hired him to work with the special effects for the film Star Wars) Carpenter received praise for his ability to make low-budget films [17]\n\n\n1980s: Continued commercial success\nCarpenter followed up the success of Halloween with The Fog (1980), a ghostly revenge tale (co-written by Hill) inspired by horror comics such as Tales from the Crypt [28] and by The Crawling Eye, a 1958 film about monsters hiding in clouds [29]\n\n\n1990s: Commercial decline\nCarpenter's 1990s career is characterized by a number of notable failures including Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1992) and Village of the Damned (1995) Also notable from this decade are Body Bags, a television horror anthology film that was made in collaboration with Tobe Hooper, In the Mouth of Madness (1995), a Lovecraftian homage which did not do well either commercially nor with critics [57] but now has a cult following, [58] Escape from L.A (1996), the sequel of the cult classic Escape from New York, which received mixed reviews but gained a cult following since then [59] [60] and  Vampires (1998), which featured James Woods as the leader of a band of vampire hunters in league with the Catholic Church.\n\n\n2000s: Semi-retirement\nIn 2001, his film Ghosts of Mars was released and was also unsuccessful During 2005, there were remakes of Assault on Precinct 13 and The Fog, the latter being produced by Carpenter himself, though in an interview he defined his involvement as, \"I come in and say hello to everybody Go home.\"\n\n\n2010s: The Ward, focus on music and return to Halloween\nThe Ward, Carpenter's first film since Ghosts of Mars, premiered at Toronto International Film Festival on September 13, 2010, before a limited release in the United States in July 2011 It received generally poor reviews from critics and grossed only $5.3 million worldwide against an estimated $10 million budget As of 2024, it is his most recent directorial effort.\n\n\nStyle and influences\nCarpenter's films are characterized by minimalist lighting and photography, panoramic shots, use of steadicam, and scores he usually composes himself [72] With a few exceptions, [a] he has scored all of his films (some of which he co-scored), most famously the themes from Halloween and Assault on Precinct 13 His music is generally synthesized with accompaniment from piano and atmospherics [73]\n\n\nFilm music and solo records\nIn a 2016 interview, Carpenter stated that it was his father's work as a music teacher which first sparked an interest in him to make music [75] This interest was to play a major role in his later career: he composed the music to most of his films, and the soundtrack to many of those became \"cult\" items for record collectors A 21st-Century revival of his music is due in no small amount to the Death Waltz record company, which reissued several of his soundtracks, including Escape from New York, Halloween II, Halloween III: Season of the Witch, Assault on Precinct 13, They Live, Prince of Darkness, and The Fog [76]\n\n\nPersonal life\nCarpenter met actress Adrienne Barbeau on the set of his television film Someone's Watching Me! (1978) They married on January 1, 1979, and divorced in 1984 During their marriage, she appeared in his films The Fog and Escape from New York [91] They have one son, Cody Carpenter (born May 7, 1984), who became a musician and composer; Cody's godfather is English-American musician Daniel Davies, whose own godfather is Carpenter [92]\n\n\nLegacy\nMany of Carpenter's films have been re-released on DVD as special editions with numerous bonus features Examples of such are: the collector's editions of Halloween, Escape from New York, Christine, The Thing, Assault on Precinct 13, Big Trouble In Little China, and The Fog Some were re-issued with a new anamorphic widescreen transfer In the UK, several of Carpenter's films have been released as DVD with audio commentary by Carpenter and his actors (They Live, with actor/wrestler Roddy Piper, Starman with actor Jeff Bridges, and Prince of Darkness with actor Peter Jason).\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nRecurring collaborators\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nAlbums\n\n\nRemix albums\n\n\nEPs\n\n\nSingles\n\n\nCompilation albums\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**John Carpenter**\n\nJohn Howard Carpenter is an American film director, screenwriter, film composer, and producer.

She made her feature film debut in the Kannada film \"Darshan\" and went on to work in several other films, including Telugu releases like \"Seenu Vasanthi Lakshmi\" (2004), \"Chetna\" (2005), \"Jagapathi\" (2005), \"Good Boy\" (2005), and \"Bhuma\" (2008).

He was a key figure in the resistance against the Portuguese Empire, which had established a significant presence in the region during the 16th century. Kunjali Marakkar's life and exploits have been the subject of numerous historical accounts and literary works, including the Tuhfat-ul-Mujahideen, a 16th-century manuscript written by Zainuddin Makhdoom II.\n\n**Origins of Marakkar**\n\nThe Marakkars originate from a branch of Tamil-speaking merchants within the seafaring community who settled in Kochi. They were involved in trade and engaged in collaboration with the Portuguese. However, in 1524, the Marakkars turned against the Portuguese when the latter disrupted the former's trade networks by purchasing spices and commodities directly from local people in Kochi.\n\n**Kunjali Marakkar I**\n\nKutty Ahmed Ali was a prominent figure in the early years of resistance against the Portuguese. He played a significant role in resisting the Portuguese expansion and was a key advisor to the Zamorin. In 1524, the Zamorin Kingdom helped the Ceylonese king in his campaign to expel the Portuguese from Ceylon, and reduced the Colombo Fort with the help of the Zamorin navy under the command of Ahmed Ali. Later that year, a fleet of Zamorin ships under the command of Ahmed Ali bombarded the fort, and in 1525, they entered the port of Cochin, setting fire to a number of Portuguese vessels and returning safely to Calicut.\n\n**Against the Portuguese Empire**\n\nThe Kunjali IV had rescued a Chinese boy, called Chinali, who was said to have been enslaved on a Portuguese ship. The Kunjali was very fond of him, and he became one of his most feared lieutenants, a Muslim and enemy of the Portuguese. The Portuguese were terrorized by the Kunjali and his Chinese right-hand man. Eventually, after the Portuguese allied with Calicut's Zamorin, under André Furtado de Mendonça, they attacked the Kunjali and Chinali's forces, and they were handed over to the Portuguese by the Samorin after he reneged on a promise to let them go.\n\n**Marakkar Kotta**\n\nThe Marakkars had four harbors under the ambit of the Samoothiri, where they built their galleys. These harbors were Moutingue (Muttungal), Badara (Vadakara), Chombaye (Chambal), and Cangelotte (Kaniyaram Kottu). They were fortified only on the seaside under the patronage of the Samoothiri, who granted these ports to the Marakkar family, who fortified them. These ports were two leagues from each other. The Portuguese made multiple attempts to conquer these fortified ports, without effect or to their own loss, mainly at Badara.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nKunjali Marakkar's legacy is a testament to his bravery and strategic mind in the face of overwhelming odds. He played a significant role in the resistance against the Portuguese Empire, and his exploits have inspired generations of historians and literary figures. His life and work continue to be celebrated in India and around the world, and his legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of standing up against oppression and fighting for freedom.\n\n**Popular Culture**\n\nThe film \"Kunjali Marakkar\" is said to be historically inaccurate, and has been criticized for its portrayal of the historical figure. However, the film has helped to raise awareness about the life and exploits of Kunjali Marakkar, and has sparked a renewed interest in the history of the Malabar region.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Zamorin of Calicut\n* Portuguese Empire\n* Malabar region\n* Tuhfat-ul-Mujahideen\n* Zainuddin Makhdoom II\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* \"The Tuhfat-ul-Mujahideen\" by Zainuddin Makhdoom II\n* \"The Malabar Coast\" by C.

The mother's head is covered in bandages, with only her eyes and mouth visible, and the twins are unnerved by their mother's appearance.\n\nAs the story progresses, the mother begins to exhibit strange behavior, pointedly ignoring Lukas and appearing to only acknowledge Elias in conversation. Despite the fact that it is the middle of summer, the mother orders the twins to keep the blinds closed during the day, imposes a strict rule of silence inside the house, and only permits them to play outdoors. The mother also acts cruel and lashes out at Elias physically when he displays mischievous or disobedient acts, something the boys comment that their mother would never do.\n\nAs the twins struggle to cope with their mother's increasingly erratic behavior, they begin to suspect that something is terribly wrong. They start to question whether their mother is the same person they once knew, and whether she is still their mother at all.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including:\n\n* Susanne Wuest as the mother\n* Elias and Lukas Schwarz as Elias and Lukas, the twin sons\n* Felix Lauffenburger as the father (played in flashbacks)\n* Hannah von Gottberg as the nurse (played in flashbacks)\n\n## Reception\n\nGoodnight Mommy received widespread critical acclaim upon its release.

The film's critical success can be attributed to its unique and unsettling portrayal of a mother's descent into madness, as well as its exploration of themes such as identity, family dynamics, and the breakdown of social norms.\n\n## Cultural Impact\n\nGoodnight Mommy has had a significant impact on popular culture, particularly in the horror genre.

{"title": "Smallpox", "content": "\nClassification\nThere are two forms of the smallpox Variola major is the severe and most common form, with a more extensive rash and higher fever Variola minor is a less common presentation, causing less severe disease, typically discrete smallpox, with historical death rates of 1% or less [32] Subclinical (asymptomatic) infections with variola virus were noted but were not common [33] In addition, a form called variola sine eruptione (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by viral culture [33] In addition, there were two very rare and fulminating types of smallpox, the malignant (flat) and hemorrhagic forms, which were usually fatal.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nThe initial symptoms were similar to other viral diseases that are still extant, such as influenza and the common cold: fever of at least 38.3 °C (101 °F), muscle pain, malaise, headache and fatigue As the digestive tract was commonly involved, nausea, vomiting, and backache often occurred The early prodromal stage usually lasted 2–4 days By days 12–15, the first visible lesions – small reddish spots called enanthem – appeared on mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, palate, and throat, and the temperature fell to near-normal These lesions rapidly enlarged and ruptured, releasing large amounts of virus into the saliva [34]\n\n\nOrdinary\nAt least 90% of smallpox cases among unvaccinated persons were of the ordinary type [33] In this form of the disease, by the second day of the rash the macules had become raised papules By the third or fourth day, the papules had filled with an opalescent fluid to become vesicles This fluid became opaque and turbid within 24–48 hours, resulting in pustules.\n\n\nConfluent\nSometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after scabs had formed over all the lesions In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62% [33]\n\n\nModified\nReferring to the character of the eruption and the rapidity of its development, modified smallpox occurred mostly in previously vaccinated people It was rare in unvaccinated people, with one case study showing 1–2% of modified cases compared to around 25% in vaccinated people In this form, the prodromal illness still occurred but may have been less severe than in the ordinary type There was usually no fever during the evolution of the rash The skin lesions tended to be fewer and evolved more quickly, were more superficial, and may not have shown the uniform characteristic of more typical smallpox [38] Modified smallpox was rarely, if ever, fatal This form of variola major was more easily confused with chickenpox [33]\n\n\nMalignant\nIn malignant-type smallpox (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remained almost flush with the skin at the time when raised vesicles would have formed in the ordinary type It is unknown why some people developed this type Historically, it accounted for 5–10% of cases, and most (72%) were children [3] Malignant smallpox was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted 3–4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of viremia The prodromal symptoms continued even after the onset of the rash [3] The rash on the mucous membranes (enanthem) was extensive Skin lesions matured slowly, were typically confluent or semi-confluent, and by the seventh or eighth day, they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contained little fluid, were soft and velvety to the touch, and may have contained hemorrhages Malignant smallpox was nearly always fatal and death usually occurred between the 8th and 12th day of illness Often, a day or two before death, the lesions turned ashen gray, which, along with abdominal distension, was a bad prognostic sign [3] This form is thought to be caused by deficient cell-mediated immunity to smallpox If the person recovered, the lesions gradually faded and did not form scars or scabs [39]\n\n\nHemorrhagic\nHemorrhagic smallpox is a severe form accompanied by extensive bleeding into the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and viscera This form develops in approximately 2% of infections and occurs mostly in adults [33] Pustules do not typically form in hemorrhagic smallpox Instead, bleeding occurs under the skin, making it look charred and black, [33] hence this form of the disease is also referred to as variola nigra or \"black pox\" [40] Hemorrhagic smallpox has very rarely been caused by variola minor virus [41] While bleeding may occur in mild cases and not affect outcomes, [42] hemorrhagic smallpox is typically fatal [43] Vaccination does not appear to provide any immunity to either form of hemorrhagic smallpox and some cases even occurred among people that were revaccinated shortly before It has two forms [3]\n\n\nEarly\nThe early or fulminant form of hemorrhagic smallpox (referred to as purpura variolosa) begins with a prodromal phase characterized by a high fever, severe headache, and abdominal pain [39] The skin becomes dusky and erythematous, and this is rapidly followed by the development of petechiae and bleeding in the skin, conjunctiva and mucous membranes Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present Some people survive a few days longer, during which time the skin detaches and fluid accumulates under it, rupturing at the slightest injury People are usually conscious until death or shortly before [43] Autopsy reveals petechiae and bleeding in the spleen, kidney, serous membranes, skeletal muscles, pericardium, liver, gonads and bladder [41] Historically, this condition was frequently misdiagnosed, with the correct diagnosis made only at autopsy [41] This form is more likely to occur in pregnant women than in the general population (approximately 16% of cases in unvaccinated pregnant women were early hemorrhagic smallpox, versus roughly 1% in nonpregnant women and adult males) [43] The case fatality rate of early hemorrhagic smallpox approaches 100% [43]\n\n\nLate\nThere is also a later form of hemorrhagic smallpox (referred to late hemorrhagic smallpox, or variolosa pustula hemorrhagica) The prodrome is severe and similar to that observed in early hemorrhagic smallpox, and the fever persists throughout the course of the disease [3] Bleeding appears in the early eruptive period (but later than that seen in purpura variolosa), and the rash is often flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage Hemorrhages in the mucous membranes appear to occur less often than in the early hemorrhagic form [33] Sometimes the rash forms pustules which bleed at the base and then undergo the same process as in ordinary smallpox This form of the disease is characterized by a decrease in all of the elements of the coagulation cascade and an increase in circulating antithrombin [34] This form of smallpox occurs anywhere from 3% to 25% of fatal cases, depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain [36] Most people with the late-stage form die within eight to 10 days of illness Among the few who recover, the hemorrhagic lesions gradually disappear after a long period of convalescence [3] The case fatality rate for late hemorrhagic smallpox is around 90–95% [35] Pregnant women are slightly more likely to experience this form of the disease, though not as much as early hemorrhagic smallpox [3]\n\n\nCause\nSmallpox is caused by infection with variola virus, which belongs to the family Poxviridae, subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, genus Orthopoxvirus.\n\n\nEvolution\nThe date of the appearance of smallpox is not settled It most probably evolved from a terrestrial African rodent virus between 68,000 and 16,000 years ago [44] The wide range of dates is due to the different records used to calibrate the molecular clock One clade was the variola major strains (the more clinically severe form of smallpox) which spread from Asia between 400 and 1,600 years ago A second clade included both alastrim (a phenotypically mild smallpox) described from the American continents and isolates from West Africa which diverged from an ancestral strain between 1,400 and 6,300 years before present This clade further diverged into two subclades at least 800 years ago [45]\n\n\nVirology\nVariola virus is  large and brick-shaped and is approximately 302 to 350 nanometers by 244 to 270 nm, [48] with a single linear double stranded DNA genome 186 kilobase pairs (kbp) in size and containing a hairpin loop at each end [49] [50]\n\n\nVariola major\nThe more common, infectious form of the disease was caused by the variola major virus strain, known for its significantly higher mortality rate compared to its counterpart, variola minor Variola major had a fatality rate of around 30%, while variola minor’s mortality rate was about 1% Throughout the 18th century, variola major was responsible for around 400,000 deaths annually in Europe alone Survivors of the disease often faced lifelong consequences, such as blindness and severe scarring, which were nearly universal among those who recovered [51]\n\n\nVariola minor\nVariola minor virus, also called alastrim, was a less common form of the virus, and much less deadly Although variola minor had the same incubation period and pathogenetic stages as smallpox, it is believed to have had a mortality rate of less than 1%, as compared to variola major's 30% Like variola major, variola minor was spread through inhalation of the virus in the air, which could occur through face-to-face contact or through fomites Infection with variola minor virus conferred immunity against the more dangerous variola major virus.\n\n\nGenome composition\nThe genome of variola major virus is about 186,000 base pairs in length [53] It is made from linear double stranded DNA and contains the coding sequence for about 200 genes [54] The genes are usually not overlapping and typically occur in blocks that point towards the closer terminal region of the genome [55] The coding sequence of the central region of the genome is highly consistent across orthopoxviruses, and the arrangement of genes is consistent across chordopoxviruses [54] [55]\n\n\nGene expression\nGene expression of variola virus occurs entirely within the cytoplasm of the host cell, and follows a distinct progression during infection [55] After entry of an infectious virion into a host cell, synthesis of viral mRNA can be detected within 20 minutes [55] About half of the viral genome is transcribed prior to the replication of viral DNA [55] The first set of expressed genes are transcribed by pre-existing viral machinery packaged within the infecting virion [55] These genes encode the factors necessary for viral DNA synthesis and for transcription of the next set of expressed genes [55] Unlike most DNA viruses, DNA replication in variola virus and other poxviruses takes place within the cytoplasm of the infected cell [55] The exact timing of DNA replication after infection of a host cell varies across the poxviridae [55] Recombination of the genome occurs within actively infected cells [55] Following the onset of viral DNA replication, an intermediate set of genes codes for transcription factors of late gene expression [55] The products of the later genes include transcription factors necessary for transcribing the early genes for new virions, as well as viral RNA polymerase and other essential enzymes for new viral particles [55] These proteins are then packaged into new infectious virions capable of infecting other cells [55]\n\n\nResearch\nTwo live samples of variola major virus remain, one in the United States at the CDC in Atlanta, and one at the Vector Institute in Koltsovo, Russia [56] Research with the remaining virus samples is tightly controlled, and each research proposal must be approved by the WHO and the World Health Assembly (WHA) [56] Most research on poxviruses is performed using the closely related Vaccinia virus as a model organism [55] Vaccinia virus, which is used to vaccinate for smallpox, is also under research as a viral vector for vaccines for unrelated diseases [57]\n\n\nGenetic engineering\nThe WHO currently bans genetic engineering of the variola virus [59] However, in 2004, a committee advisory to the WHO voted in favor of allowing editing of the genome of the two remaining samples of variola major virus to add a marker gene [59] This gene, called GFP, or green fluorescent protein, would cause live samples of the virus to glow green under fluorescent light [60] The insertion of this gene, which would not influence the virulence of the virus, would be the only allowed modification of the genome [60] The committee stated the proposed modification would aid in research of treatments by making it easier to assess whether a potential treatment was effective in killing viral samples [60] The recommendation could only take effect if approved by the WHA [60] When the WHA discussed the proposal in 2005, it refrained from taking a formal vote on the proposal, stating that it would review individual research proposals one at a time [61] Addition of the GFP gene to the Vaccinia genome is routinely performed during research on the closely related Vaccinia virus [62]\n\n\nControversies\nThe public availability of the variola virus complete sequence has raised concerns about the possibility of illicit synthesis of infectious virus [63] Vaccinia, a cousin of the variola virus, was artificially synthesized in 2002 by NIH scientists [64] They used a previously established method that involved using a recombinant viral genome to create a self-replicating bacterial plasmid that produced viral particles [64]\n\n\nTransmission\nSmallpox was highly contagious, but generally spread more slowly and less widely than some other viral diseases, perhaps because transmission required close contact and occurred after the onset of the rash The overall rate of infection was also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage In temperate areas, the number of smallpox infections was highest during the winter and spring In tropical areas, seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year [33] Age distribution of smallpox infections depended on acquired immunity Vaccination immunity declined over time and was probably lost within thirty years [34] Smallpox was not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there was no asymptomatic carrier state [33]\n\n\nMechanism\nOnce inhaled, the variola virus invaded the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat, and respiratory tract From there, it migrated to regional lymph nodes and began to multiply In the initial growth phase, the virus seemed to move from cell to cell, but by around the 12th day, widespread lysis of infected cells occurred and the virus could be found in the bloodstream in large numbers, a condition known as viremia This resulted in the second wave of multiplication in the spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.\n\n\nDiagnosis\nThe clinical definition of ordinary smallpox is an illness with acute onset of fever equal to or greater than 38.3 °C (101 °F) followed by a rash characterized by firm, deep-seated vesicles or pustules in the same stage of development without other apparent cause [33] When a clinical case was observed, smallpox was confirmed using laboratory tests.\n\n\nPrevention\nThe earliest procedure used to prevent smallpox was inoculation with variola minor virus (a method later known as variolation after the introduction of smallpox vaccine to avoid possible confusion), which likely occurred in India, Africa, and China well before the practice arrived in Europe [15] The idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged, as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation [71] Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found as early as the late 10th century, and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century, during the Ming dynasty [72] If successful, inoculation produced lasting immunity to smallpox Because the person was infected with variola virus, a severe infection could result, and the person could transmit smallpox to others Variolation had a 0.5–2 percent mortality rate, considerably less than the 20–30 percent mortality rate of smallpox [33] Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers [73]\n\n\nTreatment\nSmallpox vaccination within three days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in the vast majority of people Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of the disease [77] Other than vaccination, treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock, such as fluid resuscitation People with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns [84]\n\n\nPrognosis\nThe mortality rate from variola minor is approximately 1%, while the mortality rate from variola major is approximately 30% [90]\n\n\nComplications\nComplications of smallpox arise most commonly in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia Respiratory complications tend to develop on about the eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin Secondary bacterial infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication of smallpox When this occurs, the fever usually remains elevated [33]\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest credible clinical evidence of smallpox is found in the descriptions of smallpox-like disease in medical writings from ancient India (as early as 1500 BCE), [91] [92] and China (1122 BCE), [93] as well as a study of the Egyptian mummy of Ramses V (died 1145 BCE) [92] [94] It has been speculated that Egyptian traders brought smallpox to India during the 1st millennium BCE, where it remained as an endemic human disease for at least 2000 years Smallpox was probably introduced into China during the 1st century CE from the southwest, and in the 6th century was carried from China to Japan [3] In Japan, the epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of the population [18] [95] At least seven religious deities have been specifically dedicated to smallpox, such as the god Sopona in the Yoruba religion in West Africa In India, the Hindu goddess of smallpox, Shitala, was worshipped in temples throughout the country [96]\n\n\nDisease emergence\nThe earliest credible clinical evidence of smallpox is found in the descriptions of smallpox-like disease in medical writings from ancient India (as early as 1500 BCE),

[96]\n\n\nEradication\n\n\n\nCosts and benefits\nThe cost of the eradication effort, from 1967 to 1979, was roughly US$300 million Roughly a third came from the developed world, which had largely eradicated smallpox decades earlier The United States, the largest contributor to the program, has reportedly recouped that investment every 26 days since in money not spent on vaccinations and the costs of incidence [138]\n\n\nSince eradication\nThe last case of smallpox in the world occurred in an outbreak in the United Kingdom in 1978 [139] A medical photographer, Janet Parker, contracted the disease at the University of Birmingham Medical School and died on 11 September 1978 Although it has remained unclear how Parker became infected, the source of the infection was established to be the variola virus grown for research purposes at the Medical School laboratory [140] [141] All known stocks of smallpox worldwide were subsequently destroyed or transferred to two WHO-designated reference laboratories with BSL-4 facilities – the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Soviet Union's (now Russia's) State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR [142]\n\n\nSociety and culture\nIn 1763, Pontiac's War broke out as a Native American confederacy led by Pontiac attempted to counter British control over the Great Lakes region [157] [158] [159] A group of Native American warriors laid siege to British-held Fort Pitt on June 22 [160] In response, Henry Bouquet, the commander of the fort, ordered his subordinate Simeon Ecuyer to give smallpox-infested blankets from the infirmary to a Delaware delegation outside the fort Bouquet had discussed this with his superior, Sir Jeffrey Amherst, who wrote to Bouquet stating: \"Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among the disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them.\" Bouquet agreed with the proposal, writing back that \"I will try to inocculate   [sic] the Indians by means of Blankets that may fall in their hands\" [161] On 24 June 1763, William Trent, a local trader and commander of the Fort Pitt militia, wrote, \"Out of our regard for them, we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital I hope it will have the desired effect.\" [162] [157] The effectiveness of this effort to broadcast the disease is unknown There are also accounts that smallpox was used as a weapon during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) [163] [164]\n\n\nBiological warfare\nIn 1763, Pontiac's War broke out as a Native American confederacy led by Pontiac attempted to counter British control over the Great Lakes region [157] [158] [159] A group of Native American warriors laid siege to British-held Fort Pitt on June 22 [160] In response, Henry Bouquet, the commander of the fort, ordered his subordinate Simeon Ecuyer to give smallpox-infested blankets from the infirmary to a Delaware delegation outside the fort Bouquet had discussed this with his superior, Sir Jeffrey Amherst, who wrote to Bouquet stating: \"Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among the disaffected tribes of Indians?

It was caused by the variola virus, which belongs to the family Poxviridae, subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, genus Orthopoxvirus.\n\n**Classification**\n\nThere are two main forms of smallpox: variola major and variola minor. Variola major is the more severe and common form, with a higher fever and more extensive rash. Variola minor is a less common and less severe form, with a milder rash and lower fever.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nThe initial symptoms of smallpox are similar to other viral diseases, such as influenza and the common cold. They include fever, muscle pain, malaise, headache, and fatigue. The early prodromal stage usually lasts 2-4 days. The rash typically appears on the mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, palate, and throat, and then spreads to other parts of the body. The rash is characterized by small reddish spots called enanthem, which rapidly enlarge and rupture, releasing large amounts of virus into the saliva.\n\n**Ordinary Smallpox**\n\nAt least 90% of smallpox cases among unvaccinated persons were of the ordinary type. In this form of the disease, the rash typically appears on the second day of the rash, and the macules become raised papules. The papules then fill with an opalescent fluid to become vesicles, which become opaque and turbid within 24-48 hours, resulting in pustules.\n\n**Confluent Smallpox**\n\nIn some cases, the blisters merge into sheets, forming a confluent rash. This type of smallpox is often more severe and can be fatal. Patients with confluent smallpox often remain ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions.\n\n**Modified Smallpox**\n\nModified smallpox occurs mostly in previously vaccinated people. It is rare in unvaccinated people, with one case study showing 1-2% of modified cases compared to around 25% in vaccinated people. In this form, the prodromal illness is often less severe than in the ordinary type, and there may be no fever during the evolution of the rash. The skin lesions tend to be fewer and evolve more quickly, are more superficial, and may not show the uniform characteristic of more typical smallpox.\n\n**Malignant Smallpox**\n\nMalignant smallpox, also known as flat smallpox, is a rare and severe form of the disease. It is characterized by a severe prodromal phase, prolonged high fever, and extensive skin lesions. The rash on the mucous membranes (enanthem) is extensive, and the skin lesions mature slowly, are typically confluent or semi-confluent, and by the seventh or eighth day, they are flat and appear to be buried in the skin.\n\n**Hemorrhagic Smallpox**\n\nHemorrhagic smallpox is a severe form of the disease, characterized by extensive bleeding into the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and viscera. It develops in approximately 2% of infections and occurs mostly in adults. Pustules do not typically form in hemorrhagic smallpox, and bleeding occurs under the skin, making it look charred and black.\n\n**Cause**\n\nSmallpox is caused by infection with variola virus, which belongs to the family Poxviridae, subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, genus Orthopoxvirus. The virus is large and brick-shaped, approximately 302-350 nanometers by 244-270 nanometers, with a single linear double-stranded DNA genome 186 kilobase pairs (kbp) in size and containing a hairpin loop at each end.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nThe date of the appearance of smallpox is not settled, but it is believed to have evolved from a terrestrial African rodent virus between 68,000 and 16,000 years ago. The wide range of dates is due to the different records used to calibrate the molecular clock.\n\n**Virology**\n\nVariola virus is a large and complex virus, with a genome that is approximately 186 kbp in size. It has a single linear double-stranded DNA molecule, with a hairpin loop at each end. The virus has a complex replication cycle, involving multiple stages of transcription and replication.\n\n**Transmission**\n\nSmallpox was highly contagious, but generally spread more slowly and less widely than some other viral diseases. It was transmitted through close contact, after the onset of the rash, and required a relatively short duration of infectiousness.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe clinical definition of ordinary smallpox is an illness with acute onset of fever equal to or greater than 38.3°C (101°F) followed by a rash characterized by firm, deep-seated vesicles or pustules in the same stage of development without other apparent cause.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe earliest procedure used to prevent smallpox was inoculation with variola minor virus (a method later known as variolation after the introduction of smallpox vaccine to avoid possible confusion). This method was practiced in India, Africa, and China well before its introduction in Europe.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nSmallpox vaccination within three days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in the vast majority of people. Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of the disease. Other than vaccination, treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe mortality rate from variola minor is approximately 1%, while the mortality rate from variola major is approximately 30%.\n\n**Complications**\n\nComplications of smallpox arise most commonly in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia.

common form, with a more extensive rash and higher fever Variola minor is a less common presentation, causing less severe disease, typically discrete smallpox, with historical death rates of 1% or less [32] Subclinical (asymptomatic) infections with variola virus were noted but were not common [33] In addition, a form called variola sine eruptione (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by viral culture [33] In addition, there were two very rare and fulminating types of smallpox, the malignant (flat) and hemorrhagic forms, which were usually fatal.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nThe initial symptoms were similar to other viral diseases that are still extant, such as influenza and the common cold: fever of at least 38.3 °C (101 °F), muscle pain, malaise, headache and fatigue As the digestive tract was commonly involved, nausea, vomiting, and backache often occurred The early prodromal stage usually lasted 2–4 days By days 12–15, the first visible lesions – small reddish spots called enanthem – appeared on mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, palate, and throat, and the temperature fell to near-normal These lesions rapidly enlarged and ruptured, releasing large amounts of virus into the saliva [34]\n\n\nOrdinary\nAt least 90% of smallpox cases among unvaccinated persons were of the ordinary type [33] In this form of the disease, by the second day of the rash the macules had become raised papules By the third or fourth day, the papules had filled with an opalescent fluid to become vesicles This fluid became opaque and turbid within 24–48 hours, resulting in pustules.\n\n\nConfluent\nSometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after scabs had formed over all the lesions In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62% [33]\n\n\nModified\nReferring to the character of the eruption and the rapidity of its development, modified smallpox occurred mostly in previously vaccinated people It was rare in unvaccinated people, with one case study showing 1–2% of modified cases compared to around 25% in vaccinated people In this form, the prodromal illness still occurred but may have been less severe than in the ordinary type There was usually no fever during the

even after the onset of the rash [3] The rash on the mucous membranes (enanthem) was extensive Skin lesions matured slowly, were typically confluent or semi-confluent, and by the seventh or eighth day, they were flat and appeared to be buried in the skin Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contained little fluid, were soft and velvety to the touch, and may have contained hemorrhages Malignant smallpox was nearly always fatal and death usually occurred between the 8th and 12th day of illness Often, a day or two before death, the lesions turned ashen gray, which, along with abdominal distension, was a bad prognostic sign [3] This form is thought to be caused by deficient cell-mediated immunity to smallpox If the person recovered, the lesions gradually faded and did not form scars or scabs [39]\n\n\nHemorrhagic\nHemorrhagic smallpox is a severe form accompanied by extensive bleeding into the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and viscera This form develops in approximately 2% of infections and occurs mostly in adults [33] Pustules do not typically form in hemorrhagic smallpox Instead, bleeding occurs under the skin, making it look charred and black, [33] hence this form of the disease is also referred to as variola nigra or \"black pox\" [40] Hemorrhagic smallpox has very rarely been caused by variola minor virus [41] While bleeding may occur in mild cases and not affect outcomes, [42] hemorrhagic smallpox is typically fatal [43] Vaccination does not appear to provide any immunity to either form of hemorrhagic smallpox and some cases even occurred among people that were revaccinated shortly before It has two forms [3]\n\n\nEarly\nThe early or fulminant form of hemorrhagic smallpox (referred to as purpura variolosa) begins with a prodromal phase characterized by a high fever, severe headache, and abdominal pain [39] The skin becomes dusky and erythematous, and this is rapidly followed by the development of petechiae and bleeding in the skin, conjunctiva and mucous membranes Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present Some people survive a few days longer, during which time the skin detaches and fluid accumulates under it, rupturing at the slightest injury People are usually conscious until death or shortly before [43] Autopsy reveals petechiae and bleeding in the spleen, kidney, serous membranes, skeletal muscles, pericardium, liver, gonads and bladder [41] Historically, this condition was frequently misdiagnosed, with the correct diagnosis made only at autopsy [41] This form is more likely to occur in pregnant women than in the general population (approximately 16% of cases in unvaccinated pregnant women were early hemorrhagic smallpox, versus roughly 1% in nonpregnant women and adult males) [43] The case fatality rate of early hemorrhagic smallpox approaches 100% [43]\n\n\nLate\nThere is also a later form of hemorrhagic smallpox (referred to late hemorrhagic smallpox, or variolosa pustula hemorrhagica) The prodrome is severe and similar to that observed in early hemorrhagic smallpox, and the fever persists throughout the course of the disease [3] Bleeding appears in the early eruptive period (but later than that seen in purpura variolosa), and the rash is often flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage Hemorrhages in the mucous membranes appear to occur less often than in the early hemorrhagic form [33] Sometimes the rash forms pustules which bleed at the base and then undergo the same process as in ordinary smallpox This form of the disease is characterized by a decrease in all of the elements of the coagulation cascade and an increase in circulating antithrombin [34] This form of smallpox occurs anywhere from 3% to 25% of fatal cases, depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain [36] Most people with the late-stage form die within eight to 10 days of illness Among the few who recover, the hemorrhagic lesions gradually disappear after a long period of convalescence [3] The case fatality rate for late hemorrhagic smallpox is around 90–95% [35] Pregnant women are slightly more likely to experience this form of the disease, though not as much as early hemorrhagic smallpox [3]\n\n\nCause\nSmallpox is caused by infection with variola virus, which belongs to the family Poxviridae, subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, genus Orthopoxvirus.\n\n\nEvolution\nThe date of the appearance of smallpox is not settled It most probably evolved from a terrestrial African rodent virus between 68,000 and 16,000 years ago [44] The wide range of dates is due to the different records used to calibrate the molecular clock One clade was the variola major strains (the more clinically severe form of smallpox) which spread from Asia between 400 and 1,600 years ago A second clade included both alastrim (a phenotypically mild smallpox) described from the American continents and isolates from West Africa which diverged from an ancestral strain between 1,400 and 6,300 years before present This clade further diverged into two subclades at least 800 years ago [45]\n\n\nVirology\nVariola virus is  large and brick-shaped and is approximately 302 to 350 nanometers by 244 to 270 nm, [48] with a single linear double stranded DNA genome 186 kilobase pairs (kbp) in size and containing a hairpin loop at each end [49] [50]\n\n\nVariola major\nThe more common, infectious form of the disease was caused by the variola major virus strain, known for its significantly higher mortality rate compared to its counterpart, variola minor Variola major had a fatality rate of around 30%, while variola minor’s mortality rate was about 1% Throughout the 18th century, variola major was responsible for around 400,000 deaths annually in Europe alone Survivors of the disease often faced lifelong consequences, such as blindness and severe scarring, which were nearly universal among those who recovered [51]\n\n\nVariola minor\nVariola minor virus, also called alastrim, was a less common form of the virus, and much less deadly Although variola minor had the same incubation period and pathogenetic stages as smallpox, it is believed to have had a mortality rate of less than 1%, as compared to variola major's 30% Like variola major, variola minor was spread through inhalation of the virus in the air, which could occur through face-to-face contact or through fomites Infection with variola minor virus conferred immunity against the more dangerous variola major virus.\n\n\nGenome composition\nThe genome of variola major virus is about 186,000 base pairs in length [53] It is made from linear double stranded DNA and contains the coding sequence for about 200 genes [54] The genes are usually not overlapping and typically occur in blocks that point towards the closer terminal region of the genome [55] The coding sequence of the central region of the genome is highly consistent across orthopoxviruses, and the arrangement of genes is consistent across chordopoxviruses [54] [55]\n\n\nGene expression\nGene expression of variola virus occurs entirely within the cytoplasm of the host cell, and follows a distinct progression during infection [55] After entry of an infectious virion into a host cell, synthesis of viral mRNA can be detected within 20 minutes [55] About half of the viral genome is transcribed prior to the replication of viral DNA [55] The first set of expressed genes are transcribed by pre-existing viral machinery packaged within the infecting virion [55] These genes encode the factors necessary for viral DNA synthesis and for transcription of the next set of expressed genes [55] Unlike most DNA viruses, DNA replication in variola virus and other poxviruses takes place within the cytoplasm of the infected cell [55] The exact timing of DNA replication after infection of a host cell varies across the poxviridae [55] Recombination of the genome occurs within actively infected cells [55] Following the onset of viral DNA replication, an intermediate set of genes codes for transcription factors of late gene expression [55] The products of the later genes include transcription factors necessary for transcribing the early genes for new virions, as well as viral RNA polymerase and other essential enzymes for new viral particles [55] These proteins are then packaged into new infectious virions capable of infecting other cells [55]\n\n\nResearch\nTwo live samples of variola major virus remain, one in the United States at the CDC in Atlanta, and one at the Vector Institute in Koltsovo, Russia [56] Research with the remaining virus samples is tightly controlled, and each research proposal must be approved by the WHO and the World Health Assembly (WHA) [56] Most research on poxviruses is performed using the closely related Vaccinia virus as a model organism [55] Vaccinia virus, which is used to vaccinate for smallpox, is also under research as a viral vector for vaccines for unrelated diseases [57]\n\n\nGenetic engineering\nThe WHO currently bans genetic engineering of the variola virus [59] However, in 2004, a committee advisory to the WHO voted in favor of allowing editing of the genome of the two remaining samples of variola major virus to add a marker gene [59] This gene, called GFP, or green fluorescent protein, would cause live samples of the virus to glow green under fluorescent light [60] The insertion of this gene, which would not influence the virulence of the virus, would be the only allowed modification of the genome [60] The committee stated the proposed modification would aid in research of treatments by making it easier to assess whether a potential treatment was effective in killing viral samples [60] The recommendation could only take effect if approved by the WHA [60] When the WHA discussed the proposal in 2005, it refrained from taking a formal vote on the proposal, stating that it would review individual research proposals one at a time [61] Addition of the GFP gene to the Vaccinia genome is routinely performed during research on the closely related Vaccinia virus [62]\n\n\nControversies\nThe public availability of the variola virus complete sequence has raised concerns about the possibility of illicit synthesis of infectious virus [63] Vaccinia, a cousin of the variola virus, was artificially synthesized in 2002 by NIH scientists [64] They used a previously established method that involved using a recombinant viral genome to create a self-replicating bacterial plasmid that produced viral particles [64]\n\n\nTransmission\nSmallpox was highly contagious, but generally spread more slowly and less widely than some other viral diseases, perhaps because transmission required close contact and occurred after the onset of the rash The overall rate of infection was also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage In temperate areas, the number of smallpox infections was highest during the winter and spring In tropical areas, seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year [33] Age distribution of smallpox infections depended on acquired immunity Vaccination immunity declined over time and was probably lost within thirty years [34] Smallpox was not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there was no asymptomatic carrier state [33]\n\n\nMechanism\nOnce inhaled, the variola virus invaded the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat, and respiratory tract From there, it migrated to regional lymph nodes and began to multiply In the initial growth phase, the virus seemed to move from cell to cell, but by around the 12th day, widespread lysis of infected cells occurred and the virus could be found in the bloodstream in large numbers, a condition known as viremia This resulted in the second wave of multiplication in the spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.\n\n\nDiagnosis\nThe clinical definition of ordinary smallpox is an illness with acute onset of fever equal to or greater than 38.3 °C (101 °F) followed by a rash characterized by firm, deep-seated vesicles or pustules in the same stage of development without other apparent cause [33] When a clinical case was observed, smallpox was confirmed using laboratory tests.\n\n\nPrevention\nThe earliest procedure used to prevent smallpox was inoculation with variola minor virus (a method later known as variolation after the introduction of smallpox vaccine to avoid possible confusion), which likely occurred in India, Africa, and China well before the practice arrived in Europe [15] The idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged, as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation [71] Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found as early as the late 10th century, and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century, during the Ming dynasty [72] If successful, inoculation produced lasting immunity to smallpox Because the person was infected with variola virus, a severe infection could result, and the person could transmit smallpox to others Variolation had a 0.5–2 percent mortality rate, considerably less than the 20–30 percent mortality rate of smallpox [33] Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers [73]\n\n\nTreatment\nSmallpox vaccination within three days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in the vast majority of people Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of the disease [77] Other than vaccination, treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock, such as fluid resuscitation People with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns [84]\n\n\nPrognosis\nThe mortality rate from variola minor is approximately 1%, while the mortality rate from variola major is approximately 30% [90]\n\n\nComplications\nComplications of smallpox arise most commonly in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia Respiratory complications tend to develop on about the eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin Secondary bacterial infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication of smallpox When this occurs, the fever usually remains elevated [33]\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest credible clinical evidence of smallpox is found in the descriptions of smallpox-like disease in medical writings from ancient India (as early as 1500 BCE), [91] [92] and China (1122 BCE), [93] as well as a study of the Egyptian mummy of Ramses V (died 1145 BCE) [92] [94] It has been speculated that Egyptian traders brought smallpox to India during the 1st millennium BCE, where it remained as an endemic human disease for at least 2000 years Smallpox was probably introduced into China during the 1st century CE from the southwest, and in the 6th century was carried from China to Japan [3] In Japan, the epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of the population [18] [95] At least seven religious deities have been specifically dedicated to smallpox, such as the god Sopona in the Yoruba religion in West Africa In India, the Hindu goddess of smallpox, Shitala, was worshipped in temples throughout the country [96]\n\n\nDisease emergence\nThe earliest credible clinical evidence of smallpox is

Africa In India, the Hindu goddess of smallpox, Shitala, was worshipped in temples throughout the country [96]\n\n\nEradication\n\n\n\nCosts and benefits\nThe cost of the eradication effort, from 1967 to 1979, was roughly US$300 million Roughly a third came from the developed world, which had largely eradicated smallpox decades earlier The United States, the largest contributor to the program, has reportedly recouped that investment every 26 days since in money not spent on vaccinations and the costs of incidence [138]\n\n\nSince eradication\nThe last case of smallpox in the world occurred in an outbreak in the United Kingdom in 1978 [139] A medical photographer, Janet Parker, contracted the disease at the University of Birmingham Medical School and died on 11 September 1978 Although it has remained unclear how Parker became infected, the source of the infection was established to be the variola virus grown for research purposes at the Medical School laboratory [140] [141] All known stocks of smallpox worldwide were subsequently destroyed or transferred to two WHO-designated reference laboratories with BSL-4 facilities – the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Soviet Union's (now Russia's) State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR [142]\n\n\nSociety and culture\nIn 1763, Pontiac's War broke out as a Native American confederacy led by Pontiac attempted to counter British control over the Great Lakes region [157] [158] [159] A group of Native American warriors laid siege to British-held Fort Pitt on June 22 [160] In response, Henry Bouquet, the commander of the fort, ordered his subordinate Simeon Ecuyer to give smallpox-infested blankets from the infirmary to a Delaware delegation outside the fort Bouquet had discussed this with his superior, Sir Jeffrey Amherst, who wrote to Bouquet stating: \"Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among the disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them.\" Bouquet agreed with the proposal, writing back that \"I will try to inocculate   [sic] the Indians by means of Blankets that may fall in their hands\" [161] On 24 June 1763, William Trent, a local trader and commander of the Fort Pitt militia, wrote, \"Out of our regard for them, we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital I hope it will have the desired effect.\" [162] [157] The effectiveness of this effort to broadcast the disease is unknown There are also accounts that smallpox was used as a weapon during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) [163] [164]\n\n\nBiological warfare\nIn 1763, Pontiac's War broke out as a Native American confederacy led by Pontiac attempted to counter British control over the Great Lakes region [157] [158] [159] A group of Native American warriors laid siege to British-held Fort Pitt on June 22 [160] In response, Henry Bouquet, the commander of the fort, ordered his subordinate Simeon Ecuyer to give smallpox-infested blankets from the infirmary to a Delaware delegation outside the fort Bouquet had discussed this with his superior, Sir Jeffrey Amherst, who wrote to Bouquet stating: \"Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among the disaffected tribes of Indians?

Kolkata Knight Riders–Royal Challengers Bangalore rivalry\n\nThe Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) are two of the most successful teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The rivalry between the two teams has been one of the most intense and thrilling in the history of the league.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore were two of the founding teams of the Indian Premier League, which was launched in 2008. The two teams have been rivaling each other since the inception of the league, and their matches are always highly anticipated and closely contested.\n\n## Head-to-head summary\n\nThe Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore have played each other on numerous occasions since the launch of the IPL. The two teams have a rich history of rivalry, with the KKR emerging victorious in several matches, while the RCB have also triumphed on several occasions.\n\n## 2008\n\nThe Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore played their inaugural match of the IPL in 2008 at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. The RCB won the toss and elected to bowl, and the KKR posted a mammoth total of 222 runs for 3 wickets in 20 overs, thanks to a marvellous inning by Brendon McCullum, who scored 158* in 73 balls and became the first centurion of the tournament.\n\n## 2009\n\nThe 100th match of the Indian Premier League saw both teams playing against each other at the SuperSport Park, Centurion, as the tournament was shifted to South Africa due to the 2009 Indian general election.

{"title": "Jurassic_Park_(film)", "content": "\nPlot\nIndustrialist John Hammond has created Jurassic Park, a theme park of cloned dinosaurs, on the tropical island Isla Nublar, located off of the coast of Costa Rica After a Velociraptor kills a dinosaur handler, the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand a safety certification Gennaro invites chaotician Ian Malcolm, and Hammond invites paleontologist Alan Grant and paleobotanist Ellie Sattler Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live Brachiosaurus and other dinosaurs At the park's visitor center, the group learns that the cloning was accomplished by extracting dinosaur DNA from prehistoric mosquitoes preserved in amber DNA from frogs, among other animals, were used to fill in gaps in the dinosaurs' genome.\n\n\nCast\nMichael Crichton originally conceived a screenplay about a graduate student who recreates a dinosaur He continued to wrestle with his fascination with dinosaurs and cloning until he began writing the novel Jurassic Park [9] Before its publication, Steven Spielberg learned of the novel in October 1989, while he was discussing a screenplay with Crichton that would become the television series ER [10] Spielberg recognized what really fascinated him about Jurassic Park was it was \"a really credible look at how dinosaurs might someday be brought back alongside modern mankind\", going beyond a simple monster movie [11]\n\n\nProduction\nMichael Crichton originally conceived a screenplay about a graduate student who recreates a dinosaur He continued to wrestle with

really credible look at how dinosaurs might someday be brought back alongside modern mankind\", going beyond a simple monster movie [11]\n\n\nWriting\nUniversal paid Crichton a further $500,000 to adapt his own novel, [27] which he had finished by the time Spielberg was filming Hook Crichton noted that because the book was \"fairly long\", his script had about 10 to 20 percent of the novel's content; scenes were dropped for budgetary and practical reasons, and the violence was toned down [28] Malia Scotch Marmo began a script rewrite in October 1991 over a five-month period, merging Ian Malcolm with Alan Grant [29]\n\n\nCasting\nWilliam Hurt was initially offered the role of Alan Grant, but turned it down without reading the script [37] Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss were also considered for the role, but they were deemed too expensive [38] Harrison Ford and Tim Robbins were also offered the role [39] [40] before Sam Neill was cast three or four weeks before filming began Neill said \"it all happened real quick I hadn't read the book, knew nothing about it, hadn't heard anything about it, and in a matter of weeks I'm working with Spielberg\" [41] Janet Hirshenson, the film's casting director, felt Jeff Goldblum was right to play Ian Malcolm after reading the novel Jim Carrey also auditioned for the role [42] According to Hirshenson, Carrey \"was terrific, too, but I think pretty quickly we all loved the idea of Jeff\" [41]\n\n\nFilming\nAfter 25 months of pre-production, filming began on August 24, 1992, on the Hawaiian island of Kauaʻi [52] While the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica, the novel's settings, were considered as locations, Spielberg's concerns over infrastructure and accessibility made him choose a place he had already worked [11] The three-week shoot involved various daytime exteriors for Isla Nublar's forests [12] On September 11, Hurricane Iniki passed directly over Kauaʻi, costing a day of shooting [53] Several of the storm scenes from the film are of actual footage shot during the hurricane The scheduled shoot of the Gallimimus chase was moved to Kualoa Ranch on the island of Oahu One of the early scenes had to be created by digitally animating a still shot of scenery [23] The opening scene was shot in Haiku, on Maui, [54] with additional scenes filmed on the \"forbidden island\" of Niihau [55] The exterior of the Visitor Center was a large façade constructed on the grounds of the Valley House Plantation Estate in Kauai [56] Samuel L Jackson was to film a lengthy death scene where his character is chased and killed by raptors, but the set was destroyed by Hurricane Iniki [51]\n\n\nDinosaurs on screen\nDespite the film title's referencing the Jurassic period, Brachiosaurus and Dilophosaurus are the only dinosaurs featured that lived during that time; the other species featured did not exist until the Cretaceous period [72] This is acknowledged in the film during a scene where Dr Grant describes the ferocity of the Velociraptor to a young boy, saying: \"Try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period\" [73]\n\n\nPost-production\nSpecial effects work continued on the film, with Tippett's unit adjusting to new technology with Dinosaur Input Devices: [93] models that fed information into computers to allow them to animate the characters like stop-motion puppets In addition, they acted out scenes with the raptors and Gallimimus As well as the computer-generated dinosaurs, ILM also created elements such as water splashing and digital face replacement for Ariana Richards's stunt double [16] Compositing the dinosaurs onto the live action scenes took around an hour Rendering the dinosaurs often took two to four hours per frame, and rendering the T rex in the rain took six hours per

movie [11]\n\n\nWriting\nUniversal paid Crichton a further $500,000 to adapt his own novel, [27] which he had finished by the time Spielberg was filming Hook Crichton noted that because the book was \"fairly long\", his script had about 10 to 20 percent of the novel's content; scenes were dropped for budgetary and practical reasons, and the violence was toned down [28] Malia Scotch Marmo began a script rewrite in October 1991 over a five-month period, merging Ian Malcolm with Alan Grant [29]\n\n\nCasting\nWilliam Hurt was initially offered the role of Alan Grant, but turned it down without reading the script [37] Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss were also considered for the role, but they were deemed too expensive [38] Harrison Ford and Tim Robbins were also offered the role [39] [40]

August 24, 1992, on the Hawaiian island of Kauaʻi [52] While the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica, the novel's settings, were considered as locations, Spielberg's concerns over infrastructure and accessibility made him choose a place he had already worked [11] The three-week shoot involved various daytime exteriors for Isla Nublar's forests [12] On September 11, Hurricane Iniki passed directly over Kauaʻi, costing a day of shooting [53] Several of the storm scenes from the film are of actual footage shot during the hurricane The scheduled shoot of the Gallimimus chase was moved to Kualoa Ranch on the island of Oahu One of the early scenes had to be created by digitally animating a still shot of scenery [23] The opening scene was shot in Haiku, on Maui, [54] with additional scenes filmed on the \"forbidden island\" of Niihau [55] The exterior of the Visitor Center was a large façade constructed on the grounds of the Valley House Plantation Estate in Kauai [56] Samuel L Jackson was to film a lengthy death scene where his character is chased and killed by raptors, but the set was destroyed by Hurricane Iniki [51]\n\n\nDinosaurs on screen\nDespite the film title's referencing the Jurassic period, Brachiosaurus and Dilophosaurus are the only dinosaurs featured that lived during that time; the other species featured did not exist until the Cretaceous period [72] This is acknowledged in the film during a scene where Dr Grant describes the ferocity of the Velociraptor to a young boy, saying: \"Try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period\" [73]\n\n\nPost-production\nSpecial effects work continued on the film, with Tippett's unit adjusting to new technology with Dinosaur Input Devices: [93] models that fed information into computers to allow them to animate the characters like stop-motion puppets In addition, they acted out scenes with the raptors and Gallimimus As well as the computer-generated dinosaurs, ILM also created elements such as water splashing and digital face replacement for Ariana Richards's stunt double [16] Compositing the dinosaurs onto the live action scenes took around an hour Rendering the dinosaurs often took two to four hours per frame, and rendering the T rex in the rain took six hours per frame [94]\n\n\nMusic\nJohn Williams began scoring the film at the end of February, and it was recorded a month

Josefa Edralin (1893–1988) [66] Mariano Marcos was a lawyer and congressman from Ilocos Norte, Philippines [67] He was executed by Filipino guerillas in 1945 for being a Japanese propagandist and collaborator during World War II Drawn and quartered with the use of carabaos, his remains were left hanging on a tree [68] [69] [70] Josefa Marcos was a schoolteacher who would far outlive her husband – dying in 1988, two years after the Marcos family left her in Malacañang Palace when they fled into exile after the 1986 People Power Revolution, and only one year before her son Ferdinand's death [71]\n\n\nEducation\nMarcos studied law at the University of the Philippines (UP) in Manila, attending the College of Law He excelled in both curricular and extra-curricular activities, becoming a member of the university's swimming, boxing, and wrestling teams He was also an accomplished orator, debater, and writer for the student newspaper While attending the UP College of Law, he became a member of the Upsilon Sigma Phi, where he met his future colleagues in government and some of his staunchest critics [82] [page needed] [83] [page needed]\n\n\nAssassination of Julio Nalundasan\nMarcos first gained national notoriety over the murder of Julio Nalundasan Nalundasan, Mariano Marcos's political rival, was killed with a single rifle shot at his home in Batac on September 21, 1935, the day after he had defeated Marcos a second time for a seat in the National Assembly [89]\n\n\nWorld War II (1939–1945)\nMarcos's military service during World War II has been the subject of debate and controversy, both in the Philippines and in international military circles [29]\n\n\nPost-WWII and congressional career (1949–1965)\nAfter the surrender of the Japanese and the end of World War II, the American government became preoccupied with setting up the Marshall Plan to revive the economies of the western hemisphere, and quickly backtracked from its interests in the Philippines, granting the islands independence on July 4, 1946 [101] [102] After the war, Marcos was one of only eleven lawyers confirmed by the new government as a special prosecutor with the office of the Solicitor General tasked to try by \"process of law and justice\" all those accused of collaboration with the Japanese [103] Eventually, Marcos ran for his father's old post as representative of the 2nd district of Ilocos Norte and won three consecutive terms, serving in the House of Representatives from 1949 to 1959 [104]\n\n\nAdministration and cabinet\nMarcos's first term began with his inauguration on December 30, 1965, and ended when he was inaugurated for his second term on December 30, 1969 [105]\n\n\nFirst term (1965–1969)\nMarcos's first term began with his inauguration on December 30, 1965, and ended when he was inaugurated for his second term on December 30, 1969 [105]\n\n\nPresidential campaign\nMarcos ran a populist campaign emphasizing that he was a bemedalled war hero emerging from World War II In 1962, Marcos would claim to be the most decorated war hero of the Philippines by garnering almost every medal and decoration that the Filipino and American governments could give to a soldier [112] Included in his claim of 27 war medals and decorations are that of the Distinguished Service Cross and the Medal of Honor [112] [113] According to Primitivo Mijares, author of the book The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos, the opposition Liberal Party would later confirm that many of his war medals were only acquired in 1962 to aid in his reelection campaign for the Senate, not for his presidential campaign [60] Marcos won the presidency in 1965 [114]\n\n\nInauguration\nFerdinand Marcos was inaugurated to his first term as the 10th president of the Philippines on December 30, 1965, after winning the Philippine presidential election of 1965 against the incumbent president, Diosdado Macapagal His inauguration marked the beginning of his two-decade long stay in power, even though the 1935 Philippine Constitution had set a limit of only two four-year terms of office.\n\n\nExpansion of the Philippine military\nOne of Marcos's earliest initiatives upon becoming president was to significantly expand the Philippine military In an unprecedented move, Marcos chose to concurrently serve as his own defense secretary, allowing him to have a direct hand in running the military [105] He also significantly increased the budget of the armed forces, tapping them in civil projects such as the construction of schools Generals loyal to Marcos were allowed to stay in their positions past their retirement age, or were rewarded with civilian government posts, leading Senator Benigno Aquino Jr to accuse Marcos in 1968 of trying to establish \"a garrison state\" [108]\n\n\nVietnam War\nUnder intense pressure from the administration of Lyndon B Johnson, [109] Marcos reversed his pre-presidency position of not sending Philippine forces to Vietnam War, [109] [115] and consented to a limited involvement, [116] asking Congress to approve sending a combat engineer unit Despite opposition to the new plan, the Marcos government gained Congressional approval and Philippine troops were sent from the middle of 1966 as the Philippines Civic Action Group (PHILCAG) PHILCAG reached a strength of some 1,600 troops in 1968 and between 1966 and 1970 over 10,000 Filipino soldiers served in South Vietnam, mainly being involved in civilian infrastructure projects [117] [118]\n\n\nLoans for construction projects\nWith an eye toward becoming the first president of the third republic to be reelected to a second term, Marcos began taking up massive foreign loans to fund the \"rice, roads, and school buildings\" he promised in his reelection campaign With tax revenues unable to fund his administration's 70% increase in infrastructure spending from 1966 to 1970, Marcos began tapping foreign loans, creating a budget deficit 72% higher than the Philippine government's annual deficit from 1961 to 1965 [105]\n\n\nJabidah exposé and Muslim reactions\nIn March 1968 a Muslim man named Jibin Arula was fished out of the waters of Manila Bay, having been shot He was brought to then-Cavite Governor Delfin N Montano, to whom he recounted the story of the Jabidah massacre, saying that numerous Moro army recruits had been executed en-masse by members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on March 18, 1968 [110] [better source needed] This became the subject of a senate exposé by opposition Senator Benigno Aquino Jr [119] [120]\n\n\n1969 presidential campaign\nFerdinand Marcos's campaign for a second term formally began with his nomination as the presidential candidate of the Nacionalista Party at its July 1969 general meeting A meeting of the party's ruling junta had met a week earlier to assure that the nomination would be unanimous [126] Under the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines which was in force at the time, Marcos was supposed to be allowed a maximum of two four-year terms as president [105]\n\n\n1969 balance of payments crisis\nDuring the campaign, Marcos spent $50 million worth in debt-funded infrastructure, triggering a balance of payments crisis [132] The Marcos administration ran to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for help, and the IMF offered a debt restructuring deal New policies, including a greater emphasis on exports and the relaxation of controls of the peso, were put in place The Peso was allowed to float to a lower market value, resulting in drastic inflation, and social unrest [133]\n\n\nInformal diplomacy\nFrom the 1960s, Ferdinand Marcos would engage in unofficial diplomacy with the Soviet Bloc, in ways that were shaped by the Sino-Soviet split [134] [135] The Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930, an officially illegal organization, had endorsed Marcos in 1965 The formation of the China-aligned Communist Party of the Philippines led to government support of the Soviet-aligned Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930 Some members of the PKP-1930 were appointed to positions within Marcos's government as salaried \"researchers\" Their transnational connections were used as another channel of negotiation with the Soviet Union on geopolitical and economic lines [135]\n\n\nSecond term (1969–1972)\nPresidential elections were held on November 11, 1969, and Marcos was reelected for a second term He was the first and last Filipino president to win a second full term [136] [137] [138] [139] His running mate, incumbent Vice President Fernando Lopez was also elected to a third full term as Vice President of the Philippines.\n\n\nSocial unrest after the balance of payments crisis\nWhile Marcos had won the November 1969 election by a landslide, and was inaugurated on December 30 of that year, Marcos's massive spending during the 1969 presidential campaign triggered growing public unrest [133]\n\n\n\"Moderate\" and \"radical\" opposition\nThe media reports of the time classified the various civil society groups opposing Marcos into two categories [140] [141] The \"moderates\", which included church groups, civil libertarians, and nationalist politicians, were those who wanted to create change through political reforms [140] The \"radicals\", including a number of labor and student groups, wanted broader, more systemic political reforms [140] [142]\n\n\nThe \"moderate\" opposition\nWith the Constitutional Convention occupying their attention from 1971 to 1973, statesmen and politicians opposed to the increasingly more-authoritarian administration of Ferdinand Marcos mostly focused their efforts on political efforts from within the halls of power [105]\n\n\nThe \"radical\" opposition\nThe other broad category of opposition groups during this period were those who wanted broader, more systemic political reforms, usually as part of the National Democracy movement These groups were branded \"radicals\" by the media, [140] [142] although the Marcos administration extended that term to \"moderate\" protest groups as well [151]\n\n\nRadicalization\nWhen Marcos became president in 1965, Philippine policy and politics functioned under a post-World War II geopolitical framework [152] As a result, the Philippines was ideologically caught up in the anti-communist scare perpetuated by the US during the Cold War [153] Marcos and the AFP thus emphasized the \"threat\" represented by the formation of the Communist Party of the Philippines in 1969, even if it was still a small organization [144]: 43  partly because doing so was good for building up the AFP budget [144]: 43  [133] As a result, notes security specialist Richard J Kessler, this \"mythologized the group, investing it with a revolutionary aura that only attracted more supporters.\"\n\n\nFirst Quarter Storm\nBy the time Marcos gave the first State of the Nation Address of his second term on January 26, 1970, the unrest born from the 1969–1970 balance of payments crisis exploded into a series of demonstrations, protests, and marches against the government Student groups – some moderate and some radical – served as the driving force of the protests, which lasted until the end of the university semester in March 1970, and would come to be known as the \"First Quarter Storm\" [159] [133]\n\n\nConstitutional Convention of 1971\nExpressing opposition to the Marcos's policies and citing rising discontent over wide inequalities in society, [105] civil society groups and opposition leaders began campaigning in 1967 to initiate a constitutional convention which would revise change the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines [164] On March 16 of that year, the Philippine Congress constituted itself into a Constituent Assembly and passed Resolution No 2, which called for a Constitutional Convention to change the 1935 Constitution [165]\n\n\nEarly growth of the CPP New People's Army\nOn December 29, 1970, Philippine Military Academy instructor Lt Victor Corpuz led New People's Army rebels in a raid on the PMA armory, capturing rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, a bazooka and thousands of rounds of ammunition in 1970 [172] In 1972, China, which was then actively supporting and arming communist insurgencies in Asia as part of Mao Zedong's People's War Doctrine, transported 1,200 M-14 and AK-47 rifles aboard the MV Karagatan for the NPA to speed up its campaign to defeat the government [173] [174] [175]\n\n\nRumored coup d'état and assassination plot\nRumors of coup d'état were also brewing A report of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that shortly after the 1969 Philippine presidential election, a group composed mostly of retired colonels and generals organized a revolutionary junta with the aim of first discrediting President Marcos and then killing him The group was headed by Eleuterio Adevoso, an official of the opposition Liberal Party A document given to the committee by a Philippine government official alleged that key figures in the plot were Vice President Fernando Lopez and Sergio Osmena Jr., whom Marcos defeated in the 1969 election [176]\n\n\nPlaza Miranda bombing\nIn interviews by The Washington Post, unnamed former Communist Party of the Philippines officials alleged that \"the Communist party leadership planned – and three operatives carried out – the Plaza Miranda attack in an attempt to provoke government repression and push the country to the brink of revolution Communist Party Leader Jose Maria Sison had calculated that Marcos could be provoked into cracking down on his opponents, thereby driving thousands of political activists into the underground, the anonymous former officials said Recruits were urgently needed, they said, to make use of a large influx of weapons and financial aid that China had already agreed to provide.\" [179] José María Sison continues to deny these claims, [180] and the CPP has never released any official confirmation of their culpability in the incident Marcos and his allies claimed that Benigno Aquino Jr was part of the plot, which was denied by CPP-NPA founding chair Jose Maria Sison [181]\n\n\n1971 suspension of the writ of habeas corpus\nAs a response to the Plaza Miranda bombing, Marcos issued Proclamation No 889, through which he assumed emergency powers and suspended the writ of habeas corpus [185] – an act which would later be seen as a prelude to the declaration of martial law more than a year later [146]\n\n\n1972 Manila bombings\nOn the evening of September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos announced that he had placed the entirety of the Philippines under martial law [39] This marked the beginning of a 14-year period of one-man rule that would effectively last until Marcos was exiled from the country on February 25, 1986 Even though the formal document proclaiming martial law – Proclamation No 1081 – was formally lifted on January 17, 1981, Marcos retained virtually all of his powers as dictator until he was ousted by the EDSA Revolution [187] Plaza Miranda was soon followed by a series of about twenty explosions that took place in various locations in Metro Manila in the months immediately preceding Marcos's proclamation of martial law [188] The first of these bombings took place on March 15, 1972, and the last took place on September 11, 1972, [188] twelve days before martial law was announced on September 23 of that year.\n\n\nMartial law era (1972–1981)\nMarcos's declaration of martial law became known to the public on September 23, 1972, when his press secretary, Francisco Tatad, announced through the radio [189] [39] [40] that Proclamation № 1081, which Marcos had supposedly signed two days earlier on September 21, had come into force and would extend Marcos's rule beyond the constitutional two-term limit [190] Ruling by decree, he almost dissolved press freedom and other civil liberties to add propaganda machine, closed down Congress and media establishments, and ordered the arrest of opposition leaders and militant activists, including senators Benigno Aquino Jr., Jovito Salonga and Jose W Diokno [191] [192] Marcos claimed that martial law was the prelude to creating his Bagong Lipunan, a \"New Society\" based on new social and political values [citation needed]\n\n\nArrests\nHowever, unlike Ninoy Aquino's Senate colleagues who were detained without charges, Ninoy, together with communist NPA leaders Lt Corpuz and Bernabe Buscayno, was charged with murder, illegal possession of firearms and subversion [197]\n\n\nBagong Lipunan (New Society)\nAs one of his rationalizations for the declaration of martial law, Marcos said that there was a need to \"reform society\" [149]: 66  by placing it under the control of a \"benevolent dictator\" which could guide the undisciplined populace through a period of chaos [149]: 29  [198] He referred to this social engineering exercise as the bagong lipunan or \"new society\" [199]: 13  and the Marcos administration produced a range propaganda materials – including speeches, books, lectures, slogans, and numerous propaganda songs – to promote it [199]: 13  [200] [201]\n\n\nFilipinization of Chinese schools\nTo instill patriotism among Filipino citizens and prevent the growing number of Chinese schools from propagating foreign ideologies, Marcos issued Presidential Decree No 176, [206] preventing any educational institution to be established exclusively for foreigners or offer any curriculum exclusively for foreigners, [207] and restricted the teaching of the Chinese language to not more than 100 minutes a day [208]\n\n\n1973 martial law referendum\nMartial law was put on vote in July 1973 in the 1973 Philippine martial law referendum and was marred with controversy [41]: 191  [14] resulting to 90.77% voting yes and 9.23% voting no.\n\n\nRolex 12 and the military\nAlong with Marcos, members of his Rolex 12 circle like Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, Chief of the Philippine Constabulary Fidel Ramos, and Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Fabian Ver were the chief administrators of martial law from 1972 to 1981, and the three remained President Marcos's closest advisers until he was ousted in 1986 Other peripheral members of the Rolex 12 included Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco Jr and Lucio Tan.\n\n\nUS foreign policy and martial law under Marcos\nBy 1977, the armed forces had quadrupled and over 60,000 Filipinos had been arrested for political reasons In 1981, Vice President George H W Bush praised Marcos for his \"adherence to democratic principles and to the democratic processes\" [d] No American military or politician in the 1970s ever publicly questioned the authority of Marcos to help fight communism in South East Asia [citation needed]\n\n\nWithdrawal of Taiwan relations in favor of the People's Republic of China\nPrior to the Marcos administration, the Philippine government had maintained a close relationship with the Kuomintang-ruled Republic of China (ROC) government which had fled to the island of Taiwan, despite the victory of the Chinese Communist Party in the 1949 Chinese Communist Revolution Prior administrations had seen the People's Republic of China (PRC) as a security threat, due to its financial and military support of communist rebels in the country [217]\n\n\n1978 Philippine parliamentary election\nBy 1977, reports of \"gross human rights violations\" had led to pressure from the international community, including newly elected US President Jimmy Carter, put pressure on the Marcos Administration to release Ninoy Aquino and to hold parliamentary elections to demonstrate that some \"normalization\" had begun after the declaration of martial law [221]: 168  Marcos did not release Aquino, but announced that the 1978 Philippine parliamentary election would be held in 1978 [221]: 168 \n\n\nPrime minister\nIn 1978, Ferdinand Marcos became Prime Minister of the Philippines, marking the return of the position for the first time since the terms of Pedro Paterno and Jorge Vargas during the American occupation Based on Article 9 of the 1973 constitution, it had broad executive powers that would be typical of modern prime ministers in other countries The position was the official head of government, and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces All of the previous powers of the President from the 1935 Constitution were transferred to the newly restored office of prime minister The prime minister also acted as head of the National Economic Development Authority Upon his re-election to the presidency in 1981, Marcos was succeeded as prime minister by an American-educated leader and Wharton graduate, Cesar Virata, who was elected as an Assemblyman (Member of the Parliament) from Cavite in 1978 He is the eponym of the Cesar Virata School of Business, the business school of the University of the Philippines Diliman.\n\n\nProclamation No. 2045\nAfter putting in force amendments to the constitution and legislative action, [225] President Marcos issued Proclamation 2045, which lifted martial law, on January 17, 1981, [226] while retaining the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus for rebellion and subversion-related crimes [225] The lifting of martial law was timed with the election of US President Ronald Reagan and the visit of Pope John Paul II, to get support from Reagan and minimize criticism from the Pope [225] [227]\n\n\nThird term (1981–1986)\nOn June 16, 1981, six months after the lifting of martial law, the first presidential election in twelve years was held President Marcos ran while the major opposition parties, the United Nationalists Democratic Organizations (UNIDO), a coalition of opposition parties and LABAN, boycotted the election Marcos won a massive victory over the other candidates [228]\n\n\nArmed conflict with the CPP–NPA\nThe Martial Law period, which had lasted from September 1972 to January 1981, had been a period of significant growth for the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People's army because the implementation of Martial Law had the effect of radicalizing otherwise moderate protesters [144]: 43  [133] This continued into the 1980s, with the NPA able to establish itself in urban areas and with the NDF able to form relationships with legal opposition organizations - all despite Marcos' claims in January 1981 that the conflict had been \"substantially contained.\" [225] [226] The killing of key leaders in Davao city in the opening years of the 1980s led the administration to claim that the CPP \"backbone\" in the south had broken,” [232]  But the remaining leaders soon began to experiment with new tactics including urban insurrectionism, leading the international press to label Davao City as the \"Killing Fields, and as \"the Philippines' \"Murder Capital.\" [233]  The violence reached its peak in 1985 with 1,282 military and police deaths and 1,362 civilian deaths [220]\n\n\n1980s economic collapse\nThe Marcos administration's spending had relied heavily on debt since Marcos's first term in the 60s This left the Philippines vulnerable when high inflation caused the US to raise interest rates from 1980 to 1982, which caused US recessions in 1980 and again in the 3rd quarter of 1981 [234] [235] The Philippine economy also began going into decline in 1981, continuing to do so by the time of the Benigno Aquino Jr assassination in 1983 The economic and political instability combined to produce the worst recession in Philippine history in 1984 and 1985, with the economy contracting by 7.3% for two successive years [235] and poverty incidence at 49% or almost half the Philippine population [236]\n\n\nAquino's assassination\nOn August 21, 1983, opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr was assassinated on the tarmac at Manila International Airport He had returned to the Philippines after three years in exile in the United States, where he had a heart bypass operation to save his life after Marcos allowed him to leave the Philippines to seek medical care Prior to his heart surgery, Ninoy, along with his two co-accused, NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno (Commander Dante) and Lt Victor Corpuz, were sentenced to death by a military commission on charges of murder, illegal possession of firearms and subversion [197]\n\n\nImpeachment attempt\nIn August 1985, 56 Assemblymen signed a resolution calling for the impeachment of President Marcos for alleged diversion of US aid for personal use, [242] citing a July 1985 San Jose Mercury News exposé of the Marcos's multimillion-dollar investment and property holdings in the United States.\n\n\nPhysical decline\nDuring his third term, Marcos's health deteriorated rapidly due to kidney ailments, as a complication of a chronic autoimmune disease lupus erythematosus He had a kidney transplant in August 1983, and when his body rejected the first kidney transplant, he underwent a second transplant in November 1984 [243] Marcos's regime was sensitive to publicity of his condition; a palace physician who alleged that during one of these periods Marcos had undergone a kidney transplant was shortly afterwards found murdered Police said he was kidnapped and slain by communist rebels [243] Many people questioned whether he still had capacity to govern, due to his grave illness and the burgeoning political unrest [244] With Marcos ailing, his powerful wife, Imelda, emerged as the government's main public figure Marcos dismissed speculations of his ailing health as he used to be an avid golfer and fitness buff who liked showing off his physique.\n\n\nEconomic performance\nThe 21-year period of Philippine economic history during Ferdinand Marcos's regime – from his election in 1965 until he was ousted by the People Power Revolution in 1986 – was a period of significant economic highs and lows [248] [235] [105]\n\n\nPoverty and inequality\nSusan Quimpo recounts that times were hard financially during the Marcos regime, so much so that citizens had to line up for rice rations due to rice shortage, and that the government told citizens to consume corn instead [251]\n\n\nDebt\nTo help finance a number of economic development projects, the Marcos government borrowed large amounts of money from international lenders [254] [255] The external debt of the Philippines rose more than 70-fold from $360 million in 1962 to $26.2 billion in 1985, [256] making the Philippines one of the most indebted countries in Asia [254]\n\n\nReliance on US trade\nAs a former colony of the United States, the Philippines was heavily reliant on the American economy to purchase agricultural goods such as sugar, [260] tobacco, coconut, bananas, and pineapple [261] [page needed] [262]\n\n\nEconomy during martial law (1973–1980)\nAccording to World Bank Data, the Philippine's Annual Gross Domestic Product quadrupled from $8 billion in 1972 to $32.45 billion in 1980, for an inflation-adjusted average growth rate of 6% per year, while debt stood at US$17.2 billion by the end of 1980 [249] [257] According to The Heritage Foundation in the United States, the Philippines enjoyed its best economic development since 1945 between 1972 and 1979 [263] The economy grew amidsts two severe global oil shocks following the 1973 oil crisis and 1979 energy crisis – oil price was $3 / barrel in 1973 and $39.5 in 1979, or a growth of 1200% By the end of 1979, debt was still manageable, with debt to Debt-GNP ratio about the same as South Korea, according to the US National Bureau of Economic Research [257]\n\n\nEconomy after martial law (1981–1985)\nThe Philippine economy, heavily reliant on exports to the United States, suffered a great decline after the Aquino assassination in August 1983.\n\n\nCreation of the Credit Information Bureau\nIn 1981, Ferdinand Marcos issued Letter of Instructions No 1107 mandating the Central Bank of the Philippines to analyze the probability of establishing and funding the operation of a credit bureau in the Philippines due to the disturbing increase of failures on corporate borrowers [267] In adherence to the order, Central Bank of the Philippines organized the Credit Information Exchange System under the department of Loans and Credit It was created to engage in collating, developing and analyzing credit information on individuals, institutions, business entities and other business concerns It aims to develop and undertake the continuing exchange of credit data within its members and subscribers and to provide an impartial source of credit information for debtors, creditors and the public On April 14, 1982, Credit Information Bureau, Inc was incorporated as a non-stock, non-profit corporation CIBI was created pursuant to LOI No 1107 dated February 16, 1981, and was further strengthened by PD No 1941 which recognizes and supports CIBI as a suitable credit bureau to promote the development and maintenance of rational and efficient credit processes in the financial system and in the economy as a whole In 1997, Credit Information Bureau, Inc was incorporated and transformed into a private entity and became CIBI Information, Inc CIBI is a provider of information and intelligence for business, credit and individuals [268] The company also supplies compliance reports before accrediting suppliers, industry partners and even hiring professionals [269]\n\n\nSnap election, People Power Revolution, and ouster (1986)\nIn late 1985, in the face of escalating public discontent and under pressure from foreign allies, Marcos called a snap election with more than a year left in his term He selected Arturo Tolentino as his running mate The opposition to Marcos united behind two American-educated leaders, Aquino's widow, Corazon, and her running mate, Salvador Laurel [270] [271]\n\n\n1986 snap election\nIn late 1985, in the face of escalating public discontent and under pressure from foreign allies, Marcos called a snap election with more than a year left in his term He selected Arturo Tolentino as his running mate The opposition to Marcos united behind two American-educated leaders, Aquino's widow, Corazon, and her running mate, Salvador Laurel [270] [271]\n\n\n1986 RAM coup and People Power Revolution\nThe failed election process gave a decisive boost to the \"People Power movement\" Enrile and Ramos would later abandon Marcos and switch sides and seek protection behind the 1986 People Power Revolution, backed by fellow-American educated Eugenio Lopez Jr., Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, and the old political and economic elites RAM, led by Lt Col Gregorio \"Gringo\" Honasan and backed by Enrile had plotted a coup d'état to seize Malacañang and kill Marcos and his family [279]\n\n\nExile in Hawaii (1986–1989)\nAt 15:00 PST (GMT+8) on February 25, 1986, Marcos talked to United States Senator Paul Laxalt, a close associate of the United States President, Ronald Reagan, asking for advice from the White House Laxalt advised him to \"cut and cut cleanly\", to which Marcos expressed his disappointment after a short pause [283] In the afternoon, Marcos talked to Enrile, asking for safe passage for him and his family, and included his close allies like General Ver Finally, at 9:00 p.m., the Marcos family was transported by four Sikorsky HH-3E helicopters [284] to Clark Air Base in Angeles City, about 83 kilometers north of Manila, before boarding US Air Force C-130 planes bound for Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, and finally to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii where Marcos arrived on February 26.\n\n\nFleeing to Hawaii\nAt 15:00 PST (GMT+8) on February 25, 1986, Marcos talked to United States Senator Paul Laxalt, a close associate of the United States President, Ronald Reagan, asking for advice from the White House Laxalt advised him to \"cut and cut cleanly\", to which Marcos expressed his disappointment after a short pause [283] In the afternoon, Marcos talked to Enrile, asking for safe passage for him and his family, and included his close allies like General Ver Finally, at 9:00 p.m., the Marcos family was transported by four Sikorsky HH-3E

Force Base in Hawaii where Marcos arrived on February 26.\n\n\nPlans to return and \"The Marcos Tapes\"\nMore than a year after the People Power Revolution, it was revealed to the United States House Foreign Affairs subcommittee in 1987 that Marcos held an intention to fly back to the Philippines and overthrow the Aquino government Two Americans, namely attorney Richard Hirschfeld and business consultant Robert Chastain, both of whom posed as arms dealers, gained knowledge of a plot by gaining Marcos's trust and secretly tape recorded their conversations with the ousted leader.\n\n\nLegal cases\nWithin two weeks of his arrival to the United States, the Marcos family and their cronies received hundred of criminal and civil cases filed in Hawaii, San Francisco, and New York [288] Marcos made personal appeals with Pres Ronald Reagan to intervene and put a stop to these cases In June 1988 National Security Advisor Colin Powell recommended proceeding with the indictment of the Marcoses, as he reviewed the cases as forwarded by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Rudy Giuliani Pres Reagan gave his tacit approval to this [299] On August 4, Marcos stated that he had head of state immunity to resist the subpoenas by a federal grand jury to produce his finger and palm prints, and failed to consent to investigators to go into his foreign bank accounts By August 18, a bench warrant of arrest was released against the Marcoses By October that year, Pres Reagan personally wrote to Marcos informing him that he believed his innocence of the charges against him, but reminding him that the case was out of his hands He also assured him that they will have every opportunity to prove their innocence in the US justice system [300]\n\n\nDeath and burial\nMarcos was admitted to the hospital on January 15, 1989, with pneumonia and underwent a series of operations [301] In his dying days, Marcos was visited by Vice President Salvador Laurel [302] During the meeting with Laurel, Marcos offered to return 90% of his ill-gotten wealth to the Filipino people in exchange for being buried back in the Philippines beside his mother, an offer also disclosed to Enrique Zobel However, Marcos's offer was rebuffed by the Aquino government and by Imelda Marcos [303] [304] [305]\n\n\nTrials and reparations\nRogelio Roxas, a Filipino treasure hunter, discovered a 3-foot-tall golden Buddha statue in tunnels under the Baguio General Hospital in 1971 Roxas was later arrested and tortured by members of the military, and the statue was taken away Upon exile of the Marcoses, Roxas assigned his rights to a friend in the United States and formed the Golden Buddha Corporation (GBC) who pursued the case against the former president In 1996, the lower court awarded US$22 billion in favor of GBC, making this the largest award in any civil case in the history of the United States In November 1998, the Hawaii Supreme Court overturned the ruling, but still maintained the award of US$6 million for the illegal arrest and torture experienced by Roxas [313] [314]\n\n\nRoxas v. Marcos\nRogelio Roxas, a Filipino treasure hunter, discovered a 3-foot-tall golden Buddha statue in tunnels under the Baguio General Hospital in 1971 Roxas was later arrested and tortured by members of the military, and the statue was taken away Upon exile of the Marcoses, Roxas assigned his rights to a friend in the United States and formed the Golden Buddha Corporation (GBC) who pursued the

the Hawaii Supreme Court overturned the ruling, but still maintained the award of US$6 million for the illegal arrest and torture experienced by Roxas [313] [314]\n\n\nSandiganbayan, Supreme Court, and international trials\nOn November 9, 2018, Imelda Marcos was found \"guilty beyond reasonable doubt\" by the Sandiganbayan of seven counts of graft for the private organizations set up in Switzerland during her active duty as a government official from 1968 to 1986 In less than 20 days however, the Sandiganbayan listed Imelda's \"advanced age\" and health condition as considerations for allowing the accused to post bail The Fifth Division's (of the Sandiganbayan) ruling read that \"the fact that she is of advanced age and for health reasons, consistent with the doctrine in Enrile vs Sandiganbayan, bail is allowed for these seven cases.\" [315] The Supreme Court of the Philippines affirms that the Marcoses' assets, that are beyond the legal and declared government salaries, are considered as ill-gotten wealth In 1998 however, the Supreme Court acquitted Imelda Marcos of corruption charges from a previous graft conviction in 1993.\n\n\nReparations\nIn 1995, some 10,000 Filipinos won a US class-action lawsuit filed against the Marcos estate The claims were filed by victims or their surviving relatives consequent on torture, execution, and disappearances [316] [317]\n\n\nLegacy\nMarcos left an economic legacy of debt, hardship and excess of dictatorship [330]\n\n\nAuthoritarianism\nWhile Ferdinand Marcos was not the first Philippine executive to institute an authoritarian form of government, he was the first to do so since the immediate post-WWII era, and the first to do so throughout the whole archipelago since the war itself [14]\n\n\nHuman rights abuses\nAs many student activists like Edgar Jopson and Rigoberto Tiglao, farmers like Bernabe Buscayno, journalists like Satur Ocampo, legal political opposition (Ninoy Aquino [333] and fellow candidate in 1978 election Alex Boncayao [222]), and priest and nuns joined or developed relationships with communist rebels, [334] many farmers, [335] student protesters, [336] leftists, [210] political opponents, [337] journalists and members of the media [338] [339] accused of being members or sympathizing with the CPP, NPA or MNLF [340] or of plotting against the government were frequent targets of human rights violations Victims would simply be rounded up with no arrest warrant nor reading of prisoners' rights and kept indefinitely locked up with no charges filed against them [133] In a keynote speech at the University of the East, journalist Raissa Robles described how anyone could just be arrested (or abducted) with ease through pre-signed Arrest Search and Seizure Orders (ASSO), [341] which allowed the military or police to detain victims on trumped up charges or unclear allegations according to Rappler research [342] Anybody could be picked up at any time for any reason by the military or the police, according to Raissa's husband, journalist Alan Robles [343] [344]\n\n\nAbductions\nVictims were often taken to military \"safehouses\", [352] a euphemism for hidden places of torture, [353] often blindfolded [133] [354] In a document titled \"Open Letter to the Filipino People\", martial law martyr Edgar \"Edjop\" Jopson described safehouses as such: \"Safehouses usually have their windows always shut tight They are usually covered with high walls One would usually detect  [safehouses] through the traffic of motorcycles and cars, going in and out of the house at irregular hours Burly men, armed with pistols tucked in their waists or in clutch bags, usually drive these vehicles.\" [355]\n\n\nTorture\nVarious forms of torture were used by the military, and these forms of torture were usually combined with each other [337]\n\n\nKillings\nSummary executions were prevalent during the martial law era with bodies being recovered in various places and often bearing signs of torture and mutilation [355] [357] Such cases were referred to as \"salvaging\" with the term widely believed to have originated from the Spanish word salvaje, meaning savage [358] Mutilated remains were often dumped on roadsides in public display in order to spread a sense of fear and to intimidate opponents from encouraging actions against the government – turning the Philippines into a theater state of terror [24]\n\n\n\"Salvagings\"\nSummary executions were prevalent during the martial law era with bodies being recovered in various places and often bearing signs of torture and mutilation [355] [357] Such cases were referred to as \"salvaging\" with the term widely believed to have originated from the Spanish word salvaje, meaning savage [358] Mutilated remains were often dumped on roadsides in public display in order to spread a sense of fear and to intimidate opponents from encouraging actions against the government – turning the Philippines into a theater state of terror [24]\n\n\nEnforced disappearances\nEnforced disappearances, also known \"desaparecidos\" or \"the disappeared\" – people who suddenly went missing, sometimes without a trace and with bodies never recovered [362]\n\n\nNotable murders\nWhile the numbers of political detainees went down, the number of people killed rose and spiked in 1981, the year martial law was officially lifted by Marcos according to Task Force Detainees of the Philippines According to Senator Jose W Diokno, \"As torture (cases) declined, a more terrible tactic emerged; unofficial executions\" – suspected dissidents were simply arrested and vanished [133]\n\n\nCivilian massacres\nIt is hard to judge the full extent of massacres and atrocities that happened during the Marcos regime due to a heavily censored press at the time [366]\n\n\nMuslim massacres\nThe Marcos regime had started to kill hundreds of Moros even before the imposition of martial law in 1972 [372] Thousands of Moros were killed during the Marcos regime, prompting them to form insurgent groups and separatist movements such as the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which became more radical with time due to atrocities against Muslims [373] According to the study The Liberation Movements in Mindanao: Root Causes and Prospects for Peace, a doctoral dissertation by Marjanie Salic Macasalong, the number of Moro victims killed by the Army, Philippine Constabulary, and the Ilaga (a notorious government-sanctioned [374] terrorist cult known for cannibalism and land grabbing that served as members of the CHDF) [369] reached as high as 10,000 lives [351]\n\n\nFamily denial\nMembers of the Marcos family deny that human rights violations happened during the Marcos administration [378]\n\n\nIll-gotten wealth and kleptocracy\nThe Philippine Supreme Court considers all Marcos assets beyond their legally declared earnings/salary to be ill-gotten wealth [382] and such wealth to have been forfeited in favor of the government or human rights victims [383]\n\n\nOverseas investments and bank accounts\nThe overseas properties of Marcos and his associates created an empire spanning places as diverse as California, Washington, New York, Rome, Vienna, Australia, Antilles, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Switzerland and Singapore The more popular properties among those in this empire are the multimillion-dollar New York real estate investments, California banks and Swiss bank accounts; lesser known ones are villas in Austria, London, and Rome, gold and diamond investments in South Africa, and banks and hotels in Israel [415]: 423 \n\n\nIllegal Swiss foundations\nIn 1986, following the overthrow of the Marcos regime, it was discovered that as early as 1968, [421] Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, under the pseudonyms William Saunders and Jane Ryan, [421] opened bank accounts in Swiss banks, with one account having a balance of $950,000 [422] Ferdinand Marcos's salary then was only around $5,600 a year [422] while Imelda Marcos did not have any visible means of income.\n\n\nMonopolies\nMarcos's administration spawned new oligarchs in Philippine society who became instant millionaires [426] These oligarchs plundered government financing institutions to finance their corporate raiding, monopolies and various takeover schemes Marcos's cronies were awarded timber, mining and oil concessions and vast tracts of rich government agricultural and urban lands, not to mention lush government construction contracts During his martial law regime, Marcos confiscated and appropriated by force and duress many businesses and institutions, both private and public, and redistributed them to his cronies and close personal friends A presidential crony representing Westington won for its principal the $500 million bid for the construction of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant in Bagac The crony's commission was $25 million or $200 million representing five percent of the total bid price These new oligarchs were known to be insatiable and more profligate than the oligarchs of pre-martial law days [151] Two of Marcos's friends were Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco Jr., who would go on to control San Miguel Corporation, and Ramon Cojuangco, late businessman and chairman of PLDT, and father of Antonio \"Tony Boy\" Cojuangco (who would eventually succeed his father in the telecommunications company), both happened to be cousins of Corazon Aquino These associates of Marcos then used these as fronts to launder proceeds from institutionalized graft and corruption in the different national governmental agencies as \"crony capitalism\" for personal benefit Graft and corruption via bribery, racketeering, and embezzlement became more prevalent during this era [427] [428] Marcos also silenced the free press, making the press of the state propaganda the only legal one, which was a common practice for governments around the world that sought to fight communism [citation needed]\n\n\nFloating casino in Manila Bay\nOne of the first acts of Imelda Marcos as the governor of Metro Manila was to legalize gambling to raise revenue for the new metropolis A floating casino was allowed to operate exclusively inside the Manila Bay It is owned and operated by \"mysterious\" stockholders according to the major daily However, the people of Manila are aware that behind the floating casino management was the brother of Imelda Marcos One of the most lucrative gambling managements back then was the Jai-Alai, managed by a corporation that received its franchise from the pre-war Commonwealth government As soon as its franchised expired, a new corporation took over management of Jai-Alai It was immediately under the control of the First Lady's brother This new management was allowed to perform operations denied from the former, and it is estimated that the take between the Jai-Alai fronton and the floating casino is PHP2 million a day [151]\n\n\nPhilippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)\nReports of the US Senate and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have described massive million-dollar bribes to officials of the government-backed Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company by the General Telephone and Electric Co of New York in exchange for supply contracts The officials of PLDT needed to be investigated for violations of foreign currency regulations and unearned income However, different stakeholders were kept silent As one PLDT official boasted \"an exposé will only hurt the Palace.\" In the US and Japan, presidents have been driven out of office for similar misconduct [151]\n\n\nManila Electric Co. (Meralco)\nThe Manila Electric Company (Meralco) was one of the largest corporations in the Philippines before the declaration of martial law It was owned and controlled by the Lopez family After martial law was imposed, it became the prime target for takeover by the Marcos-Romualdez family Among the first things the clan did was to arrest the eldest son of Eugenio Lopez Sr., the major stockholder of Meralco for allegedly plotting the assassination of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\n\nPhilippine national debt\nMassive foreign loans enabled Marcos to build more schools, hospitals and infrastructure than all of his predecessors combined, [13] but crippled the Philippine economy [citation needed] Today, according to Ibon Foundation, Filipino citizens are still bearing the heavy burden of servicing public debts incurred during Marcos's administration, with ongoing interest payments on the loan schedule by the Philippine government estimated to last until 2025–59 years after Marcos assumed office and 39 years after he was deposed [431] [432]\n\n\nInfrastructure and edifices\nMarcos projected himself to the Philippine public as having spent a lot on construction projects, and his record upholds that reputation [105]: 128  A 2011 study by University of the Philippines School of Economics indicated that at the time of the study, Marcos was the president that spent the most on infrastructure, not just because he stayed in power for nearly two and a half decades, but in terms of actual per-year spending By the time of the study, Marcos had only been outspent in infrastructure building for a period of one year, during the term of Fidel Ramos [436]\n\n\nCultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) Complex\nThe CCP Complex is a 77-hectare [447] reclaimed property in Pasay designed by Leandro Locsin It includes the CCP main building, the Folk Arts Theater, the Philippine International Convention Center, the Manila Film Center and the Coconut Palace (also called the Tahanang Pilipino) [448] It was established as a result of Ferdinand Marcos's issuance of Executive Order No 30 s 1966, which stated that \"the preservation and promotion of Philippine culture in all its varied aspects and phases is a vital concern of the State.\" [449] Following this issuance, he appointed a seven-member board of trustees, who then unanimously elected Imelda Marcos as its chair [448]\n\n\nSan Juanico Bridge\nThe San Juanico Bridge is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway and links the provinces of Leyte and Samar through Tacloban City and Santa Rita, Samar Having a total length of 2.16 kilometres (1.34 mi), it is the longest bridge over a body of water in the Philippines [451] It is said to be Ferdinand Marcos's gift to his wife Imelda, whose hometown was Leyte [452]\n\n\nManila Film Center\nConstruction of the Manila Film Center began in January 1981 and was spearheaded by Imelda Marcos It cost $25 million [443] [454]\n\n\nMasagana 99\nMarcos's signature agricultural program, Masagana 99, was thus launched on May 21, 1973, [456] [457] as an effort to address a nationwide rice shortage arising from the various natural disasters and pest infestations in 1972 [458]\n\n\nLogging and deforestation\nThe Marcos administration marked a period of intense logging exportation, [473] with commercial logging accounting for 5% of the gross national product during the first half of the 1970s This was the result of intense demand created by a construction boom in Japan [474] [475] Timber products became one of the nation's top exports but little attention was paid to the environmental impacts of deforestation as cronies never complied with reforestation agreements [476] [477]\n\n\nHeavy industrialization projects\nIn 1979, Marcos put a range of 11 heavy industrialization projects [480] on the Philippines' economic agenda.\n\n\nBataan Nuclear Power Plant\nThe Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP) is one of the six nuclear power plants that the Marcos regime planned to build [490] It stands in Morong, Bataan, atop Napot Point that overlooks the South China Sea Construction of the BNPP began in 1976 and was completed in 1985 [491]\n\n\nEducational system\nRecognizing the value Filipino culture placed on education, Marcos emphasized the construction of educational infrastructure as early as during his first presidential term By being more willing than those previous presidents to use foreign loans to fund construction projects, he was able to achieve construct more roads and schoolbuildings than any previous administration [105]: 128 \n\n\nEstablishment of Metro Manila\nIn 1975, Marcos issued Presidential Decree No 824, placing the four cities and thirteen municipalities in the immediate vicinity of the Province of Manila under the administration of the Metro Manila Commission (MMC), which would serve as the central government of the capital [498]\n\n\nLaws passed during the Marcos administration\nThe country crafted a large number of decrees, laws, and edicts during Marcos's term [501] From 1972 to 1986, the Marcos Administration codified laws through 2,036 Presidential Decrees, [502] an average of 145 per year during the 14-year period To put this into context, only 14, 12, and 11 laws were passed in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively [503] A large number of the laws passed during the term of Marcos remain in force today and are embedded in the country's legal system [501] According to Imee Marcos in 2006, many of the thousands of proclamations, decrees, and executive orders Marcos issued were still in force, and few have been repealed, revoked, modified or amended [504]\n\n\nImpact on later Philippine governance\nMany people who rose to power during Marcos's 21-years as president continued to remain in power or even ascended higher after his exile, thus leaving a further imprint on present-day Filipino affairs One of these was Fidel Ramos, a general promoted by Marcos who supervised many terror killings and tortures, who later switched sides and subsequently became president himself through free elections [505]\n\n\nThe US–Marcos relationship\nAll five American presidents from 1965 to 1985 were unwilling to jeopardize the US–Marcos relationship, mainly to protect and retain access of the US military bases in the Philippines However, at the same time, for the US the Philippines was just one of its many allies, and for the Philippines, the US was its only patron Therefore, Marcos worked to identify himself closely with the US in order to secure a strong bargaining position with their government Indeed, he had manipulated this American connection to sustain him during his two decades of power US support was believed to be the only reason why Marcos remained in power [506]\n\n\nAuthored works\nA number of books were published under Marcos's name during his term from 1970 to 1983, and a final book was published in 1990 posthumously [509] Those published during his term are believed to have been written by ghostwriters, [510] notably Adrian Cristobal [511] [512]\n\n\nHonors\nMarcos and his wife, Imelda, were jointly credited in 1989 by Guinness World Records with the largest-ever theft from a government (an estimated 5 billion to 10 billion US dollars), [522] a record they still hold today [64]\n\n\nNational honors\nMarcos and his wife, Imelda, were jointly credited in 1989 by Guinness World Records with the largest-ever theft from a government (an estimated 5 billion to 10 billion US

Marcos\n\nIntroduction\n\nFerdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos was a Filipino politician and lawyer who served as the 10th President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. He is best known for his authoritarian and corrupt regime, which lasted for over two decades. Marcos was a prominent figure in Philippine history, and his presidency had a significant impact on the country's politics, economy, and society.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nFerdinand Marcos was born on September 11, 1917, in the town of Sarrat, Ilocos Norte, to Mariano Marcos and Josefa Edralin. Mariano Marcos was a lawyer and congressman from Ilocos Norte, while Josefa was a schoolteacher. Marcos's father was executed by Filipino guerillas in 1945, allegedly for collaborating with the Japanese during World War II. Marcos's mother, Josefa, died in 1988, two years after the Marcos family left her in Malacañang Palace when they fled into exile after the 1986 People Power Revolution.\n\nMarcos attended the University of the Philippines in Manila and graduated with a degree in law. He became a member of the Upsilon Sigma Phi fraternity and developed an interest in politics. Marcos's early life was marked by academic excellence and leadership roles, which set the stage for his future career in politics.\n\n**Military Service and the Hukbalahap**\n\nMarcos served as a captain in the Philippine Constabulary during World War II, but he was eventually captured by Japanese forces. Marcos claimed that he was tortured by the Japanese and witnessed the execution of several Filipino soldiers. After the war, Marcos became involved in politics and joined the Liberal Party.\n\nMarcos's involvement in politics led him to serve as a congressman from Ilocos Norte from 1949 to 1959. He also served as a governor of Ilocos Norte from 1951 to 1959. Marcos's entry into politics was marked by controversy and violence, with some accusing him of involvement in the murder of opposition leader Julio Nalundasan in 1935.\n\n**Presidential Campaigns and the People Power Revolution**\n\nMarcos's first presidential campaign was in 1965, where he ran against incumbent President Diosdado Macapagal. Marcos won the election and became the 10th President of the Philippines. He was inaugurated on December 30, 1965.\n\nMarcos's second presidential campaign was in 1969, where he ran against opposition leader Sergio Osmeña Jr. Marcos won the election and became the first president to be re-elected to a second full term. His campaign was marked by controversy and violence, with some accusing him of using the military to crush opposition candidates.\n\nThe People Power Revolution in 1986 marked the end of Marcos's 21-year rule. He fled the country on February 25, 1986, after a series of protests and demonstrations led by opposition leader Corazon Aquino.\n\n**Relationship with the United States**\n\nMarcos's relationship with the United States was complex and multifaceted. He was a close ally of President Lyndon B. Johnson and received significant military aid from the US. Marcos also allowed the US to maintain a military presence in the Philippines.\n\nHowever, Marcos's authoritarian regime and human rights abuses led to criticism from the US. President Jimmy Carter imposed an arms embargo on the Philippines in 1977, citing concerns over human rights.\n\n**Economic Legacy**\n\nMarcos's economic legacy is marked by significant debt and corruption. His administration borrowed heavily from international lenders to finance infrastructure projects. However, the economy suffered from high inflation and poverty.\n\nThe Philippine economy contracted by 7.3% in 1984, making it one of the worst recessions in the country's history. Marcos's economic policies were marked by crony capitalism and corruption, with his close allies and family members controlling key industries.\n\n**Human Rights Abuses**\n\nMarcos's human rights abuses are well-documented. His administration was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people, including students, politicians, and activists. Torture, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings were common under Marcos's rule.\n\nThe Marcos regime was responsible for the forced relocation of thousands of people, particularly in Mindanao. The regime also suppressed opposition and dissent, with many opposition leaders and activists being arrested, detained, or killed.\n\n**Cultural Legacy**\n\nMarcos's cultural legacy is complex and multifaceted. He was a patron of the arts and built several cultural institutions, including the Cultural Center of the Philippines.\n\nHowever, Marcos's authoritarian regime also suppressed artistic expression and dissent. Many artists and writers were persecuted or forced into exile under his rule.\n\n**Post-Marcos Era**\n\nThe post-Marcos era has been marked by significant reforms and efforts to address human rights abuses. The country has also seen significant economic growth and development.\n\nHowever, the Marcos family's wealth and influence remain a significant issue in the country. Imelda Marcos, Marcos's widow, has been convicted of corruption and is serving a prison sentence. Their son, Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr., is currently the president of the Philippines.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFerdinand Marcos's life and legacy are complex and multifaceted. He was a prominent figure in Philippine history, and his presidency had a significant impact on the country's politics, economy, and society.\n\nHowever, his authoritarian regime and human rights abuses are well-documented, and his economic policies were marked by crony capitalism and corruption. The post-Marcos era has seen significant reforms and efforts to address human rights abuses, but the Marcos family's wealth and influence remain a significant issue in the country.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ferdinand_Marcos\" following this outline:\n\n\nPersonal life\nFerdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos was born on September 11, 1917, in the town of Sarrat, Ilocos Norte, to Mariano Marcos (1897–1945) and Josefa Edralin (1893–1988) [66] Mariano Marcos was a lawyer and congressman from Ilocos Norte, Philippines [67] He was executed by Filipino guerillas in 1945 for being a Japanese propagandist and collaborator during World War II Drawn and quartered with the use of carabaos, his remains were left hanging on a tree [68] [69] [70] Josefa Marcos was a schoolteacher who would far outlive her husband – dying in 1988, two years after the Marcos family left her in Malacañang Palace when they fled into exile after the 1986 People Power Revolution, and only one year before her son Ferdinand's death [71]\n\n\nEducation\nMarcos studied law at the University of the Philippines (UP) in Manila, attending the College of Law He excelled in both curricular and extra-curricular activities, becoming a member of the university's swimming, boxing, and wrestling teams He was also an accomplished orator, debater, and writer for the student newspaper While attending the UP College of Law, he became a member of the Upsilon Sigma Phi, where he met his future colleagues in government and some of his staunchest critics [82] [page needed] [83] [page needed]\n\n\nAssassination of Julio Nalundasan\nMarcos first gained national notoriety over the murder of Julio Nalundasan Nalundasan, Mariano Marcos's political rival, was killed with a single rifle shot at his home in Batac on September 21, 1935, the day after he had defeated Marcos a second time for a seat in the National Assembly [89]\n\n\nWorld War II (1939–1945)\nMarcos's military service during World War II has been the subject of debate and controversy, both in the Philippines and in international military circles [29]\n\n\nPost-WWII and congressional career (1949–1965)\nAfter the surrender of the Japanese and the end of World War II, the American government became preoccupied with setting up the Marshall Plan to revive the economies of the western hemisphere, and quickly backtracked from its interests in the Philippines, granting the islands independence on July 4, 1946 [101] [102] After the war, Marcos was one of only eleven lawyers confirmed by the new government as a special prosecutor with the office of the Solicitor General tasked to try by \"process of law and justice\" all those accused of collaboration with the Japanese [103] Eventually, Marcos ran for his father's old post as representative of the 2nd district of Ilocos Norte and won three consecutive terms, serving in the House of Representatives from 1949 to 1959 [104]\n\n\nAdministration and cabinet\nMarcos's first term began with his inauguration on December 30, 1965, and ended when he was inaugurated for his second term on December 30, 1969 [105]\n\n\nFirst term (1965–1969)\nMarcos's first term began with his inauguration on December 30, 1965, and ended when he was inaugurated for his second term on December 30, 1969 [105]\n\n\nPresidential campaign\nMarcos ran a populist campaign emphasizing that he was a bemedalled war hero emerging from World War II In 1962, Marcos would claim to be the most decorated war hero of the Philippines by garnering almost every medal and decoration that the Filipino and American governments could give to a soldier [112] Included in his claim of 27 war medals and decorations are that of the Distinguished Service Cross and the Medal of Honor [112] [113] According to Primitivo Mijares, author of the book The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos, the opposition Liberal Party would later confirm that many of his war medals were only acquired in 1962 to aid in his reelection campaign for the Senate, not for his presidential campaign [60] Marcos won the presidency in 1965 [114]\n\n\nInauguration\nFerdinand Marcos was inaugurated to his first term as the 10th president of the Philippines on December 30, 1965, after winning the Philippine presidential election of 1965 against the incumbent president, Diosdado Macapagal His inauguration marked the beginning of his two-decade long stay in power, even though the 1935 Philippine Constitution had set a limit of only two four-year terms of office.\n\n\nExpansion of the Philippine military\nOne of Marcos's earliest initiatives upon becoming president was to significantly expand the Philippine military In an unprecedented move, Marcos chose to concurrently serve as his own defense secretary, allowing him to have a direct hand in running the military [105] He also significantly increased the budget of the armed forces, tapping them in civil projects such as the construction of schools Generals loyal to Marcos were allowed to stay in their positions past their retirement age, or were rewarded with civilian government posts, leading Senator Benigno Aquino Jr to accuse Marcos in 1968 of trying to establish \"a garrison state\" [108]\n\n\nVietnam War\nUnder intense pressure from the administration of Lyndon B Johnson, [109] Marcos reversed his pre-presidency position of not sending Philippine forces to Vietnam War, [109] [115] and consented to a limited involvement, [116] asking Congress to approve sending a combat engineer unit Despite opposition to the new plan, the Marcos government gained Congressional approval and Philippine troops were sent from the middle of 1966 as the Philippines Civic Action Group (PHILCAG) PHILCAG reached a strength of some 1,600 troops in 1968 and between 1966 and 1970 over 10,000 Filipino soldiers served in South Vietnam, mainly being involved in civilian infrastructure projects [117] [118]\n\n\nLoans for construction projects\nWith an eye toward becoming the first president of the third republic to be reelected to a second term, Marcos began taking up massive foreign loans to fund the \"rice, roads, and school buildings\" he promised in his reelection campaign With tax revenues unable to fund his administration's 70% increase in infrastructure spending from 1966 to 1970, Marcos began tapping foreign loans, creating a budget deficit 72% higher than the Philippine government's annual deficit from 1961 to 1965 [105]\n\n\nJabidah exposé and Muslim reactions\nIn March 1968 a Muslim man named Jibin Arula was fished out of the waters of Manila Bay, having been shot He was brought to then-Cavite Governor Delfin N Montano, to whom he recounted the story of the Jabidah massacre, saying that numerous Moro army recruits had been executed en-masse by members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on March 18, 1968 [110] [better source needed] This became the subject of a senate exposé by opposition Senator Benigno Aquino Jr [119] [120]\n\n\n1969 presidential campaign\nFerdinand Marcos's campaign for a second term formally began with his nomination as the presidential candidate of the Nacionalista Party at its July 1969 general meeting A meeting of the party's ruling junta had met a week earlier to assure that the nomination would be unanimous [126] Under the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines which was in force at the time, Marcos was supposed to be allowed a maximum of two four-year terms as president [105]\n\n\n1969 balance of payments crisis\nDuring the campaign, Marcos spent $50 million worth in debt-funded infrastructure, triggering a balance of payments crisis [132] The Marcos administration ran to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for help, and the IMF offered a debt restructuring deal New policies, including a greater emphasis on exports and the relaxation of controls of the peso, were put in place The Peso was allowed to float to a lower market value, resulting in drastic inflation, and social unrest [133]\n\n\nInformal diplomacy\nFrom the 1960s, Ferdinand Marcos would engage in unofficial diplomacy with the Soviet Bloc, in ways that were shaped by the Sino-Soviet split [134] [135] The Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930, an officially illegal organization, had endorsed Marcos in 1965 The formation of the China-aligned Communist Party of the Philippines led to government support of the Soviet-aligned Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930 Some members of the PKP-1930 were appointed to positions within Marcos's government as salaried \"researchers\" Their transnational connections were used as another channel of negotiation with the Soviet Union on geopolitical and economic lines [135]\n\n\nSecond term (1969–1972)\nPresidential elections were held on November 11, 1969, and Marcos was reelected for a second term He was the first and last Filipino president to win a second full term [136] [137] [138] [139] His running mate, incumbent Vice President Fernando Lopez was also elected to a third full term as Vice President of the Philippines.\n\n\nSocial unrest after the balance of payments crisis\nWhile Marcos had won the November 1969 election by a landslide, and was inaugurated on December 30 of that year, Marcos's massive spending during the 1969 presidential campaign triggered growing public unrest [133]\n\n\n\"Moderate\" and \"radical\" opposition\nThe media reports of the time classified the various civil society groups opposing Marcos into two categories [140] [141] The \"moderates\", which included church groups, civil libertarians, and nationalist politicians, were those who wanted to create change through political reforms [140] The \"radicals\", including a number of labor and student groups, wanted broader, more systemic political reforms [140] [142]\n\n\nThe \"moderate\" opposition\nWith the Constitutional Convention occupying their attention from 1971 to 1973, statesmen and politicians opposed to the increasingly more-authoritarian administration of Ferdinand Marcos mostly focused their efforts on political efforts from within the halls of power [105]\n\n\nThe \"radical\" opposition\nThe other broad category of opposition groups during this period were those who wanted broader, more systemic political reforms, usually as part of the National Democracy movement These groups were branded \"radicals\" by the media, [140] [142] although the Marcos administration extended that term to \"moderate\" protest groups as well [151]\n\n\nRadicalization\nWhen Marcos became president in 1965, Philippine policy and politics functioned under a post-World War II geopolitical framework [152] As a result, the Philippines was ideologically caught up in the anti-communist scare perpetuated by the US during the Cold War [153] Marcos and the AFP thus emphasized the \"threat\" represented by the formation of the Communist Party of the Philippines in 1969, even if it was still a small organization [144]: 43  partly because doing so was good for building up the AFP budget [144]: 43  [133] As a result, notes security specialist Richard J Kessler, this \"mythologized the group, investing it with a revolutionary aura that only attracted more supporters.\"\n\n\nFirst Quarter Storm\nBy the time Marcos gave the first State of the Nation Address of his second term on January 26, 1970, the unrest born from the 1969–1970 balance of payments crisis exploded into a series of demonstrations, protests, and marches against the government Student groups – some moderate and some radical – served as the driving force of the protests, which lasted until the end of the university semester in March 1970, and would come to be known as the \"First Quarter Storm\" [159] [133]\n\n\nConstitutional Convention of 1971\nExpressing opposition to the Marcos's policies and citing rising discontent over wide inequalities in society, [105] civil society groups and opposition leaders began campaigning in 1967 to initiate a constitutional convention which would revise change the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines [164] On March 16 of that year, the Philippine Congress constituted itself into a Constituent Assembly and passed Resolution No 2, which called for a Constitutional Convention to change the 1935 Constitution [165]\n\n\nEarly growth of the CPP New People's Army\nOn December 29, 1970, Philippine Military Academy instructor Lt Victor Corpuz led New People's Army rebels in a raid on the PMA armory, capturing rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, a bazooka and thousands of rounds of ammunition in 1970 [172] In 1972, China, which was then actively supporting and arming communist insurgencies in Asia as part of Mao Zedong's People's War Doctrine, transported 1,200 M-14 and AK-47 rifles aboard the MV Karagatan for the NPA to speed up its campaign to defeat the government [173] [174] [175]\n\n\nRumored coup d'état and assassination plot\nRumors of coup d'état were also brewing A report of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that shortly after the 1969 Philippine presidential election, a group composed mostly of retired colonels and generals organized a revolutionary junta with the aim of first discrediting President Marcos and then killing him The group was headed by Eleuterio Adevoso, an official of the opposition Liberal Party A document given to the committee by a Philippine government official alleged that key figures in the plot were Vice President Fernando Lopez and Sergio Osmena Jr., whom Marcos defeated in the 1969 election [176]\n\n\nPlaza Miranda bombing\nIn interviews by The Washington Post, unnamed former Communist Party of the Philippines officials alleged that \"the Communist party leadership planned – and three operatives carried out – the Plaza Miranda attack in an attempt to provoke government repression and push the country to the brink of revolution Communist Party Leader Jose Maria Sison had calculated that Marcos could be provoked into cracking down on his opponents, thereby driving thousands of political activists into the underground, the anonymous former officials said Recruits were urgently needed, they said, to make use of a large influx of weapons and financial aid that China had already agreed to provide.\" [179] José María Sison continues to deny these claims, [180] and the CPP has never released any official confirmation of their culpability in the incident Marcos and his allies claimed that Benigno Aquino Jr was part of the plot, which was denied by CPP-NPA founding chair Jose Maria Sison [181]\n\n\n1971 suspension of the writ of habeas corpus\nAs a response to the Plaza Miranda bombing, Marcos issued Proclamation No 889, through which he assumed emergency powers and suspended the writ of habeas corpus [185] – an act which would later be seen as a prelude to the declaration of martial law more than a year later [146]\n\n\n1972 Manila bombings\nOn the evening of September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos announced that he had placed the entirety of the Philippines under martial law [39] This marked the beginning of a 14-year period of one-man rule that would effectively last until Marcos was exiled from the country on February 25, 1986 Even though the formal document proclaiming martial law – Proclamation No 1081 – was formally lifted on January 17, 1981, Marcos retained virtually all of his powers as dictator until he was ousted by the EDSA Revolution [187] Plaza Miranda was soon followed by a series of about twenty explosions that took place in various locations in Metro Manila in the months immediately preceding Marcos's proclamation of martial law [188] The first of these bombings took place on March 15, 1972, and the last took place on September 11, 1972, [188] twelve days before martial law was announced on September 23 of that year.\n\n\nMartial law era (1972–1981)\nMarcos's declaration of martial law became known to the public on September 23, 1972, when his press secretary, Francisco Tatad, announced through the radio [189] [39] [40] that Proclamation № 1081, which Marcos had supposedly signed two days earlier on September 21, had come into force and would extend Marcos's rule beyond the constitutional two-term limit [190] Ruling by decree, he almost dissolved press freedom and other civil liberties to add propaganda machine, closed down Congress and media establishments, and ordered the arrest of opposition leaders and militant activists, including senators Benigno Aquino Jr., Jovito Salonga and Jose W Diokno [191] [192] Marcos claimed that martial law was the prelude to creating his Bagong Lipunan, a \"New Society\" based on new social and political values [citation needed]\n\n\nArrests\nHowever, unlike Ninoy Aquino's Senate colleagues who were detained without charges, Ninoy, together with communist NPA leaders Lt Corpuz and Bernabe Buscayno, was charged with murder, illegal possession of firearms and subversion [197]\n\n\nBagong Lipunan (New Society)\nAs one of his rationalizations for the declaration of martial law, Marcos said that there was a need to \"reform society\" [149]: 66  by placing it under the control of a \"benevolent dictator\" which could guide the undisciplined populace through a period of chaos [149]: 29  [198] He referred to this social engineering exercise as the bagong lipunan or \"new society\" [199]: 13  and the Marcos administration produced a range propaganda materials – including speeches, books, lectures, slogans, and numerous propaganda songs – to promote it [199]: 13  [200] [201]\n\n\nFilipinization of Chinese schools\nTo instill patriotism among Filipino citizens and prevent the growing number of Chinese schools from propagating foreign ideologies, Marcos issued Presidential Decree No 176, [206] preventing any educational institution to be established exclusively for foreigners or offer any curriculum exclusively for foreigners, [207] and restricted the teaching of the Chinese language to not more than 100 minutes a day [208]\n\n\n1973 martial law referendum\nMartial law was put on vote in July 1973 in the 1973 Philippine martial law referendum and was marred with controversy [41]: 191  [14] resulting to 90.77% voting yes and 9.23% voting no.\n\n\nRolex 12 and the military\nAlong with Marcos, members of his Rolex 12 circle like Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, Chief of the Philippine Constabulary Fidel Ramos, and Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Fabian Ver were the chief administrators of martial law from 1972 to 1981, and the three remained President Marcos's closest advisers until he was ousted in 1986 Other peripheral members of the Rolex 12 included Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco Jr and Lucio Tan.\n\n\nUS foreign policy and martial law under Marcos\nBy 1977, the armed forces had quadrupled and over 60,000 Filipinos had been arrested for political reasons In 1981, Vice President George H W Bush praised Marcos for his \"adherence to democratic principles and to the democratic processes\" [d] No American military or politician in the 1970s ever publicly questioned the authority of Marcos to help fight communism in South East Asia [citation needed]\n\n\nWithdrawal of Taiwan relations in favor of the People's Republic of China\nPrior to the Marcos administration, the Philippine government had maintained a close relationship with the Kuomintang-ruled Republic of China (ROC) government which had fled to the island of Taiwan, despite the victory of the Chinese Communist Party in the 1949 Chinese Communist Revolution Prior administrations had seen the People's Republic of China (PRC) as a security threat, due to its financial and military support of communist rebels in the country [217]\n\n\n1978 Philippine parliamentary election\nBy 1977, reports of \"gross human rights violations\" had led to pressure from the international community, including newly elected US President Jimmy Carter, put pressure on the Marcos Administration to release Ninoy Aquino and to hold parliamentary elections to demonstrate that some \"normalization\" had begun after the declaration of martial law [221]: 168  Marcos did not release Aquino, but announced that the 1978 Philippine parliamentary election would be held in 1978 [221]: 168 \n\n\nPrime minister\nIn 1978, Ferdinand Marcos became Prime Minister of the Philippines, marking the return of the position for the first time since the terms of Pedro Paterno and Jorge Vargas during the American occupation Based on Article 9 of the 1973 constitution, it had broad executive powers that would be typical of modern prime ministers in other countries The position was the official head of government, and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces All of the previous powers of the President from the 1935 Constitution were transferred to the newly restored office of prime minister The prime minister also acted as head of the National Economic Development Authority Upon his re-election to the presidency in 1981, Marcos was succeeded as prime minister by an American-educated leader and Wharton graduate, Cesar Virata, who was elected as an Assemblyman (Member of the Parliament) from Cavite in 1978 He is the eponym of the Cesar Virata School of Business, the business school of the University of the Philippines Diliman.\n\n\nProclamation No. 2045\nAfter putting in force amendments to the constitution and legislative action, [225] President Marcos issued Proclamation 2045, which lifted martial law, on January 17, 1981, [226] while retaining the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus for rebellion and subversion-related crimes [225] The lifting of martial law was timed with the election of US President Ronald Reagan and the visit of Pope John Paul II, to get support from Reagan and minimize criticism from the Pope [225] [227]\n\n\nThird term (1981–1986)\nOn June 16, 1981, six months after the lifting of martial law, the first presidential election in twelve years was held President Marcos ran while the major opposition parties, the United Nationalists Democratic Organizations (UNIDO), a coalition of opposition parties and LABAN, boycotted the election Marcos won a massive victory over the other candidates [228]\n\n\nArmed conflict with the CPP–NPA\nThe Martial Law period, which had lasted from September 1972 to January 1981, had been a period of significant growth for the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People's army because the implementation of Martial Law had the effect of radicalizing otherwise moderate protesters [144]: 43  [133] This continued into the 1980s, with the NPA able to establish itself in urban areas and with the NDF able to form relationships with legal opposition organizations - all despite Marcos' claims in January 1981 that the conflict had been \"substantially contained.\" [225] [226] The killing of key leaders in Davao city in the opening years of the 1980s led the administration to claim that the CPP \"backbone\" in the south had broken,” [232]  But the remaining leaders soon began to experiment with new tactics including urban insurrectionism, leading the international press to label Davao City as the \"Killing Fields, and as \"the Philippines' \"Murder Capital.\" [233]  The violence reached its peak in 1985 with 1,282 military and police deaths and 1,362 civilian deaths [220]\n\n\n1980s economic collapse\nThe Marcos administration's spending had relied heavily on debt since Marcos's first term in the 60s This left the Philippines vulnerable when high inflation caused the US to raise interest rates from 1980 to 1982, which caused US recessions in 1980 and again in the 3rd quarter of 1981 [234] [235] The Philippine economy also began going into decline in 1981, continuing to do so by the time of the Benigno Aquino Jr assassination in 1983 The economic and political instability combined to produce the worst recession in Philippine history in 1984 and 1985, with the economy contracting by 7.3% for two successive years [235] and poverty incidence at 49% or almost half the Philippine population [236]\n\n\nAquino's assassination\nOn August 21, 1983, opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr was assassinated on the tarmac at Manila International Airport He had returned to the Philippines after three years in exile in the United States, where he had a heart bypass operation to save his life after Marcos allowed him to leave the Philippines to seek medical care Prior to his heart surgery, Ninoy, along with his two co-accused, NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno (Commander Dante) and Lt Victor Corpuz, were sentenced to death by a military commission on charges of murder, illegal possession of firearms and subversion [197]\n\n\nImpeachment attempt\nIn August 1985, 56 Assemblymen signed a resolution calling for the impeachment of President Marcos for alleged diversion of US aid for personal use, [242] citing a July 1985 San Jose Mercury News exposé of the Marcos's multimillion-dollar investment and property holdings in the United States.\n\n\nPhysical decline\nDuring his third term, Marcos's health deteriorated rapidly due to kidney ailments, as a complication of a chronic autoimmune disease lupus erythematosus He had a kidney transplant in August 1983, and when his body rejected the first kidney transplant, he underwent a second transplant in November 1984 [243] Marcos's regime was sensitive to publicity of his condition; a palace physician who alleged that during one of these periods Marcos had undergone a kidney transplant was shortly afterwards found murdered Police said he was kidnapped and slain by communist rebels [243] Many people questioned whether he still had capacity to govern, due to his grave illness and the burgeoning political unrest [244] With Marcos ailing, his powerful wife, Imelda, emerged as the government's main public figure Marcos dismissed speculations of his ailing health as he used to be an avid golfer and fitness buff who liked showing off his physique.\n\n\nEconomic performance\nThe 21-year period of Philippine economic history during Ferdinand Marcos's regime – from his election in 1965 until he was ousted by the People Power Revolution in 1986 – was a period of significant economic highs and lows [248] [235] [105]\n\n\nPoverty and inequality\nSusan Quimpo recounts that times were hard financially during the Marcos regime, so much so that citizens had to line up for rice rations due to rice shortage, and that the government told citizens to consume corn instead [251]\n\n\nDebt\nTo help finance a number of economic development projects, the Marcos government borrowed large amounts of money from international lenders [254] [255] The external debt of the Philippines rose more than 70-fold from $360 million in 1962 to $26.2 billion in 1985, [256] making the Philippines one of the most indebted countries in Asia [254]\n\n\nReliance on US trade\nAs a former colony of the United States, the Philippines was heavily reliant on the American economy to purchase agricultural goods such as sugar, [260] tobacco, coconut, bananas, and pineapple [261] [page needed] [262]\n\n\nEconomy during martial law (1973–1980)\nAccording to World Bank Data, the Philippine's Annual Gross Domestic Product quadrupled from $8 billion in 1972 to $32.45 billion in 1980, for an inflation-adjusted average growth rate of 6% per year, while debt stood at US$17.2 billion by the end of 1980 [249] [257] According to The Heritage Foundation in the United States, the Philippines enjoyed its best economic development since 1945 between 1972 and 1979 [263] The economy grew amidsts two severe global oil shocks following the 1973 oil crisis and 1979 energy crisis – oil price was $3 / barrel in 1973 and $39.5 in 1979, or a growth of 1200% By the end of 1979, debt was still manageable, with debt to Debt-GNP ratio about the same as South Korea, according to the US National Bureau of Economic Research [257]\n\n\nEconomy after martial law (1981–1985)\nThe Philippine economy, heavily reliant on exports to the United States, suffered a great decline after the Aquino assassination in August 1983.\n\n\nCreation of the Credit Information Bureau\nIn 1981, Ferdinand Marcos issued Letter of Instructions No 1107 mandating the Central Bank of the Philippines to analyze the probability of establishing and funding the operation of a credit bureau in the Philippines due to the disturbing increase of failures on corporate borrowers [267] In adherence to the order, Central Bank of the Philippines organized the Credit Information Exchange System under the department of Loans and Credit It was created to engage in collating, developing and analyzing credit information on individuals, institutions, business entities and other business concerns It aims to develop and undertake the continuing exchange of credit data within its members and subscribers and to provide an impartial source of credit information for debtors, creditors and the public On April 14, 1982, Credit Information Bureau, Inc was incorporated as a non-stock, non-profit corporation CIBI was created pursuant to LOI No 1107 dated February 16, 1981, and was further strengthened by PD No 1941 which recognizes and supports CIBI as a suitable credit bureau to promote the development and maintenance of rational and efficient credit processes in the financial system and in the economy as a whole In 1997, Credit Information Bureau, Inc was incorporated and transformed into a private entity and became CIBI Information, Inc CIBI is a provider of information and intelligence for business, credit and individuals [268] The company also supplies compliance reports before accrediting suppliers, industry partners and even hiring professionals [269]\n\n\nSnap election, People Power Revolution, and ouster (1986)\nIn late 1985, in the face of escalating public discontent and under pressure from foreign allies, Marcos called a snap election with more than a year left in his term He selected Arturo Tolentino as his running mate The opposition to Marcos united behind two American-educated leaders, Aquino's widow, Corazon, and her running mate, Salvador Laurel [270] [271]\n\n\n1986 snap election\nIn late 1985, in the face of escalating public discontent and under pressure from foreign allies, Marcos called a snap election with more than a year left in his term He selected Arturo Tolentino as his running mate The opposition to Marcos united behind two American-educated leaders, Aquino's widow, Corazon, and her running mate, Salvador Laurel [270] [271]\n\n\n1986 RAM coup and People Power Revolution\nThe failed election process gave a decisive boost to the \"People Power movement\" Enrile and Ramos would later abandon Marcos and switch sides and seek protection behind the 1986 People Power Revolution, backed by fellow-American educated Eugenio Lopez Jr., Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, and the old political and economic elites RAM, led by Lt Col Gregorio \"Gringo\" Honasan and backed by Enrile had plotted a coup d'état to seize Malacañang and kill Marcos and his family [279]\n\n\nExile in Hawaii (1986–1989)\nAt 15:00 PST (GMT+8) on February 25, 1986, Marcos talked to United States Senator Paul Laxalt, a close associate of the United States President, Ronald Reagan, asking for advice from the White House Laxalt advised him to \"cut and cut cleanly\", to which Marcos expressed his disappointment after a short pause [283] In the afternoon, Marcos talked to Enrile, asking for safe passage for him and his family, and included his close allies like General Ver Finally, at 9:00 p.m., the Marcos family was transported by four Sikorsky HH-3E helicopters [284] to Clark Air Base in Angeles City, about 83 kilometers north of Manila, before boarding US Air Force C-130 planes bound for Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, and finally to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii where Marcos arrived on February 26.\n\n\nFleeing to Hawaii\nAt 15:00 PST (GMT+8) on February 25, 1986, Marcos talked to United States Senator Paul Laxalt, a close associate of the United States President, Ronald Reagan, asking for advice from the White House Laxalt advised him to \"cut and cut cleanly\", to which Marcos expressed his disappointment after a short pause [283] In the afternoon,

Force Base in Hawaii where Marcos arrived on February 26.\n\n\nPlans to return and \"The Marcos Tapes\"\nMore than a year after the People Power Revolution, it was revealed to the United States House Foreign Affairs subcommittee in 1987 that Marcos held an intention to fly back to the Philippines and overthrow the Aquino government Two Americans, namely attorney Richard Hirschfeld and business consultant Robert Chastain, both of whom posed as arms dealers, gained knowledge of a plot by gaining Marcos's trust and secretly tape recorded their conversations with the ousted leader.\n\n\nLegal cases\nWithin two weeks of his arrival to the United States, the Marcos family and their cronies received hundred of criminal and civil cases filed in Hawaii, San Francisco, and New York [288] Marcos made personal appeals with Pres Ronald Reagan to intervene and put a stop to these cases In June 1988 National Security Advisor Colin Powell recommended proceeding with the indictment of the Marcoses, as he reviewed the cases as forwarded by the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Rudy Giuliani Pres Reagan gave his tacit approval to this [299] On August 4, Marcos stated that he had head of state immunity to resist the subpoenas by a federal grand jury to produce his finger and palm prints, and failed to consent to investigators to go into his foreign bank accounts By August 18, a bench warrant of arrest was released against the Marcoses By October that year, Pres Reagan personally wrote to Marcos informing him that he believed his innocence of the charges against him, but reminding him that the case was out of his hands He also assured him that they will have every opportunity to prove their innocence in the US justice system [300]\n\n\nDeath and burial\nMarcos was admitted to the hospital on January 15, 1989, with pneumonia and underwent a series of operations [301] In his dying days, Marcos was visited by Vice President Salvador Laurel [302] During the meeting with Laurel, Marcos offered to return 90% of his ill-gotten wealth to the Filipino people in exchange for being buried back in the Philippines beside his mother, an offer also disclosed to Enrique Zobel However, Marcos's offer was rebuffed by the Aquino government and by Imelda Marcos [303] [304] [305]\n\n\nTrials and reparations\nRogelio Roxas, a Filipino treasure hunter, discovered a 3-foot-tall golden Buddha statue in tunnels under the Baguio General Hospital in 1971 Roxas was later arrested and tortured by members of the military, and the statue was taken away Upon exile of the Marcoses, Roxas assigned his rights to a friend in the United States and formed the Golden Buddha Corporation (GBC) who pursued the case against the former president In 1996, the lower court awarded US$22 billion in favor of GBC, making this the largest award in any civil case in the history of the United States In November 1998, the Hawaii Supreme Court overturned the ruling, but still maintained the award of US$6 million for the illegal arrest and torture experienced by Roxas [313] [314]\n\n\nRoxas v. Marcos\nRogelio Roxas, a Filipino treasure hunter, discovered a 3-foot-tall golden Buddha statue in tunnels under the Baguio General Hospital in 1971 Roxas was later arrested and tortured by members of the military, and the statue was taken away Upon exile of the Marcoses, Roxas assigned his rights to a friend in the United States and formed the Golden Buddha Corporation (GBC) who pursued the

the Hawaii Supreme Court overturned the ruling, but still maintained the award of US$6 million for the illegal arrest and torture experienced by Roxas [313] [314]\n\n\nSandiganbayan, Supreme Court, and international trials\nOn November 9, 2018, Imelda Marcos was found \"guilty beyond reasonable doubt\" by the Sandiganbayan of seven counts of graft for the private organizations set up in Switzerland during her active duty as a government official from 1968 to 1986 In less than 20 days however, the Sandiganbayan listed Imelda's \"advanced age\" and health condition as considerations for allowing the accused to post bail The Fifth Division's (of the Sandiganbayan) ruling read that \"the fact that she is of advanced age and for health reasons, consistent with the doctrine in Enrile vs Sandiganbayan, bail is allowed for these seven cases.\" [315] The Supreme Court of the Philippines affirms that the Marcoses' assets, that are beyond the legal and declared government salaries, are considered as ill-gotten wealth In 1998 however, the Supreme Court acquitted Imelda Marcos of corruption charges from a previous graft conviction in 1993.\n\n\nReparations\nIn 1995, some 10,000 Filipinos won a US class-action lawsuit filed against the Marcos estate The claims were filed by victims or their surviving relatives consequent on torture, execution, and disappearances [316] [317]\n\n\nLegacy\nMarcos left an economic legacy of debt, hardship and excess of dictatorship [330]\n\n\nAuthoritarianism\nWhile Ferdinand Marcos was not the first Philippine executive to institute an authoritarian form of government, he was the first to do so since the immediate post-WWII era, and the first to do so throughout the whole archipelago since the war itself [14]\n\n\nHuman rights abuses\nAs many student activists like Edgar Jopson and Rigoberto Tiglao, farmers like Bernabe Buscayno, journalists like Satur Ocampo, legal political opposition (Ninoy Aquino [333] and fellow candidate in 1978 election Alex Boncayao [222]), and priest and nuns joined or developed relationships with communist rebels, [334] many farmers, [335] student protesters, [336] leftists, [210] political opponents, [337] journalists and members of the media [338] [339] accused of being members or sympathizing with the CPP, NPA or MNLF [340] or of plotting against the government were frequent targets of human rights violations Victims would simply be rounded up with no arrest warrant nor reading of prisoners' rights and kept indefinitely locked up with no charges filed against them [133] In a keynote speech at the University of the East, journalist Raissa Robles described how anyone could just be arrested (or abducted) with ease through pre-signed Arrest Search and Seizure Orders (ASSO), [341] which allowed the military or police to detain victims on trumped up charges or unclear allegations according to Rappler research [342] Anybody could be picked up at any time for any reason by the military or the police, according to Raissa's husband, journalist Alan Robles [343] [344]\n\n\nAbductions\nVictims were often taken to military \"safehouses\", [352] a euphemism for hidden places of torture, [353] often blindfolded [133] [354] In a document titled \"Open Letter to the Filipino People\", martial law martyr Edgar \"Edjop\" Jopson described safehouses as such: \"Safehouses usually have their windows always shut tight They are usually covered with high walls One would usually detect  [safehouses] through the traffic of motorcycles and cars, going in and out of the house at irregular hours Burly men, armed with pistols tucked in their waists or in clutch bags, usually drive these vehicles.\" [355]\n\n\nTorture\nVarious forms of torture were used by the military, and these forms of torture were usually combined with each other [337]\n\n\nKillings\nSummary executions were prevalent during the martial law era with bodies being recovered in various places and often bearing signs of torture and mutilation [355] [357] Such cases were referred to as \"salvaging\" with the term widely believed to have originated from the Spanish word salvaje, meaning savage [358] Mutilated remains were often dumped on roadsides in public display in order to spread a sense of fear and to intimidate opponents from encouraging actions against the government – turning the Philippines into a theater state of terror [24]\n\n\n\"Salvagings\"\nSummary executions were prevalent during the martial law era with bodies being recovered in various places and often

Mutilated remains were often dumped on roadsides in public display in order to spread a sense of fear and to intimidate opponents from encouraging actions against the government – turning the Philippines into a theater state of terror [24]\n\n\nEnforced disappearances\nEnforced disappearances, also known \"desaparecidos\" or \"the disappeared\" – people who suddenly went missing, sometimes without a trace and with bodies never recovered [362]\n\n\nNotable murders\nWhile the numbers of political detainees went down, the number of people killed rose and spiked in 1981, the year martial law was officially lifted by Marcos according to Task Force Detainees of the Philippines According to Senator Jose W Diokno, \"As torture (cases) declined, a more terrible tactic emerged; unofficial executions\" – suspected dissidents were simply arrested and vanished [133]\n\n\nCivilian massacres\nIt is hard to judge the full extent of massacres and atrocities that happened during the Marcos regime due to a heavily censored press at the time [366]\n\n\nMuslim massacres\nThe Marcos regime had started to kill hundreds of Moros even before the imposition of martial law in 1972 [372] Thousands of Moros were killed during the Marcos regime, prompting them to form insurgent groups and separatist movements such as the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which became more radical with time due to atrocities against Muslims [373] According to the study The Liberation Movements in Mindanao: Root Causes and Prospects for Peace, a doctoral dissertation by Marjanie Salic Macasalong, the number of Moro victims killed by the Army, Philippine Constabulary, and the Ilaga (a notorious government-sanctioned [374] terrorist cult known for cannibalism and land grabbing that served as members of the CHDF) [369] reached as high as 10,000 lives [351]\n\n\nFamily denial\nMembers of the Marcos family deny that human rights violations happened during the Marcos administration [378]\n\n\nIll-gotten wealth and kleptocracy\nThe Philippine Supreme Court considers all Marcos assets beyond their legally declared earnings/salary to be ill-gotten wealth [382] and such wealth to have been forfeited in favor of the government or human rights victims [383]\n\n\nOverseas investments and bank accounts\nThe overseas properties of Marcos and his associates created an empire spanning places as diverse as California, Washington, New York, Rome, Vienna, Australia, Antilles, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Switzerland and Singapore The more popular properties among those in this empire are the multimillion-dollar New York real estate investments, California banks and Swiss bank accounts; lesser known ones are villas in Austria, London, and Rome, gold and diamond investments in South Africa, and banks and hotels in Israel [415]: 423 \n\n\nIllegal Swiss foundations\nIn 1986, following the overthrow of the Marcos regime, it was discovered that as early as 1968, [421] Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, under the pseudonyms William Saunders and Jane Ryan, [421] opened bank accounts in Swiss banks, with one account having a balance of $950,000 [422] Ferdinand Marcos's salary then was only around $5,600 a year [422] while Imelda Marcos did not have any visible means of income.\n\n\nMonopolies\nMarcos's administration spawned new oligarchs in Philippine society who became instant millionaires [426] These oligarchs plundered government financing institutions to finance their corporate raiding, monopolies and various takeover schemes Marcos's cronies were awarded timber, mining and oil concessions and vast tracts of rich government agricultural and urban lands, not to mention lush government construction contracts During his martial law regime, Marcos confiscated and appropriated by force and duress many businesses and institutions, both private and public, and redistributed them to his cronies and close personal friends A presidential crony representing Westington won for its principal the $500 million bid for the construction of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant in Bagac The crony's commission was $25 million or $200 million representing five percent of the total bid price These new oligarchs were known to be insatiable and more profligate than the oligarchs of pre-martial law days [151] Two of Marcos's friends were Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco Jr., who would go on to control San Miguel Corporation, and Ramon Cojuangco, late businessman and chairman of PLDT, and father of Antonio \"Tony Boy\" Cojuangco (who would eventually succeed his father in the telecommunications company), both happened to be cousins of Corazon Aquino These associates of Marcos then used these as fronts to launder proceeds from institutionalized graft and corruption in the different national governmental agencies as \"crony capitalism\" for personal benefit Graft and corruption via bribery, racketeering, and embezzlement became more prevalent during this era [427] [428] Marcos also silenced the free press, making the press of the state propaganda the only legal one, which was a common practice for governments around the world that sought to fight communism [citation needed]\n\n\nFloating casino in Manila Bay\nOne of the first acts of Imelda Marcos as the governor of Metro Manila was to legalize gambling to raise revenue for the new metropolis A floating casino was allowed to operate exclusively inside the Manila Bay It is owned and operated by \"mysterious\" stockholders according to the major daily However, the people of Manila are aware that behind the floating casino management was the brother of Imelda Marcos One of the most lucrative gambling managements back then was the Jai-Alai, managed by a corporation that received its franchise from the pre-war Commonwealth government As soon as its franchised expired, a new corporation took over management of Jai-Alai It was immediately under the control of the First Lady's brother This new management was allowed to perform operations denied from the former, and it is estimated that the take between the Jai-Alai fronton and the floating casino is PHP2 million a day [151]\n\n\nPhilippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)\nReports of the US Senate and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have described massive million-dollar bribes to officials of the government-backed Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company by the General Telephone and Electric Co of New York in exchange for supply contracts The officials of PLDT needed to be investigated for violations of foreign currency regulations and unearned income However, different stakeholders were kept silent As one PLDT official boasted \"an exposé will only hurt the Palace.\" In the US and Japan, presidents have been driven out of office for similar misconduct [151]\n\n\nManila Electric Co. (Meralco)\nThe Manila Electric Company (Meralco) was one of the largest corporations in the Philippines before the declaration of martial law It was owned and controlled by the Lopez family After martial law was imposed, it became the prime target for takeover by the Marcos-Romualdez family Among the first things the clan did was to arrest the eldest son of Eugenio Lopez Sr., the major stockholder of Meralco for allegedly plotting the assassination of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\n\nPhilippine national debt\nMassive foreign loans enabled Marcos to build more schools, hospitals and infrastructure than all of his predecessors combined, [13] but crippled the Philippine economy [citation needed] Today, according to Ibon Foundation, Filipino citizens are still bearing the heavy burden of servicing public debts incurred during Marcos's administration, with ongoing interest payments on the loan schedule by the Philippine government estimated to last until 2025–59 years after Marcos assumed office and 39 years after he was deposed [431] [432]\n\n\nInfrastructure and edifices\nMarcos projected himself to the Philippine public as having spent a lot on construction projects, and his record upholds that reputation [105]: 128  A 2011 study by University of the Philippines School of Economics indicated that at the time of the study, Marcos was the president that spent the most on infrastructure, not just because he stayed in power for nearly two and a half decades, but in terms of actual per-year spending By the time of the study, Marcos had only been outspent in infrastructure building for a period of one year, during the term of Fidel Ramos [436]\n\n\nCultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) Complex\nThe CCP Complex is a 77-hectare [447] reclaimed property in Pasay designed by Leandro Locsin It includes the CCP main building, the Folk Arts Theater, the Philippine International Convention Center, the Manila Film Center and the Coconut Palace (also called the Tahanang Pilipino) [448] It was established as a result of Ferdinand Marcos's issuance of Executive Order No 30 s 1966, which stated that \"the preservation and promotion of Philippine culture in all its varied aspects and phases is a vital concern of the State.\" [449] Following this issuance, he appointed a seven-member board of trustees, who then unanimously elected Imelda Marcos as its chair [448]\n\n\nSan Juanico Bridge\nThe San Juanico Bridge is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway and links the provinces of Leyte and Samar through Tacloban City and Santa Rita, Samar Having a total length of 2.16 kilometres (1.34 mi), it is the longest bridge over a body of water in the Philippines [451] It is said to be Ferdinand Marcos's gift to his wife Imelda, whose hometown was Leyte [452]\n\n\nManila Film Center\nConstruction of the Manila Film Center began in January 1981 and was spearheaded by Imelda Marcos It cost $25 million [443] [454]\n\n\nMasagana 99\nMarcos's signature agricultural program, Masagana 99, was thus launched on May 21, 1973, [456] [457] as an effort to address a nationwide rice shortage arising from the various natural disasters and pest infestations in 1972 [458]\n\n\nLogging and deforestation\nThe Marcos administration marked a period of intense logging exportation, [473] with commercial logging accounting for 5% of the gross national product during the first half of the 1970s This was the result of intense demand created by a construction boom in Japan [474] [475] Timber products became one of the nation's top exports but little attention was paid to the environmental impacts of deforestation as cronies never complied with reforestation agreements [476] [477]\n\n\nHeavy industrialization projects\nIn 1979, Marcos put a range of 11 heavy industrialization projects [480] on the Philippines' economic agenda.\n\n\nBataan Nuclear Power Plant\nThe Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP) is one of the six nuclear power plants that the Marcos regime planned to build [490] It stands in Morong, Bataan, atop Napot Point that overlooks the South China Sea Construction of the BNPP began in 1976 and was completed in 1985 [491]\n\n\nEducational system\nRecognizing the value Filipino culture placed on education, Marcos emphasized the construction of educational infrastructure as early as during his first presidential term By being more willing than those previous presidents to use foreign loans to fund construction projects, he was able to achieve construct more roads and schoolbuildings than any previous administration [105]: 128 \n\n\nEstablishment of Metro Manila\nIn 1975, Marcos issued Presidential Decree No 824, placing the four cities and thirteen municipalities in the immediate vicinity of the Province of Manila under the administration of the Metro Manila Commission (MMC), which would serve as the central government of the capital [498]\n\n\nLaws passed during the Marcos administration\nThe country crafted a large number of decrees, laws, and edicts during Marcos's term [501] From 1972 to 1986, the Marcos Administration codified laws through 2,036 Presidential Decrees, [502] an average of 145 per year during the 14-year period To put this into context, only 14, 12, and 11 laws were passed in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively [503] A large number of the laws passed during the term of Marcos remain in force today and are embedded in the country's legal system [501] According to Imee Marcos in 2006, many of the thousands of proclamations, decrees, and executive orders Marcos issued were still in force, and few have been repealed, revoked, modified or amended [504]\n\n\nImpact on later Philippine governance\nMany people who rose to power during Marcos's 21-years as president continued to remain in power or even ascended higher after his exile, thus leaving a further imprint on present-day Filipino affairs One of these was Fidel Ramos, a general promoted by Marcos who supervised many terror killings and tortures, who later switched sides and subsequently became president himself through free elections [505]\n\n\nThe US–Marcos relationship\nAll five American presidents from 1965 to 1985 were unwilling to jeopardize the US–Marcos relationship, mainly to protect and retain access of the US military bases in the Philippines However, at the same time, for the US the Philippines was just one of its many allies, and for the Philippines, the US was its only patron Therefore, Marcos worked to identify himself closely with the US in order to secure a strong bargaining position with their government Indeed, he had manipulated this American connection to sustain him during his two decades of power US support was believed to be the only reason why Marcos remained in power [506]\n\n\nAuthored works\nA number of books were published under Marcos's name during his term from 1970 to 1983, and a final book was published in 1990 posthumously [509] Those published during his term are believed to have been written by ghostwriters, [510] notably Adrian Cristobal [511] [512]\n\n\nHonors\nMarcos and his wife, Imelda, were jointly credited in 1989 by Guinness World Records with the largest-ever theft from a government (an estimated 5 billion to 10 billion US dollars), [522] a record they still hold today [64]\n\n\nNational honors\nMarcos and his wife, Imelda, were jointly credited in 1989 by Guinness World Records with the largest-ever theft from a government (an estimated 5 billion to 10 billion US dollars), [522] a record they still hold today [64]\n\n\nForeign honors\nMarcos and his wife, Imelda, were jointly credited in 1989 by Guinness World Records with the largest-ever theft from a government (an estimated 5 billion to 10 billion US dollars), [522] a record they still hold today [64]\n\n\nSee also\nBusiness sector opposition\n\n\nNotes\nBusiness sector

He is best known for his racing career in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series and Busch Series, as well as his involvement in the creation of Joe Gibbs Racing Motocross (JGRMX) in the AMA motocross and supercross championships.\n\n**Football**\n\nGibbs played college football as a linebacker at Stanford University from 1991 to 1994. During his senior year, he led the Cardinal in tackles, demonstrating his athletic prowess and dedication to the sport. After college, Gibbs joined the Washington Redskins as an offensive quality control assistant in 2004, a position he held until 2007. His experience in football helped shape his understanding of the importance of teamwork and strategy, skills that he would later apply to his racing career.\n\n**Racing Career**\n\nGibbs made his NASCAR debut in the Craftsman Truck Series in 2000, sharing the driving duties of the No. 20 Chevrolet with his brother J.D. In 2001, he began racing a full-time schedule, posting two top-five finishes and finishing 10th in points both in 2001 and 2002. Gibbs' performance in the series earned him a reputation as a skilled and competitive driver.\n\nIn 2003, Gibbs replaced Mike McLaughlin in the Busch Series, competing in the No. 19 Chevrolet for his father's team. He secured two top-ten finishes and was named runner-up in the Rookie of the Year race to David Stremme. Gibbs' impressive performance in the Busch Series led to his decision to retire from racing at the conclusion of the season.\n\n**Kevin Harvick Incident**\n\nOne of Gibbs' most notable moments in NASCAR came in 2002, when he and Kevin Harvick clashed in the spring Truck Series race at Martinsville Speedway. Gibbs, driving the No. 20 truck for his father's team, made contact with Harvick's No. 6 truck, which he owned. Harvick retaliated later in the race, intentionally wrecking Gibbs' truck after a restart. The incident resulted in Harvick being parked for the remainder of the race.\n\nAlthough Harvick denied his actions were intentional, radio communications revealed otherwise. The incident also came on the heels of Harvick's physical altercation with Greg Biffle after the Busch Series race at Bristol Motor Speedway two weeks earlier. As a result, Harvick was suspended from the Cup Series race at Martinsville one day later, fined $35,000, and put on probation for the rest of the year.\n\n**Motorcycle Racing Team**\n\nIn August 2007, Gibbs announced the formation of Joe Gibbs Racing Motocross (JGRMX), competing in the AMA motocross and supercross championships. Gibbs headed up the operation, working alongside motocross industry veteran David Evans to create a competitive team. The race shop for JGRMX was located in Huntersville, North Carolina, just a short distance from the NASCAR Cup Series teams.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nGibbs was originally from Fayetteville, Arkansas, but later resided in Cornelius, North Carolina, with his wife Heather and their four children, sons Ty, Case, and Jett, and daughter Elle.\n\n**Motorsports Career Results**\n\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time Italics – Pole position earned by points standings or practice time * – Most laps led.)\n\n**NASCAR**\n\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time Italics – Pole position earned by points standings or practice time * – Most laps led.)\n\n| Year | Team | Manufacturer | No. | Start | Finish |\n| 2000 | Joe Gibbs Racing | Chevrolet | 20 | 10 | 15 |\n| 2001 | Joe Gibbs Racing | Chevrolet | 20 | 5 | 10 |\n| 2002 | Joe Gibbs Racing | Chevrolet | 20 | 15 | 10 |\n| 2003 | Joe Gibbs Racing | Chevrolet | 19 | 20 | 5 |\n\n**Busch Series**\n\n| Year | Team | Manufacturer | No. | Start | Finish |\n| 2003 | Joe Gibbs Racing | Chevrolet | 19 | 10 | 5 |\n\n**Craftsman Truck Series**\n\n| Year | Team | Manufacturer | No. | Start | Finish |\n| 2000 | Joe Gibbs Racing | Chevrolet | 20 | 15 | 10 |\n| 2001 | Joe Gibbs Racing | Chevrolet | 20 | 5 | 10 |\n| 2002 | Joe Gibbs Racing | Chevrolet | 20 | 15 | 10 |\n\nThis article about Coy Gibbs provides a comprehensive overview of his racing career, personal life, and involvement in the creation of Joe Gibbs Racing Motocross.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Coy_Gibbs\" following this outline:\n\n\nFootball\nGibbs played college football as a linebacker at Stanford University from 1991 to 1994 [5] He led the Cardinal in tackles as a senior In 2004, after his father was re-hired as the Redskins coach, he joined the team as an offensive quality control assistant, [6] serving in that capacity until 2007 [7]\n\n\nRacing career\nGibbs made his NASCAR debut in the Craftsman Truck Series in 2000, sharing the driving duties of the No 20 Chevrolet with his brother J D In 2001, he began racing a full-time schedule, posting two top-five finishes, and finishing 10th in points both in 2001 and 2002 [8]  In 2003, he replaced Mike McLaughlin in the Busch Series, nailing down two top-ten finishes and being named runner-up in the Rookie of the Year race to David Stremme He retired from racing at the conclusion of the season [citation needed]\n\n\nKevin Harvick incident\nOne of Gibbs' more notable moments in NASCAR came in 2002, when he and Kevin Harvick raced in the spring Truck Series race at Martinsville Speedway Gibbs, driving the #20 truck for his father's team, made contact with Harvick, who was driving the #6 truck that he owned, during the race Harvick retaliated later on by intentionally wrecking Gibbs' after a restart, which resulted in the #6 being parked for the remainder of the race Although Harvick denied his actions were intentional, radio communications proved otherwise and, since Harvick was already on probation after he got into a physical altercation with Greg Biffle after the Busch Series race at Bristol Motor Speedway two weeks earlier, [9] the incident with Gibbs resulted in Harvick being suspended from the Cup Series race at Martinsville one day later [10] Harvick was also fined $35,000 and was put into another probation for the rest of the year [11]\n\n\nMotorcycle racing team\nIn August 2007, Gibbs announced the formation of Joe Gibbs Racing Motocross (JGRMX) competing in the AMA motocross and supercross championships [12] [13] The race shop for JGRMX was less than a 1-mile away from the NASCAR Cup Series teams located in Huntersville, North Carolina [12] Gibbs headed up the operation along with help from motocross industry veteran David Evans [citation needed]\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nOriginally from Fayetteville, Arkansas, Gibbs lived in Cornelius, North Carolina with his wife Heather and their four children, sons Ty, Case, and Jett, and daughter Elle [citation needed]\n\n\nMotorsports career results\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time Italics – Pole position earned by points standings or practice time * – Most laps led.)\n\n\nNASCAR\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time Italics – Pole position earned by points standings or practice time * – Most laps led.)\n\n\nBusch Series\n\n\nCraftsman Truck Series\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Star_Wars", "content": "\nPremise\nThe Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters \"a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\" [2] across multiple fictional eras, in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with droids, which may be programmed for personal assistance or battle [3] Space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology [4] [5] [6] The planets range from wealthy, planet-wide cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive tribes Virtually any Earth biome, along with many fictional ones, has its counterpart as a Star Wars planet which, in most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life [7] The franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae [8] [9] Spacecraft range from small starfighters to large capital ships, such as the Star Destroyers, as well as space stations such as the moon-sized Death Stars [10] [11] [12] Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual screens, holographic projections, and hyperspace transmission [13]\n\n\nFilms\nThe Star Wars film series centers around three sets of trilogies, the nine films of which are collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\" [43] The saga was produced non-chronologically, beginning in media res with the release of the original trilogy between 1977 and 1983 This was followed by the prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005, and the sequel trilogy, released between 2015 and 2019 [44]\n\n\nThe Skywalker Saga\nThe Star Wars film series centers around three sets of trilogies, the nine films of which are collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\" [43] The saga was produced non-chronologically, beginning in media res with the release of the original trilogy between 1977 and 1983 This was followed by the prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005, and the sequel trilogy, released between 2015 and 2019 [44]\n\n\nOriginal trilogy\nIn 1971, George Lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the Flash Gordon serial, but could not obtain the rights, so he began developing his own space opera [49] [c] After directing American Graffiti (1973), he wrote a two-page synopsis, which 20th Century Fox decided to invest in [50] [51] By 1974, he had expanded the story into the first draft of a screenplay [52] Fox expected the film would be of limited financial success, and so it was given a relatively low budget, with production being moved to Elstree Studios in England to help save on cost [53]\n\n\nPrequel trilogy\nAccording to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films [57] In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted, [58] but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981 [59] In 1983, Lucas explained that \"There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now .. As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them .. I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday.\" [60]\n\n\nSequel trilogy\nPrior to releasing the original 1977 film, and made possible by its success, Lucas planned \"three trilogies of nine films\" [56] [66] However, he announced to Time in 1978 that he planned \"10 sequels\" [67] He confirmed that he had outlined the prequels and sequels in 1981 [68] At various stages of development, the sequel trilogy was to focus on the rebuilding of the Republic, [69] the return of Luke as a Jedi Master (a role similar to that of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original trilogy), [66] Luke's sister (not yet determined to be Leia), [57] Han, Leia, [70] R2-D2 and C-3PO [56] [71] However, after beginning work on the prequel trilogy, Lucas insisted that Star Wars was meant to be a six-part series and that there would be no sequel trilogy [72] [73]\n\n\nStandalone films\nSeveral Star Wars films have been produced separately from the Skywalker Saga In 2008, Lucasfilm released the animated film The Clone Wars, which is set during the prequel trilogy and serves as the theatrical pilot of the television series of the same name [85] Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, an \"anthology\" film series set between the main episodes of the Skywalker Saga entered development in parallel with the production of the sequel trilogy, [86] described by Disney chief financial officer Jay Rasulo as origin stories [87]\n\n\nUpcoming films\nIn April 2023, three new Star Wars films were announced to be set within different eras of the franchise [97] An untitled film written and directed by James Mangold will be set during the \"dawn of the Jedi\" [97] Dave Filoni will direct a film set between the original and sequel trilogies during the New Republic era, serving as the climax of the various live-action television series that began with The Mandalorian in 2019 [97] Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy will direct a third film about a new Jedi Order, set fifteen years after the sequel trilogy [94] [98]\n\n\nOther potential projects\nLucasfilm has a number of Star Wars films in various stages of development, including:\n\n\nTelevision\nThe first two animated series, Droids and Ewoks, were produced in the 1980s [128] They were followed by the Clone Wars animated micro-series in 2003 and the 2008 series of the same name Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, all animated series released prior to 2014, apart from the 2008 series, were discarded from the franchise's canon [1] Subsequent animated series include Rebels, released in 2014; Resistance, released in 2018; and The Bad Batch, released in 2021.\n\n\nAnimated series\nThe first two animated series, Droids and Ewoks, were produced in the

2014, apart from the 2008 series, were discarded from the franchise's canon [1] Subsequent animated series include Rebels, released in 2014; Resistance, released in 2018; and The Bad Batch, released in 2021.\n\n\nLive-action series\nThe Star Wars franchise includes several live-action series The first series, The Mandalorian, was released in 2019 for the streaming service Disney+ and is set between the original and sequel trilogies of the Skywalker Saga [131] Due to its success, the series spawned multiple live-action spin-offs set during the same fictional era, including The Book of Boba Fett, released in 2021; Ahsoka, released in 2023; and the upcoming Skeleton Crew [132] [133] [134] These series follow the plight of the New Republic and its allies against the remnants of the fallen Galactic Empire [135]\n\n\nFilms and specials\nThe Star Wars canon fictional universe spans multiple eras, of which three are focused around each of the film trilogies [138] The following eras were defined in January 2021, [139] and further refined and expanded in April 2023: [140]\n\n\nFictional timeline\nThe Star Wars canon fictional universe spans multiple eras, of which three are focused around each of the film trilogies [138] The following eras were defined in January 2021, [139] and further refined and expanded in April 2023: [140]\n\n\nOther media\nFrom 1976 to 2014, the term Expanded Universe (EU) was an umbrella term for all officially licensed Star Wars storytelling material set outside the events depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video games [145] Lucasfilm maintained internal continuity between the films and television content and the EU material until April 25, 2014, when the company announced all of the EU works would cease production Existing works would no longer be considered canon to the franchise and subsequent reprints would be rebranded under the Star Wars Legends label, [145] with downloadable content for the massively multiplayer online game The Old Republic the only Legends material to still be produced The Star Wars canon was subsequently restructured to only include the existing six feature films, the animated film The Clone Wars (2008), and its companion animated series All future projects and creative developments across all types of media would be overseen and coordinated by the story group, announced as a division of Lucasfilm created to maintain continuity and a cohesive vision on the storytelling of the franchise [1] Multiple comics series from Marvel and novels published by Del Rey were produced after the announcement Since the new canon has been introduced, there has been a multitude of pieces of Expanded Universe continuity that have become a part of canon [146]\n\n\nPrint media\nStar Wars in print predates the release of the first film, with the November 1976 novelization of Star Wars, initially subtitled \"From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker\" Credited to Lucas, it was ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster [147] The first \"Expanded Universe\" story appeared in Marvel Comics' Star Wars #7 in January 1978 (the first six issues being an adaptation of the film), followed by Foster's sequel novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye the following month.\n\n\nNovels\nAfter penning the novelization of the original film, Foster followed it with the sequel Splinter of the Mind's Eye (1978) The novelizations of The Empire Strikes Back (1980) by Donald F Glut and Return of the Jedi (1983) by James Kahn followed, as well as The Han Solo Adventures trilogy (1979–1980) by Brian Daley, [148] and The Adventures of Lando Calrissian trilogy (1983) by L Neil Smith [149] [150]\n\n\nComics\nMarvel Comics published a Star Wars comic book series from 1977 to 1986 [177] [178] [179] [180] Original Star Wars comics were serialized in the Marvel magazine Pizzazz between 1977 and 1979 The 1977 installments were the first original Star Wars stories not directly adapted from the films to appear in print form, as they preceded those of the Star Wars comic series [181] From 1985 to 1987, the animated children's series Ewoks and Droids inspired comic series from Marvel's Star Comics line [182] [183] [184] According to Marvel Comics former Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter, the strong sales of Star Wars comics saved Marvel financially in 1977 and 1978 [185] Marvel's Star Wars series was one of the industry's top selling titles in 1979 and 1980 [186] The only downside for Marvel was that the 100,000 copy sales quota was surpassed quickly, allowing Lippincott to renegotiate the royalty arrangements from a position of strength [187]\n\n\nAudio\nJohn Williams composed the soundtracks for the nine episodic films He stated he would retire from the franchise with The Rise of Skywalker, [198] but he composed a theme for Obi-Wan Kenobi for the miniseries and Han Solo's theme for Solo: A Star Wars Story [199] Williams also created the main theme for Galaxy's Edge [200]\n\n\nSoundtracks and singles\nJohn Williams composed the soundtracks for the nine episodic films He stated he would retire from the franchise with The Rise of Skywalker, [198] but he composed a theme for Obi-Wan Kenobi for the miniseries and Han Solo's theme for Solo: A Star Wars Story [199] Williams also created the main theme for Galaxy's Edge [200]\n\n\nAudio novels\nThe first Star Wars audio work is The Story of Star Wars, an LP using audio samples from the original film and a new narration to retell the story, released in 1977 Most later printed novels were adapted into audio novels, usually released on cassette tape and re-released on CD As of 2019, audio-only novels have been released not directly based on printed media [202]\n\n\nRadio\nRadio adaptations of the films were also produced Lucas, a fan of the NPR-affiliated campus radio station of his alma mater the University of Southern California, licensed the Star Wars radio rights to KUSC-FM for US$1 The production used John Williams's original film score, along with Ben Burtt's sound effects [203] [204]\n\n\nVideo games\nThe Star Wars franchise has spawned over one hundred [208] computer, video, and board games, dating back to some of the earliest home consoles Some are based directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical Expanded Universe (rebranded as Star Wars Legends and removed from the canon in 2014) Star Wars games have gone through three significant development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to Electronic Arts.\n\n\nEarly licensed games (1979–1993)\nThe first officially licensed electronic Star Wars game was Kenner's 1979 table-top Star Wars Electronic Battle Command [209] [210] In 1982, Parker Brothers published the first Star Wars video game for the Atari 2600, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, [211] followed soon the year later by Star Wars: Jedi Arena, the first video game to depict lightsaber combat They were followed in 1983 by Atari's rail shooter arcade game Star Wars, with vector graphics to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film [212] The next game, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1984), has more traditional raster graphics, [213] while the following Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1985) has vector graphics [214]\n\n\nLucasArts and modern self-published games (1993–2014)\nLucasfilm founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and World War II flight combat games, but as George Lucas took more interest in the increasing success of the video game market, he wanted to have more creative control over the games and founded his own development company, LucasArts Improved graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity, with voice-overs and CGI cutscenes In 1993, LucasArts released Star Wars: X-Wing, the first self-published Star Wars video game and the first space flight simulator based on the franchise [215] It was one of the bestselling video games of 1993 and established its own series of games [215] The Rogue Squadron series was released between 1998 and 2003, also focusing on space battles set during the films.\n\n\nEA Star Wars (2014–present)\nFollowing its acquisition of the franchise, Disney reassigned video game rights to Electronic Arts Games made during this era are considered canonical, and feature more influence from the Star Wars filmmakers Disney partnered with Lenovo to create the augmented reality video game Jedi Challenges, released in November 2017 [229] [230] In August 2018, it was announced that Zynga would publish free-to-play Star Wars mobile games [231] The Battlefront games received a canonical reboot with Star Wars: Battlefront in November 2015, which was followed by a sequel, Battlefront II, in November 2017 A single-player action-adventure game, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, with an original story and cast of characters, was released in November 2019 A space combat game titled Star Wars: Squadrons, which builds upon the space battles from Battlefront, was released in October 2020.\n\n\nTheme park attractions\nIn addition to the Disneyland ride Star Tours (1987) and its successor, Star Tours: The Adventures Continue (2011), many live attractions have been held at Disney parks, including the traveling exhibition Where Science Meets Imagination, the Space Mountain spin-off Hyperspace Mountain, a walkthrough Launch Bay, and the night-time A Galactic Spectacular An immersive themed area called Galaxy's Edge (2019) opened at Disneyland and opened at Walt Disney World in mid-2019 [232] A themed hotel, Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, operated from 2022 to 2023 at Walt Disney World.\n\n\nMultimedia projects\nA multimedia project involves works released across multiple types of media Shadows of the Empire (1996) was a multimedia project set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi that included a novel by Steve Perry, a comic book series, a video game, and action figures [159] [160] The Force Unleashed (2008–2010) was a similar project set between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope that included a novel, a 2008 video game and its 2010 sequel, a graphic novel, a role-playing game supplement, and toys [235] [236]\n\n\nMerchandising\nThe success of the Star Wars films led the franchise to become one of the most merchandised franchises in the world While filming the original 1977 film, George Lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the franchise's merchandising rights By 1987, the first three films have made US$2.6 billion in merchandising revenue [237] By 2012, the first six films produced approximately US$20 billion in merchandising revenue [238]\n\n\nThemes\nStar Wars features elements such as knighthood, chivalry, and Jungian archetypes such as \"the shadow\" [250]\nThere are also many references to Christianity, such as in the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil [251] Anakin was conceived of a virgin birth, and is assumed to be the \"Chosen One\", a messianic individual However, unlike Jesus, Anakin falls from grace, remaining evil as Darth Vader until Return of the Jedi According to Adam Driver, sequel trilogy villain Kylo Ren, who idolizes Vader, believes he is \"doing what he thinks is right\" [252] George Lucas has said that the theme of the saga is redemption [253]\n\n\nHistorical influences\nPolitical science has been an important element of Star Wars since the franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between democracy and dictatorship Battles featuring the Ewoks and Gungans against the Empire and Trade Federation, respectively, represent the clash between a primitive society and a more advanced one, similar to the Vietnam-American War [261] [262] Darth Vader's design was initially inspired by Samurai armor, and also incorporated a German military helmet [263] [264] Originally, Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way the Schutzstaffel (SS) served Adolf Hitler, but this was condensed into one character in the form of Vader [265] Stormtroopers borrow the name of World War I German \"shock\" troopers Imperial officers wear uniforms resembling those of German forces during World War II, [266] and political and security officers resemble the black-clad SS down to the stylized silver death's head on their caps World War II terms were used for names in the films; e.g the planets Kessel (a term that refers to a group of encircled forces) and Hoth (after a German general who served on the snow-laden Eastern Front) [267] Shots of the commanders looking through AT-AT walker viewscreens in The Empire Strikes Back resemble tank interiors, [268] and space battles in the original film were based on World War I and World War II dogfights [269]\n\n\nCultural impact\nThe Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on popular culture, [277] with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life [278] Phrases like \"evil empire\" and \"May the Force be with you\" have become part of the popular lexicon [279] The first Star Wars film in 1977 was a cultural unifier, [280] enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people [281] The film can be said to have helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science-fiction films a mainstream genre [282] The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including Hardware Wars, Spaceballs, The Family Guy Trilogy and Robot Chicken: Star Wars.\n\n\nIndustry\nThe original Star Wars film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million [269] The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate [290] With over $10.3 billion in worldwide box office receipts, Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time [291] [292]\n\n\nFan works\nThe Star Wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries Fan fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries [304] Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit [305]\n\n\nAcademia\nAs the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource For example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance [306] Others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers [307] Similarly, psychiatrists in New Zealand and the U.S have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of psychopathology [308] [309]\n\n\nSee also\n

The saga was produced non-chronologically, beginning in media res with the release of the original trilogy between 1977 and 1983. This was followed by the prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005, and the sequel trilogy, released between 2015 and 2019.\n\n**The Skywalker Saga**\n\nThe Star Wars film series centers around three sets of trilogies, the nine films of which are collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\".

This was followed by the prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005, and the sequel trilogy, released between 2015 and 2019.\n\n**Original Trilogy**\n\nIn 1971, George Lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the Flash Gordon serial, but could not obtain the rights, so he began developing his own space opera. After directing American Graffiti (1973), he wrote a two-page synopsis, which 20th Century Fox decided to invest in. By 1974, he had expanded the story into the first draft of a screenplay. Fox expected the film would be of limited financial success, and so it was given a relatively low budget, with production being moved to Elstree Studios in England to help save on cost.\n\n**Prequel Trilogy**\n\nAccording to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films. In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted, but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981. In 1983, Lucas explained that \"There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now .. As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them .. I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday.\"\n\n**Sequel Trilogy**\n\nPrior to releasing the original 1977 film, and made possible by its success, Lucas planned \"three trilogies of nine films\". However, he announced to Time in 1978 that he planned \"10 sequels\". He confirmed that he had outlined the prequels and sequels in 1981. At various stages of development, the sequel trilogy was to focus on the rebuilding of the Republic, the return of Luke as a Jedi Master (a role similar to that of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original trilogy), Luke's sister (not yet determined to be Leia), Han, Leia, R2-D2 and C-3PO. However, after beginning work on the prequel trilogy, Lucas insisted that Star Wars was meant to be a six-part series and that there would be no sequel trilogy.\n\n**Standalone Films**\n\nSeveral Star Wars films have been produced separately from the Skywalker Saga. In 2008, Lucasfilm released the animated film The Clone Wars, which is set during the prequel trilogy and serves as the theatrical pilot of the television series of the same name. Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, an \"anthology\" film series set between the main episodes of the Skywalker Saga entered development in parallel with the production of the sequel trilogy, described by Disney chief financial officer Jay Rasulo as origin stories.\n\n**Upcoming Films**\n\nIn April 2023, three new Star Wars films were announced to be set within different eras of the franchise. An untitled film written and directed by James Mangold will be set during the \"dawn of the Jedi\". Dave Filoni will direct a film set between the original and sequel trilogies during the New Republic era, serving as the climax of the various live-action television series that began with The Mandalorian in 2019. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy will direct a third film about a new Jedi Order, set fifteen years after the sequel trilogy.\n\n**Television**\n\nThe first two animated series, Droids and Ewoks, were produced in the 1980s. They were followed by the Clone Wars animated micro-series in 2003 and the 2008 series of the same name. Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, all animated series released prior to 2014, apart from the 2008 series, were discarded from the franchise's canon. Subsequent animated series include Rebels, released in 2014; Resistance, released in 2018; and The Bad Batch, released in 2021.\n\n**Live-Action Series**\n\nThe Star Wars franchise includes several live-action series. The first series, The Mandalorian, was released in 2019 for the streaming service Disney+ and is set between the original and sequel trilogies of the Skywalker Saga. Due to its success, the series spawned multiple live-action spin-offs set during the same fictional era, including The Book of Boba Fett, released in 2021; Ahsoka, released in 2023; and the upcoming Skeleton Crew.\n\n**Fictional Timeline**\n\nThe Star Wars canon fictional universe spans multiple eras, of which three are focused around each of the film trilogies. The following eras were defined in January 2021, and further refined and expanded in April 2023:\n\n* The High Republic Era: 200-100 years before the events of the Skywalker Saga\n* The Galactic Republic Era: 100-0 years before the events of the Skywalker Saga\n* The New Republic Era: 0-500 years after the events of the Skywalker Saga\n\n**Print Media**\n\nStar Wars in print predates the release of the first film, with the November 1976 novelization of Star Wars, initially subtitled \"From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker\". Credited to Lucas, it was ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster. The first \"Expanded Universe\" story appeared in Marvel Comics' Star Wars #7 in January 1978 (the first six issues being an adaptation of the film), followed by Foster's sequel novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye the following month.\n\n**Novels**\n\nAfter penning the novelization of the original film, Foster followed it with the sequel Splinter of the Mind's Eye (1978). The novelizations of The Empire Strikes Back (1980) by Donald F Glut and Return of the Jedi (1983) by James Kahn followed, as well as The Han Solo Adventures trilogy (1979-1980) by Brian Daley, and The Adventures of Lando Calrissian trilogy (1983) by L Neil Smith.\n\n**Comics**\n\nMarvel Comics published a Star Wars comic book series from 1977 to 1986. Original Star Wars comics were serialized in the Marvel magazine Pizzazz between 1977 and 1979. From 1985 to 1987, the animated children's series Ewoks and Droids inspired comic series from Marvel's Star Comics line.\n\n**Audio**\n\nJohn Williams composed the soundtracks for the nine episodic films. He stated he would retire from the franchise with The Rise of Skywalker, but he composed a theme for Obi-Wan Kenobi for the miniseries and Han Solo's theme for Solo: A Star Wars Story. Williams also created the main theme for Galaxy's Edge.\n\n**Audio Novels**\n\nThe first Star Wars audio work is The Story of Star Wars, an LP using audio samples from the original film and a new narration to retell the story, released in 1977. Most later printed novels were adapted into audio novels, usually released on cassette tape and re-released on CD. As of 2019, audio-only novels have been released not directly based on printed media.\n\n**Radio**\n\nRadio adaptations of the films were also produced. Lucas, a fan of the NPR-affiliated campus radio station of his alma mater the University of Southern California, licensed the Star Wars radio rights to KUSC-FM for US$1. The production used John Williams's original film score, along with Ben Burtt's sound effects.\n\n**Video Games**\n\nThe Star Wars franchise has spawned over one hundred computer, video, and board games, dating back to some of the earliest home consoles. Some are based directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical Expanded Universe (rebranded as Star Wars Legends and removed from the canon in 2014). Star Wars games have gone through three significant development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to Electronic Arts.\n\n**Theme Park Attractions**\n\nIn addition to the Disneyland ride Star Tours (1987) and its successor, Star Tours: The Adventures Continue (2011), many live attractions have been held at Disney parks, including the traveling exhibition Where Science Meets Imagination, the Space Mountain spin-off Hyperspace Mountain, a walkthrough Launch Bay, and the night-time A Galactic Spectacular. An immersive themed area called Galaxy's Edge (2019) opened at Disneyland and opened at Walt Disney World in mid-2019. A themed hotel, Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, operated from 2022 to 2023 at Walt Disney World.\n\n**Multimedia Projects**\n\nA multimedia project involves works released across multiple types of media. Shadows of the Empire (1996) was a multimedia project set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi that included a novel by Steve Perry, a comic book series, a video game, and action figures. The Force Unleashed (2008-2010) was a similar project set between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope that included a novel, a 2008 video game and its 2010 sequel, a graphic novel, a role-playing game supplement, and toys.\n\n**Merchandising**\n\nThe success of the Star Wars films led the franchise to become one of the most merchandised franchises in the world. While filming the original 1977 film, George Lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the franchise's merchandising rights. By 1987, the first three films have made US$2.6 billion in merchandising revenue. By 2012, the first six films produced approximately US$20 billion in merchandising revenue.\n\n**Themes**\n\nStar Wars features elements such as knighthood, chivalry, and Jungian archetypes such as \"the shadow\". There are also many references to Christianity, such as in the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil. Anakin was conceived of a virgin birth, and is assumed to be the \"Chosen One\", a messianic individual. However, unlike Jesus, Anakin falls from grace, remaining evil as Darth Vader until Return of the Jedi. According to Adam Driver, sequel trilogy villain Kylo Ren, who idolizes Vader, believes he is \"doing what he thinks is right\". George Lucas has said that the theme of the saga is redemption.\n\n**Historical Influences**\n\nPolitical science has been an important element of Star Wars since the franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between democracy and dictatorship. Battles featuring the Ewoks and Gungans against the Empire and Trade Federation, respectively, represent the clash between a primitive society and a more advanced one, similar to the Vietnam-American War. Darth Vader's design was initially inspired by Samurai armor, and also incorporated a German military helmet. Originally, Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way the Schutzstaffel (SS) served Adolf Hitler, but this was condensed into one character in the form of Vader. Stormtroopers borrow the name of World War I German \"shock\" troopers. Imperial officers wear uniforms resembling those of German forces during World War II, and political and security officers resemble the black-clad SS down to the stylized silver death's head on their caps. World War II terms were used for names in the films; e.g the planets Kessel (a term that refers to a group of encircled forces) and Hoth (after a German general who served on the snow-laden Eastern Front).\n\n**Cultural Impact**\n\nThe Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on popular culture, with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life. Phrases like \"evil empire\" and \"May the Force be with you\" have become part of the popular lexicon. The first Star Wars film in 1977 was a cultural unifier, enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people. The film can be said to have helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science-fiction films a mainstream genre. The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including Hardware Wars, Spaceballs, The Family Guy Trilogy and Robot Chicken: Star Wars.\n\n**Industry**\n\nThe original Star Wars film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million. The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate. With over $10.3 billion in worldwide box office receipts, Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.\n\n**Fan Works**\n\nThe Star Wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries. Fan fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries. Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit.\n\n**Academia**\n\nAs the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource. For example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance. Others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers. Similarly, psychiatrists in New Zealand and the U.S have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of psychopathology.\n\nThe Star Wars saga has become a cultural phenomenon, with a vast and dedicated fan base. The franchise's impact on popular culture, industry, and academia is undeniable, and its influence will be felt for generations to come.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Star_Wars\" following this outline:\n\n\nPremise\nThe Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters \"a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\" [2] across multiple fictional eras, in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with droids, which may be programmed for personal assistance or battle [3] Space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology [4] [5] [6] The planets range from wealthy, planet-wide cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive tribes Virtually any Earth biome, along with many fictional ones, has its counterpart as a Star Wars planet which, in most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life [7] The franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae [8] [9] Spacecraft range from small starfighters to large capital ships, such as the Star Destroyers, as well as space stations such as the moon-sized Death Stars [10] [11] [12] Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual screens, holographic projections, and hyperspace transmission [13]\n\n\nFilms\nThe Star Wars film series centers around three sets of trilogies, the nine films of which are collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\" [43] The saga was produced non-chronologically, beginning in media res with the release of the original trilogy between 1977 and 1983 This was followed by the prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005, and the sequel trilogy, released between 2015 and 2019 [44]\n\n\nThe Skywalker Saga\nThe Star Wars film series centers around three sets of trilogies, the nine films of which are collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\" [43] The saga was produced non-chronologically, beginning in media res with the release of the original trilogy between 1977 and 1983 This was followed by the prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005, and the sequel trilogy, released between 2015 and 2019 [44]\n\n\nOriginal trilogy\nIn 1971, George Lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the Flash Gordon serial, but could not obtain the rights, so he began developing his own space opera [49] [c] After directing American Graffiti (1973), he wrote a two-page synopsis, which 20th Century Fox decided to invest in [50] [51] By 1974, he had expanded the story into the first draft of a screenplay [52] Fox expected the film would be of limited financial success, and so it was given a relatively low budget, with production being moved to Elstree Studios in England to help save on cost [53]\n\n\nPrequel trilogy\nAccording to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films [57] In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted, [58] but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981 [59] In 1983, Lucas explained that \"There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ..

term Expanded Universe (EU) was an umbrella term for all officially licensed Star Wars storytelling material set outside the events depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video games [145] Lucasfilm maintained internal continuity between the films and television content and the EU material until April 25, 2014, when the company announced all of the EU works would cease production Existing works would no longer be considered canon to the franchise and subsequent reprints would be rebranded under the Star Wars Legends label, [145] with downloadable content for the

films to appear in print form, as they preceded those of the Star Wars comic series [181] From 1985 to 1987, the animated children's series Ewoks and Droids inspired comic series from Marvel's Star Comics line [182] [183] [184] According to Marvel Comics former Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter, the strong sales of Star Wars comics saved Marvel financially in 1977 and 1978 [185] Marvel's Star Wars

developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to Electronic Arts.\n\n\nEarly licensed games (1979–1993)\nThe first officially licensed electronic Star Wars game was Kenner's 1979 table-top Star Wars Electronic Battle Command [209] [210] In 1982, Parker Brothers published the first Star Wars video game for the Atari 2600, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, [211] followed soon the year later by Star Wars: Jedi Arena, the first video game to depict lightsaber combat They were followed in 1983 by Atari's rail shooter arcade game Star Wars, with vector graphics to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film [212] The next game, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1984), has more traditional raster graphics, [213] while the following Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1985) has vector graphics [214]\n\n\nLucasArts and modern self-published games (1993–2014)\nLucasfilm founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and World War II flight combat games, but as George Lucas took more interest in the increasing success of the video game market, he wanted to have more creative control over the games and founded his own development company, LucasArts Improved graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity, with voice-overs and CGI cutscenes In 1993, LucasArts released Star Wars: X-Wing, the first self-published Star Wars video game and the first space flight simulator based on the franchise [215] It was one of the bestselling video games of 1993 and established its own series of games [215] The Rogue Squadron series was released between 1998 and 2003, also focusing on space battles set during the films.\n\n\nEA Star Wars (2014–present)\nFollowing its acquisition of the franchise, Disney reassigned video game rights to Electronic Arts Games made during this era are considered canonical, and feature more influence from the Star Wars filmmakers Disney partnered with Lenovo to create the augmented reality video game Jedi Challenges, released in November 2017 [229] [230] In August 2018, it was announced that Zynga would publish free-to-play Star Wars mobile games [231] The Battlefront games

general who served on the snow-laden Eastern Front) [267] Shots of the commanders looking through AT-AT walker viewscreens in The Empire Strikes Back resemble tank interiors, [268] and space battles in the original film were based on World War I and World War II dogfights [269]\n\n\nCultural impact\nThe Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on popular culture, [277] with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life [278] Phrases like \"evil empire\" and \"May the Force be with you\" have become part of the popular lexicon [279] The first Star Wars film in 1977 was a cultural unifier, [280] enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people [281] The film can be said to have helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science-fiction films a mainstream genre [282] The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including Hardware Wars, Spaceballs, The Family Guy Trilogy and Robot Chicken: Star Wars.\n\n\nIndustry\nThe original Star Wars film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million [269] The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate [290] With over $10.3 billion in worldwide box office receipts, Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time [291] [292]\n\n\nFan works\nThe Star Wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries Fan fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries [304] Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit [305]\n\n\nAcademia\nAs the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource For example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance [306] Others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers [307] Similarly, psychiatrists in New Zealand and the U.S have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of psychopathology [308] [309]\n\n\nSee also\n

Rico [14] [15] [16] The family lived in an apartment in the Bronx neighborhood of Parkchester [15] until Ocasio-Cortez was five, when they moved to a house in suburban Yorktown Heights [15] [17] She said her family raised enough money to buy a small home there so she could go to school, and that her mother worked as a house cleaner in the town [18]\n\n\nEarly career\nAfter college, Ocasio-Cortez moved back to the Bronx and took a job as a bartender and waitress to help her mother—a house cleaner and school bus driver—fight foreclosure of their home [35] [36] She later launched Brook Avenue Press, a now-defunct publishing firm for books that portrayed the Bronx in a positive light [37] [38] Ocasio-Cortez also worked for the nonprofit National Hispanic Institute [25] [39] [40]\n\n\nElections\nOcasio-Cortez began her campaign in April 2017 [7] while waiting tables and tending bar at Flats Fix, a taqueria in New York City's Union Square [47] \"For 80 percent of this campaign, I operated out of a paper grocery bag hidden behind that bar,\" she told Bon Appétit [48] She was the first person since 2004 to challenge Joe Crowley, the Democratic Caucus Chair, in the primary She faced a financial disadvantage, saying, \"You can't really beat big money with more money You have to beat them with a totally different game.\" [49] [50] [28] Ocasio-Cortez's campaign undertook grassroots mobilization and did not take donations from corporations [7] Her campaign posters' designs were said to have taken inspiration from \"revolutionary posters and visuals from the past\" [46]\n\n\n2018\nThe MIT Lincoln Laboratory named the asteroid 23238 Ocasio-Cortez after her when she was a senior in high school in recognition of her second-place finish in the 2007 Intel

completely defied their predictions and expectations [41] [64] [65] [5] She was outspent by a margin of 18 to 1 ($1.5 million to $83,000) but won the endorsement of some influential groups on the party's left [66] Crowley conceded defeat on election night, [67] but did not telephone Ocasio-Cortez that night to congratulate her, fueling short-lived speculation that he intended to run against her in the general election [68]\n\n\nGeneral election\nOcasio-Cortez faced Republican nominee Anthony Pappas in the November 6 general election [78] Pappas, an economics professor, did not actively

pairing Ocasio-Cortez wore an organza gown emblazoned with the phrase \"Tax the Rich\" As an elected official in New York City, she was considered a guest of the museum, and as such did not have to buy a ticket, which costs persons other than elected officials at least $35,000 The dress's designer, Aurora James, also invited her boyfriend Benjamin Bronfman, the son of a billionaire Critics, both conservative and liberal, rebuked Ocasio-Cortez for attending an event where guests were not required to wear masks (employees and event staff were required to do so), and one known for its opulent display of wealth and social status She responded that they were using a sexist double standard and that she \"punctured the fourth wall of excess and spectacle\" James also believed that the extremely wealthy people in attendance needed to see the message in person [177]\n\n\n\"The Squad\"\nOcasio-Cortez is a member of an informal group of progressive members of Congress called \"The Squad\", initially including Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib [181] On July 14, 2019, Trump attacked the Squad (which had only four members at the time) in a tweet, saying that they should \"go back and help fix\" the countries they came from rather than criticize the American government [182] He continued to make similar comments over the next several days, even though three of the women, including Ocasio-Cortez, were born in the United States Ocasio-Cortez responded in a tweet that \"the President's words  [yesterday], telling four American Congresswomen of color 'go back to your own country' is hallmark language of white supremacists.\" [183] She later added, \"We don't leave the things that we love, and when we love this country, what that means is that we propose the solutions to fix it.\" [184] Days later, Trump falsely asserted that Ocasio-Cortez called \"our country and our people 'garbage'\"; she had actually said that Americans should not be content with moderate policies that are \"10% better from garbage\" [185] Trump also falsely claimed that Ocasio-Cortez said \"illegal immigrants are more American\" than Americans who tried to keep them out; she actually said that \"women and children on that border that are trying to seek refuge and opportunity\" in America \"are acting more American\" than those who tried to keep them out [186] The Squad grew in 2020, 2022, and 2024, with Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Greg Casar, Summer Lee, and Delia Ramirez joining [187]\n\n\nGreen New Deal\nOcasio-Cortez submitted her first piece of legislation, the

phase out fossil fuel use and overhaul the nation's infrastructure.\" [188] Their plan called for implementing the \"social cost of carbon\" that was part of the Obama administration's plans to address climate change In the process it aimed to create jobs [188] According to CNBC, an initial outline the Green New Deal called for \"completely ditching fossil fuels, upgrading or replacing 'every building' in the country and 'totally overhaul [ing] transportation' to the point where 'air travel stops becoming necessary'\" The outline set a goal of having the U.S \"creating 'net zero' greenhouse gases in 10 years Why 'net zero'? The lawmakers explained: 'We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.'\" [189] Activist groups such as Greenpeace and the Sunrise Movement came out in favor of the plan No Republican lawmakers voiced support [190] [191] The plan gained support from some Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker; [192] other Democrats, such as Senator Dianne Feinstein and House speaker Nancy Pelosi, dismissed the proposal (Pelosi has referred to it as \"the green dream, or whatever they call it\") [193]\n\n\nHarassment\nOn July 20, 2020, U.S Representatives Ted Yoho and Roger Williams accosted Ocasio-Cortez on the Capitol steps, where Yoho (as overheard by a journalist) called her \"disgusting\" and told her \"You are out of your freaking mind\" for recently suggesting that poverty and unemployment were driving a spike in crime in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic amid her ongoing advocacy for cutting police budgets Ocasio-Cortez told Yoho he was being \"rude\" As she walked away from Yoho into the Capitol, Yoho called her a \"fucking bitch\" [197] [198] Yoho addressed the matter on the House floor and, without naming Ocasio-Cortez, apologized for the \"abrupt manner of the conversation\" with her, claiming that \"offensive name calling, words attributed to me by the press, were never spoken to my colleagues\", and concluding: \"I cannot apologize for my passion\" [199] [200] Ocasio-Cortez responded with a speech saying that the incident was emblematic of a \"culture .. accepting of violence and violent language against women .. In using that language, in front of the press, he gave permission to use that language against his wife, his daughters, women in his community, and I am here to stand up to say that is not acceptable.\" [201] [202]\n\n\nJanuary 6 Capitol attack\nIn a nearly 90-minute Instagram Live video made in February 2021, [207] Ocasio-Cortez said that she had previously experienced sexual assault,

bathroom before being startled by a Capitol Police officer who entered her office suite and shouted \"Where is she?\" before ordering her and her staff to evacuate to a different House Office Building

Born on October 13, 1989, in the Bronx, New York, Ocasio-Cortez rose to prominence after her unexpected victory in the 2018 Democratic primary election for New York's 14th congressional district. She is the youngest woman ever to serve in the United States Congress and has become a prominent voice for progressive policies and social justice.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nOcasio-Cortez was born to Sergio Ocasio-Roman and Blanca Ocasio-Cortez (née Cortez) in the Bronx, New York. Her father was born in the Bronx to a Puerto Rican family, and her mother was born in Puerto Rico. Ocasio-Cortez has a younger brother, Gabriel. The family lived in an apartment in the Bronx's Parkchester neighborhood until Ocasio-Cortez was five years old, when they moved to a house in suburban Yorktown Heights. Her mother worked as a house cleaner and school bus driver to support the family.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nAfter college, Ocasio-Cortez moved back to the Bronx and took a job as a bartender and waitress to help her mother, who was struggling to pay her mortgage. She later launched Brook Avenue Press, a publishing firm that focused on books that portrayed the Bronx in a positive light. Ocasio-Cortez also worked for the nonprofit National Hispanic Institute.\n\n**Elections**\n\nOcasio-Cortez began her campaign for Congress in April 2017, while working as a bartender and waitress. She was the first person to challenge Joe Crowley, the Democratic Caucus Chair, in the primary since 2004. Despite facing a financial disadvantage, Ocasio-Cortez's campaign undertook grassroots mobilization and did not take donations from corporations. Her campaign posters were designed to reflect \"revolutionary posters and visuals from the past.\"\n\n**2018**\n\nThe MIT Lincoln Laboratory named the asteroid 23238 Ocasio-Cortez after her when she was a senior in high school in recognition of her second-place finish in the 2007 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.

She was named as one of the 2019 BBC 100 Women.\n\n**2019**\n\nOcasio-Cortez continued to receive media coverage early in her congressional tenure on par with that of 2020 presidential candidates. She was considered \"one of the faces of the Democratic party\" and one of the most talked-about politicians in the United States. Between July 8 and 14, 2019, she drew more social media attention than the Democratic presidential candidates. Ocasio-Cortez also attended the 2021 Met Gala, where she wore an organza gown emblazoned with the phrase \"Tax the Rich.\"\n\n**The Squad**\n\nOcasio-Cortez is a member of an informal group of progressive members of Congress called \"The Squad,\" which initially included Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib. On July 14, 2019, President Trump attacked the Squad in a tweet, saying that they should \"go back and help fix\" the countries they came from rather than criticize the American government. Ocasio-Cortez responded in a tweet that \"the President's words yesterday, telling four American Congresswomen of color 'go back to your own country' is hallmark language of white supremacists.\"\n\n**Green New Deal**\n\nOcasio-Cortez submitted her first piece of legislation, the Green New Deal, to the House on February 7, 2019. The plan called for a 10-year \"economic mobilization\" that would phase out fossil fuel use and overhaul the nation's infrastructure. The plan aimed to create jobs and implement the \"social cost of carbon\" that was part of the Obama administration's plans to address climate change.\n\n**Harassment**\n\nOn July 20, 2020, Ocasio-Cortez was accosted by Representatives Ted Yoho and Roger Williams on the Capitol steps. Yoho called her \"disgusting\" and told her that she was \"out of your freaking mind\" for suggesting that poverty and unemployment were driving a spike in crime in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ocasio-Cortez responded that Yoho was being \"rude\" and that his language was unacceptable.\n\n**Supreme Court Impeachment Effort**\n\nOn July 1, 2020, Ocasio-Cortez announced that she would file articles of impeachment against Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She argued that the Court was corrupt and that Congress must defend the nation against an \"authoritarian capture.\"\n\n**Withdrawal of Biden**\n\nAfter the June 2024 presidential debate, Ocasio-Cortez said that she had spoken with Joe Biden and that he made clear he was staying in the race. She said that she supported him and that her focus was defeating Republicans in the election. Later, on July 19, she held an Instagram Live in which she said that replacing Biden was risky and legally challenging, but suggested that nominating Vice President Kamala Harris was better than an open convention.\n\n**Healthcare**\n\nOcasio-Cortez supports transitioning to a single-payer healthcare system and considers medical care a human right. She says that a single government health insurer should cover every American, reducing overall costs.\n\n**Social Issues**\n\nOcasio-Cortez supports codifying the right to abortion and is a member of the House pro-choice caucus. On July 19, 2022, after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade in Dobbs v.

[298]\n\n\nIsrael-Palestine\nIn May 2018, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Israel Defense Forces' use of deadly force against Palestinians participating in the 2018 Gaza border protests, calling it a \"massacre\" in a tweet [301] [302] In a July 2018 interview, she said she was \"a proponent of a two-state solution\" [246] and called Israel's presence in the West Bank an \"occupation of Palestine\" After being asked to elaborate, she responded she was not \"the expert on geopolitics on this issue\" [303] [304] Her use of the term \"occupation\" drew backlash from a number of pro-Israel groups and commentators [305] [303] Others defended her remarks, citing the United Nations' designation of the territory in the West Bank as occupied [306] [307] In July 2019, Ocasio-Cortez voted against a House resolution introduced by Representative Brad Schneider condemning the Global Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel [308] The resolution passed 398–17 [309]\n\n\nGovernance\nAfter the contentious confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Ocasio-Cortez urged Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to expand the court if he won and their party achieved a Senate majority [326] In April 2021, she supported a bill to increase the Court's size [327] She again called for expansion in September 2021 after the Court voted not to grant an emergency stay of the Texas Heartbeat Bill [328]\n\n\nJudiciary\nAfter the contentious confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Ocasio-Cortez urged Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to expand the court if he won and their party achieved a Senate majority [326] In April 2021, she supported a bill to increase the Court's size [327] She again called for expansion in September 2021 after the Court voted not to grant an emergency stay of the Texas Heartbeat Bill [328]\n\n\nPay raises for Congress\nIn 2019, Ocasio-Cortez supported pay raises for Congress She wrote, \"It's not a fun or politically popular position to take But consistency is important ALL workers should get cost of living increases That's why minimum wage should be pegged to inflation, too.\" Members of Congress make $174,000 annually; the Speaker makes $223,500 and House leaders make $193,400 Republican Kevin McCarthy joined her in supporting the pay raise, saying he did not want Congress to be a place where only the wealthy can afford to serve Colleagues such as Joe Cunningham opposed the measure, saying, \"We didn't come up here to give ourselves a raise\" [335]\n\n\nTrump impeachments\nOn June 28, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN she would support the first impeachment of President Trump, citing Trump's alleged violations of the Emoluments Clause and saying that \"we have to hold everyone accountable and that no person is above that law.\" [336] [337]\n\n\nAndrew Cuomo scandals\nIn April 2020, Ocasio-Cortez was one of 77 representatives to call for public reports of data on COVID-19 cases in nursing homes and long-term care facilities [340] In March 2021, she and Representative Jamaal Bowman called on New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign, citing the sexual misconduct allegations against him as well as the New York COVID-19 nursing home scandal about the Cuomo administration's reported undercounting of COVID-19 nursing home deaths [341]\n\n\nPuerto Rico\nOcasio-Cortez has called for \"solidarity with Puerto Rico\" She has advocated for granting Puerto Ricans further civil rights, regardless of Puerto Rico's legal classification She advocates for voting rights and disaster relief Ocasio-Cortez was critical of FEMA's response to Hurricane Maria and the federal government's unwillingness to address Puerto Rico's political status [342] She believes the federal government should increase investment in Puerto Rico [253] In August 2020, Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Velázquez introduced the Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act of 2020, which was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources [343] [344]\n\n\nWithdrawal of Biden\nAfter the June 2024 presidential debate, Ocasio-Cortez, who previously supported Biden during the campaign, [347] said that she had spoken with Biden and that he made clear he was staying in the race She said that she supported him and that her focus was defeating Republicans in the election [348] [349] [350] Later, on July 19, she held an Instagram Live in which she said that replacing Biden was risky and legally challenging, but suggested that nominating Vice President Kamala Harris was better than an open convention [351] When Biden withdrew from the race, she endorsed Harris [352]\n\n\nHealthcare\nOcasio-Cortez supports transitioning to a single-payer healthcare system and considers medical care a human right [353] [354] She says that a single government health insurer should cover every American, reducing overall costs [249] Her campaign website says, \"Almost every other developed nation in the world has universal healthcare It's time the United States catch up to the rest of the world in ensuring all people have real healthcare coverage that doesn't break the bank.\" [354] Many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates adopted the Medicare-for-all proposal [251]\n\n\nSocial issues\nOcasio-Cortez supports codifying the right to abortion, and is a member of the House pro-choice caucus [357] On July 19, 2022, after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v Wade in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, she and 17 other members of Congress were arrested in an act of civil disobedience for refusing to clear a street during a protest for reproductive rights outside the Supreme Court Building [358] [359]\n\n\nAbortion rights\nOcasio-Cortez supports codifying the right to abortion, and is a member of the House pro-choice caucus [357] On July 19, 2022, after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v Wade in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, she and 17 other members of Congress were arrested in an act of civil disobedience for refusing to clear a street during a protest for reproductive rights outside the Supreme Court Building [358] [359]\n\n\nEducation\nOcasio-Cortez campaigned in favor of establishing tuition-free public colleges and trade schools She has said she is still paying off student loans herself and wants to cancel all student debt [354]\n\n\nImmigration\nOcasio-Cortez has expressed support for defunding and abolishing the U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency on multiple occasions In February 2018 she called it \"a product of the Bush-era Patriot Act suite of legislation\" and \"an enforcement agency that takes on more of a paramilitary tone every single day\" [360] [361] That June, she said she would \"stop short of fully disbanding the agency\", and would rather \"create a pathway to citizenship for more immigrants through decriminalization\" [362] She later clarified that this does not mean ceasing all deportations [363] Two days before the primary election, Ocasio-Cortez attended a protest at an ICE child-detention center in Tornillo, Texas [364] She was the only Democrat to vote against H.R 648, a bill to fund and reopen the government, because it funded ICE [365]\n\n\nLGBT+ rights\nOcasio-Cortez is a proponent of LGBT+ rights and equality She has said she supports the community and thanked its members for their role in her campaign [379] [253] At the January 2019 New York City Women's March in Manhattan, Ocasio-Cortez gave a detailed speech in support of measures needed to ensure LGBT+ equality in the workplace and elsewhere [380] She has also spoken in support of transgender rights, specifically saying, \"Trans rights are civil rights are human rights.\" [381] Later, she appeared on a video game live stream to help raise money for Mermaids, a UK-based charity for transgender children [382]\n\n\nPolice funding\n\nOcasio-Cortez supports the \"defund the police\" movement Asked to give her interpretation of the movement, she said: \n\nElectoral history\nThe MIT Lincoln Laboratory named the asteroid 23238 Ocasio-Cortez after her when she

{"title": "Turtle", "content": "\nNaming and etymology\nThe word turtle is borrowed from the French word tortue or tortre 'turtle, tortoise' [3] It is a common name and may be used without knowledge of taxonomic distinctions In North America, it may denote the order as a whole In Britain, the name is used for sea turtles as opposed to freshwater terrapins and land-dwelling tortoises In Australia, which lacks true tortoises (family Testudinidae), non-marine turtles were traditionally called tortoises, but more recently turtle has been used for the entire group [4]\n\n\nAnatomy and physiology\nThe largest living species of turtle (and fourth-largest reptile) is the leatherback turtle, which can reach over 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in) in length and weigh over 500 kg (1,100 lb) [9] The largest known turtle was Archelon ischyros, a Late Cretaceous sea turtle up to 4.5 m (15 ft) long, 5.25 m (17 ft) wide between the tips of the front flippers, and estimated to have weighed over 2,200 kg (4,900 lb) [10] The smallest living turtle is Chersobius signatus of South Africa, measuring no more than 10 cm (3.9 in) in length [11] and weighing 172 g (6.1 oz) [12]\n\n\nSize\nThe largest living species of turtle (and fourth-largest reptile) is the leatherback turtle, which can reach over 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in) in length and weigh over 500 kg (1,100 lb) [9] The largest known turtle was Archelon ischyros, a Late Cretaceous sea turtle up to 4.5 m (15 ft) long, 5.25 m (17 ft) wide between the tips of the front flippers, and estimated to have weighed over 2,200 kg (4,900 lb) [10] The smallest living turtle is Chersobius signatus of South Africa, measuring no more than 10 cm (3.9 in) in length [11] and weighing 172 g (6.1 oz) [12]\n\n\nShell\nThe shell of a turtle is unique among vertebrates and serves to protect the animal and provide shelter from the elements [13] [14] [15] It is primarily made of 50–60 bones and consists of two parts: the domed, dorsal (back) carapace and the flatter, ventral (belly) plastron They are connected by lateral (side) extensions of the plastron [13] [16]\n\n\nHead and neck\nThe turtle's skull is unique among living amniotes (which includes reptiles, birds and mammals); it is solid and rigid with no openings for muscle attachment (temporal fenestrae) [24] [25] Muscles instead attach to recesses in the back of the skull Turtle skulls vary in shape, from the long and narrow skulls of softshells to the broad and flattened skull of the mata mata [25] Some turtle species have developed large and thick heads, allowing for greater muscle mass and stronger bites [26]\n\n\nLimbs and locomotion\nDue to their heavy shells, turtles are slow-moving on land A desert tortoise moves at only 0.22–0.48 km/h (0.14–0.30 mph) By contrast, sea turtles can swim at 30 km/h (19 mph) [13] The limbs of turtles are adapted for various means of locomotion and habits and most have five toes Tortoises are specialized for terrestrial environments and have column-like legs with elephant-like feet and short toes The gopher tortoise has flattened front limbs for digging in the substrate Freshwater turtles have more flexible legs and longer toes with webbing, giving them thrust in the water Some of these species, such as snapping turtles and mud turtles, mainly walk along the water bottom, as they would on land Others, such as terrapins, swim by paddling with all four limbs, switching between the opposing front and hind limbs, which keeps their direction stable [13] [34]\n\n\nSenses\nTurtles make use of vision to find food and mates, avoid predators, and orient themselves The retina's light-sensitive cells include both rods for vision in low light, and cones with three different photopigments for bright light, where they have full-color vision There is possibly a fourth type of cone that detects ultraviolet, as hatchling sea turtles respond experimentally to ultraviolet light, but it is unknown if they can distinguish this from longer wavelengths A freshwater turtle, the red-eared slider, has an exceptional seven types of cone cell [38] [39] [40]\n\n\nBreathing\nThe rigid shell of turtles is not capable of expanding and making room for the lungs, as in other amniotes, so they have had to evolve special adaptations for respiration [45] [46] [47] The lungs of turtles are attached directly to the carapace above while below, connective tissue attaches them to the organs [48] They have multiple lateral (side) and medial (middle) chambers (the numbers of which vary between species) and one terminal (end) chamber [49]\n\n\nCirculation\nTurtles share the linked circulatory and pulmonary (lung) systems of vertebrates, where the three-chambered heart pumps deoxygenated blood through the lungs and then pumps the returned oxygenated blood through the body's tissues The cardiopulmonary system has both structural and physiological adaptations that distinguish it from other vertebrates Turtles have a large lung volume and can move blood through non-pulmonary blood vessels, including some within the heart, to avoid the lungs while they are not breathing They can hold their breath for much longer periods than other reptiles and they can tolerate the resulting low oxygen levels They can moderate the increase in acidity during anaerobic (non-oxygen-based) respiration by chemical buffering and they can lie dormant for months, in aestivation or brumation [53]\n\n\nOsmoregulation\nIn sea turtles, the bladder is one unit and in most freshwater turtles, it is double-lobed [55] Sea turtle bladders are connected to two small accessory bladders, located at the sides to the neck of the urinary bladder and above the pubis [56] Arid-living tortoises have bladders that serve as reserves of water, storing up to 20% of their body weight in fluids The fluids are normally low in solutes, but higher during droughts when the reptile gains potassium salts from its plant diet The bladder stores these salts until the tortoise finds fresh drinking water [57] To regulate the amount of salt in their bodies, sea turtles and the brackish-living diamondback terrapin secrete excess salt in a thick sticky substance from their tear glands Because of this, sea turtles may appear to be \"crying\" when on land [58]\n\n\nThermoregulation\nTurtles, like other reptiles, have a limited ability to regulate their body temperature This ability varies between species, and with body size Small pond turtles regulate their temperature by crawling out of the water and basking in the sun, while small terrestrial turtles move between sunny and shady places to adjust their temperature Large species, both terrestrial and marine, have sufficient mass to give them substantial thermal inertia, meaning that they heat up or cool down over many hours The Aldabra giant tortoise weighs up to some 60 kilograms (130 lb) and is able to allow its temperature to rise to some 33 °C (91 °F) on a hot day, and to fall naturally to around 29 °C (84 °F) by night Some giant tortoises seek out shade to avoid overheating on sunny days On Grand Terre Island, food is scarce inland, shade is scarce near the coast, and the  tortoises compete for space under the few trees on hot days Large males may push smaller females out of the shade, and some then overheat and die [59]\n\n\nBehavior\nMost turtle species are opportunistic omnivores; land-dwelling species are more herbivorous and aquatic ones more carnivorous [26] Generally lacking speed and agility, most turtles feed either on plant material or on animals with limited movements like mollusks, worms, and insect larvae [13] Some species, such as the African helmeted turtle and snapping turtles, eat fish, amphibians, reptiles (including other turtles), birds, and mammals They may take them by ambush but also scavenge [60] The alligator snapping turtle has a worm-like appendage on its tongue that it uses to lure fish into its mouth Tortoises are the most herbivorous group, consuming grasses, leaves, and fruits [61] Many turtle species, including tortoises, supplement their diet with eggshells, animal bones, hair, and droppings for extra nutrients [62]\n\n\nDiet and feeding\nMost turtle species are opportunistic omnivores; land-dwelling species are more herbivorous and aquatic ones more carnivorous [26] Generally lacking speed and agility, most

animal bones, hair, and droppings for extra nutrients [62]\n\n\nCommunication and intelligence\nWhile popularly thought of as mute, turtles make various sounds to communicate [69] [70] One study which recorded 53 species found that all of them vocalized [71] Tortoises may bellow when courting and mating [70] [31] Various species of both freshwater and sea turtles emit short, low-frequency calls from the time they are in the egg to when they are adults These vocalizations may serve to create group cohesion when migrating [70] The oblong turtle has a particularly large vocal range; producing sounds described as clacks, clicks, squawks, hoots, various kinds of chirps, wails, hooos, grunts, growls, blow bursts, howls, and drum rolls [68]\n\n\nDefense\nWhen sensing danger, a turtle may flee, freeze or withdraw into its shell Freshwater turtles flee into the water, though the Sonora mud turtle may take refuge on land as the shallow temporary ponds they inhabit make them vulnerable [78] When startled, a softshell turtle may dive underwater and bury itself under the sea floor [79] If a predator persists, the turtle may bite or discharge from its cloaca Several species produce foul-smelling chemicals from musk glands Other tactics include threat displays and Bell's hinge-back tortoise can play dead When attacked, big-headed turtle hatchlings squeal, possibly startling the predator [80]\n\n\nMigration\nTurtles are the only reptiles that migrate long distances, more specifically the marine species that can travel up to thousands of kilometers Some non-marine turtles, such as the species of Geochelone (terrestrial), Chelydra (freshwater), and Malaclemys (estuarine), migrate seasonally over much shorter distances, up to around 27 km (17 mi), to lay eggs Such short migrations are comparable to those of some lizards, snakes, and crocodilians [81] Sea turtles nest in a specific area, such as a beach, leaving the eggs to hatch unattended The young turtles leave that area, migrating long distances in the years or decades in which they grow to maturity, and then return seemingly to the same area every few years to mate and lay eggs, though the precision varies between species and populations This \"natal homing\" has appeared remarkable to biologists, though there is now plentiful evidence for it, including from genetics [82]\n\n\nReproduction and life cycle\nTurtles have a wide variety of mating behaviors but do not form pair-bonds or social groups [83] In green sea turtles, females generally outnumber males [84] In terrestrial species, males are often larger than females and fighting between males establishes a dominance hierarchy for access to mates For most semi-aquatic and bottom-walking aquatic species, combat occurs less often Males of these species instead may use their size advantage to mate forcibly In fully aquatic species, males are often smaller than females and rely on courtship displays to gain mating access to females [85]\n\n\nCourtship and mounting\nCourtship varies between species, and with habitat It is often complex in aquatic species, both marine and freshwater, but simpler in the semi-aquatic mud turtles and snapping turtles A male tortoise bobs his head, then subdues the female by biting and butting her before mounting [13] The male scorpion mud turtle approaches the female from the rear, and often resorts to aggressive methods such as biting the female's tail or hind limbs, followed by a mounting [86]\n\n\nEggs and hatchlings\nTurtles, including sea turtles, lay their eggs on land, although some lay eggs near water that rises and falls in level, submerging the eggs While most species build nests and lay eggs where they forage, some travel miles The common snapping turtle walks 5 km (3 mi) on land, while sea turtles travel even further; the leatherback swims some 12,000 km (7,500 mi) to its nesting beaches [13] [89] Most turtles create a nest for their eggs Females usually dig a flask-like chamber in the substrate Other species lay their eggs in vegetation or crevices [93] Females choose nesting locations based on environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, which are important for developing embryos [89] Depending on the species, the number of eggs laid varies from one to over 100 Larger females can lay eggs that are greater in number or bigger in size Compared to freshwater turtles, tortoises deposit fewer but larger eggs Females can lay multiple clutches throughout a season, particularly in species that experience unpredictable monsoons [94]\n\n\nLifespan\nTurtles can live long lives The oldest living turtle and land animal is said to be a Seychelles giant tortoise named Jonathan, who turned 187 in 2019 [101] A Galápagos tortoise named Harriet was collected by Charles Darwin in 1835; it died in 2006, having lived for at least 176 years Most wild turtles do not reach that age Turtles keep growing new scutes under the previous scutes every year, allowing researchers to estimate how long they have lived [102] They also age slowly [103] The survival rate for adult turtles can reach 99% per year [13]\n\n\nSystematics and evolution\nZoologists have sought to explain the evolutionary origin of the turtles, and in particular of their unique shells In 1914, Jan Versluys proposed that bony plates in the dermis, called osteoderms, fused to the ribs beneath them, later called the \"Polka Dot Ancestor\" by Olivier Rieppel [19] [104] The theory accounted for the evolution of fossil pareiasaurs from Bradysaurus to Anthodon, but not for how the ribs could have become attached to the bony dermal plates [19]\n\n\nFossil history\nZoologists have sought to explain the evolutionary origin of the turtles, and in particular of their unique shells In 1914, Jan Versluys proposed that bony plates in the dermis, called osteoderms, fused to the ribs beneath them, later called the \"Polka Dot Ancestor\" by Olivier Rieppel [19] [104] The theory accounted for the evolution of fossil pareiasaurs from Bradysaurus to Anthodon, but not for how the ribs could have become attached to the bony dermal plates [19]\n\n\nExternal relationships\nThe turtles' exact ancestry has been disputed It was believed they were the only surviving branch of the ancient evolutionary grade Anapsida, which includes groups such as procolophonids and pareiasaurs All anapsid skulls lack a temporal opening while all other living amniotes have temporal openings [114] It was later suggested that the anapsid-like turtle skulls may be due to backward evolution rather than to anapsid descent [115] Fossil evidence has shown that early stem-turtles possessed small temporal openings [105]\n\n\nInternal relationships\nModern turtles and their extinct relatives with a complete shell are classified within the clade Testudinata [124] The most recent common ancestor of living turtles, corresponding to the split between Pleurodira (side-necked species) and Cryptodira (hidden necked species), is estimated to have occurred around 210 million years ago during the Late Triassic [125] Robert Thompson and colleagues (2021) comment that living turtles have low diversity, relative to how long they existed Diversity has been stable, according to their analysis, except for a single rapid increase around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary some 30 million years ago, and a large regional extinction at roughly the same time They suggest that global climate change caused both events, as the cooling and drying caused the land to become arid and turtles to become extinct there, while new continental margins opened up by the climate change provided habitats for other species to evolve [126]\n\n\nDifferences between the two suborders\nTurtles are divided into two living suborders: Cryptodira and Pleurodira [129] The two groups differ in the way the neck is retracted for protection Pleurodirans retract their neck to the side and in front of the shoulder girdles, whereas cryptodirans retract their neck backward into their shell These motions are enabled by the morphology and arrangement of neck vertebrae [130] [131] Sea turtles (which belong to Cryptodira) have mostly lost the ability to retract their heads [132]\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nTurtles are widely distributed across the world's continents, oceans, and islands with terrestrial, fully aquatic, and semi-aquatic species Sea turtles are mainly tropical and subtropical, but leatherbacks can be found in colder areas of the Atlantic and Pacific [135] Living Pleurodira all live in freshwater and are found only in the Southern Hemisphere [136] The Cryptodira include terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species, and these range more widely [135] The world regions richest in non-marine turtle species are the Amazon basin, the Gulf of Mexico drainages of the United States, and parts of South and Southeast Asia [137]\n\n\nConservation\nAmong vertebrate orders, turtles are second only to primates in the percentage of threatened species 360 modern species have existed since 1500 AD Of these, 51–56% are considered threatened and 60% considered threatened or extinct [144] Turtles face many threats, including habitat destruction, harvesting for consumption, the pet trade, [145] [146] light pollution, [147] and climate change [148] Asian species have a particularly high extinction risk, primarily due to their long-term unsustainable exploitation for food and medicine, [149] and about 83% of Asia's non-marine turtle species are considered threatened [144] As of 2021, turtle extinction is progressing much faster than during the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction At this rate, all turtles could be extinct in a few centuries [150]\n\n\nHuman uses\nTwo tortoises were on the Soviet Union's September 1968 Zond 5 circumlunar flight, making them the first earthly living things to travel to the

ayotl drums [198]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nCitations\n\n\n\nCited sources\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Introduction**\n\nTurtles are a group of reptiles that have been on the planet for over 200 million years, and have adapted to a wide range of environments and ecosystems. With over 360 species, turtles are one of the most diverse groups of animals on Earth, and can be found on every continent except Antarctica. They are known for their distinctive shells, which provide protection and support for their bodies, and are a key feature of their biology and evolution.\n\n**Naming and Etymology**\n\nThe word \"turtle\" is borrowed from the French word \"tortue\" or \"tortre\", which means \"turtle, tortoise\". This name is used to refer to the entire group of animals, and is often used interchangeably with other terms such as \"tortoise\" and \"sea turtle\". In North America, the name \"turtle\" is often used to refer to the order as a whole, while in Britain, it is used specifically to refer to sea turtles, as opposed to freshwater terrapins and land-dwelling tortoises.\n\n**Anatomy and Physiology**\n\nThe largest living species of turtle is the leatherback sea turtle, which can reach lengths of over 2.7 meters (8.9 feet) and weigh over 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds). The largest known turtle was Archelon ischyros, a Late Cretaceous sea turtle that reached lengths of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) and weighed an estimated 2,200 kilograms (4,900 pounds). The smallest living turtle is the Chersobius signatus, a species of South African tortoise that measures no more than 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) in length and weighs 172 grams (6.1 ounces).\n\n**Size**\n\nTurtles come in a wide range of sizes, from the tiny Chersobius signatus to the massive leatherback sea turtle. The largest turtles are the sea turtles, which can reach lengths of up to 3 meters (10 feet) and weigh over 900 kilograms (2,000 pounds). The smallest turtles are the terrestrial species, which can measure as little as 5 centimeters (2 inches) in length.\n\n**Shell**\n\nThe shell of a turtle is unique among vertebrates and serves to protect the animal and provide shelter from the elements. It is primarily made of 50-60 bones and consists of two parts: the domed, dorsal (back) carapace and the flatter, ventral (belly) plastron. The carapace is the outer, harder shell that covers the turtle's back, while the plastron is the softer, inner shell that covers the turtle's belly.\n\n**Head and Neck**\n\nThe turtle's skull is unique among living amniotes, with no openings for muscle attachment (temporal fenestrae). Muscles instead attach to recesses in the back of the skull. The shape of the turtle's skull varies, from the long and narrow skulls of softshells to the broad and flattened skull of the mata mata.\n\n**Limbs and Locomotion**\n\nTurtles are slow-moving on land, due to their heavy shells. The desert tortoise moves at a speed of only 0.22-0.48 kilometers per hour (0.14-0.30 miles per hour). Sea turtles, on the other hand, can swim at speeds of up to 30 kilometers per hour (19 miles per hour). The limbs of turtles are adapted for various means of locomotion and habits, and most have five toes.\n\n**Senses**\n\nTurtles use their vision to find food and mates, avoid predators, and orient themselves. The retina of a turtle's eye includes both rods for vision in low light and cones with three different photopigments for bright light. Some species of turtles, such as the red-eared slider, have an exceptional seven types of cone cell.\n\n**Breathing**\n\nTurtles have a unique respiratory system that allows them to breathe air while keeping their shells closed. The lungs of turtles are attached directly to the carapace above and connected to the organs below by connective tissue. They have multiple lateral and medial chambers, and one terminal chamber.\n\n**Circulation**\n\nTurtles have a three-chambered heart that pumps deoxygenated blood through the lungs and then pumps oxygenated blood through the body's tissues. They have a linked circulatory and pulmonary system that allows them to move blood through non-pulmonary blood vessels, even when they are not breathing.\n\n**Osmoregulation**\n\nSea turtles have a unique bladder that is connected to two small accessory bladders located near the neck of the urinary bladder. Arid-living tortoises have bladders that serve as reserves of water, storing up to 20% of their body weight in fluids. They also have a special adaptation that allows them to regulate the amount of salt in their bodies by secreting excess salt in a sticky substance from their tear glands.\n\n**Thermoregulation**\n\nTurtles are ectothermic, meaning that they regulate their body temperature using external sources, such as the sun or a warm rock. Small turtles regulate their temperature by crawling out of the water and basking in the sun, while large species have sufficient mass to give them substantial thermal inertia.\n\n**Behavior**\n\nMost turtle species are opportunistic omnivores, feeding on plant material, animals, and other invertebrates. Some species, such as the African helmeted turtle and snapping turtles, eat fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Tortoises are the most herbivorous group, consuming grasses, leaves, and fruits.\n\n**Defense**\n\nWhen sensing danger, a turtle may flee, freeze, or withdraw into its shell. Some species, such as the softshell turtle, may dive underwater and bury itself under the sea floor. Others may bite or discharge from their cloaca, or produce foul-smelling chemicals from musk glands.\n\n**Migration**\n\nTurtles are the only reptiles that migrate long distances, with some species traveling up to thousands of kilometers. Sea turtles nest in a specific area, leaving the eggs to hatch unattended, and then return to the same area every few years to mate and lay eggs.\n\n**Reproduction and Life Cycle**\n\nTurtles have a wide variety of mating behaviors, but do not form pair bonds or social groups. In most species, males are larger than females, and fighting between males establishes a dominance hierarchy for access to mates. For most semi-aquatic and bottom-walking aquatic species, combat occurs less often, and males may use their size advantage to mate forcibly.\n\n**Courtship and Mounting**\n\nCourtship varies between species, and with habitat. It is often complex in aquatic species, but simpler in semi-aquatic mud turtles and snapping turtles. A male tortoise may bob his head, then subdue the female by biting and butting her before mounting.\n\n**Eggs and Hatchlings**\n\nTurtles lay their eggs on land, although some species lay eggs near water that rises and falls in level. Females usually dig a flask-like chamber in the substrate, and the eggs hatch after incubation. The number of eggs laid varies between species, from one to over 100.\n\n**Lifespan**\n\nTurtles can live long lives, with some species living up to 150 years or more. The oldest living turtle and land animal is said to be a Seychelles giant tortoise named Jonathan, who turned 187 in 2019.\n\n**Systematics and Evolution**\n\nZoologists have sought to explain the evolutionary origin of turtles, and in particular of their unique shells. The theory of the \"Polka Dot Ancestor\" proposes that bony plates in the dermis, called osteoderms, fused to the ribs beneath them.\n\n**Fossil History**\n\nTurtles have a rich fossil history, with evidence of their existence dating back to the Early Triassic period. The earliest known turtle fossils were found in Europe and North America, and showed a mix of reptilian and turtle-like characteristics.\n\n**External Relationships**\n\nThe turtles' exact ancestry has been disputed, with some scientists suggesting that they may be related to the extinct group Anapsida. However, most evidence suggests that turtles are a distinct group that evolved from a common ancestor with other reptiles.\n\n**Internal Relationships**\n\nModern turtles and their extinct relatives with a complete shell are classified within the clade Testudinata. The most recent common ancestor of living turtles, corresponding to the split between Pleurodira and Cryptodira, is estimated to have occurred around 210 million years ago during the Late Triassic.\n\n**Distribution and Habitat**\n\nTurtles are widely distributed across the world's continents, oceans, and islands, with terrestrial, fully aquatic, and semi-aquatic species. Sea turtles are mainly tropical and subtropical, but leatherbacks can be found in colder areas of the Atlantic and Pacific.\n\n**Conservation**\n\nAmong vertebrate orders, turtles are second only to primates in the percentage of threatened species. Many turtle species are threatened by habitat destruction, harvesting for consumption, the pet trade, and climate change.\n\n**Human Uses**\n\nTurtles have been used in various ways by humans, including as pets, for food, and for scientific research. They have also been used in space exploration, with two tortoises being sent to the Moon on the Soviet Union's Zond 5 mission in 1968.\n\n**In Culture**\n\nTurtles have featured in human cultures across the world since ancient times, often symbolizing longevity and wisdom. They are often depicted in art and literature, and are considered a sacred animal in many cultures.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Turtle\" following this outline:\n\n\nNaming and etymology\nThe word turtle is borrowed from the French word tortue or tortre 'turtle, tortoise' [3] It is a common name and may be used without knowledge of taxonomic distinctions In North America, it may denote the order as a whole In Britain, the name is used for sea turtles as opposed to freshwater terrapins and land-dwelling tortoises In Australia, which lacks true tortoises (family Testudinidae), non-marine turtles were traditionally called tortoises, but more recently turtle has been used for the entire group [4]\n\n\nAnatomy and physiology\nThe largest living species of turtle (and fourth-largest reptile) is the leatherback turtle, which can reach over 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in) in length and weigh over 500 kg (1,100 lb) [9] The largest known turtle was Archelon ischyros, a Late Cretaceous sea turtle up to 4.5 m (15 ft) long, 5.25 m (17 ft) wide between the tips of the front flippers, and estimated to have weighed over 2,200 kg (4,900 lb) [10] The smallest living turtle is Chersobius signatus of South Africa, measuring no more than 10 cm (3.9 in) in length [11] and weighing 172 g (6.1 oz) [12]\n\n\nSize\nThe largest living species of turtle

Cretaceous sea turtle up to 4.5 m (15 ft) long, 5.25 m (17 ft) wide between the tips of the front flippers, and estimated to have weighed over 2,200 kg (4,900 lb) [10] The smallest living turtle is Chersobius signatus of South Africa, measuring no more than 10 cm (3.9 in) in length [11] and weighing 172 g (6.1 oz) [12]\n\n\nShell\nThe shell of a turtle is unique among vertebrates and serves to protect the animal and provide shelter from the elements [13] [14] [15] It is primarily made of 50–60 bones and consists of two parts: the domed, dorsal (back) carapace and the flatter, ventral (belly) plastron They are connected by lateral (side) extensions of the plastron [13] [16]\n\n\nHead and neck\nThe turtle's skull is unique among living amniotes (which includes reptiles, birds and mammals); it is solid and rigid with no openings for muscle attachment (temporal fenestrae) [24] [25] Muscles instead attach to recesses in the back of the skull Turtle skulls vary in shape, from the long and narrow skulls of softshells to the broad and flattened skull of the mata mata [25] Some turtle species have developed large and thick heads, allowing for greater muscle mass and stronger bites [26]\n\n\nLimbs and locomotion\nDue to their heavy shells, turtles are slow-moving on land A desert tortoise moves at only 0.22–0.48 km/h (0.14–0.30 mph) By contrast, sea turtles can swim at 30 km/h (19 mph) [13] The limbs of turtles are adapted for various means of locomotion and habits and most have five toes Tortoises are specialized for terrestrial environments and have column-like legs with elephant-like feet and short toes The gopher tortoise has flattened front limbs for digging in the substrate Freshwater turtles have more flexible legs and longer toes with webbing, giving them thrust in the water Some of these species, such as snapping turtles and mud turtles, mainly walk along the water bottom, as they would on land Others, such as terrapins, swim by paddling with all four limbs, switching between the opposing front and hind limbs, which keeps their direction stable [13] [34]\n\n\nSenses\nTurtles make use of vision to find food and mates, avoid predators, and orient themselves The retina's light-sensitive cells include both rods for vision in low light, and cones with three different photopigments for bright light, where they have full-color vision There is possibly a fourth type of cone that detects ultraviolet, as hatchling sea turtles respond experimentally to ultraviolet light, but it is unknown if they can distinguish this from longer wavelengths A freshwater turtle, the red-eared slider, has an exceptional seven types of cone cell [38] [39] [40]\n\n\nBreathing\nThe rigid shell of turtles is not capable of expanding and making room for the lungs, as in other amniotes, so they have had to evolve special adaptations for respiration [45] [46] [47] The lungs of turtles are attached directly to the carapace above while below, connective tissue attaches them to the organs [48] They have multiple lateral (side) and medial (middle) chambers (the numbers of which vary between species) and one terminal (end) chamber [49]\n\n\nCirculation\nTurtles share the linked circulatory and pulmonary (lung) systems of vertebrates, where the three-chambered heart pumps deoxygenated blood through the lungs and then pumps the returned oxygenated blood through the body's tissues The cardiopulmonary system has both structural and physiological adaptations that distinguish it from other vertebrates Turtles have a large lung volume and can move blood through non-pulmonary blood vessels, including some within the heart, to avoid the lungs while they are not breathing They can hold their breath for much longer periods than other reptiles and they can tolerate the resulting low oxygen levels They can moderate the increase in acidity during anaerobic (non-oxygen-based) respiration by chemical buffering and they can lie dormant for months, in aestivation or brumation [53]\n\n\nOsmoregulation\nIn sea turtles, the bladder is one unit and in most freshwater turtles, it is double-lobed [55] Sea turtle bladders are connected to two small accessory bladders, located at the sides to the neck of the urinary bladder and above the pubis [56] Arid-living tortoises have bladders that serve as reserves of water, storing up to 20% of their body weight in fluids The fluids are normally low in solutes, but higher during droughts when the reptile gains potassium salts from its plant diet The bladder stores these salts until the tortoise finds fresh drinking water [57] To regulate the amount of salt in their bodies, sea turtles and the brackish-living diamondback terrapin secrete excess salt in a thick sticky substance from their tear glands Because of this, sea turtles may appear to be \"crying\" when on land [58]\n\n\nThermoregulation\nTurtles, like other reptiles, have a limited ability to regulate their body temperature This ability varies between species, and with body size Small pond turtles regulate their temperature by crawling out of the water and basking in the sun, while small terrestrial turtles move between sunny and shady places to adjust their temperature Large species, both terrestrial and marine, have sufficient mass to give them substantial thermal inertia, meaning that they heat up or cool down over many hours The Aldabra giant tortoise weighs up to some 60 kilograms (130 lb) and is able to allow its temperature to rise to some 33 °C (91 °F) on a hot day, and to fall naturally to around 29 °C (84 °F) by night Some giant tortoises seek out shade to avoid overheating on sunny days On Grand Terre Island, food is scarce inland, shade is scarce near the coast, and the  tortoises compete for space under the few trees on hot days Large males may push smaller females out of the shade, and some then overheat and die [59]\n\n\nBehavior\nMost turtle species are opportunistic omnivores; land-dwelling species are more herbivorous and aquatic ones more carnivorous [26] Generally lacking speed and agility, most turtles feed either on plant material or on animals with limited movements like mollusks, worms, and insect larvae [13] Some species, such as the African helmeted turtle and snapping turtles, eat fish, amphibians, reptiles (including other turtles), birds, and mammals They may take them by ambush but also scavenge [60] The alligator snapping turtle has a worm-like appendage on its tongue that it uses to lure fish into its mouth Tortoises are the most herbivorous group, consuming grasses, leaves, and fruits [61] Many turtle species, including tortoises, supplement their diet with eggshells, animal bones, hair, and droppings for extra nutrients [62]\n\n\nDiet and feeding\nMost turtle species are opportunistic omnivores; land-dwelling species are more herbivorous and aquatic ones more carnivorous [26] Generally lacking speed and agility, most turtles feed either on plant material or on animals with limited movements like mollusks, worms, and insect larvae [13] Some species, such as the African helmeted turtle and snapping turtles, eat

it uses to lure fish into its mouth Tortoises are the most herbivorous group, consuming grasses, leaves, and fruits [61] Many turtle species, including tortoises, supplement their diet with eggshells, animal bones, hair, and droppings for extra nutrients [62]\n\n\nCommunication and intelligence\nWhile popularly thought of as mute, turtles make various sounds to communicate [69] [70] One study which recorded 53 species found that all of them vocalized [71] Tortoises may bellow when courting and mating [70] [31] Various species of both freshwater and sea turtles emit short, low-frequency calls from the time they are in the egg to when they are adults These vocalizations may serve to create group cohesion when migrating [70] The oblong turtle has a particularly large vocal range; producing sounds described as clacks, clicks, squawks, hoots, various kinds of chirps, wails, hooos, grunts, growls, blow bursts, howls, and drum rolls [68]\n\n\nDefense\nWhen sensing danger, a turtle may flee, freeze or withdraw into its shell Freshwater turtles flee into the water, though the Sonora mud turtle may take refuge on land as the shallow temporary ponds they inhabit make them vulnerable [78] When startled, a softshell turtle may dive underwater and bury itself under the sea floor [79] If a predator persists, the turtle may bite or discharge from its cloaca Several species produce foul-smelling chemicals from musk glands Other tactics include threat displays and Bell's hinge-back tortoise can play dead When attacked, big-headed turtle hatchlings squeal, possibly startling the predator [80]\n\n\nMigration\nTurtles are the only reptiles that migrate long distances, more specifically the marine species that can travel up to thousands of kilometers Some non-marine turtles, such as the species of Geochelone (terrestrial), Chelydra (freshwater), and Malaclemys (estuarine), migrate seasonally over much shorter distances, up to around 27 km (17 mi), to lay eggs Such short migrations are comparable to those of some lizards, snakes, and crocodilians [81] Sea turtles nest in a specific area, such as a beach, leaving the eggs to hatch unattended The young turtles leave that area, migrating long distances in the years or decades in which they grow to maturity, and then return seemingly to the same area every few years to mate and lay eggs, though the precision varies between species and populations This \"natal homing\" has appeared remarkable to biologists, though there is now plentiful evidence for it, including from genetics [82]\n\n\nReproduction and life cycle\nTurtles have a wide variety of mating behaviors but do not form pair-bonds or social groups [83] In green sea turtles, females generally outnumber males [84] In terrestrial species, males are often larger than females and fighting between males establishes a dominance hierarchy for access to mates For most semi-aquatic and bottom-walking aquatic species, combat occurs less often Males of these species instead may use their size advantage to mate forcibly In fully aquatic species, males are often smaller than females and rely on courtship displays to gain mating access to females [85]\n\n\nCourtship and mounting\nCourtship varies between species, and with habitat It is often complex in aquatic species, both marine and freshwater, but simpler in the semi-aquatic mud turtles and snapping turtles A male tortoise bobs his head, then subdues the female by biting and butting her before mounting [13] The male scorpion mud turtle approaches the female from the rear, and often resorts to aggressive methods such as biting the female's tail or hind limbs, followed by a mounting [86]\n\n\nEggs and hatchlings\nTurtles, including sea turtles, lay their eggs on land, although some lay eggs near water that rises and falls in level, submerging the eggs While most species build nests and lay eggs where they forage, some travel miles The common snapping turtle walks 5 km (3 mi) on land, while sea turtles travel even further; the leatherback swims some 12,000 km (7,500 mi) to its nesting beaches [13] [89] Most turtles create a nest for their eggs Females usually dig a flask-like chamber in the substrate Other species lay their eggs in vegetation or crevices [93] Females choose nesting locations based on environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, which are important for developing embryos [89] Depending on the species, the number of eggs laid varies from one to over 100 Larger females can lay eggs that are greater in number or bigger in size Compared to freshwater turtles, tortoises deposit fewer but larger eggs Females can lay multiple clutches throughout a season, particularly in species that experience unpredictable monsoons [94]\n\n\nLifespan\nTurtles can live long lives The oldest living turtle and land animal is said to be a Seychelles giant tortoise named Jonathan, who turned 187 in 2019 [101] A Galápagos tortoise named Harriet was collected by Charles Darwin in 1835; it died in 2006, having lived for at least 176 years Most wild turtles do not reach that age Turtles keep growing new scutes under the previous scutes every year, allowing researchers to estimate how long they have lived [102] They also age slowly [103] The survival rate for adult turtles can reach 99% per year [13]\n\n\nSystematics and evolution\nZoologists have sought to explain the evolutionary origin of the turtles, and in particular of their unique shells In 1914, Jan Versluys proposed that bony plates in the dermis, called osteoderms, fused to the ribs beneath them, later called the \"Polka Dot Ancestor\" by Olivier Rieppel [19] [104] The theory accounted for the evolution of fossil pareiasaurs from Bradysaurus to Anthodon, but not for how the ribs could have become attached to the bony dermal plates [19]\n\n\nFossil history\nZoologists have sought to explain the evolutionary origin of the turtles, and in particular of their unique shells In 1914, Jan Versluys proposed that bony plates in the dermis, called osteoderms, fused to the ribs beneath them, later called the \"Polka Dot Ancestor\" by Olivier Rieppel [19] [104] The theory accounted for the evolution of fossil pareiasaurs from Bradysaurus to Anthodon, but not for how the ribs could have become attached to the bony dermal plates [19]\n\n\nExternal relationships\nThe turtles' exact ancestry has been disputed It was believed they were the only surviving branch of the ancient evolutionary grade Anapsida, which includes groups such as procolophonids and pareiasaurs All anapsid skulls lack a temporal opening while all other living amniotes have temporal openings [114] It was later suggested that the anapsid-like turtle skulls may be due to backward evolution rather than to anapsid descent [115] Fossil evidence has shown that early stem-turtles possessed small temporal openings [105]\n\n\nInternal relationships\nModern turtles and their extinct relatives with a complete shell are classified within the clade Testudinata [124] The most recent common ancestor of living turtles, corresponding to the split between Pleurodira (side-necked species) and Cryptodira (hidden necked species), is estimated to have occurred around 210 million years ago during the Late Triassic [125] Robert Thompson and colleagues (2021) comment that living turtles have low diversity, relative to how long they existed Diversity has been stable, according to their analysis, except for a single rapid increase around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary some 30 million years ago, and a large regional extinction at roughly the same time They suggest that global climate change caused both events, as the cooling and drying caused the land to become arid and turtles to become extinct there, while new continental margins opened up by the climate change provided habitats for other species to evolve [126]\n\n\nDifferences between the two suborders\nTurtles are divided into two living suborders: Cryptodira and Pleurodira [129] The two groups differ in the way the neck is retracted for protection Pleurodirans retract their neck to the side and in front of the shoulder girdles, whereas cryptodirans retract their neck backward into their shell These motions are enabled by the morphology and arrangement of neck vertebrae [130] [131] Sea turtles (which belong to Cryptodira) have mostly lost the ability to retract their heads [132]\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nTurtles are widely distributed across the world's continents, oceans, and islands with terrestrial, fully aquatic, and semi-aquatic species Sea turtles are mainly tropical and subtropical, but leatherbacks can be found in colder areas of the Atlantic and Pacific [135] Living Pleurodira all live in freshwater and are found only in the Southern Hemisphere [136] The Cryptodira include terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species, and these range more widely [135] The world regions richest in non-marine turtle species are the Amazon basin, the Gulf of Mexico drainages of the United States, and parts of South and Southeast Asia [137]\n\n\nConservation\nAmong vertebrate orders, turtles are second only to primates in the percentage of threatened species 360 modern species have existed since 1500 AD Of these, 51–56% are considered threatened and 60% considered threatened or extinct [144] Turtles face many threats, including habitat destruction, harvesting for consumption, the pet trade, [145] [146] light pollution, [147] and climate change [148] Asian species have a particularly high extinction risk, primarily due to their long-term unsustainable exploitation for food and medicine, [149] and about 83% of Asia's non-marine turtle species are considered threatened [144] As of 2021, turtle extinction is progressing much faster than during the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction At this rate, all turtles could be extinct in a few centuries [150]\n\n\nHuman uses\nTwo tortoises were on the Soviet Union's September 1968 Zond 5 circumlunar flight, making them the first earthly living things to travel to the vicinity of the Moon Turtles were also on the Zond 6 (1968) and the Zond 7 (1969) circumlunar flights [163] [164]\n\n\nOn space flights\nTwo tortoises were on the Soviet Union's September 1968 Zond 5 circumlunar flight, making them the first earthly living things to travel to the vicinity of the Moon Turtles were also on the Zond 6 (1968) and the Zond 7 (1969) circumlunar flights [163] [164]\n\n\nIn culture\nTurtles have featured in human cultures across the world since ancient times They are generally viewed positively despite not being \"cuddly\" or flashy; their association with the ancient times and old age have contributed to their endearing image [165]\n\n\nAs pets\nSome turtles, particularly small terrestrial and freshwater species, are kept as pets [187] [188]  The demand for pet turtles increased in the 1950s, with the US being the main supplier, particularly of farm-bred red-eared sliders The popularity for exotic pets has led to an increase in illegal wildlife trafficking Around 21% of the value of live animal trade is in reptiles, and turtles are among the more popularly traded species [189] Poor husbandry of tortoises can cause chronic rhinitis (nasal swelling), overgrown beaks, hyperparathyroidism (which softens their skeleton), constipation, various reproductive problems, and injuries from dogs [187] In the early 20th century, people in the United States have organized and gambled on turtle races [190]\n\n\nAs food and other uses\nThe flesh of captured wild turtles continues to be eaten in Asian cultures, [191] while turtle soup was once a popular dish in English cuisine [192] Gopher tortoise stew has been popular with some groups in Florida [193] The supposed aphrodisiac or medicinal properties of turtle eggs created a large trade for them in Southeast Asia [167] Hard-shell turtle plastrons and soft-shell carapaces are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine; Taiwan imported nearly 200 metric tons of hard-shells from

This guy is a choir boy!'.\" [26] But soon he was stunned by and impressed with Golovkin's talent and attitude from their first meeting He has since then worked to add Mexican-style aggression to Golovkin's Eastern European-style amateur discipline, thereby producing a formidable hybrid champion \"I have a chalkboard in the gym, and I wrote Ali's name, Manny Pacquiao's name and his name,\" Sanchez said \"I told him, 'You could be right there.'

and more fighting,\" [206] [207] [208] On 5 April, ESPN reported that Mexican boxer, Jaime Munguia (28-0, 24 KOs), a 21 year old untested prospect who previously fought at welterweight and light middleweight was going to step in and fight Golovkin [209] Later that day, Lance Pugmire of LA Times stated sources close to NSAC, although Tom Loeffler hadn't submitted any names forward, if

priority During a conference call, he stated it was the 'biggest fight in the world' and beneficial for all parties involved Although Golovkin stated the rematch had a 10% chance of happening, Eric Gomez and Tom Loeffler agreed to meet and start negotiating after 5 May [220] [221] [222] One of the main issues preventing the rematch to take place was the purse split Álvarez wanted 65-35 in his favor, the same terms Golovkin agreed to initially, however Golovkin wanted a straight 50-50 split [223]\n\n\nCareer from 2019–2023\nIn January 2019, Oscar De La Hoya instructed Golden Boy president

Brandon Adams (21-2, 13 KOs), Kamil Szeremeta (19-0, 4 KO) and former world champion Hassan N'Dam [256] [257] It was then reported that Adams would challenge Jermall Charlo (28-0, 21 KOs) instead [258] Speaking to Fight Hub TV, Loeffler explained Rolls was chosen as Golovkin's opponent to increase subscriptions in Canada [259] On 24 April, Golovkin released a statement announcing he had split with longtime trainer Abel Sanchez, after nine long years Sanchez called Golovkin 'Greedy and ungrateful', also advising ESPN, Golovkin had offered him a pay cut, which he refused [260] [261] In May, during a press conference, Golovkin revealed Johnathon Banks as his new trainer Banks was best known for having trained former world heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko [262] Golovkin weighed 163 pounds, and Rolls came in at 163¾ pounds [263] Golovkin's official purse was listed as $2 million, however it was reported he would earn closer to $15 million Rolls was paid $300,000

Garden, New York After a tentative start to the opening round, which saw both fighters sizing each other up with probing jabs, Golovkin fired off a six punch combination ending with a right hook to Derevyanchenko's head, dropping the Ukrainian with 1 minute left in the first round Derevyanchenko rose to his feet within seconds, showing no signs of being hurt The knockdown appeared to spur Derevyanchenko into action as he began to answer Golovkin's punches with his own shots for the remainder of the round In round two, Derevyanchenko began putting three and four punch combinations together behind a single and double jab, while Golovkin stuck to single punches, landing the occasional eye-catching hook Towards the end of the round, Golovkin opened a cut above Derevyanchenko's right eye The action replay appeared to show the cut was caused by a left hook, however, the New York State Athletic Commission deemed it to be the result of an accidental clash of heads, meaning if the fight was stopped due to the cut before the fourth round then the fight would be ruled a no contest, after the fourth, the result would be determined by the scorecards with a technical decision rather than a technical knockout win for Golovkin if the cut was deemed to be the result of a punch After Golovkin started the opening seconds of the third round as the aggressor, Derevyanchenko quickly fired back to the body, appearing to hurt Golovkin as he backed up and kept his elbows tucked in close to his body to protect his mid-section Derevyanchenko took advantage of Golovkin's defensive posture, landing several clean punches to the former champion's head Towards the end of the round Golovkin had some success with a couple of sharp hooks to the head and a right uppercut Golovkin was the aggressor for the majority of the fourth round, having partial success, with Derevyanchenko picking his moments to fire back with two and three punch combinations and continuing to work the body In the last minute of the round, Derevyanchenko appeared to momentarily trouble Golovkin with a straight-left hand to the body At the beginning of the fifth round, the ringside doctor gave the cut above Derevyanchenko's right-eye a close examination before the action resumed Derevyanchenko controlled the pace of the round with a high punch-output, continuing with three and four punch combinations with lateral movement Golovkin, meanwhile, stuck with single hooks and probing jabs, landing a solid uppercut halfway through the round In the final 20 seconds, Derevyanchenko landed another body shot which again appeared to hurt Golovkin, who reeled backwards with his elbows down at his side, protecting his body The sixth was an evenly fought round with both fighters landing several clean punches to the head, although Golovkin appeared to land the more significant blows which caught the attention of the crowd Rounds seven, eight and nine were much of the same, back and forth engagements with Golovkin seeming to land the more eye catching blows The tenth saw Derevyanchenko apply the pressure and back Golovkin up for the first half of the round Golovkin had success in the last minute with left and right hooks landing on Derevyanchenko's head, only to see the Ukrainian answer with his own solid shots and back Golovkin up once again in the final 30 seconds of the round The eleventh and twelfth were closely contested, both fighters having success, with Golovkin again appearing to land the more catching punches in the twelfth and final round After twelve hard fought rounds, Golovkin won by unanimous decision with two judges scoring the bout 115–112 and the third scoring it 114–113, all in favour of Golovkin According to CompuBox stats, Golovkin landed

favor, the same terms Golovkin agreed to initially, however Golovkin wanted a straight 50-50 split [223]\n\n\nCareer from 2019–2023\nIn January 2019, Oscar De La Hoya instructed Golden Boy president Eric Gomez to start negotiating a deal for a third fight between Golovkin and Álvarez Golden Boy had already booked in 4 May, Cinco De Mayo weekend at the T-Mobile Arena [244] A few days later, Gomez posted on social media, after preliminary talks with Golovkin's team, he felt as though Golovkin did not want a third fight [245] On 17 January, it was announced that Álvarez would take part in a middleweight unification bout against Daniel Jacobs on 4 May 2019 [246]\n\n\nGolovkin vs. Rolls\nOn 21 March, Golovkin advised that he wanted to fight the best of the middleweight division, regardless

old Canadian boxer Steve Rolls (19-0, 10 KOs) on 8 June 2019, at Madison Square Garden in New York at a catchweight of 164 pounds [253] [254] [255] Other names in the running to fight Golovkin were Brandon Adams (21-2, 13 KOs), Kamil Szeremeta (19-0, 4 KO) and former world champion Hassan N'Dam [256] [257] It was then reported that Adams would challenge Jermall Charlo (28-0, 21 KOs) instead [258] Speaking to Fight Hub TV, Loeffler explained Rolls was chosen as Golovkin's opponent to increase subscriptions in Canada [259] On 24 April, Golovkin released a statement announcing he had split with longtime trainer Abel Sanchez, after nine long years Sanchez called Golovkin 'Greedy and ungrateful', also advising ESPN, Golovkin had offered him a pay cut, which he refused [260] [261] In May, during a press conference, Golovkin revealed Johnathon Banks as his new trainer Banks was best known for having trained former world heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko [262] Golovkin weighed 163 pounds, and Rolls came in at 163¾ pounds [263] Golovkin's official purse was listed as $2 million, however it was reported he would earn closer to $15 million Rolls was paid $300,000 [264]\n\n\nGolovkin vs. Derevyanchenko\nOn 5 October 2019, Golovkin defeated Ukrainian Sergiy Derevyanchenko by unanimous decision for the vacant IBF and IBO middleweight titles at Madison Square Garden, New York After a tentative start to the opening round, which saw both fighters sizing each other up with probing jabs, Golovkin fired off a six punch combination ending with a right hook to Derevyanchenko's head, dropping the Ukrainian with 1 minute left in the first round Derevyanchenko rose to his feet within seconds, showing no signs of being hurt The knockdown appeared to spur Derevyanchenko into action as he began to answer Golovkin's punches with his own shots for the remainder of the round In round two, Derevyanchenko began putting three and four punch combinations together behind a single and double jab, while Golovkin stuck to single punches, landing the occasional eye-catching hook Towards the end of the round, Golovkin opened a cut above Derevyanchenko's right eye The action replay appeared to show the cut was caused by a left hook, however, the New York State Athletic Commission deemed it to be the result of an accidental clash of heads, meaning if the fight was stopped due to the cut before the fourth round then the fight would be ruled a no contest, after the fourth, the result would be determined by the scorecards with a technical decision rather than a technical knockout win for Golovkin if the cut was deemed to be the result of a punch After Golovkin started the opening seconds of the third round as the aggressor, Derevyanchenko quickly fired back to the body, appearing to hurt Golovkin as he backed up and kept his elbows tucked in close to his body to protect his mid-section Derevyanchenko took advantage of Golovkin's defensive posture, landing several clean punches to the former champion's head Towards the end of the round Golovkin had some success with a couple of sharp hooks to the head and a right uppercut Golovkin was the aggressor for the majority of the fourth round, having partial success, with Derevyanchenko picking his moments to fire back with two and three punch combinations and continuing to work the body In the last minute of the round, Derevyanchenko appeared to momentarily trouble Golovkin with a straight-left hand to the body At the beginning of the fifth round, the ringside doctor gave the cut above Derevyanchenko's right-eye a close examination before the action resumed Derevyanchenko controlled the pace of the round with a high punch-output, continuing with three and four punch combinations with lateral movement Golovkin, meanwhile, stuck with single hooks and probing jabs, landing a solid uppercut halfway through the round In the final 20 seconds, Derevyanchenko landed another body shot which again appeared to hurt Golovkin, who reeled backwards with his elbows down at his side, protecting his body The sixth was an evenly fought round with both fighters landing several clean punches to the head, although Golovkin appeared to land the more significant blows which caught the attention of the crowd Rounds seven, eight and nine were much of the same, back and forth engagements with Golovkin seeming to land the more eye catching blows The tenth saw Derevyanchenko apply the pressure and back Golovkin up for the first half of the round Golovkin had success in the last minute with left and right hooks landing on Derevyanchenko's head, only to see the Ukrainian answer with his own solid shots and back Golovkin up once again in the final 30 seconds of the round The eleventh and twelfth were closely contested, both fighters having success, with Golovkin again appearing to land the more catching punches in the twelfth and final round After twelve

The election saw a runoff between Gustavo Petro, a member of the Historic Pact for Colombia coalition, and Rodolfo Hernández Suárez, a member of the Independent Movement of Action. Petro won the runoff, becoming the first left-wing candidate to be elected president of Colombia since the country's independence in 1810.\n\n**Background**\n\nDuring the previous election held in 2018, a run-off took place as no candidate attained 50% of the vote. The top two candidates were senator Iván Duque of the Democratic Center party and Humane Colombia nominee Gustavo Petro, a former mayor of Bogotá and a former AD/M-19 member. The election's issues included the FARC peace agreement, corruption, unemployment, and healthcare. Duque defeated Petro by over ten percentage points; however, there were subsequent allegations of fraud and irregularities. As the runner-up, Petro became a senator per the Legislative Act No 2 of 2015.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nColombian presidents are elected for four-year terms using a two-round system; if no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the first round, a runoff is held between the top two candidates. The vice president is elected on the same ticket as the president. Presidents are limited to a single four-year term and Article 191 of the constitution requires candidates to be Colombian by birth and at least thirty years old. In line with the constitution, Colombian citizens by birth or by naturalization, aged eighteen or older have the right to vote. Several scenarios can cause the loss of the right to vote, as outlined in the constitution. Citizens in detention centers can vote from the establishments determined by the National Civil Registry. The civil registry inscription is not automatic, and citizens must go to the regional office of the registry to register. Legislative Act No 2 of 2015 established that the runner-up in the presidential elections is given a seat in the Senate and their vice president candidate becomes a member of the Chamber of Representatives.\n\n**Primaries and party conventions**\n\nThe Historic Pact for Colombia (Spanish: Pacto Histórico por Colombia) is a coalition of left-wing, progressive, and Indigenous politicians. Five pre-candidates representing six political parties or movements announced that they would be standing for election as the unified presidential candidate for the coalition. The candidate was chosen by public vote on 13 March 2022. The Hope Center Coalition (Spanish: Coalición Centro Esperanza), formerly known as the Coalition of Hope (Spanish: Coalición de la Esperanza) until 28 November 2021, is a coalition of centre and centre-left politicians. Five pre-candidates announced that they would be standing for election as the unified presidential candidate for the coalition. The candidate was chosen by public vote on 13 March 2022. The Team for Colombia Coalition (Spanish: Coalición Equipo por Colombia) is a coalition of centre-right and right-wing politicians. Five pre-candidates announced that they would be standing for election as the unified presidential candidate for the coalition. The candidate was chosen by public vote on 13 March 2022.\n\n**Other candidates**\n\nThe following candidates registered with the National Registrar of Civil Status and appeared on the ballot of the first round. This list also displays the most recent political office held by each candidate.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nGustavo Petro, the economist, former guerrilla, and former mayor of Bogotá, promised that he would retire from politics should his campaign for the presidency be unsuccessful. Petro said he would do so as he did not want to be an \"eternal candidate\". His campaign, Gwynne Dyer wrote, \"Petro is a known quantity, active in politics for the past thirty years. He's not really radical, but he would be Colombia's first-ever president from the left, so for some Colombians his policies would seem extreme: things like expanding social programs, ending oil and gas exploration, and investing in agriculture.\" Petro tried to win over more of the middle class during his campaign, which led him to moderate his economic program and his criticism of the private sector, while trying to distance himself from Venezuela, which he previously supported; he maintained his position of re-establishing bilateral relations with the government of Nicolás Maduro.\n\n**Debates**\n\nFourteen debates were scheduled between the candidates before the election. The debates were broadcast on television and online.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nThe polls revealed both generational and professional cleavages. Voters were more likely to vote for Petro the younger they were. The majority of employees, unemployed, and students were planning to vote for Petro, while the majority of the self-employed, housewives, and pensioners were planning to vote for Hernandez. The wealthier voters were, the more likely they were to vote for Hernandez.\n\n**First round**\n\nHernández called Petro to congratulate him on his victory. He also encouraged Petro to remain committed to the \"anti-corruption discourse\". Hernández and Marelen Castillo also thanked Colombians that voted for them. Castillo announced shortly after the election that she would accept a seat in the chamber of representatives reserved for the second-place vice presidential candidate. She also encouraged Hernández to take a senate seat, although he was still to decide. On 23 June, Hernández announced that he would become a senator. President Iván Duque called Petro to congratulate him; he also pledged to carry out a smooth transition.\n\n**Second round**\n\nHernández called Petro to congratulate him on his victory. He also encouraged Petro to remain committed to the \"anti-corruption discourse\". Hernández and Marelen Castillo also thanked Colombians that voted for them. Castillo announced shortly after the election that she would accept a seat in the chamber of representatives reserved for the second-place vice presidential candidate. She also encouraged Hernández to take a senate seat, although he was still to decide. On 23 June, Hernández announced that he would become a senator. President Iván Duque called Petro to congratulate him; he also pledged to carry out a smooth transition.\n\n**Results**\n\nShortly after the first round, the process of judicial scrutiny commenced. The process found an increase of 0.1% votes, reportedly the lowest in Colombian history and slightly altered the final results for the initial round. As none of the presidential nominees obtained at least 50% of the votes, a runoff was held on 19 June 2022, between the top two candidates, Gustavo Petro and Rodolfo Hernández Suárez. Petro won the runoff, becoming the first left-wing candidate to be elected president of Colombia since the country's independence in 1810. The results for the second round saw the lowest record of blank votes in over 20 years. Furthermore, turnout for the run-off was 58.17%, the highest since 1998.\n\n**International state reactions**\n\nPeruvian writer, politician, and Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa declared \" [Colombians] voted wrong, let's see how Petro acts.\" Ron DeSantis, the Republican Governor of Florida, denounced Petro as a \"former narco-terrorist and a Marxist\" whose victory is going to be \"disastrous\" for Colombia. In the United Kingdom, former Leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, praised Petro's victory as proof of the \"power of community organizing to build a popular policy platform to heal the divisions of the past and bring about social justice\".\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe election marked a significant shift in Colombian politics, with Petro's victory representing a major defeat for the right-wing and centrist parties that had dominated the country's politics for decades. The election also marked a significant increase in voter turnout, with over 18 million people casting ballots in the first round and over 20 million in the runoff. The election was also notable for its high level of violence, with several candidates and their supporters being targeted by paramilitary groups and other extremist organizations.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Colombian presidential election, 2018\n* Colombian presidential election, 2014\n* Colombian presidential election, 2010\n\n**References**\n\nThis article includes a list of references, but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Colombian_presidential_election\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nDuring the previous election held in 2018, a run-off took place as no candidate attained 50% of the vote The top two candidates were senator Iván Duque of the Democratic Center party and Humane Colombia nominee Gustavo Petro, a former mayor of Bogotá and a former AD/M-19 member [18] The election's issues included the FARC peace agreement, corruption, unemployment, and healthcare [19] Duque defeated Petro by over ten percentage points;

the Boy Scouts of America [12] and its Silver Buffalo Award in 2006 Living in Winnetka, his family attended a Congregational church [13] From 1943 to 1945, Rumsfeld lived in Coronado, California,

administration\nRumsfeld resigned from Congress in 1969 – his fourth term – to serve in the Nixon administration in a variety of executive branch positions Nixon appointed Rumsfeld director of the United States Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), a position with Cabinet rank Rumsfeld had voted against the creation of OEO when he was in Congress, [38] and, according to his 2011 memoirs, he initially rejected Nixon's offer, citing his own inherent belief that the OEO did more harm than good, and he felt that he was not the right person for the job [39]: 119–121  After much negotiation, he accepted the OEO appointment with Nixon's \"assurances that he would be .. also an assistant to the President, with Cabinet-level status and an office in the White House,\" [38] which \"sweetened (the OEO position) with status and responsibility\" [40]\nAs director, Rumsfeld sought to reorganize the Office to serve what he later described in his 2011 memoir as \"a laboratory for experimental programs\" [39]: 125  Several beneficial anti-poverty programs were saved by allocating funds to them from other less-successful government programs During this time, he hired Frank Carlucci [41] and Dick Cheney [42] [43] to serve under him.\n\nFord administration\nIn August 1974, after Nixon resigned as president in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, Rumsfeld was called back to Washington to

to succeed Schlesinger as the 13th U.S Secretary of Defense and George H W Bush to become Director of Central Intelligence According to Bob Woodward's 2002 book Bush at War, a rivalry developed between the two men and \"Bush senior was convinced that Rumsfeld was pushing him out to the CIA to end his political career.\" [54]\n\n\nSALT II Treaty\nDuring his tenure as Secretary of Defense, Rumsfeld worked to finish the SALT II Treaty [16] Rumsfeld, together with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General George S Brown drafted the treaty [16] However, an agreement was not made before the 1976 election SALT II was finished and signed during the Carter administration [59] [16]\n\n\nReturn to the private sector (1977–2000)\nIn early 1977 Rumsfeld briefly lectured at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School and Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management His sights instead turned to business, and from 1977 to 1985 Rumsfeld served as chief executive officer, president, and then chairman of G D Searle & Company, a worldwide pharmaceutical company based in Skokie, Illinois During his tenure at Searle, Rumsfeld led the company's financial turnaround, thereby earning awards as the Outstanding Chief Executive Officer in the Pharmaceutical Industry from the Wall Street Transcript (1980) and Financial World (1981) Journalist Andrew Cockburn of Harper's Magazine claimed that Rumsfeld suppressed news that Searle's key product, aspartame, was shown to have potentially dangerous effects by leveraging old government contacts at the Food and Drug Administration [61] In 1985, Searle was sold to the Monsanto Company [62]\n\n\nBusiness career\nIn early 1977 Rumsfeld briefly lectured at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School and Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management His

Wall Street Transcript (1980) and Financial World (1981) Journalist Andrew Cockburn of Harper's Magazine claimed that Rumsfeld suppressed news that Searle's key product, aspartame, was shown to have potentially dangerous effects by leveraging old government contacts at the Food and Drug Administration [61] In 1985, Searle was sold to the Monsanto Company [62]\n\n\nPart-time public service\nDuring his business career, Rumsfeld continued part-time public service in various posts In November 1983, Rumsfeld was appointed special envoy to the Middle East by President Ronald Reagan, [69] at a turbulent time in modern Middle Eastern history when Iraq was fighting Iran in the Iran–Iraq War The United States wished for Iraq to win the conflict, and Rumsfeld was sent to the Middle East to serve as a mediator on behalf of the president.\n\n\nPresidential and vice-presidential aspirations\nDuring the 1976 Republican National Convention, Rumsfeld received one vote for Vice President of the United States, although he did not seek the office, and the nomination was easily won by Ford's choice, Senator Bob Dole [76] During the 1980 Republican National Convention he again received one vote for vice president [77]\n\n\nSecretary of Defense (2001–2006)\nRumsfeld was named Secretary of Defense soon after President George W Bush took office in 2001 despite Rumsfeld's past rivalry with the previous President Bush Bush's first choice, FedEx founder Fred Smith, was unavailable and Vice President-elect Cheney recommended Rumsfeld for the job [80] Rumsfeld's second tenure as Secretary of Defense cemented him as the most powerful Pentagon chief since Robert McNamara and one of the most influential Cabinet members in the Bush administration [81] His tenure proved to be a pivotal and rocky one that led the United States military into the 21st century Following the September 11 attacks, Rumsfeld led the military planning and execution of the 2001 United States invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent 2003 invasion of Iraq He pushed hard to send as small a force as soon as possible to both conflicts, a concept codified as the Rumsfeld Doctrine [82]\n\n\nSeptember 11, 2001 attacks\nOn September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked commercial airliners and crashed them in coordinated strikes into both towers of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, New York City, and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C The fourth plane crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and its target was likely a prominent building in Washington, D.C., most probably either the U.S Capitol Building or the White House [85] Within three hours of the start of the first hijacking and two hours after American Airlines Flight 11 struck the World Trade Center, Rumsfeld raised the defense condition signaling of the United States offensive readiness to DEFCON 3, the highest it had been since the Arab–Israeli war in 1973 [86]\n\n\nMilitary decisions in the wake of 9/11\nOn the afternoon of September 11, Rumsfeld issued rapid orders to his aides to look for evidence of possible Iraqi involvement in regard to what had just occurred, according to notes taken by senior policy official Stephen Cambone \"Best info fast Judge whether good enough hit S.H.\" – meaning Saddam Hussein – \"at same time Not only UBL\" (Osama bin Laden), Cambone's notes quoted Rumsfeld as saying \"Need to move swiftly – Near term target needs – go massive – sweep it all up Things related and not.\" [88] [89]\n\n\nWar in Afghanistan\nRumsfeld directed the planning for the War in Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks [82] On September 21, 2001, USCENTCOM Commander General Tommy Franks, briefed the President on a plan to destroy al Qaeda in Afghanistan and remove the Taliban government General Franks, also initially proposed to Rumsfeld that the U.S invade Afghanistan using a conventional force of 60,000 troops, preceded by six months of preparation Rumsfeld, however feared that a conventional invasion of Afghanistan could bog down as had happened to the Soviets in the Soviet–Afghan War and the 1842 retreat from Kabul by the British [96] Rumsfeld rejected Franks's plan, saying \"I want men on the ground now!\" Franks returned the next day with a plan utilizing U.S Special Forces [97] [82] Despite air and missile attacks against al Qaeda in Afghanistan, USCENTCOM had no pre-existing plans for conducting ground operations there [82]\n\n\nIraq War\nBefore and during the Iraq War, Rumsfeld claimed that Iraq had an active weapons of mass destruction program; in particular during his famous phrase \"there are known knowns\" in a press conference at the Pentagon on February 12, 2002, [113]\nno stockpiles were ever found [4] [5] Bush administration officials also claimed that there was an operational relationship between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein A Pentagon Inspector General report found that Rumsfeld's top policy aide, Douglas J Feith, \"developed, produced, and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al-Qaeda relationship, which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community, to senior decision-makers\" [6]\n\n\nPrisoner abuse and torture concerns\nThe Department of Defense's preliminary concerns for holding, housing, and interrogating captured prisoners on the battlefield were raised during the military build-up prior to the Iraq War Because Saddam Hussein's military forces surrendered when faced with military action, many within the DOD, including Rumsfeld and United States Central Command General Tommy Franks, decided it was in the best interest of all to hand these prisoners over to their respective countries Additionally, it was determined that maintaining a large holding facility was, at the time, unrealistic Instead, the use of many facilities such as Abu Ghraib to house prisoners of interest prior to handing them over, and Rumsfeld defended the Bush administration's decision to detain enemy combatants Because of this, critics, including members of the U.S Senate Armed Services Committee, held Rumsfeld responsible for the ensuing Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal Rumsfeld himself said: \"These events occurred on my watch as Secretary of Defense I am accountable for them.\" [138] He offered his resignation to President Bush in the wake of the scandal, but it was not accepted [139]\n\n\nResignation\nEight U.S and other NATO-member retired generals and admirals called for Rumsfeld to resign in early 2006 in what was called the \"Generals Revolt\", accusing him of \"abysmal\" military planning and lack of strategic competence [152] [153] [154]\n\n\nRetirement and later life (2006–2021)\nIn the months after his resignation, Rumsfeld toured the New York City publishing houses in preparation for a potential memoir [164] After receiving what one industry source labeled \"big bids\", [165] he reached an agreement with the Penguin Group to publish the book under its Sentinel HC imprint [166] Rumsfeld declined to accept an advance for the publication of his memoir, and said he was donating all proceeds from the work to veterans groups [167] His book, entitled Known and Unknown: A Memoir, was released on February 8, 2011 [168]\n\n\nDeath\nOn June 29, 2021, Rumsfeld died from multiple myeloma at his home in Taos, New Mexico [184] [185] Following a private funeral at Fort Myer, he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery on August 24, 2021 [186] [187]\n\n\nElectoral history\nDuring the four elections during which he ran to represent Illinois's 13th congressional district, Rumsfeld received shares of the popular vote that ranged from 58% (in 1964) to 76% (in 1966) In 1975 and 2001, Rumsfeld was overwhelmingly confirmed by the U.S Senate after presidents Gerald Ford and George W Bush, respectively, appointed him as U.S Secretary of Defense.\n\n\nAwards\nRumsfeld was awarded 11 honorary degrees [189] Following his years as CEO, president, and later chairman of G D Searle & Company, he was recognized as Outstanding CEO in the pharmaceutical industry by The Wall Street Transcript (1980) and Financial World (1981) [190]\n\n\nHonours\nSecretary of State Henry Kissinger described Rumsfeld as \"the most ruthless man\" he knew [202] George Packer of The Atlantic named Rumsfeld \"the worst secretary of defense in American history\" who \"lacked the wisdom to change his mind.\" [203] Bradley Graham, a Washington Post reporter and author of the book titled By His Own Rules: The Ambitions, Successes, and Ultimate Failures of Donald Rumsfeld released on June 23, 2009, stated \"Rumsfeld left office as one of the most controversial Defense Secretaries since Robert McNamara and widely criticized for his management of the Iraq war and for his difficult relationships with Congress, administration colleagues, and military officers.\" [204] Neoconservative commentator Bill Kristol was also critical of Rumsfeld, stating he \"breezily dodged responsibility\" for planning mistakes made in the Iraq War, including insufficient troop levels [205] In Jon Meacham's book Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush, published in November 2015, the 41st president George H.W Bush was critical of Rumsfeld and called Rumsfeld \"an arrogant fellow\" and \"I think he served the president badly,\" and \"I don't like what he did, and I think it hurt the president having his iron-ass view of everything.\" [206]\n\n\nLegacy and

politician and government official who served as the United States Secretary of Defense from 1975 to 1977 and again from 2001 to 2006. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1963 to 1969, representing Illinois's 13th congressional district.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nDonald Henry Rumsfeld was born on July 9, 1932, in Chicago, Illinois, to Jeannette Kearsley (née Husted) and George Donald Rumsfeld. His father came from a German family that had emigrated in the 1870s from Weyhe in Lower Saxony. Rumsfeld grew up in Winnetka, Illinois, where he became an Eagle Scout in 1949. He was the recipient of both the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America and its Silver Buffalo Award in 2006. Rumsfeld's family attended a Congregational church, and he was raised in a conservative household.\n\n**Naval Service**\n\nRumsfeld served in the United States Navy from 1954 to 1957, as a naval aviator and flight instructor. His initial training was in the North American SNJ Texan basic trainer, after which he transitioned to the T-28 advanced trainer. In 1957, he transferred to the Naval Reserve and continued his naval service in flying and administrative assignments as a drilling reservist. Rumsfeld was designated aircraft commander of Anti-submarine Squadron 731 on October 1, 1960, at Naval Air Station Grosse Ile, Michigan, where he flew the S2F Tracker. He transferred to the Individual Ready Reserve when he became Secretary of Defense in 1975 and retired with the rank of captain in 1989.\n\n**Career in Government (1962-1975)**\n\nIn 1957, during the Dwight D Eisenhower administration, Rumsfeld served as administrative assistant to David S Dennison Jr., a Congressman representing the 11th district of Ohio. In 1959, he moved on to become a staff assistant to Congressman Robert P Griffin of Michigan. Engaging in a two-year stint with an investment banking firm, A G Becker & Co., from 1960 to 1962, Rumsfeld then set his sights on becoming a member of Congress.\n\n**Member of Congress**\n\nIn 1957, during the Dwight D Eisenhower administration, Rumsfeld served as administrative assistant to David S Dennison Jr., a Congressman representing the 11th district of Ohio.

Engaging in a two-year stint with an investment banking firm, A G Becker & Co., from 1960 to 1962, Rumsfeld then set his sights on becoming a member of Congress.\n\n**Nixon Administration**\n\nRumsfeld resigned from Congress in 1969, his fourth term, to serve in the Nixon administration in a variety of executive branch positions. Nixon appointed Rumsfeld director of the United States Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), a position with Cabinet rank. Rumsfeld had voted against the creation of OEO when he was in Congress, and, according to his 2011 memoirs, he initially rejected Nixon's offer, citing his own inherent belief that the OEO did more harm than good, and he felt that he was not the right person for the job. After much negotiation, he accepted the OEO appointment with Nixon's \"assurances that he would be...also an assistant to the President, with Cabinet-level status and an office in the White House,\" which \"sweetened (the OEO position) with status and responsibility.\" As director, Rumsfeld sought to reorganize the Office to serve what he later described in his 2011 memoir as \"a laboratory for experimental programs.\" Several beneficial anti-poverty programs were saved by allocating funds to them from other less-successful government programs. During this time, he hired Frank Carlucci and Dick Cheney to serve under him.\n\n**Ford Administration**\n\nIn August 1974, after Nixon resigned as president in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, Rumsfeld was called back to Washington to serve as the transition chairman for the new president, Gerald Ford. He had been Ford's confidante since their days in the House, before Ford was House minority leader and was one of the members of the \"Young Turks\" who played a major role in bringing Ford to Republican leadership in the House of Representatives. As the new president became settled in, Ford appointed Rumsfeld White House Chief of Staff, following Ford's appointment of General Alexander Haig to be the new Supreme Allied Commander Europe. Rumsfeld served from 1974 to 1975.\n\n**Secretary of Defense (1975-1977)**\n\nIn October 1975, Ford reshuffled his cabinet in the Halloween Massacre. Various newspaper and magazine articles at the time identified Rumsfeld as having orchestrated these events. Ford named Rumsfeld to succeed Schlesinger as the 13th U.S Secretary of Defense and George H W Bush to become Director of Central Intelligence. According to Bob Woodward's 2002 book Bush at War, a rivalry developed between the two men and \"Bush senior was convinced that Rumsfeld was pushing him out to the CIA to end his political career.\"\n\n**Return to the Private Sector (1977-2000)**\n\nIn early 1977, Rumsfeld briefly lectured at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School and Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management. His sights instead turned to business, and from 1977 to 1985, Rumsfeld served as chief executive officer, president, and then chairman of G D Searle & Company, a worldwide pharmaceutical company based in Skokie, Illinois. During his tenure at Searle, Rumsfeld led the company's financial turnaround, thereby earning awards as the Outstanding Chief Executive Officer in the Pharmaceutical Industry from The Wall Street Transcript (1980) and Financial World (1981). Journalist Andrew Cockburn of Harper's Magazine claimed that Rumsfeld suppressed news that Searle's key product, aspartame, was shown to have potentially dangerous effects by leveraging old government contacts at the Food and Drug Administration. In 1985, Searle was sold to the Monsanto Company.\n\n**Secretary of Defense (2001-2006)**\n\nRumsfeld was named Secretary of Defense soon after President George W Bush took office in 2001, despite Rumsfeld's past rivalry with the previous President Bush. Bush's first choice, FedEx founder Fred Smith, was unavailable, and Vice President-elect Cheney recommended Rumsfeld for the job. Rumsfeld's second tenure as Secretary of Defense cemented him as the most powerful Pentagon chief since Robert McNamara and one of the most influential Cabinet members in the Bush administration. His tenure proved to be a pivotal and rocky one that led the United States military into the 21st century.

He pushed hard to send as small a force as soon as possible to both conflicts, a concept codified as the Rumsfeld Doctrine.\n\n**Legacy and Reputation**\n\nRumsfeld's legacy is complex and highly debated. Some view him as a visionary and a strong leader who helped shape the modern military into a more agile and effective force. Others see him as a reckless and arrogant individual who ignored warnings and intelligence to pursue his own ideological agenda. His tenure as Secretary of Defense was marked by controversy, including the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal, the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and the mismanagement of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Despite these criticisms, Rumsfeld remains a highly influential figure in American politics and a symbol of the Bush administration's foreign policy.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style

retired generals and admirals called for Rumsfeld to resign in early 2006 in what was called the \"Generals Revolt\", accusing him of \"abysmal\" military planning and lack of strategic competence [152] [153] [154]\n\n\nRetirement and later life (2006–2021)\nIn the months after his resignation, Rumsfeld toured the New York City publishing houses in preparation for a potential memoir [164] After receiving what one industry source labeled \"big bids\", [165] he reached an agreement with the Penguin Group to publish the book under its Sentinel HC imprint [166] Rumsfeld declined to accept an advance for the publication of his memoir, and said he was donating all proceeds from the work to veterans groups [167] His book, entitled Known and Unknown: A Memoir, was released on February 8, 2011 [168]\n\n\nDeath\nOn June 29, 2021, Rumsfeld died from multiple myeloma at his home in Taos, New Mexico [184] [185] Following a private funeral at Fort Myer, he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery on August 24, 2021 [186] [187]\n\n\nElectoral history\nDuring the four elections during which he ran to represent Illinois's 13th congressional district, Rumsfeld received shares of the popular vote that ranged from 58% (in 1964) to 76% (in 1966) In 1975 and 2001, Rumsfeld was overwhelmingly confirmed by the U.S Senate after presidents Gerald Ford and George W Bush, respectively, appointed him as U.S Secretary of Defense.\n\n\nAwards\nRumsfeld was awarded 11 honorary degrees [189] Following his years as CEO, president, and later chairman of G D Searle & Company, he was recognized as Outstanding CEO in the pharmaceutical industry by The Wall Street Transcript (1980) and Financial World (1981) [190]\n\n\nHonours\nSecretary of State Henry Kissinger described Rumsfeld as \"the most ruthless man\" he knew [202] George Packer of The Atlantic named Rumsfeld \"the worst secretary of defense in American history\" who \"lacked the wisdom to change his mind.\" [203] Bradley Graham, a Washington Post reporter and author of the book titled By His Own Rules: The Ambitions, Successes, and Ultimate Failures of Donald Rumsfeld released on June 23, 2009, stated \"Rumsfeld left office as one of the most controversial Defense Secretaries since Robert McNamara and widely criticized for his management of the Iraq war and for his difficult relationships with Congress, administration colleagues, and military officers.\" [204] Neoconservative commentator Bill Kristol was also critical of Rumsfeld, stating he \"breezily dodged responsibility\" for planning mistakes made in the Iraq War, including insufficient troop levels [205] In Jon Meacham's book Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush, published in November 2015, the 41st president George H.W Bush was critical of Rumsfeld and called Rumsfeld \"an arrogant fellow\" and \"I think he served the president badly,\" and \"I don't like what he did, and I think it hurt the president having his iron-ass view of everything.\" [206]\n\n\nLegacy and reputation\nSecretary of State Henry Kissinger described Rumsfeld as \"the most ruthless man\" he knew [202] George Packer

The book received widespread critical acclaim for its thought-provoking and terrifying narrative, which explores themes of family, trauma, and the unknown.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story revolves around Andrew and Eric, a forty-year-old couple and the adoptive parents of their seven-year-old daughter Wen. They leave their home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, behind to spend a vacation in a secluded cabin in New Hampshire. The isolation of the cabin serves as a catalyst for the events that unfold.\n\nUpon arriving at the cabin, Wen is approached by a large, mysterious man named Leonard, who claims to be sad about what he has to do. He informs Wen and her parents that they need their help to save the world. Wen is initially fascinated by Leonard's enigmatic nature, and the three spend time together catching grasshoppers. However, when three other people show up, armed with makeshift weapons, Wen becomes increasingly suspicious.\n\nAs the tension escalates, Wen flees to warn Andrew and Eric, who are initially skeptical of Leonard's intentions. As the situation becomes more dire, the family is forced to confront the possibility that Leonard's claims may be true, and that they may be trapped in a desperate bid to save humanity from an apocalyptic fate.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe Cabin at the End of the World received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. Reviewers praised the novel for its thought-provoking and terrifying narrative, which explores themes of family, trauma, and the unknown. Author Stephen King wrote that the novel was \"thought-provoking and terrifying,\" while Andrew Liptak of The Verge noted that the book was \"grimly reflective of the times that we live in.\"\n\nThe novel's exploration of themes such as family dynamics, trauma, and the unknown resonated with many readers. The book's use of psychological tension and suspenseful storytelling also received praise from critics, who noted that the novel was a masterclass in building tension and creating a sense of unease in the reader.\n\n**Film Adaptation**\n\nA film adaptation of The Cabin at the End of the World, titled Knock at the Cabin, was released in 2023. The film was written, directed, and produced by M. Night Shyamalan, and stars Dave Bautista, Jonathan Groff, Ben Aldridge, Nikki Amuka-Bird, and Rupert Grint.\n\nThe film adaptation took creative liberties with the source material, while maintaining the core elements of the novel's plot. The film's script was rewritten by M. Night Shyamalan, who brought his unique vision to the project. The film was released by Universal Pictures on February 3, 2023, to generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n**Themes and Symbolism**\n\nThe Cabin at the End of the World explores a range of themes, including family dynamics, trauma, and the unknown. The novel's use of a mysterious figure, Leonard, serves as a catalyst for the events that unfold, and his enigmatic nature raises questions about the nature of reality and the unknown.\n\nThe novel also explores themes of trauma and its impact on individuals and families. The character of Wen, the seven-year-old daughter, is particularly vulnerable to the trauma that unfolds, and her experiences serve as a powerful exploration of the long-term effects of trauma on children.\n\nThe cabin itself serves as a symbol of isolation and confinement, highlighting the characters' feelings of being trapped and powerless. The cabin's remote location serves as a metaphor for the characters' emotional state, and the novel's use of the cabin as a setting creates a sense of claustrophobia and unease.\n\n**Style and Structure**\n\nThe Cabin at the End of the World is written in a style that is both lyrical and suspenseful. Tremblay's use of language is evocative and atmospheric, creating a sense of unease and tension in the reader. The novel's structure is non-linear, jumping back and forth in time to create a sense of confusion and disorientation.\n\nThe novel's use of multiple perspectives adds to the sense of complexity and depth, allowing the reader to experience the story from multiple angles. The novel's use of psychological tension and suspenseful storytelling creates a sense of unease and tension in the reader, making it difficult to put the book down.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Cabin at the End of the World is a thought-provoking and terrifying novel that explores themes of family, trauma, and the unknown. The novel's use of a mysterious figure, Leonard, serves as a catalyst for the events that unfold, and his enigmatic nature raises questions about the nature of reality and the unknown.\n\nThe novel's exploration of themes such as family dynamics, trauma, and the unknown resonated with many readers. The book's use of psychological tension and suspenseful storytelling also received praise from critics, who noted that the novel was a masterclass in building tension and creating a sense of unease in the reader.\n\nThe film adaptation, Knock at the Cabin, brought the novel's story to life in a new and exciting way, using the same themes and ideas to create a unique and suspenseful film. Overall, The Cabin at the End of the World is a must-read for fans of horror and suspense fiction, and its exploration of themes and ideas continues to resonate with readers and viewers alike.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Cabin_at_the_End_of_the_World\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nForty-year-old couple Andrew and Eric and their adopted seven-year-old daughter Wen leave their home in Cambridge, Massachusetts behind to spend a vacation in a secluded cabin in New Hampshire Wen is approached by a large, mysterious man named Leonard, who says he is sad about what he has to do and that he needs Wen and her parents' help to save the world The two spend time together catching grasshoppers, but Wen becomes suspicious when three other people show up with odd, makeshift weapons Wen flees to warn Andrew and Eric.\n\n\nReception\nThe Cabin at the End of the World received \"Rave\" reviews according to the book review aggregator Book Marks based on eleven independent reviews [3] Author Stephen King wrote that the novel was \"thought-provoking and terrifying\" [4] Andrew Liptak of The Verge wrote, \"Good horror stories look at the world around us to draw inspiration as to what could go wrong, and with this book, Tremblay has penned a story that's not only a nightmare as it plays out on the page, but one that's grimly reflective of the times that we live in.\" [5]\n\n\nFilm adaptation\nKnock at the Cabin is an adaptation of The Cabin at the End of the World It was written, directed, and produced by M Night Shyamalan, and stars Dave Bautista, [6] Jonathan Groff, Ben Aldridge, [7] Nikki Amuka-Bird, and Rupert Grint [8] FilmNation Entertainment signed an option with Tremblay in late 2017, prior to the book's publication Steve Desmond and Michael Sherman wrote the initial draft, and their script was rewritten by Shyamalan [9] [10] The film was released by Universal Pictures on February 3, 2023 [11]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

[22] [23] [24] [25] Norval went by the moniker \"Captain\", despite only having been a private in the British Army [26] At the time of his marriage to Cedella Malcolm, an Afro-Jamaican then 18 years old, Norval was supervising a subdivision of land for war veteran housing, and he was about 64 years old at the time of Bob Marley's birth [24] [26] [27] Norval, who provided little financial support for his wife and child and rarely saw them, [24] died when Marley was 10 years old [28]\n\n\nCareer\nIn February 1962, Marley recorded four songs, \"Judge Not\", \"One Cup of Coffee\", \"Do You Still

Records\nIn 1972, Bob Marley signed with CBS Records in London and embarked on a UK tour with soul singer Johnny Nash [53] While in London the Wailers asked their road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to Chris Blackwell, who had licensed some of their Coxsone releases for his Island Records The Wailers intended to discuss the royalties associated with these releases; instead, the meeting resulted in the offer of an advance of £4,000 to record an album [54] Since Jimmy Cliff, Island's top reggae star, had recently left the label, Blackwell was primed for a replacement In Marley, Blackwell recognised the elements needed to snare the rock audience: \"I was dealing with rock music, which was really rebel music I felt that would really be the way to break Jamaican music But you needed someone who could be that image When Bob walked in he really was that image.\" [55] The Wailers returned to Jamaica to record at Harry J's in Kingston, which resulted in the album Catch

Tracks such as \"Zimbabwe\", \"Africa Unite\", \"Wake Up and Live\" and \"Survival\" reflected Marley's support for the struggles of Africans His appearance at the Amandla Festival in Boston in July 1979 showed his strong opposition to South African apartheid, which he already had shown in his song \"War\" in 1976.\n\n\nPersonal life\nMarley was a longtime member of the Rastafari movement, whose

retention of 769,000 on the coast.\" [42] In the 1890s, slavery was abolished [43]\n\n\nModern\nBritish rule came to an end on 9 December 1961 Elizabeth II, who had acceded to the British throne in 1952, continued to reign through the first year of Tanganyika's independence, but now distinctly as Queen of Tanganyika, represented by the governor general [56]: page 6  Tanganyika also joined the British Commonwealth in 1961 [15] On 9 December 1962, Tanganyika became a democratic republic under an executive president [56]: page 6 \n\n\nGeography\nAt 947,403 square kilometres (365,794 sq mi), [4] Tanzania is the 13th largest country in Africa and the 31st largest in the world, ranked between the larger Egypt and smaller Nigeria [74] It borders Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; and Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south Tanzania is located on the eastern coast of Africa and has an Indian Ocean coastline approximately 1,424 kilometres (885 mi) long [75] It also incorporates several offshore islands, including Unguja (Zanzibar), Pemba, and Mafia [76]: page 1245  The country is the site of Africa's highest and lowest points: Mount Kilimanjaro, at 5,895 metres (19,341 ft) above sea level, and the floor of Lake Tanganyika, at 1,471 metres (4,826 ft) below sea level, respectively [76]: page 1245 \n\n\nClimate\nClimate varies greatly within Tanzania In the highlands, temperatures range between 10 and 20 °C (50 and 68 °F) during cold and hot seasons respectively The rest of the country has temperatures rarely falling lower than 20 °C (68 °F) The hottest period extends between November and February (25–31 °C or 77.0–87.8 °F) while the coldest period occurs between May and August (15–20 °C or 59–68 °F) Annual temperature is 20 °C (68.0 °F) The climate is cool in high mountainous regions.\n\n\nWildlife and conservation\nTanzania contains around 20% of the species of Africa's enormous warm-blooded animal populace, found over its 21 National parks, reserves, 1 conservation area, and 3 marine parks Spread over a zone of in excess of 42,000 square kilometres (16,000 sq mi) and shaping around 38% of the nation's area [82] Tanzania has 21 national parks, [83] plus a variety of game and forest reserves, including the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, however the local human population still has an impact on the environment In western Tanzania, Gombe Stream National Park is the site of Jane Goodall's ongoing study of chimpanzee behaviour, which started in 1960 [84] [85]\n\n\nPolitics\nTanzania is a one-party dominant state with the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party in power From its formation until 1992, it was the only legally permitted party in the country This changed on 1 July 1992, when the constitution was amended [91]: § 3  It has held power since independence in 1961, and is the longest-serving ruling party in Africa [70]\n\n\nGovernment\nTanzania is a one-party dominant state with the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party in power From its formation until 1992, it was the only legally permitted party in the country This changed on 1 July 1992, when the constitution was amended [91]: § 3  It has held power since independence in 1961, and is the longest-serving ruling party in Africa [70]\n\n\nExecutive\nThe president of Tanzania and the members of the National Assembly are elected concurrently by direct popular vote for five-year terms [91]: § 42(2)  The vice-president is elected for a five-year term at the same time as the president and on the same ticket [91]: §§ 47(2), 50(1)  Neither the president nor the vice-president may be a member of the National Assembly [91]: § 66(2)  The president appoints a prime minister from among the members of the National Assembly, subject to confirmation by the assembly, to serve as the government's leader in the assembly [91]: §§ 51(1)-(2), 52(2)  The president selects her cabinet from assembly members [91]: § 55  Law enforcement in Tanzania is under the executive branch of government and is administered by the Tanzania Police Force [97]\n\n\nLegislature\nAll legislative power relating to mainland Tanzania and union matters is vested in the National Assembly, [91]: § 64(1)  which is unicameral and has 393 members [98] These include members elected to represent constituencies, the attorney general, five members elected by the Zanzibar house of representatives from among its own members, the special women's seats that constitute at least 30% of the seats that any party has in the assembly, the speaker of the assembly (if not otherwise a member of the assembly), and the persons (not more than ten) appointed by the president [91]: § 66(1)  The Tanzania Electoral Commission demarcates the mainland into constituencies in the number determined by the commission with the consent of the president [91]: § 75 \n\n\nJudiciary\nTanzania's legal system is based on English common law [99]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nPublic safety and border control is the responsibility of the Tanzania Police Force Oversight of the force is shared by the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Police and the Inspector-General of Police [105]\n\n\nZanzibar\nThe legislative authority in Zanzibar over all non-union matters is vested in the House of Representatives (per the Tanzania constitution) [91]: § 106(3)  or the Legislative Council (per the Zanzibar constitution).\n\n\nLeadership in World governance initiatives\nTanzania has been one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution [108] [109] As a result, in 1968, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth [110] Julius Nyerere, then president of Tanzania signed the agreement to convene a World Constituent Assembly [111]\n\n\nAdministrative subdivisions\nIn 1972, local government on the mainland was abolished and replaced with direct rule from the central government Local government, however, was reintroduced in the beginning of the 1980s, when the rural councils and rural authorities were re-established Local government elections took place in 1983, and functioning councils started in 1984 In 1999, a Local Government Reform Programme was enacted by the National Assembly, setting \"a comprehensive and ambitious agenda ..  [covering] four areas: political decentralization, financial decentralization, administrative decentralization and changed central-local relations, with the mainland government having overriding powers within the framework of the Constitution.\" [112]\n\n\nForeign policies and partnerships\nForeign policies of Tanzania are in process of review to replace the current New Foreign Policy of 2001, which was the first official foreign policy of Tanzania [119] [120] Before 2001, Tanzanian foreign policy was dictated by the various presidential declarations of Mwalimu Nyerere specifically Circular No 2 of 1964, [121] Arusha Declaration, [122] and Policy of Foreign Affairs of 1967 [123] These declarations had focused foreign policy primarily on independence and sovereignty, human rights, and African unity [124] [125] The current New Foreign Policy of 2001 was established to better address the end of colonialism and the cold war, globalization, market economics and liberalization, and the multi-party state of Tanzania Its primary focus is economic diplomacy and development [126]\n\n\nInternational partnerships\nTanzania is a member of many international organizations such as the United Nations (UN), African Union (AU), East African Community (EAC), and Southern African Development Community (SADC) among many others [128] Additionally, due to the strength of Tanzania's non-alignment, unity and internal peace since independence, Tanzania frequently acts as a mediator and location of treaties and agreements between other nations, such as the Arusha Agreement with Europe, as well as the Arusha Accords with Rwanda (1993) and Burundi (2000) [129] [130]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF) (Kiswahili: Jeshi la Wananchi wa Tanzania (JWTZ)) is the armed forces of Tanzania, operating as a people's force under civilian control It is composed of five branches or commands: Land Force (army), Air Force, Naval Command, National Service, Headquarter (MMJ) [143] Tanzanian citizens are able to volunteer for military service from 15 years of age, and 18 years of age for compulsory National military service upon graduation from advanced secondary school Conscript service obligation was 2 years as of 2004 [needs update]\n\n\nHuman rights\nThroughout Tanzania, same sex acts are illegal and carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment [145] According to a 2007 Pew Research Centre survey, 95 percent of Tanzanians believed that homosexuality should not be accepted by society [146]\n\n\nEconomy and infrastructure\nAs of 2021 [update], according to the IMF, Tanzania's gross domestic product (GDP) was an estimated $71 billion (nominal), or $218.5 billion on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis GDP per capita (PPP) was $3,574 [150]\n\n\nHunger and poverty\nThe Global Hunger Index previously ranked the situation as \"alarming\" with a score of 42 in the year 2000; since then the GHI has declined to 23.2 [159] Children in rural areas suffer substantially higher rates of malnutrition and chronic hunger, although urban-rural disparities have narrowed as regards both stunting and underweight [160] Low rural sector productivity arises mainly from inadequate infrastructure investment; limited access to farm inputs, extension services and credit; limited technology as well as trade and marketing support; and heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources [160]\n\n\nAgriculture\nThe Tanzanian economy is heavily based on agriculture, which in 2013 accounted for 24.5 per cent of gross domestic product, [56]: page 37  provides 85% of exports, [14] and accounted for half of the employed workforce [56]: page 56  The agricultural sector grew 4.3 percent in 2012, less than half of the Millennium Development Goal target of 10.8% [164] 16.4 per cent of the land is arable, [165] with 2.4 percent of the land planted with permanent crops [166] Tanzania's economy relies on farming, but climate change has impacted their farming.\n\n\nIndustry, energy and construction\nIndustry and construction is a major and growing component of the Tanzanian economy, contributing 22.2 per cent of GDP in 2013 [56]: page 37  This component includes mining and quarrying, manufacturing, electricity and natural gas, water supply, and construction [56]: page 37  Mining contributed 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2013 [56]: page 33  The vast majority of the country's mineral export revenue comes from gold, accounting for 89 per cent of the value of those exports in 2013 [56]: page 71  It also exports sizeable quantities of gemstones, including diamonds and tanzanite [76]: page 1251  All of Tanzania's coal production, which totalled 106,000 short tons in 2012, is used domestically [168]\n\n\nTourism\nTravel and tourism contributed 17.5 per cent of Tanzania's gross domestic product in 2016 [183] and employed 11.0 per cent of the country's labour force (1,189,300 jobs) in 2013 [184] Overall receipts rose from US$1.74 billion in 2004 to US$4.48 billion in 2013, [184] and receipts from international tourists rose from US$1.255 billion in 2010 to US$2 billion in 2016 [183] [185] In 2016, 1,284,279 tourists arrived at Tanzania's borders compared to 590,000 in 2005 [152] The vast majority of tourists visit Zanzibar or a \"northern circuit\" of Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tarangire National Park, Lake Manyara National Park, and Mount Kilimanjaro [76]: page 1252  In 2013, the most visited national park was Serengeti (452,485 tourists), followed by Manyara (187,773) and Tarangire (165,949) [56]: page xx \n\n\nBanking\nThe Bank of Tanzania is the central bank of Tanzania and is primarily responsible for maintaining price stability, with a subsidiary responsibility for issuing the banknotes and coins of the Tanzanian shilling [186] At the end of 2013, the total assets of the Tanzanian banking industry were TSh 19.5 trillion, a 15 per cent increase over 2012 [187]\n\n\nTransport\nMost transport in Tanzania is by road, with road transport constituting over 75 per cent of the country's freight traffic and 80 percent of its passenger traffic [76]: page 1252  The Cairo-Cape Town Highway passes through Tanzania The 181,191 kilometres (112,587 mi) road system is in generally poor condition [76]: page 1252  Tanzania has two railway companies: TAZARA, which provides service between Dar es Salaam and Kapiri Mposhi (in a copper-mining district in Zambia), and Tanzania Railways Limited, which connects Dar es Salaam with central and northern Tanzania [76]: page 1252  Rail travel in Tanzania often entails slow journeys with frequent cancellations or delays, and the railways have a deficient safety record [76]: page 1252 \n\n\nCommunications\nIn 2013, the communications sector was the fastest growing in Tanzania, expanding 22.8 per cent; however, the sector accounted for only 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product that year [172]: page 2 \n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nWater supply and sanitation in Tanzania has been characterised by decreasing access to improved water sources in the 2000s (especially in urban areas), steady access to some form of sanitation (around 93 per cent since the 1990s), intermittent water supplies, and generally low quality of service [189] Many utilities are barely able to cover their operation and maintenance costs through revenues because of low tariffs and poor efficiency There are significant regional differences, with the best performing utilities being Arusha, Moshi, and Tanga [190]\n\n\nEconomic statistics controversy\nTwo articles in the Economist in July 2020 raised doubts about official claims of economic growth: \"If Tanzania's economy grew by almost 7% in the fiscal year to the end of June 2019, why did tax revenue fall by 1%? And why has bank lending to companies slumped? Private data are bad, too In 2019 sales at the biggest brewer fell by 5% Sales of cement by the two biggest producers were almost flat None of these things is likely if growth is storming ahead The discrepancies are so large that it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the government is lying.\" [193] [194]\n\n\nFood and nutrition\nPoor nutrition remains a persistent problem within Tanzania and varies hugely throughout the country's regions USAID reports that 16% of children are underweight and 34% experience stunted growth as a result of malnutrition [196] 10 regions house 58% of children suffering from stunted growth while 50% of acutely malnourished children can be found in 5 regions [197] Over a 5-year period, the Mara district of Tanzania saw a 15% reduction in stunting in children under 5 years old, falling from 46% to 31% in 2005 and 2010 respectively Dodoma, on the other hand, saw a 7% increase in the prevalence of stunting in this age group, rising from 50% in 2005 to 57% in 2010 [198] Overall availability of food does not necessarily contribute to overall stunting figures Iringa, Mbeya and Rukwa regions, where overall availability of food is considered acceptable, still experience stunting incidents in excess of 50% In some areas where food shortages are common, such as in the Tabora and Singida regions, stunting instances remain comparatively less than those seen in Iringa, Mbeya and Rukwa [198] The Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre attributes these discrepancies to variance in maternal malnutrition, poor infant feeding practices, hygiene practices and poor healthcare services [198] Periods of drought can have significant impacts on the production of crops in Tanzania Drought in East Africa has resulted in massive increases in the prices of food staples such as maize and sorghum, crops crucial to the nutrition of the majority of Tanzania's population From 2015 to 2017 the price of maize when bought wholesale more than tripled, from TSh 400/= per kilogramme to 1,253/= per kilogramme [199]\n\n\nProgrammes targeting hunger\nUSAID programmes focusing on nutrition operate within the Morogoro, Dodoma, Iringa, Mbeya, Manyara, Songwe and Zanzibar regions of Tanzania These \"Feed the Future\" programmes heavily invest in nutrition, infrastructure, policy, capacity of institutions and agriculture which is identified by the organisation as a key area of economic growth in the country [196] A Tanzanian government led initiative \"Kilimo Kwanza\" or \"Agriculture First\" aims to encourage investment into agriculture within the private sector and hopes to improve agricultural processes and development within the country by seeking the knowledge of young people and the innovation that they can potentially provide [202] During the 1990s, around 25% of Tanzania's population were provided access to iodised oil aimed to target iodine deficiency within expecting mothers, as result of studies showing the negative effects of in-utero iodine deficiency on cognitive development in children Research showed that children of mothers with access to the supplement achieved on average greater than a third of a year more education than those who did not [202]\n\n\nScience and technology\nTanzania's first \"National Science and Technology Policy\" was adopted in 1996 The objective of the government's \"Vision 2025\" (1998) document was to \"transform the economy into a strong, resilient and competitive one, buttressed by science and technology\".\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2012 census, the total population of Tanzania was 44,928,923 [211] The under-15 age group represented 44.1% of the population [212]\n\n\nReligion\nOfficial statistics on religion are unavailable because religious surveys were eliminated from government census reports after 1967 [228] Tanzania's religious field is dominated by Christianity, Islam and African traditional religions connected to ethnic customs The word for religion in Swahili, dini, generally apply to the world religions of Christianity and Islam meaning that followers of traditional African religions are considered to be of \"no religion\" Religious belonging is often ambiguous, with some people adhering to multiple religious identities at the same time (for instance being Christian but also following African traditional rituals) something which suggests that religious boundaries are flexible and contextual [229]\n\n\nLanguages\nMore than 100 languages are spoken in Tanzania, making it the most linguistically diverse country in East Africa [22] Among the languages spoken are four of Africa's language families: Bantu, Cushitic, Nilotic, and Khoisan [22] There are no de jure official languages in Tanzania [25]\n\n\nEducation and Libraries\nIn 2015, the literacy rate in Tanzania was 77.9% for people aged 15 and over (83.2% males, 73.1% females) [247] Education is compulsory until children reach age 15 [248] In 2020, 97% completed primary (98.4% females and 95.5% males), 28.3% completed secondary (30% females and 27% males), and 8% completed tertiary education (7% females and 8.5% males) [249]\n\n\nHealthcare\nAs of 2012 [update], life expectancy at birth was 61 years [252] The under-five mortality rate in 2012 was 54 per 1,000 live births [252] The maternal mortality rate in 2013 was estimated at 410 per 100,000 live births [252] Prematurity and malaria were tied in 2010 as the leading cause of death in children under five years old [253] The other leading causes of death for these children were, in decreasing order, malaria, diarrhoea, HIV, and measles [253]\n\n\nWomen\nWomen and men have equality before the law [256]\nThe government signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1985 [256]\nNearly 3 out of ten women reported having experienced sexual violence before the age of 18.\n [256] The prevalence of female genital mutilation has decreased [256]\nSchool girls are reinstated back to school after delivery [256]\nThe Police Force administration strives to separate the Gender Desks from normal police operations to enhance confidentiality of the processing of women victims of abuse [256]\nMost of the abuses and violence against women and children occurs at the family level [256]\nThe Constitution of Tanzania requires that women constitute at least 30% of all elected members of National Assembly [256] The gender differences in education and training have implications later in life of these women and girls [256]\nUnemployment is higher for females than for males [256] The right of a female employee to maternity leave is guaranteed in labour law [256]\n\n\nCulture\nAs in other countries, the music in Tanzania is constantly undergoing changes, and varies by location, people, settings and occasion The five music genres in Tanzania, as defined by BASATA are, ngoma, dansi, kwaya, and taarab, with bongo flava being added in 2001 [257] [258] Singeli has since the mid-2000s been an unofficial music of uswahilini, unplanned communities in Dar es Salaam, and is the newest mainstream genre since 2020 [259]\n\n\nMedia\nAs in other countries, the music

bongo flava being added in 2001 [257] [258] Singeli has since the mid-2000s been an unofficial music of uswahilini, unplanned communities in Dar es Salaam, and is the newest mainstream genre since 2020 [259]\n\n\nMusic\nAs in other countries, the music in Tanzania is constantly undergoing changes, and varies by location, people, settings and occasion The five music genres in Tanzania, as

in Dar es Salaam, and is the newest mainstream genre since 2020 [259]\n\n\nNational anthem\nThe Tanzanian national anthem is \"Mungu Ibariki Africa\" (God Bless Africa) It has kiswahili lyrics adapted for \"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\" composed by South African composer Enoch Sontonga in 1897 [273] \"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\" became a pan-African song adapted into the current national anthems for Tanzania, Zambia, and following the end of apartheid South Africa [274] It was previously used in the national anthems for Zimbabwe and Namibia, but has since been replaced by original new anthems Another patriotic song is Tanzania, Tanzania.\n\n\nLiterature\nTanzania's literary culture is primarily oral [217]: page 68  Major oral literary forms include folktales, poems, riddles, proverbs, and songs [217]: page 69  The greatest part of Tanzania's recorded oral literature is in Swahili, even though each of the country's languages has its own oral tradition [217]: pages 68–69  The country's oral literature has been declining because of the breakdown of the multigenerational social structure, making transmission of oral literature more difficult, and because increasing modernisation has been accompanied by the devaluation of oral literature [217]: page 69 \n\n\nPainting and sculpture\nTwo Tanzanian art styles have achieved international recognition [275]: p 17  The Tingatinga school of painting, founded by Edward Said Tingatinga, consists of brightly coloured enamel paintings on canvas, generally depicting people, animals, or daily life [217]: p 113  [275]: p 17  After Tingatinga's death in 1972, other artists adopted and developed his style, with the genre now being the most important tourist-oriented style in East Africa [217]: p 113  [275]: p 17 \n\n\nSports\nFootball is very popular throughout the country [276] The most popular professional football clubs in Dar es Salaam are the Young Africans F.C and Simba S.C [277] The Tanzania Football Federation is the governing body for football in the country.\n\n\nCinema\nTanzania has a popular film industry known as \"Bongo Movie\" [280] It also hosts an international film festival, the Zanzibar International Film Festival.\n\n\nSee also\n6°S 35°E﻿ / ﻿6°S 35°E﻿ / -6; 35\n\n\nNotes\n6°S 35°E﻿ / ﻿6°S 35°E﻿ / -6; 35\n\n\nReferences\n6°S 35°E﻿ / ﻿6°S 35°E﻿ / -6; 35\n\n\nSources\n6°S

culture, and breathtaking natural beauty. The country is named after the two states that unified to create it: Tanganyika and Zanzibar. The name \"Tanzania\" was created as a clipped compound of the names of the two states, with \"Tan\" and \"Zan\" derived from the first three letters of each state's name, and the suffix \"-ia\" added to signify a country.\n\n# History\n\nTanzania is one of the oldest continuously inhabited areas on Earth, with fossil remains of humans and hominids dating back to the Quaternary era. The Olduvai Gorge, located in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that features a collection of remnants of tools that document the development and use of transitional technology.\n\n## Ancient Period\n\nTanzania's history dates back to the ancient period, with Bantu-speakers building farming and trade villages along the Tanzanian coast from the first millennium. Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the north-west coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century CE at the latest. The site features daub, shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag, indicating the presence of a thriving community.\n\n## Medieval Period\n\nTrade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century, and by the close of the 10th century, Zanzibar was one of the central Swahili trading towns. The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period. Zanzibar became the centre for the east African slave trade, with between 65 and 90 per cent of the Arab-Swahili population being enslaved.\n\n## Colonial Period\n\nIn 1840, Omani Sultan Said bin Sultan moved his capital to Zanzibar City, and the country became a protectorate of Britain. British rule came to an end on 9 December 1961, when Tanganyika gained independence. The country became a democratic republic under an executive president on 9 December 1962.\n\n# Geography\n\nTanzania is the 13th largest country in Africa and the 31st largest in the world, covering an area of 947,403 square kilometres. The country is located on the eastern coast of Africa and has an Indian Ocean coastline of approximately 1,424 kilometres. Tanzania borders Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; and Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south.\n\n## Climate\n\nClimate varies greatly within Tanzania, with temperatures ranging between 10 and 20°C (50 and 68°F) in the highlands. The rest of the country has temperatures rarely falling lower than 20°C (68°F). The hottest period extends between November and February, while the coldest period occurs between May and August.\n\n## Wildlife and Conservation\n\nTanzania contains around 20% of the species of Africa's enormous warm-blooded animal population, found over its 21 national parks, reserves, 1 conservation area, and 3 marine parks. The country has 21 national parks, plus a variety of game and forest reserves, including the Ngorongoro Conservation Area.\n\n# Politics\n\nTanzania is a one-party dominant state with the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party in power since its formation until 1992, when the constitution was amended to allow for the existence of multiple parties. The president and the members of the National Assembly are elected concurrently by direct popular vote for five-year terms.\n\n## Executive\n\nThe president of Tanzania and the members of the National Assembly are elected concurrently by direct popular vote for five-year terms. The vice-president is elected for a five-year term at the same time as the president and on the same ticket.\n\n## Legislature\n\nAll legislative power relating to mainland Tanzania and union matters is vested in the National Assembly, which is unicameral and has 393 members. These include members elected to represent constituencies, the attorney general, five members elected by the Zanzibar house of representatives from among its own members, the special women's seats that constitute at least 30% of the seats that any party has in the assembly, and the persons (not more than ten) appointed by the president.\n\n## Judiciary\n\nTanzania's legal system is based on English common law.\n\n# Economy\n\nThe Tanzanian economy is heavily based on agriculture, which in 2013 accounted for 24.5 per cent of gross domestic product. The agricultural sector grew 4.3 percent in 2012, less than half of the Millennium Development Goal target of 10.8%. Industry and construction is a major and growing component of the Tanzanian economy, contributing 22.2 per cent of GDP in 2013.\n\n## Agriculture\n\nThe Tanzanian economy relies on farming, but climate change has impacted their farming. The country's economy is expected to continue growing, driven by a combination of factors including a growing population, increasing investment in infrastructure, and a favorable business environment.\n\n## Industry, Energy and Construction\n\nIndustry and construction is a major and growing component of the Tanzanian economy, contributing 22.2 per cent of GDP in 2013.

Tanzania was created as a clipped compound of the names of the two states that unified to create the country: Tanganyika and Zanzibar [29] It consists of the first three letters of the names of the two states (\"Tan\" and \"Zan\") and the suffix \"-ia.\"\n\n\nHistory\nTanzania is one of the oldest continuously inhabited areas on Earth Traces of fossil remains of humans and hominids date back to the Quaternary era The Olduvai Gorge, in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, features a collection with remnants of tools that document the development and use of transitional technology.\n\n\nAncient\nTanzania is one of the oldest continuously inhabited areas on Earth Traces of fossil remains of humans and hominids date back to the Quaternary era The Olduvai Gorge, in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, features a collection with remnants of tools that document the development and use of transitional technology.\n\n\nMedieval\nBantu-speakers built farming and trade villages along the Tanzanian coast from the outset of the first millennium Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the north-west coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century CE at the latest The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site There is evidence for limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicate a unified group of communities that developed into the first centre of coastal maritime culture The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century and by the close of the 10th century Zanzibar was one of the central Swahili trading towns [37]\n\n\nColonial\nClaiming the coastal strip, Omani Sultan Said bin Sultan moved his capital to Zanzibar City in 1840 During this time, Zanzibar became the centre for the east African slave trade [39] Between 65 and 90 per cent of the Arab-Swahili population of Zanzibar was enslaved [40] One of the most infamous slave traders on the East African coast was Tippu Tip, who was the grandson of an enslaved African The Nyamwezi slave traders operated under the leadership of Msiri and Mirambo [41] According to Timothy Insoll, \"Figures record the exporting of 718,000 slaves from the Swahili coast during the 19th century, and the retention of 769,000 on the coast.\" [42] In the 1890s, slavery was abolished [43]\n\n\nModern\nBritish rule came to an end on 9 December 1961 Elizabeth II, who had acceded to the British throne in 1952, continued to reign through the first year of Tanganyika's independence, but now distinctly as Queen of Tanganyika, represented by the governor general [56]: page 6  Tanganyika also joined the British Commonwealth in 1961 [15] On 9 December 1962, Tanganyika became a democratic republic under an executive president [56]: page 6 \n\n\nGeography\nAt 947,403 square kilometres (365,794 sq mi), [4] Tanzania is the 13th largest country in Africa and the 31st largest in the world, ranked between the larger Egypt and smaller Nigeria [74] It borders Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; and Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south Tanzania is located on the eastern coast of Africa and has an Indian Ocean coastline approximately 1,424 kilometres (885 mi) long [75] It also incorporates several offshore islands, including Unguja (Zanzibar), Pemba, and Mafia [76]: page 1245  The country is the site of Africa's highest and lowest points: Mount Kilimanjaro, at 5,895 metres (19,341 ft) above sea level, and the floor of Lake Tanganyika, at 1,471 metres (4,826 ft) below sea level, respectively [76]: page 1245 \n\n\nClimate\nClimate varies greatly within Tanzania In the highlands, temperatures range between 10 and 20 °C (50 and 68 °F) during cold and hot seasons respectively The rest of the country has temperatures rarely falling lower than 20 °C (68 °F) The hottest period extends between November and February (25–31 °C or 77.0–87.8 °F) while the coldest period occurs between May and August (15–20 °C or 59–68 °F) Annual temperature is 20 °C (68.0 °F) The climate is cool in high mountainous regions.\n\n\nWildlife and conservation\nTanzania contains around 20% of the species of Africa's enormous warm-blooded animal populace, found over its 21 National parks, reserves, 1 conservation area, and 3 marine parks Spread over a zone of in excess of 42,000 square kilometres (16,000 sq mi) and shaping around 38% of the nation's area [82] Tanzania has 21 national parks, [83] plus a variety of game and forest reserves, including the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, however the local human population still has an impact on the environment In western Tanzania, Gombe Stream National Park is the site of Jane Goodall's ongoing study of chimpanzee behaviour, which started in 1960 [84] [85]\n\n\nPolitics\nTanzania is a one-party dominant state with the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party in power From its formation until 1992, it was the only legally permitted party in the country This changed on 1 July 1992, when the constitution was amended [91]: § 3  It has held power since independence in 1961, and is the longest-serving ruling party in Africa [70]\n\n\nGovernment\nTanzania is a one-party dominant state with the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party in power From its formation until 1992, it was the only legally permitted party in the country This changed on 1 July 1992, when the constitution was amended [91]: § 3  It has held power since independence in 1961, and is the longest-serving ruling party in Africa [70]\n\n\nExecutive\nThe president of Tanzania and the members of the National Assembly are elected concurrently by direct popular vote for five-year terms [91]: § 42(2)  The vice-president is elected for a five-year term at the same time as the president and on the same ticket [91]: §§ 47(2), 50(1)  Neither the president nor the vice-president may be a member of the National Assembly [91]: § 66(2)  The president appoints a prime minister from among the members of the National Assembly, subject to confirmation by the assembly, to serve as the government's leader in the assembly [91]: §§ 51(1)-(2), 52(2)  The president selects her cabinet from assembly members [91]: § 55  Law enforcement in Tanzania is under the executive branch of government and is administered by the Tanzania Police Force [97]\n\n\nLegislature\nAll legislative power relating to mainland Tanzania and union matters is vested in the National Assembly, [91]: § 64(1)  which is unicameral and has 393 members [98] These include members elected to represent constituencies, the attorney general, five members elected by the Zanzibar house of representatives from among its own members, the special women's seats that constitute at least 30% of the seats that any party has in the assembly, the speaker of the assembly (if not otherwise a member of the assembly), and the persons (not more than ten) appointed by the president [91]: § 66(1)  The Tanzania Electoral Commission demarcates the mainland into constituencies in the number determined by the commission with the consent of the president [91]: § 75 \n\n\nJudiciary\nTanzania's legal system is based on English common law [99]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nPublic safety and border control is the responsibility of the Tanzania Police Force Oversight of the force is shared by the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Police and the Inspector-General of Police [105]\n\n\nZanzibar\nThe legislative authority in Zanzibar over all non-union matters is vested in the House of Representatives (per the Tanzania constitution) [91]: § 106(3)  or the Legislative Council (per the Zanzibar constitution).\n\n\nLeadership in World governance initiatives\nTanzania has been one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution [108] [109] As a result, in 1968, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth [110] Julius Nyerere, then president of Tanzania signed the agreement to convene a World Constituent Assembly [111]\n\n\nAdministrative subdivisions\nIn 1972, local government on the mainland was abolished and replaced with direct rule from the central government Local government, however, was reintroduced in the beginning of the 1980s, when the rural councils and rural authorities were re-established Local government elections took place in 1983, and functioning councils started in 1984 In 1999, a Local Government Reform Programme was enacted by the National Assembly, setting \"a comprehensive and ambitious agenda ..  [covering] four areas: political decentralization, financial decentralization, administrative decentralization and changed central-local relations, with the mainland government having overriding powers within the framework of the Constitution.\" [112]\n\n\nForeign policies and partnerships\nForeign policies of Tanzania are in process of review to replace the current New Foreign Policy of 2001, which was the first official foreign policy of Tanzania [119] [120] Before 2001, Tanzanian foreign policy was dictated by the various presidential declarations of Mwalimu Nyerere specifically Circular No 2 of 1964, [121] Arusha Declaration, [122] and Policy of Foreign Affairs of 1967 [123] These declarations had focused foreign policy primarily on independence and sovereignty, human rights, and African unity [124] [125] The current New Foreign Policy of 2001 was established to better address the end of colonialism and the cold war, globalization, market economics and liberalization, and the multi-party state of Tanzania Its primary focus is economic diplomacy and development [126]\n\n\nInternational partnerships\nTanzania is a member of many international organizations such as the United Nations (UN), African Union (AU), East African Community (EAC), and Southern African Development Community (SADC) among many others [128] Additionally, due to the strength of Tanzania's non-alignment, unity and internal peace since independence, Tanzania frequently acts as a mediator and location of treaties and agreements between other nations, such as the Arusha Agreement with Europe, as well as the Arusha Accords with Rwanda (1993) and Burundi (2000) [129] [130]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF) (Kiswahili: Jeshi la Wananchi wa Tanzania (JWTZ)) is the armed forces of Tanzania, operating as a people's force under civilian control It is composed of five branches or commands: Land Force (army), Air Force, Naval Command, National Service, Headquarter (MMJ) [143] Tanzanian citizens are able to volunteer for military service from 15 years of age, and 18 years of age for compulsory National military service upon graduation from advanced secondary school Conscript service obligation was 2 years as of 2004 [needs update]\n\n\nHuman rights\nThroughout Tanzania, same sex acts are illegal and carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment [145] According to a 2007 Pew Research Centre survey, 95 percent of Tanzanians believed that homosexuality should not be accepted by society [146]\n\n\nEconomy and infrastructure\nAs of 2021 [update], according to the IMF, Tanzania's gross domestic product (GDP) was an estimated $71 billion (nominal), or $218.5 billion on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis GDP per capita (PPP) was $3,574 [150]\n\n\nHunger and poverty\nThe Global Hunger Index previously ranked the situation as \"alarming\" with a score of 42 in the year 2000; since then the GHI has declined to 23.2 [159] Children in rural areas suffer substantially higher rates of malnutrition and chronic hunger, although urban-rural disparities have narrowed as regards both stunting and underweight [160] Low rural sector productivity arises mainly from inadequate infrastructure investment; limited access to farm inputs, extension services and credit; limited technology as well as trade and marketing support; and heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources [160]\n\n\nAgriculture\nThe Tanzanian economy is heavily based on agriculture, which in 2013 accounted for 24.5 per cent of gross domestic product, [56]: page 37  provides 85% of exports, [14] and accounted for half of the employed workforce [56]: page 56  The agricultural sector grew 4.3 percent in 2012, less than half of the Millennium Development Goal target of 10.8% [164] 16.4 per cent of the land is arable, [165] with 2.4 percent of the land planted with permanent crops [166] Tanzania's economy relies on farming, but climate change has impacted their farming.\n\n\nIndustry, energy and construction\nIndustry and construction is a major and growing component of the Tanzanian economy, contributing 22.2 per cent of GDP in 2013 [56]: page 37  This component includes mining and quarrying, manufacturing, electricity and natural gas, water supply, and construction [56]: page 37  Mining contributed 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2013 [56]: page 33  The vast majority of the country's mineral export revenue comes from gold, accounting for 89 per cent of the value of those exports in 2013 [56]: page 71  It also exports sizeable quantities of gemstones, including diamonds and tanzanite [76]: page 1251  All of Tanzania's coal production, which totalled 106,000 short tons in 2012, is used domestically [168]\n\n\nTourism\nTravel and tourism contributed 17.5 per cent of Tanzania's gross domestic product in 2016 [183] and employed 11.0 per cent of the country's labour force (1,189,300 jobs) in 2013 [184] Overall receipts rose from US$1.74 billion in 2004 to US$4.48 billion in 2013, [184] and receipts from international tourists rose from US$1.255 billion in 2010 to US$2 billion in 2016 [183] [185] In 2016, 1,284,279 tourists arrived at Tanzania's borders compared to 590,000 in 2005 [152] The vast majority of tourists visit Zanzibar or a \"northern circuit\" of Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tarangire National Park, Lake Manyara National Park, and Mount Kilimanjaro [76]: page 1252  In 2013, the most visited national park was Serengeti (452,485 tourists), followed by Manyara (187,773) and Tarangire (165,949) [56]: page xx \n\n\nBanking\nThe Bank of Tanzania is the central bank of Tanzania and is primarily responsible for maintaining price stability, with a subsidiary responsibility for issuing the banknotes and coins of the Tanzanian shilling [186] At the end of 2013, the total assets of the Tanzanian banking industry were TSh 19.5 trillion, a 15 per cent increase over 2012 [187]\n\n\nTransport\nMost transport in Tanzania is by road, with road transport constituting over 75 per cent of the country's freight traffic and 80 percent of its passenger traffic [76]: page 1252  The Cairo-Cape Town Highway passes through Tanzania The 181,191 kilometres (112,587 mi) road system is in generally poor condition [76]: page 1252  Tanzania has two railway companies: TAZARA, which provides service between Dar es Salaam and Kapiri Mposhi (in a copper-mining district in Zambia), and Tanzania Railways Limited, which connects Dar es Salaam with central and northern Tanzania [76]: page 1252  Rail travel in Tanzania often entails slow journeys with frequent cancellations or delays, and the railways have a deficient safety record [76]: page 1252 \n\n\nCommunications\nIn 2013, the communications sector was the fastest growing in Tanzania, expanding 22.8 per cent; however, the sector accounted for only 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product that year [172]: page 2 \n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nWater supply and sanitation in Tanzania has been characterised by decreasing access to improved water sources in the 2000s (especially in urban areas), steady access to some form of sanitation (around 93 per cent since the 1990s), intermittent water supplies, and generally low quality of service [189] Many utilities are barely able to cover their operation and maintenance costs through revenues because of low tariffs and poor efficiency There are significant regional differences, with the best performing utilities being Arusha, Moshi, and Tanga [190]\n\n\nEconomic statistics controversy\nTwo articles in the Economist in July 2020 raised doubts about official claims of economic growth: \"If Tanzania's economy grew by almost 7% in the fiscal year to the end of June 2019, why did tax revenue fall by 1%? And why has bank lending to companies slumped? Private data are bad, too In 2019 sales at the biggest brewer fell by 5% Sales of cement by the two biggest producers were almost flat None of these things is likely if growth is storming ahead The discrepancies are so large that it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the government is lying.\" [193] [194]\n\n\nFood and nutrition\nPoor nutrition remains a persistent problem within Tanzania and varies hugely throughout the country's regions USAID reports that 16% of children are underweight and 34% experience stunted growth as a result of malnutrition [196] 10 regions house 58% of children suffering from stunted growth while 50% of acutely malnourished children can be found in 5 regions [197] Over a 5-year period, the Mara district of Tanzania saw a 15% reduction in stunting in children under 5 years old, falling from 46% to 31% in 2005 and 2010 respectively Dodoma, on the other hand, saw a 7% increase in the prevalence of stunting in this age group, rising from 50% in 2005 to 57% in 2010 [198] Overall availability of food does not necessarily contribute to overall stunting figures Iringa, Mbeya and Rukwa regions, where overall availability of food is considered acceptable, still experience stunting incidents in excess of 50% In some areas where food shortages are common, such as in the Tabora and Singida regions, stunting instances remain comparatively less than those seen in Iringa, Mbeya and Rukwa [198] The Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre attributes these discrepancies to variance in maternal malnutrition, poor infant feeding practices, hygiene practices and poor healthcare services [198] Periods of drought can have significant impacts on the production of crops in Tanzania Drought in East Africa has resulted in massive increases in the prices of food staples such as maize and sorghum, crops crucial to the nutrition of the majority of Tanzania's population From 2015 to 2017 the price of maize when bought wholesale more than tripled, from TSh 400/= per kilogramme to 1,253/= per kilogramme [199]\n\n\nProgrammes targeting hunger\nUSAID programmes focusing on nutrition operate within the Morogoro, Dodoma, Iringa, Mbeya, Manyara, Songwe and Zanzibar regions of Tanzania These \"Feed the Future\" programmes heavily invest in nutrition, infrastructure, policy, capacity of institutions and agriculture which is identified by the organisation as a key area of economic growth in the country [196] A Tanzanian government led initiative \"Kilimo Kwanza\" or \"Agriculture First\" aims to encourage investment into agriculture within the private sector and hopes to improve agricultural processes and development within the country by seeking the knowledge of young people and the innovation that they can potentially provide [202] During the 1990s, around 25% of Tanzania's population were provided access to iodised oil aimed to target iodine deficiency within expecting mothers, as result of studies showing the negative effects of in-utero iodine deficiency on cognitive development in children Research showed that children of mothers with access to the supplement achieved on average greater than a third of a year more education than those who did not [202]\n\n\nScience and technology\nTanzania's first \"National Science and Technology Policy\" was adopted in 1996 The objective of the government's \"Vision 2025\" (1998) document was to \"transform the economy into a strong, resilient and competitive one, buttressed by science and technology\".\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2012 census, the total population of Tanzania was 44,928,923 [211] The under-15 age group represented 44.1% of the population [212]\n\n\nReligion\nOfficial statistics on religion are unavailable because religious surveys were eliminated from government census reports after 1967 [228] Tanzania's religious field is dominated by Christianity, Islam and African traditional religions connected to ethnic customs The word for religion in Swahili, dini, generally apply to the world religions of Christianity and Islam meaning that followers of traditional African religions are considered to be of \"no religion\" Religious belonging is often ambiguous, with some people adhering to multiple religious identities at the same time (for instance being Christian but also following African traditional rituals) something which suggests that religious boundaries are flexible and contextual [229]\n\n\nLanguages\nMore than 100 languages are spoken in Tanzania, making it the most linguistically diverse country in East Africa [22] Among the languages spoken are four of Africa's language families: Bantu, Cushitic, Nilotic, and Khoisan [22] There are no de jure official languages in Tanzania [25]\n\n\nEducation and Libraries\nIn 2015, the literacy rate in Tanzania was 77.9% for people aged 15 and over (83.2% males, 73.1% females) [247] Education is compulsory until children reach age 15 [248] In 2020, 97% completed primary (98.4% females and 95.5% males), 28.3% completed secondary (30% females and 27% males), and 8% completed tertiary education (7% females and 8.5% males) [249]\n\n\nHealthcare\nAs of 2012 [update], life expectancy at birth was 61 years [252] The under-five mortality rate in 2012 was 54 per 1,000 live births [252] The maternal mortality rate in 2013 was estimated at 410 per 100,000 live births [252] Prematurity and malaria were tied in 2010 as the leading cause of death in children under five years old [253] The other leading causes of death for these children were, in decreasing order, malaria, diarrhoea, HIV, and measles [253]\n\n\nWomen\nWomen and men have equality before the law [256]\nThe government signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1985 [256]\nNearly 3 out of ten women reported having experienced sexual violence before the age of 18.\n [256] The prevalence of female genital mutilation has decreased [256]\nSchool girls are reinstated back to school after delivery [256]\nThe Police Force administration strives to separate the Gender Desks from normal police operations to enhance confidentiality of the processing of women victims of abuse [256]\nMost of the abuses and violence against women and children occurs at the family level [256]\nThe Constitution of Tanzania requires that women constitute at least 30% of

It seeks to explain why different political systems have similarities or differences and how developmental changes came to be between them. This subfield is comparative in its approach, examining the variations in political systems across countries and regions, and systematic in its methodology, searching for trends, patterns, and regularities among these systems.\n\n**History of the Field**\n\nThe history of comparative politics dates back to ancient Greece, with philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato making significant contributions to the field. Aristotle's work, \"The Politics,\" is considered one of the earliest comprehensive studies of politics, examining the different forms of government and the role of the state in society. Plato's \"The Republic\" also explored the ideal form of government and the relationship between the individual and the state.\n\nOver time, other thinkers, such as Machiavelli, Montesquieu, Gaetano Mosca, Max Weber, Vilfredo Pareto, and Robert Michels, have contributed to the development of comparative politics. Their works have shaped the field, influencing the way scholars approach the study of politics and government.\n\n**Two Traditions Reaching Back to Aristotle and Plato**\n\nComparative politics can be divided into two main traditions: sociological constitutionalism and legal constitutionalism. Sociological constitutionalism, which originated with Aristotle, focuses on the social and economic structures of a society and how they shape the political system. This approach examines the relationship between the individual and the state, as well as the role of social and economic factors in shaping government.\n\nLegal constitutionalism, which has its roots in Plato's ideas, emphasizes the importance of laws and institutions in shaping the political system. This approach focuses on the formal structures and procedures of government, examining how laws and institutions shape the behavior of government officials and citizens.\n\n**Periodization as a Field of Political Science**\n\nThe development of comparative politics as a field of study in the United States can be divided into several periods. The early period, which spanned from the 1920s to the 1940s, saw the emergence of comparative politics as a distinct subfield of political science. Scholars such as Carl Joachim Friedrich and James Bryce made significant contributions to the field, laying the groundwork for future research.\n\nThe post-World War II period saw a significant expansion of comparative politics, with scholars such as Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba making major contributions to the field. This period also saw the development of new methods and approaches, including the comparative historical analysis and case studies.\n\n**Contemporary Patterns, 2000-Present**\n\nSince the turn of the century, several trends have emerged in comparative politics. One of the most significant trends is the increasing importance of subnational comparative analysis, which involves comparing units within a country rather than across countries. This approach has been influenced by the growing recognition of the importance of subnational governments and institutions in shaping the behavior of national governments.\n\nAnother trend is the increasing focus on the relationship between the state and society, including the role of civil society and non-state actors in shaping government behavior. This approach has been influenced by the growing recognition of the importance of non-state actors in shaping government policy and behavior.\n\n**Substantive Areas of Research**\n\nComparative politics encompasses a wide range of substantive areas of research, including democratization, globalization, integration, and state-society relations. Scholars in the field examine the causes and consequences of these phenomena, seeking to understand how they shape government behavior and the behavior of citizens.\n\nSome of the key topics in comparative politics include the study of presidential and parliamentary systems, democracies and dictatorships, and the role of institutions in shaping government behavior. Scholars also examine the impact of globalization and integration on government behavior and the behavior of citizens.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nComparative politics employs a range of social scientific methods, including experiments, comparative historical analysis, case studies, survey methodology, and ethnography. Scholars choose a methodological approach driven by two concerns: ontological orientation and the type of question or phenomenon of interest.\n\n**Mill's Comparative Method**\n\nMany students of comparative politics have compared units within a country, using the comparative method developed by John Stuart Mill. This approach involves comparing the behavior of government officials and institutions across different units, seeking to identify patterns and regularities.\n\n**Subnational Comparative Analysis**\n\nSubnational comparative analysis involves comparing units within a country, examining the behavior of government officials and institutions across different regions or cities. This approach has been influenced by the growing recognition of the importance of subnational governments and institutions in shaping the behavior of national governments.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Political Science\n* Government\n* Politics\n* Institution\n* Society\n* State\n* Non-State Actors\n* Globalization\n* Integration\n* Democratization\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* Aristotle, \"The Politics\"\n* Plato, \"The Republic\"\n* Machiavelli, \"The Prince\"\n* Montesquieu, \"The Spirit of the Laws\"\n* Gaetano Mosca, \"The Ruling Class\"\n* Max Weber, \"The Theory of Social and Economic Organization\"\n* Vilfredo Pareto, \"The Mind and Society\"\n* Robert Michels, \"Political Parties\"\n* Carl Joachim Friedrich, \"Constitutional Government and Democracy\"\n* James Bryce, \"Modern Democracies\"\n\n**External Links**\n\n* American Political Science Association (APSA)\n* International Political Science Association (IPSA)\n* Comparative Politics Journal\n* Journal of Politics\n* World Politics", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Comparative_politics\" following this outline:\n\n\nDefinition\nComparative politics is the systematic study and comparison of the diverse political systems in the world It is comparative in searching to explain why different political systems have similarities or differences and how developmental changes came to be between them It is systematic in that it looks for trends, patterns, and regularities among these political systems The research field takes into account political systems throughout the globe, focusing on themes such as democratization, globalization, and integration New theories and approaches have been used in political science in the last 40 years thanks to comparative politics Some of these focus on political culture, dependency theory, developmentalism, corporatism, indigenous theories of change, comparative political economy, state-society relations, and new institutionalism [1] Some examples of comparative politics are studying the differences between presidential and parliamentary systems, democracies and dictatorships, parliamentary systems in different countries, multi-party systems such as Canada and two-party systems such as the United States Comparative politics must be conducted at a specific point in time, usually the present A researcher cannot compare systems from different periods of time; it must be static [1]\n\n\nHistory of the field\nHarry H Eckstein traces the history of the field of comparative politics back to Aristotle, and sees a string of thinkers from Machiavelli and Montesquieu, to Gaetano Mosca and Max Weber, Vilfredo Pareto and Robert Michels, on to James Bryce – with his Modern Democracies (1921) – and Carl Joachim Friedrich – with his Constitutional Government and Democracy (1937) – contributing to its history [9]\n\n\nTwo traditions reaching back to Aristotle and Plato\nPhilippe C Schmitter argues that the \"family tree\" of comparative politics has two main traditions: one, invented by Aristotle, that he calls \"sociological constitutionalism\"; a second, that he traced back to Plato, that he calls \"legal constitutionalism\"\" [10]\n\n\nPeriodization as a field of political science\nGerardo L Munck offers the following periodization for the evolution of modern comparative politics, as a field of political science - understood as an academic discipline - in the United States: [12]\n\n\nContemporary patterns, 2000–present\nSince the turn of the century, several trends in the field can be detected [13]\n\n\nSubstantive areas of research\nBy some definitions, comparative politics can be traced back to Greek philosophy, as Plato's Republic and Aristotle's The Politics.\n\n\nMethodology\nWhile the name of the subfield suggests one methodological approach (the comparative method), political scientists in comparative politics use the same diversity of social scientific methods as scientists elsewhere in the field, including experiments, [20] comparative historical analysis, [21] case studies, [22] survey methodology, and ethnography [23] Researchers choose a methodological approach in comparative politics driven by two concerns: ontological orientation [24] and the type of question or phenomenon of interest [25]\n\n\n(Mill's) comparative method\nSince the turn of the century, many students of comparative politics have compared units within a country Relatedly, there has been a growing discussion of what Richard O Snyder calls the \"subnational comparative method.\" [27]\n\n\nSubnational comparative analysis\nSince the turn of the century, many students of comparative politics have compared units within a country Relatedly, there has been a growing discussion of what Richard O Snyder calls the \"subnational comparative method.\" [27]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

closer to the source material [21] [22]\n\n\nCasting\nFor the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, the filmmakers sought an actor who was not excessively tall or handsome, but who had the \"heart and soul\" for the audience to identify with [36] The studio expressed interest in Leonardo DiCaprio, Freddie Prinze Jr., Chris O'Donnell, Jude Law, Chris Klein, Ewan McGregor, Wes Bentley, and Heath Ledger DiCaprio had been considered for the role in 1995 by James Cameron [b] Scott Speedman, Jay Rodan and James Franco were also involved in screen tests for the part [65] [66] Joe Manganiello auditioned, but was cast as the bully Flash instead [67]\n\n\nDesign\nThe Green Goblin's original headgear was an animatronic mask created by Amalgamated Dynamics [90] Dafoe described it as a \"Halloween mask\" and \"kind of silly-looking\" The designers then created a helmet that Dafoe termed \"very angular, very modern .. more like an armor.\" [36] Dafoe also wanted the costume to be flexible enough to allow him to do splits [91]\n\n\nFilming\nWith Spider-Man cast, filming was set to begin in November 2000 in New York City and on Sony soundstages The film's release was scheduled for November 2, 2001, [68] but was postponed to May 3, 2002, due to an extended post-production schedule [95]\n\n\nVisual effects\nJohn Dykstra was hired as the film's visual effects supervisor in May 2000 [114] [115] He convinced Raimi to use computer-generated imagery (CGI) for many of the stunts that were physically impossible Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films [50] Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider-Man swinging from buildings, which he described as, \"ballet in the sky.\" The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned $70 million to around $100 million [69] Shots were made more complicated because of the main characters' individual color schemes, so Spider-Man and the Green Goblin had to be shot separately for effects shots: Spider-Man was shot in front of a greenscreen, while the Goblin was shot against bluescreen Shooting them together would have resulted in one character being erased from a shot [42] [116] [117]\n\n\nMusic\nDanny Elfman composed the musical score for Spider-Man [120] Its soundtrack combines traditional orchestration, ethnic percussion, and electronic elements Its distinct ethnic characteristics are credited to Elfman, who spent a year in Africa studying its unique percussion [citation needed]\n\n\nRelease\nAfter the September 11 attacks occurred in 2001, Sony recalled a Spider-Man teaser poster and a teaser trailer, both of which depicted the World Trade Center towers [121] The poster showed a close-up of Spider-Man's face with the towers reflected in his eyes, while the trailer showed a helicopter getting caught in a giant spider web spun between the towers [h] The trailer, which according to Sony did not contain any actual footage from the film, was also removed from the home video release of A Knight's Tale [i] Raimi later stated that the helicopter scene was originally in the film, but was removed after the attacks [129] A new teaser poster featuring Spider-Man and the Green Goblin was unveiled in November 2001 [130] A month later, a new trailer debuted on television and in theaters [131] An additional trailer was released online and in theaters near the end of March [132]\n\n\nMarketing\nAfter the September 11 attacks occurred in 2001, Sony recalled a Spider-Man teaser poster and a teaser trailer, both of which depicted the World

was rated \"PG-13\" for \"stylized violence and action\" [136] Before the film's British theatrical release in June 2002, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) gave the film a \"12\" certificate Due to Spider-Man's popularity with younger children, this prompted much controversy The BBFC defended its decision, arguing that the film could have been given a \"15\" Despite this, North Norfolk and Breckland District Councils, in East Anglia, changed it to a \"PG\", and Tameside council, Manchester, denoted it a \"PG-12\" In late August, the BBFC relaxed its policy to \"12A\", leading Sony to re-release the film [137] [138]\n\n\nBox office\nSpider-Man was first released in theaters on May 3, 2002 in 18 markets [140] In the United States and Canada, it opened on 7,500 screens at 3,615 theaters and earned $114.8 million during its opening weekend, establishing a new opening weekend record [j] The previous record holder was Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, which earned $90.3 million when it opened in November 2001 [k] Spider-Man also became the first film to gross $100 million in a single weekend (even when adjusting for inflation), and the first film to reach $100 million in three days [145] [146] Additionally, the film set a record for the highest three-day gross [147] According to Rick Lyman of The New York Times, film industry executives expected Spider-Man to have a strong opening Competition from other films was limited, and polls showed strong interest in Raimi's film from every age group However, neither executives nor polling firms predicted that the film's earnings would exceed those of Sorcerer's Stone [141] Upon release, Spider-Man became the number one film at the box office [l]\n\n\nHome media\nSpider-Man was released

"article": "Spider-Man (2002 film)\n\nIntroduction\nThe Spider-Man film franchise, which began in 2002, has become one of the most successful and iconic superhero franchises in cinematic history. The first film, directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire as the titular character, was released on May 3, 2002, and marked the beginning of a new era for the web-slinging hero. This article will provide an in-depth look at the making of the film, its production, and its reception.\n\nPlot\nThe film is an origin story that follows Peter Parker, a shy and awkward high school student who is bitten by a genetically engineered spider during a field trip to a Columbia University genetics laboratory. The spider's bite gives Peter incredible powers, including superhuman strength, agility, and the ability to climb walls and shoot webs from his wrists. As Peter struggles to balance his secret life as a superhero with his daily life as a student, he must also face off against the Green Goblin, a villainous figure who is revealed to be Norman Osborn, the father of Peter's best friend Harry.\n\nCast\nThe film boasts an impressive cast, including Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. Joe Manganiello plays the role of Flash Thompson, Peter's bully, while Michael Papajohn appears as the Carjacker who kills Ben Parker. Ron Perkins portrays Dr. Mendel Stromm, Norman's head scientist, and Gerry Becker and Jack Betts play the Oscorp board members Maximillian Fargas and Henry Balkan, respectively.\n\nProduction\nThe development of the film began in the early 1970s, when Marvel Comics first considered bringing its characters to the big screen. However, it wasn't until the 1980s that the project began to take shape. Producer Roger Corman was the first to hold an option on the Spider-Man property and began to develop the film at Orion Pictures. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee was brought on to write a screenplay, which featured Cold War themes and Doctor Octopus as the primary antagonist. However, the project ultimately fell through due to budgetary disputes between Corman and Lee.\n\nDesign\nThe Green Goblin's iconic costume was designed by Academy Award-winning costume designer James Acheson. The original design was an animatronic mask that would be worn by Dafoe, but it was ultimately replaced by a more elaborate costume that featured a distinctive green and black suit. Dafoe was also instrumental in designing the Goblin's mask, which he wanted to be both menacing and comedic.\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography for the film took place in New York City and on Sony soundstages. The film's release was initially scheduled for November 2, 2001, but it was postponed to May 3, 2002, due to an extended post-production schedule. The film's visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic, and the visual effects supervisor, John Dykstra, convinced Raimi to use computer-generated imagery (CGI) for many of the stunts that were physically impossible.\n\nMusic\nThe film's score was composed by Danny Elfman, who is known for his work on numerous other superhero films, including Batman and Men in Black. The score combines traditional orchestration with ethnic percussion and electronic elements, and it features a distinctive theme for Spider-Man that has become iconic in popular culture.\n\nRelease\nThe film was released on May 3, 2002, and it quickly became a commercial success. The film grossed over $114 million on its opening weekend, making it the highest-grossing opening weekend of all time. The film's success was also reflected in its critical reception, with many praising the film's visual effects, action sequences, and performances.\n\nBox Office\nThe film's box office success was unprecedented, with it becoming the highest-grossing film of 2002. The film's opening weekend gross was over $114 million, and it went on to gross over $821 million worldwide. The film's success was also reflected in its home media sales, with it becoming one of the best-selling DVDs of all time.\n\nReception\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its visual effects, action sequences, and performances. The film holds a 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many considering it one of the best superhero films of all time. The film also won several awards, including two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Mix.\n\nSequels\nThe film's success led to the production of two sequels, Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3, both of which were directed by Sam Raimi and starred Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man. The sequels were also critical and commercial successes, and they cemented Spider-Man's place as one of the most iconic superhero characters of all time.\n\nVideo Game\nA video game based on the film was released in 2002, and it was developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. The game was a commercial success, and it was followed by two sequels, Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3, both of which were released in 2004 and 2007, respectively.\n\nConclusion\nThe Spider-Man film franchise has become one of the most successful and iconic superhero franchises in cinematic history.

making film adaptations of comic books a low priority [17] The film rights were then acquired by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus of The Cannon Group for $225,000 in 1985 [18] [19] The two were not familiar with the character's background and mistook Spider-Man for a werewolf-like character Leslie Stevens, creator of The Outer Limits, was hired to write a screenplay based on this concept Stevens' script depicted Peter Parker as a photographer who is subjected to a mad scientist's experiment, which transforms him into a human tarantula Tobe Hooper, who was preparing to shoot The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and Invaders from Mars for Cannon, signed on to direct [20] Lee hated the horror route the studio was taking with the character and demanded that a new script be written that was closer to the source material [21] [22]\n\n\nCasting\nFor the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, the filmmakers sought an actor who was not excessively tall or handsome, but who had the \"heart and soul\" for the audience to identify with [36] The studio expressed interest in Leonardo DiCaprio, Freddie Prinze Jr., Chris O'Donnell, Jude Law, Chris Klein, Ewan McGregor, Wes Bentley, and Heath Ledger DiCaprio had been considered for the role in 1995 by James Cameron [b] Scott Speedman, Jay Rodan and James Franco were also involved in screen tests for the part [65] [66] Joe Manganiello auditioned, but was cast as the bully Flash instead [67]\n\n\nDesign\nThe Green Goblin's original headgear was an animatronic mask created by Amalgamated Dynamics [90] Dafoe described it as a \"Halloween mask\" and \"kind of silly-looking\" The designers then created a helmet that Dafoe termed \"very angular, very modern .. more like an armor.\" [36] Dafoe also wanted the costume to be flexible enough to allow him to do splits [91]\n\n\nFilming\nWith Spider-Man cast, filming was set to begin in November 2000 in New York City and on Sony soundstages The film's release was scheduled for November 2, 2001, [68] but was postponed to May 3, 2002, due to an extended post-production schedule [95]\n\n\nVisual effects\nJohn Dykstra was hired as the film's visual effects supervisor in May 2000 [114] [115] He convinced Raimi to use computer-generated imagery (CGI) for many of the stunts that were physically impossible Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films [50] Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider-Man swinging from buildings, which he described as, \"ballet in the sky.\" The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned $70 million to around $100 million [69] Shots were made more complicated because of the main characters' individual color schemes, so Spider-Man and the Green Goblin had to be shot separately for effects shots: Spider-Man was shot in front of a greenscreen, while the Goblin was shot against bluescreen Shooting them together would have resulted in one character being erased from a shot [42] [116] [117]\n\n\nMusic\nDanny Elfman composed the musical score for Spider-Man [120] Its soundtrack combines traditional orchestration, ethnic percussion, and electronic elements Its distinct ethnic characteristics are credited to Elfman, who spent a year in Africa studying its unique percussion [citation needed]\n\n\nRelease\nAfter the September 11 attacks occurred in 2001, Sony recalled a Spider-Man teaser poster and a teaser trailer, both of which depicted the World Trade Center towers [121] The poster showed a close-up of Spider-Man's face with the towers reflected in his eyes, while the trailer showed a helicopter getting caught in a giant spider web spun between the towers [h] The trailer, which according to Sony did not contain any actual footage from the film, was also removed from the home video release of A Knight's Tale [i] Raimi later stated that the helicopter scene was originally in the film, but was removed after the attacks [129] A new teaser poster featuring Spider-Man and the Green Goblin was unveiled in November 2001 [130] A month later, a new trailer debuted on television and in theaters [131] An additional trailer was released online and in theaters near the end of March [132]\n\n\nMarketing\nAfter the September 11 attacks occurred in 2001, Sony recalled a Spider-Man teaser poster and a teaser trailer, both of which depicted the World

was rated \"PG-13\" for \"stylized violence and action\" [136] Before the film's British theatrical release in June 2002, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) gave the film a \"12\" certificate Due to Spider-Man's popularity with younger children, this prompted much controversy The BBFC defended its decision, arguing that the film could have been given a \"15\" Despite this, North Norfolk and Breckland District Councils, in East Anglia, changed it to a \"PG\", and Tameside council, Manchester, denoted it a \"PG-12\" In late August, the BBFC relaxed its policy to \"12A\", leading Sony to re-release the film [137] [138]\n\n\nBox office\nSpider-Man was first released in theaters on May 3, 2002 in 18 markets [140] In the United States and Canada, it opened on 7,500 screens at 3,615 theaters and earned $114.8 million during its opening weekend, establishing a new opening weekend record [j] The previous record holder was Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, which earned $90.3 million when it opened in November 2001 [k] Spider-Man also became the first film to gross $100 million in a single weekend (even when adjusting for inflation), and the first film to reach $100 million in three days [145] [146] Additionally, the film set a record for the highest three-day gross [147] According to Rick Lyman of The New York Times, film industry executives expected Spider-Man to have a strong opening Competition from other films was limited, and polls showed strong interest in Raimi's film from every age group However, neither executives nor polling firms predicted that the film's earnings would exceed those of Sorcerer's Stone [141] Upon release, Spider-Man became the number one film at the box office [l]\n\n\nHome media\nSpider-Man was released on VHS and DVD on November 1, 2002, in North America and Australia, and on November 25, 2002, in the United Kingdom by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment [177] It set a record for having the highest single-day DVD sales, surpassing Monsters, Inc and selling over 7 million DVD copies on its first day of release [178] The film would hold this record for a year until it was taken by Finding Nemo in 2003 [179] As of 2022, it has the single-day record for any live-action film [180] In just a few days, the DVD release sold more than 11 million copies [181] While the VHS release sold over 6.5 million copies, the DVD release went on to become one of the best-selling live-action DVD titles of all time with over 19.5 million copies being sold [182] [183] This two-disc DVD release comes in separate widescreen (1.85:1 aspect ratio) and fullscreen (1.33:1 aspect ratio) versions Bonus features include commentaries, promotional material, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and other information on both the film and the comic books that inspired it [184]\n\n\nReception\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 249 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.6/10

{"title": "Abdul_Rashid_Dostum", "content": "\nEarly life\nDostum was born in 1954 in Khwaja Du Koh near Sheberghan in Jowzjan province, Afghanistan Coming from an impoverished ethnic Uzbek family, he received a very basic traditional education as he was forced to drop out of school at a young age From there, he took up work in the village's major gas fields.\n\n\nCareer\nDostum began working in 1970 in a state-owned gas refinery in Sheberghan, participating in union politics, as the new government started to arm the staff of the workers in the oil and gas refineries The reason for this was to create \"groups for the Defense of the Revolution\" Because of the new communist ideas entering Afghanistan in the 1970s, he enlisted in the Afghan National Army in 1978 Dostum received his basic military training in Jalalabad His squadron was deployed in the rural areas around Sheberghan, under the auspices of the Ministry of National Security [20] According to photographic evidence, Dostum additionally received airborne training and still chooses to wear two first-class \"Master Paratrooper\" Afghan jump wings [21]\n\n\nSoviet–Afghan War\nBy the mid-1980s, he commanded around 20,000 militia men and controlled the northern provinces of Afghanistan [22] While the unit recruited throughout Jowzjan and had a relatively broad base, many of its early troops and commanders came from Dostum's home village He left the army after the purge of Parchamites, but returned after the Soviet occupation began [20]\n\n\nCivil war and northern Afghanistan autonomous state\nDostum's men would become an important force in the fall of Kabul in 1992, with Dostum deciding to defect from Najibullah and allying himself with opposition commanders Ahmad Shah Massoud and Sayed Jafar Naderi, [26] the head of the Isma'ili community, and together they captured the capital city With the help of fellow defectors Mohammad Nabi Azimi and Abdul Wakil, his forces entered Kabul by air in the afternoon of 14 April [27] He and Massoud fought in a coalition against Gulbuddin Hekmatyar [24] Massoud and Dostum's forces joined to defend Kabul against Hekmatyar Some 4,000–5,000 of his troops, units of his Sheberghan-based 53rd Division and Balkh-based Guards Division, garrisoning Bala Hissar fort, Maranjan Hill and Khwaja Rawash Airport, where they stopped Najibullah from entering to flee [28]\n\n\nTaliban era\nFollowing the rise of the Taliban and their capture of Kabul, Dostum aligned himself with the Northern Alliance (United Front) against the Taliban [24] The Northern Alliance was assembled in late 1996 by Dostum, Massoud and Karim Khalili against the Taliban At this point he is said to have had a force of some 50,000 men supported by both aircraft and tanks.\n\n\nOperation

Dostum**\n\nAbdul Rashid Dostum is an Afghan politician and military leader who has played a significant role in Afghan politics since the 1970s. He is a prominent figure in the country's complex history, having served as a commander in the Afghan National Army, a leader of the Northern Alliance, and a governor of the Balkh province.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nDostum was born in 1954 in Khwaja Du Koh, a village near Sheberghan in Jowzjan province, Afghanistan. He comes from an impoverished ethnic Uzbek family and received a basic traditional education before being forced to drop out of school at a young age. To support his family, Dostum began working in the village's major gas fields.\n\n**Career**\n\nDostum started his career in 1970 as a worker in a state-owned gas refinery in Sheberghan. He soon became involved in union politics, as the new government began to arm the staff of the workers in the oil and gas refineries. This move was aimed at creating \"groups for the Defense of the Revolution.\" In 1978, Dostum enlisted in the Afghan National Army, receiving his basic military training in Jalalabad. His squadron was deployed in the rural areas around Sheberghan, under the auspices of the Ministry of National Security.\n\nDostum's military career continued to rise, and by the mid-1980s, he commanded around 20,000 militia men and controlled the northern provinces of Afghanistan. While the unit recruited throughout Jowzjan and had a relatively broad base, many of its early troops and commanders came from Dostum's home village.\n\n**Soviet-Afghan War**\n\nAs the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan began, Dostum left the army after the purge of Parchamites. However, he returned to the army after the Soviet occupation started, and his men became an important force in the fall of Kabul in 1992. Dostum defected from Najibullah and allied himself with opposition commanders Ahmad Shah Massoud and Sayed Jafar Naderi. Together, they captured the capital city, and Dostum's forces entered Kabul by air in the afternoon of April 14, 1992.\n\n**Civil War and Northern Afghanistan Autonomous State**\n\nDostum and Massoud fought in a coalition against Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, with Dostum's forces joining to defend Kabul against Hekmatyar. Some 4,000-5,000 of Dostum's troops, units of his Sheberghan-based 53rd Division and Balkh-based Guards Division, garrisoned Bala Hissar fort, Maranjan Hill, and Khwaja Rawash Airport, where they stopped Najibullah from entering to flee.\n\nAfter the rise of the Taliban and their capture of Kabul, Dostum aligned himself with the Northern Alliance (United Front) against the Taliban. The Northern Alliance was assembled in late 1996 by Dostum, Massoud, and Karim Khalili against the Taliban. At this point, Dostum is said to have had a force of some 50,000 men supported by both aircraft and tanks.\n\n**Operation Enduring Freedom**\n\nDostum returned to Afghanistan in May 2001 to open up a new front before the U.S.-led campaign against the Taliban. He joined forces with Commander Massoud, Ismail Khan, and Mohammad Mohaqiq. On October 17, 2001, the CIA's eight-man Team Alpha, including Johnny Micheal Spann, landed in the Dar-e-Suf to link up with Dostum. Three days later, the 12 members of Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 595 landed to join forces with Dostum and Team Alpha.\n\nDostum, the Tajik commander Atta Muhammad Nur, and their American allies defeated Taliban forces and recaptured Mazar-i-Sharif on November 10, 2001.\n\n**Dasht-i-Leili Massacre**\n\nDostum has been accused by Western journalists of responsibility for the suffocating or otherwise killing of Taliban prisoners in December 2001, with the number of victims estimated as 2,000. In 2009, Dostum denied the accusations, and US President Obama ordered an investigation into the massacre.\n\n**Karzai Administration**\n\nIn the aftermath of the Taliban's removal from northern Afghanistan, forces loyal to Dostum frequently clashed with Tajik forces loyal to Atta Muhammad Nur. Atta's men kidnapped and killed a number of Dostum's men and constantly agitated to gain control of Mazar-e-Sharif. Through the political mediations of the Karzai administration, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), and the United Nations, the Dostum-Atta feud gradually declined, leading to their alignment in a new political party.\n\n**Time in Turkey**\n\nIn 2008, some media reports stated that Dostum was seeking political asylum in Turkey or was exiled. One Turkish media outlet said Dostum was visiting after flying there with then Turkey's Foreign Minister Ali Babacan during a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).\n\n**Ghani Administration**\n\nOn October 7, 2013, the day after filing his nomination for the 2014 general elections as running mate of Ashraf Ghani, Dostum issued a press statement that some
