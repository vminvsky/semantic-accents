It is the sixth installment in the Jurassic Park film series and the third installment in the Jurassic World trilogy. The film stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Jeff Goldblum, and features a returning cast from the previous two films, including Laura Dern, Sam Neill, andBD Wong.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place four years after the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. The surviving dinosaurs from the island of Isla Nublar have been released into the world, causing chaos and destruction. The story follows Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) as they team up with a group of scientists, led by Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), to find a way to contain the dinosaurs and prevent them from causing further harm.\n\nHowever, their efforts are complicated by the emergence of a new and powerful threat: a genetically engineered hybrid dinosaur, created by a rival biotech company, Biosyn. The hybrid, known as the Indominus rex, is a massive and deadly creature that has been designed to be the ultimate killing machine.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Owen and Claire must navigate a complex web of politics and corporate interests, all while trying to protect the dinosaurs and prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. Along the way, they encounter a cast of characters, including a group of farmers who are being terrorized by the dinosaurs, and a team of scientists who are working to develop a new technology that could potentially control the dinosaurs.\n\nUltimately, the film builds towards a thrilling showdown between Owen and Claire, and the Indominus rex, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a star-studded cast, including:\n\n* Chris Pratt as Owen Grady\n* Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing\n* Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm\n* Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler\n* Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant\n* BD Wong as Dr. Henry Wu\n* Mamoudou Athie as Dr. Kayla Watts\n* DeWanda Wise as Dr. Charlie\n* Campbell Scott as Powell\n* Justice Smith as Franklin Webb\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe idea for Jurassic World Dominion was first conceived in 2015, shortly after the release of Jurassic World. At the time, writer and director Colin Trevorrow had already begun thinking about a sequel to the film, and had started developing a story that would explore the consequences of the events of the previous film.\n\nHowever, the project was put on hold in 2016, when Trevorrow was hired to direct Star Wars: Episode IX. The film was eventually revived in 2018, with Trevorrow returning to the project and a new cast of writers and producers coming on board.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2019, with a team of writers and producers working on the script.

The work premiered in 1896 at the Helsinki Music Hall and was later withdrawn due to its perceived failure to gain an audience. The opera experienced a posthumous revival in the 20th century, with performances and recordings becoming more frequent over time.\n\n**History**\n\n### Composition\n\nSibelius began work on The Maiden in the Tower in 1892, drawing inspiration from Topelius's 1865 novel of the same name. The libretto was composed of four acts, each focusing on a different aspect of the story. The opera's score was written in a style that blended elements of Romanticism with nationalist influences.\n\n### Premiere\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower premiered at the Helsinki Music Hall on October 1, 1896, conducted by Robert Kajanus. The performance was met with mixed reviews, with some critics praising the work's beauty and others finding it too challenging to follow.\n\n### Withdrawal and suppression\n\nDue to the opera's perceived failure to gain an audience, Sibelius withdrew it from performance. The work was subsequently suppressed, and its score was largely forgotten. This neglect was partly due to the opera's complex and challenging nature, which made it difficult for audiences to follow.\n\n### Posthumous revival\n\nIn the 20th century, The Maiden in the Tower experienced a posthumous revival, with performances and recordings becoming more frequent over time. The work's music was praised for its beauty and nationalism, and its story was recognized as an important part of Finnish cultural heritage.\n\n**Structure and roles**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is an opera in four acts, each with its own unique characters and plot developments. The main roles in the opera include:\n\n* The Maiden (soprano): a young woman who is imprisoned in a tower by a wicked uncle\n* The Nurse (mezzo-soprano): a kind and caring woman who looks after the Maiden\n* The Uncle (baritone): a wicked and powerful man who imprisons the Maiden\n* The King (tenor): a just and fair ruler who seeks to rescue the Maiden\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nThe opera tells the story of a young woman, the Maiden, who is imprisoned in a tower by her wicked uncle. The Nurse, who looks after the Maiden, tries to comfort her and keep her spirits up. Meanwhile, the Uncle becomes increasingly tyrannical, and the King seeks to rescue the Maiden.\n\nAs the opera progresses, the Maiden and the Nurse become more and more desperate, and the Uncle's cruelty knows no bounds. In the final act, the King arrives and rescues the Maiden, defeating the Uncle in the process.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe music in The Maiden in the Tower is a blend of Romanticism and nationalism. Sibelius uses a range of musical devices, including leitmotifs and symbolism, to tell the story and create mood. The opera's score is characterized by its use of folk melodies and harmonies, which add to its nationalist flavor.\n\n**Context and analysis**\n\n### The plot as allegory\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower can be seen as an allegory for the struggle between good and evil. The Maiden represents innocence and purity, while the Uncle represents tyranny and cruelty. The Nurse represents kindness and compassion, while the King represents justice and fairness.\n\n### Opera and Finland's language strife\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower was composed at a time of great cultural and linguistic tension in Finland. The country was torn between its native Finnish language and the Swedish language of its former rulers. Sibelius's use of Finnish in the opera was seen as a nationalist statement, and the work was praised for its contribution to Finnish cultural heritage.\n\n### Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n\nIn the 20th century, Sibelius's music was praised for its beauty and nationalism. The Maiden in the Tower was recognized as an important work in the composer's oeuvre, and its music was widely admired. However, some critics saw the opera as overly complex and challenging, and it was not widely performed.\n\n### Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower experienced a period of neglect after 1981, partly due to the opera's complexity and challenging nature. However, the work's music and story were not forgotten, and it was recognized as an important part of Finnish cultural heritage.\n\n**Discography**\n\nThere are several recordings of The Maiden in the Tower available, including:\n\n* 1955: Finnish Radio Orchestra, conducted by Nils-Eric Fougstedt\n* 1977: Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Ulf Söderblom\n* 1985: Finnish Radio Orchestra, conducted by Jorma Panula\n* 1995: Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Leif Segerstam\n\n**Notes, references, and sources**\n\nThe Maiden in the Tower is a unique and important work in the Finnish opera repertoire. Its music and story continue to be admired and performed today, and it remains an important part of Finnish cultural heritage.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Maiden_in_the_Tower\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Composition\n##Premiere\n##Withdrawal and suppression\n##Posthumous revival\n#Structure and roles\n#Synopsis\n#Music\n#Context and analysis\n##The plot as allegory\n##Opera and Finland's language strife\n##Later opinions of Sibelius's music\n##Reasons for post-1981 neglect\n#Discography\n#Notes, references, and sources\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The fires burned across the islands of Maui, Hawaiʻi Island, and Oʻahu, causing widespread damage and loss of life.\n\n**Background**\n\nHawaii is a tropical paradise known for its lush rainforests, volcanic landscapes, and idyllic climate. However, the state's unique geography and climate also make it prone to wildfires. The dry season in Hawaii typically runs from June to October, with the peak fire season occurring in August and September.\n\n### Wildfire risk\n\nHawaii's wildfire risk is exacerbated by several factors, including:\n\n* **Vegetation:** Hawaii's vegetation is mostly composed of dry woods, shrubs, and grasses, which can easily ignite and spread quickly.\n* **Wind:** Hawaii's trade winds can gust up to 50 mph, spreading embers and sparks rapidly.\n* **Drought:** Hawaii's dry season, which typically lasts from June to October, creates ideal conditions for wildfires.\n\n### Weather factors\n\nWeather conditions played a significant role in the spread and intensity of the 2023 Hawaii wildfires. A prolonged drought, combined with hot temperatures and strong winds, created a perfect storm for wildfires. The dry and hot conditions allowed fires to spread quickly, and the strong winds fanned the flames, making it difficult for firefighters to contain them.\n\n**List of wildfires**\n\nThe 2023 Hawaii wildfires burned across multiple islands, with several notable fires occurring on Maui, Hawaiʻi Island, and Oʻahu.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### Maui\n\n**Kula**\n\n* **Date:** August 15, 2023\n* **Location:** Kula, Maui\n* **Size:** 5,000 acres\n* **Containment:** 30%\n* **Injuries:** 2\n* **Fatalities:** 0\n\nThe Kula wildfire burned across 5,000 acres of dry woods and shrubs, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents.

The dam is a critical infrastructure facility that provides hydroelectric power, irrigation, and flood control to the surrounding region.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Kakhovka Dam is a Soviet-era dam built in 1954 with a height of 26 meters and a length of 3,000 meters. It is one of the largest dams in Europe, with a capacity to store over 18 billion cubic meters of water. The dam is managed by the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy and is a critical component of the country's energy infrastructure. The dam provides hydroelectric power to the surrounding region, as well as irrigation for agricultural land and flood control for the Dnipro River.\n\n**Destruction**\n\nOn June 6, 2023, Russian forces launched a missile attack on the Kakhovka Dam, causing significant damage to the dam's structure. The attack was part of a broader military campaign by Russian forces in Ukraine, which has been ongoing since 2014. The exact circumstances of the attack are disputed, with Ukraine accusing Russia of intentional destruction of the dam. Russia has denied any involvement in the attack, although it has acknowledged that the dam was damaged.\n\n**Responsibility**\n\nThe responsibility for the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam is disputed. Ukraine has accused Russia of intentionally breaching the dam as part of its military campaign in Ukraine. Russia has denied any involvement, with officials claiming that the damage was caused by Ukrainian forces. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other international organizations have called for a thorough investigation into the circumstances of the attack.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has had significant effects on the surrounding region.\n\n### **Casualties**\n\nThe exact number of casualties from the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam is unclear. However, it is estimated that hundreds of people have been killed or injured in the resulting floods.

This group includes a wide range of organisms, from single-celled protists to multicellular plants, animals, and fungi. Eukaryotes are characterized by their complex cell structure, which is in contrast to prokaryotes, whose cells lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.\n\n**Diversity**\n\nEukaryotes are incredibly diverse, with over 100,000 known species, ranging from the simplest single-celled organisms to complex multicellular organisms like humans. They can be found in almost every environment on Earth, from the freezing tundra to the hottest deserts, and from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains.\n\n**Distinguishing features**\n\n### Nucleus\n\nThe nucleus is a membrane-bound organelle that contains the genetic material of eukaryotic cells. It is the control center of the cell, directing the synthesis of proteins and other essential cellular processes. The nucleus is typically found in the center of the cell and is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The nucleus contains a region called the nucleoplasm, where the genetic material is found, as well as a region called the nucleolus, where ribosome synthesis occurs.\n\n### Biochemistry\n\nEukaryotic cells are characterized by their complex biochemistry, which involves a wide range of metabolic processes. These processes include the synthesis of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, as well as the breakdown of nutrients and the elimination of waste products. Eukaryotic cells also have a number of specialized organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are involved in energy production and other essential cellular processes.\n\n### Internal membranes\n\nEukaryotic cells have a number of internal membranes, which are involved in a variety of cellular processes. These membranes include the endoplasmic reticulum, which is a network of membranes that is involved in protein synthesis and transport; the Golgi apparatus, which is a complex of membranes that is involved in protein modification and transport; and the lysosomes, which are membrane-bound organelles that contain digestive enzymes and are involved in the breakdown of cellular waste.\n\n### Mitochondria\n\nMitochondria are specialized organelles that are involved in energy production in eukaryotic cells. They are the site of cellular respiration, where glucose is broken down to produce energy in the form of ATP. Mitochondria have their own DNA and are thought to have evolved from ancient bacteria that were engulfed by eukaryotic cells.\n\n### Plastids\n\nPlastids are organelles that are found in plant cells and are involved in photosynthesis. They contain pigments such as chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy and uses it to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Plastids also contain other pigments, such as carotenoids and betalains, which are involved in the synthesis of other compounds.\n\n### Cytoskeletal structures\n\nEukaryotic cells have a number of cytoskeletal structures, which are involved in maintaining cell shape and providing mechanical support. These structures include microtubules, which are involved in the movement of organelles and the separation of chromosomes during cell division; microfilaments, which are involved in muscle contraction and the movement of cells; and intermediate filaments, which are involved in maintaining cell shape and providing mechanical support.\n\n### Cell wall\n\nEukaryotic cells have a cell wall, which is a rigid layer that provides structural support and protection from the environment. The cell wall is composed of a variety of compounds, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, and is found in plant cells, fungal cells, and some protist cells.\n\n### Sexual reproduction\n\nEukaryotic cells are capable of sexual reproduction, which involves the fusion of two gametes to produce a zygote. This process involves the exchange of genetic material between two individuals and is an essential mechanism for the evolution of new traits and the adaptation of species to changing environments.\n\n**Evolution**\n\n### History of classification\n\nThe classification of eukaryotes has a long and complex history, with various attempts to group organisms based on their morphology and physiology. The current system of classification, which divides eukaryotes into six kingdoms ( Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Chromista, Protozoa, and Monera), was developed in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n### Phylogeny\n\nThe phylogeny of eukaryotes is not well understood, but it is thought that they evolved from a common ancestor with archaea in the ancient past. The most widely accepted theory is the endosymbiotic theory, which suggests that eukaryotic cells evolved from a symbiotic relationship between bacteria and archaea.\n\n### Origin of eukaryotes\n\nThe origin of eukaryotes is thought to have occurred around 2.1 billion years ago, during a period of significant environmental change on Earth. It is believed that eukaryotes evolved from a common ancestor with archaea, and that the first eukaryotic cells were likely single-celled organisms that lived in aquatic environments.\n\n### Fossils\n\nFossils of eukaryotic cells are rare and difficult to find, but they provide important evidence of the evolution of these organisms. The earliest known fossils of eukaryotic cells date back to around 2.1 billion years ago, and are characterized by their simple morphology and lack of complex structures.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Eukaryotic cell\n* Prokaryotic cell\n* Archaea\n* Bacteria\n* Fossil record\n* Evolutionary biology\n* Systematics\n\n**References**\n\n(These references are not included as the article should not have any citations or references)\n\n**External links**\n\n* National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)\n* Tree of Life Project\n* Eukaryote at the Encyclopedia of Life", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Eukaryote\" following this outline:\n\n#Diversity\n#Distinguishing features\n##Nucleus\n##Biochemistry\n##Internal membranes\n##Mitochondria\n##Plastids\n##Cytoskeletal structures\n##Cell wall\n##Sexual reproduction\n#Evolution\n##History of classification\n##Phylogeny\n##Origin of eukaryotes\n##Fossils\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is considered one of the most influential monarchs in English history, known for his military conquests, administrative reforms, and legislative achievements. Edward I's reign was marked by significant events that shaped the course of English history and left a lasting impact on the country's institutions and people.\n\n**Early years, 1239–1263**\n\n### Childhood and marriage\n\nEdward was born on 17 June 1239 at the Palace of Westminster, London, to King Henry III and Queen Eleanor of Provence. He was the eldest son of the couple and was named after his father. Edward's early life was spent at court, where he received a traditional education in Latin, literature, and music. He also showed a keen interest in martial arts and was trained in the art of warfare from a young age.\n\nIn 1254, Edward was sent to Gascony, a region in southwestern France, to serve as the King's representative and to oversee the administration of the English territories in the region. During his time in Gascony, Edward met Eleanor of Castile, the daughter of King Alfonso X of Castile. The couple married in 1254, and Edward brought Eleanor back to England, where she became a prominent figure at court.\n\n### Early ambitions\n\nEdward's time in Gascony had a profound impact on his ambitions and worldview. He became fascinated with the idea of expanding English power and influence across Europe, and he saw himself as a natural leader who could achieve great things. Edward's ambition was encouraged by his father, who saw him as a potential successor to the throne. In 1258, Edward was appointed as the Lord High Warden of the Cinque Ports, a powerful group of ports on the English coast, which gave him significant influence over trade and commerce in the region.\n\n**Civil war and crusades, 1264–1273**\n\n### Second Barons' War\n\nIn 1263, the Second Barons' War broke out in England, with a group of barons led by Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, rebelling against the King. Edward, who had returned to England, joined forces with his father and together they defeated the barons at the Battle of Lewes in 1264. However, the victory was short-lived, as Edward's forces were defeated at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, and Simon de Montfort was killed.\n\n### Crusade and accession\n\nIn 1269, Edward joined the Seventh Crusade, a military campaign led by his brother-in-law, King Louis IX of France. However, the crusade was a disaster, and Edward was captured by the forces of the Sultan of Egypt. He was held captive for several years before being ransomed and returning to England.\n\nUpon his return, Edward's father, King Henry III, was dying, and Edward was summoned to his bedside. Henry III died on 16 November 1272, and Edward succeeded him as King of England. Edward was crowned on 19 August 1274, in a lavish ceremony at Westminster Abbey.\n\n**Early reign, 1274–1296**\n\n### Conquest of Wales\n\nOne of Edward's first priorities as King was to conquer Wales, which had been a thorn in the side of English monarchs for centuries. In 1277, Edward launched a military campaign against the Welsh prince, Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, and after a series of battles, Llywelyn was defeated and captured. Edward then established a series of English castles in Wales, which helped to consolidate English control over the region.\n\n### Diplomacy and war on the Continent\n\nEdward also sought to expand English influence on the Continent, particularly in Scotland and France. In 1275, he launched a military campaign against Scotland, but it was unsuccessful. In 1296, Edward invaded Scotland again, this time with a large army, and he defeated the Scottish king, John Balliol, at the Battle of Dunbar.\n\n### Great Cause\n\nThe Great Cause was a series of lawsuits that took place in the late 13th century to determine the rightful heir to the Scottish throne. Edward, who claimed that he had the right to the Scottish throne, launched a series of lawsuits against the Scottish nobles, who argued that they had the right to choose their own king. The Great Cause ultimately failed to determine the rightful heir, but it helped to pave the way for Edward's eventual conquest of Scotland.\n\n**Government and law**\n\n### Character as king\n\nEdward I was known for his strong-willed and ambitious nature, which sometimes led him to conflict with his nobles. He was also known for his sense of justice and his desire to reform the English legal system. Edward established a series of courts and tribunals to hear cases and administer justice, and he also established a system of appeals to the King's Bench.\n\n### Administration and the law\n\nEdward's administration was marked by a series of reforms, including the establishment of a new system of taxation and the creation of a professional class of administrators. He also established a system of law that emphasized the rights of individuals and the rule of law.\n\n### Finances and Parliament\n\nEdward's finances were marked by a series of taxes and levies, including the establishment of the first English parliament. In 1295, Edward summoned a group of representatives from each county in England to advise him on matters of taxation and governance. This group became known as the Model Parliament, and it paved the way for the modern English parliament.\n\n### Parliament and the expulsion of the Jews\n\nIn 1290, Edward expelled all Jews from England, in a move that was motivated by a desire to reduce the influence of Jewish moneylenders and to increase the power of the English nobility. The expulsion was a significant event in English history, and it had a profound impact on the Jewish community in England.\n\n### Administration in Ireland\n\nEdward also established a system of administration in Ireland, which included the establishment of a series of English castles and the appointment of English officials to govern the region. However, the English administration in Ireland was met with resistance from the native Irish, who saw the English as occupiers.\n\n**Later reign, 1297–1307**\n\n### Constitutional crisis\n\nIn 1297, a constitutional crisis broke out in England, as a group of nobles, led by John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, and Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, rose up against Edward, claiming that he had exceeded his authority. The crisis was eventually resolved, but it marked a significant turning point in Edward's reign.\n\n### Return to Scotland\n\nIn 1298, Edward returned to Scotland, where he defeated the Scottish king, William Wallace, at the Battle of Falkirk. However, the victory was short-lived, as Wallace rallied his forces and eventually defeated Edward at the Battle of Stirling Bridge.\n\n### Death and burial\n\nEdward died on 7 July 1307, at Burgh-by-Sands, near Carlisle, while on a military campaign in Scotland. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, where many other English kings were laid to rest.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nEdward I's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is remembered as a strong and ambitious king who expanded English power and influence across Europe, but he is also criticized for his heavy-handed approach to governance and his treatment of minorities. Edward's reign marked a significant turning point in English history, and it paved the way for the rise of the English monarchy in the centuries that followed.\n\n**Family**\n\n### First marriage\n\nEdward's first marriage was to Eleanor of Castile, whom he married in 1254. The couple had 14 children together, including several sons who went on to become prominent figures in English history.\n\n### Second marriage\n\nAfter Eleanor's death in 1290, Edward married Margaret of France, the daughter of King Philip IV of France. The couple had two daughters, but no sons, and they were eventually divorced.\n\n### Genealogical table\n\nA genealogical table of Edward I's family is as follows:\n\n* Edward I (1239–1307)\n\t+ Married: Eleanor of Castile (1241–1290)\n\t\t- Children:\n\t\t\t- Edward of Carnarfon (1284–1327)\n\t\t\t- John of Eltham (1316–1336)\n\t\t\t- Eleanor of England (1261–1298)\n\t\t\t- Joan of Acre (1272–1307)\n\t\t\t- Alfonso of England (1273–1284)\n\t\t\t- Margaret of England (1275–1333)\n\t\t\t- Berengaria of England (1278–1278)\n\t\t\t- Elizabeth of England (1282–1316)\n\t\t\t- Edward of England (1284–1325)\n\t\t\t- Thomas of Brotherton (1300–1338)\n\t\t\t- William of Hatfield (1307–1307)\n\t+ Married: Margaret of France (1283–1318)\n\t\t- Children:\n\t\t\t- Thomas of Brotherton (1300–1338)\n\t\t\t- Edmund of Woodstock (1301–1330)\n\n**See also**\n\n* Edward I of England in popular culture\n* List of English monarchs\n* List of Scottish monarchs\n* List of French monarchs\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Edward I's reign is often referred to as the \"Longshanks\" era, due to his tall stature and his reputation for being a fierce warrior.\n* Edward I's administration in Wales was marked by the establishment of a series of English castles, which helped to consolidate English control over the region.\n* Edward I's relations with Scotland were complex and multifaceted, and he launched several military campaigns against the Scottish king, John Balliol.\n* Edward I's legacy is complex and multifaceted, and he is remembered as a strong and ambitious king who expanded English power and influence across Europe.\n\n**References**\n\n* Prestwich, M.

The election was the 4th parliamentary election since the end of communism in 1989 and the 5th since the restoration of democracy in 1990.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Amendment of the electoral law\n\nIn December 2021, the Hungarian Parliament passed a law that changed the electoral system and the rules for the upcoming elections. The new law reduced the number of seats in the National Assembly from 199 to 199, and introduced a new system of electoral districts. The law also changed the rules for the formation of electoral alliances and coalitions.\n\n### Creation of joint opposition list\n\nIn response to the changes in the electoral law, the opposition parties formed a joint list, called the United for Hungary (Együtt az Országért) coalition. The coalition was formed by six opposition parties: the Momentum Movement, the Dialogue for Hungary, the Democratic Coalition, the Politics Can Be Different, the Hungarian Liberal Party, and the Hungarian Socialist Party.\n\n### Opposition primary\n\nOn 13-14 March 2022, the United for Hungary coalition held a primary election to select their joint candidate for the prime minister position. The winner of the primary election was Péter Márki-Zay, a former mayor of Hódmezővásárhely.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election was held under a mixed electoral system. The National Assembly consists of 199 members, with 106 members elected by single-member constituencies and 93 members elected by closed-list proportional representation.\n\n**Parties and coalitions**\n\nThe main parties and coalitions that participated in the election were:\n\n* Fidesz-KDNP (ruling party coalition)\n* United for Hungary (opposition coalition)\n* Jobbik (far-right party)\n* LMP (green party)\n* MSZP (socialist party)\n* DK (social democratic party)\n* Párbeszéd (liberal party)\n* Momentum (liberal party)\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls conducted in the weeks leading up to the election showed a tight race between the Fidesz-KDNP coalition and the United for Hungary coalition. However, the polls also showed that a large number of voters were undecided or planning to abstain from voting.\n\n**Results**\n\n### Result by constituency\n\nThe results of the election by constituency showed that the Fidesz-KDNP coalition won a majority of the mandates, with 135 seats. The United for Hungary coalition won 57 seats, while the Jobbik party won 12 seats.\n\n### Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n\nThe party list results showed that the Fidesz-KDNP coalition won the majority of the votes in most counties, with the exception of the counties of Pest and Budapest, where the United for Hungary coalition won a majority of the votes. The results in the diaspora showed that the Fidesz-KDNP coalition won a majority of the votes in most countries, with the exception of the United Kingdom and Ireland, where the United for Hungary coalition won a majority of the votes.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election was widely seen as a victory for the Fidesz-KDNP coalition, which won a majority of the mandates. However, the election also showed that the opposition parties, led by the United for Hungary coalition, were able to gain significant support and win a number of seats.\n\n### Conduct\n\nThe election was generally seen as free and fair, with the exception of some minor irregularities. The election was monitored by domestic and international observers, who reported that the election was conducted in accordance with the law and that the results reflected the will of the voters.\n\n### Anomalies over postal ballots\n\nThere were some anomalies reported over the use of postal ballots, particularly in the diaspora. Some voters reported that they had not received their postal ballots, or that the ballots had been damaged or tampered with.\n\n### International responses\n\nThe international community responded to the election with a mixed reaction. The European Union and the United States expressed concern over the election, citing concerns about the integrity of the election and the role of the government in promoting the Fidesz-KDNP coalition. However, other countries, such as Russia and China, welcomed the election results and expressed their support for the Fidesz-KDNP coalition.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Politics of Hungary\n* National Assembly of Hungary\n* Fidesz\n* KDNP\n* United for Hungary\n* Jobbik\n* LMP\n* MSZP\n* DK\n* Párbeszéd\n* Momentum\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is a summary of the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election on the website of the National Election Office of Hungary\n* 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election on the website of the Hungarian Parliament", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Hungarian_parliamentary_election\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Amendment of the electoral law\n##Creation of joint opposition list\n##Opposition primary\n#Electoral system\n#Parties and coalitions\n#Opinion polls\n#Results\n##Result by constituency\n##Party list results by county and in the diaspora\n#Aftermath\n##Analysis\n##Conduct\n##Anomalies over postal ballots\n##International responses\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The economics of open science examines the financial aspects of this movement, including the costs and benefits of adopting open science practices.\n\n**Economic Models**\n\nOpen science has given rise to various economic models that facilitate the dissemination of knowledge and promote collaboration among researchers. Two key models are the \"Open Science Club\" and the \"Open Science Market\".\n\n### **Open Science Club**\n\nThe Open Science Club is a concept that refers to a group of researchers who share knowledge, resources, and expertise to advance scientific understanding. This model is based on the idea of a \"knowledge club\" where members contribute to a common pool of knowledge and benefit from each other's work.\n\n#### **Definitions of Knowledge Club**\n\nA knowledge club is a group of individuals who share knowledge, expertise, and resources to achieve a common goal. Knowledge clubs can be formal or informal, and they often operate within a specific domain or industry. The key characteristics of a knowledge club include:\n\n* **Shared knowledge**: Members of the club share knowledge, expertise, and resources to achieve a common goal.\n* **Collaboration**: Members collaborate with each other to advance scientific understanding or solve a particular problem.\n* **Reciprocity**: Members benefit from each other's work, either directly or indirectly.\n\n#### **Knowledge Club and Open Science**\n\nThe Open Science Club is a specific type of knowledge club that focuses on open science practices. In an Open Science Club, members share their research data, methods, and findings openly, and collaborate with each other to advance scientific understanding. The benefits of an Open Science Club include:\n\n* **Accelerated research progress**: Open science practices facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing, leading to accelerated research progress.\n* **Increased transparency**: Open science practices promote transparency, which is essential for building trust and credibility in scientific research.\n* **Improved reproducibility**: Open science practices promote reproducibility, which is essential for verifying the results of scientific research.\n\n### **Open Science Market**\n\nThe Open Science Market is a hybrid market that combines elements of traditional publishing and open science. In this market, researchers can choose to publish their work openly or through traditional channels.\n\n#### **Scientific Publishing: a Hybrid Market**\n\nThe scientific publishing market is a hybrid market that combines elements of traditional publishing and open science. Many journals now offer open access options, where authors can pay a fee to make their work openly available. However, traditional publishing models still dominate the market.\n\n#### **From Readers to Authors: Hybrid and Full Open Access**\n\nThe shift from readers to authors in the scientific publishing market has led to a increase in open access publications. Authors are now more likely to pay for open access options, and many funders require authors to make their work openly available. This shift has led to an increase in open access publications, but traditional publishing models still dominate the market.\n\n#### **From Publishing to Analytics: Diversification of Revenue Streams**\n\nThe scientific publishing market is diversifying its revenue streams, moving from traditional publishing models to analytics and other forms of monetization. This shift is driven by the need to adapt to changing reader behavior and the increasing importance of open science practices.\n\n### **Open Science Commons**\n\nThe Open Science Commons is a digital platform that facilitates the sharing of knowledge, data, and methods among researchers. This platform has given rise to a new ecosystem of open science practices.\n\n#### **The Emergence of Digital Knowledge Commons**\n\nThe Open Science Commons is a digital platform that emerged from the need for a shared space for researchers to share knowledge, data, and methods. This platform has given rise to a new ecosystem of open science practices, where researchers can share and collaborate on each other's work.\n\n#### **Enclosures of Open Science Commons**\n\nHowever, the Open Science Commons is not without its challenges. Enclosures of open science commons refer to the use of intellectual property laws and other mechanisms to restrict access to knowledge, data, and methods. This can limit the benefits of open science practices and create new barriers to access.\n\n#### **Consolidation of the Common Ecosystem (2015-)**\n\nThe consolidation of the common ecosystem has led to a shift towards more formalized and structured open science practices. This has created new opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing, but also raises concerns about the sustainability of open science practices.\n\n**Cost**\n\nThe costs of open science practices are complex and multifaceted. They include editorial work and evaluation, technical infrastructure, and commercial services and prestige.\n\n### **Editorial Work and Evaluation**\n\nEditorial work and evaluation are essential components of open science practices. They require significant resources and expertise, and can be a major cost burden for researchers and institutions.\n\n### **Technical Infrastructure**\n\nTechnical infrastructure is also a significant cost component of open science practices. It includes the development and maintenance of digital platforms, data storage and management, and other technical requirements.\n\n### **Commercial Services and Prestige**\n\nCommercial services and prestige are also significant cost components of open science practices. They include the cost of purchasing commercial services, such as data analysis and visualization, and the value of prestige and recognition that comes with publishing in high-impact journals.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nThe benefits of open science practices are numerous and well-documented. They include transaction costs, access costs, research efficiency, and economic and social development.\n\n### **Transaction Costs**\n\nTransaction costs refer to the costs associated with sharing and accessing knowledge, data, and methods. These costs are reduced through open science practices, which facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n\n### **Access Costs**\n\nAccess costs refer to the costs associated with accessing knowledge, data, and methods. These costs are reduced through open science practices, which make knowledge, data, and methods openly available.\n\n### **Research Efficiency**\n\nResearch efficiency refers to the ability to conduct research quickly and effectively. Open science practices facilitate research efficiency by promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n\n### **Economic and Social Development**\n\nEconomic and social development refer to the benefits of open science practices for economic growth and social welfare. These benefits include increased innovation, job creation, and improved healthcare outcomes.\n\n**Economic Regulation of Open Science**\n\nThe economic regulation of open science is a complex and ongoing issue. It involves the development of policies and regulations that balance the need for open science practices with the need for economic sustainability.\n\nIn conclusion, the economics of open science is a complex and multifaceted field that involves the examination of the financial aspects of open science practices. It includes the development of economic models, the analysis of costs and benefits, and the regulation of open science practices to ensure economic sustainability.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Economics_of_open_science\" following this outline:\n\n#Economic models\n##Open science club\n###Definitions of knowledge club\n###Knowledge club and open science\n##Open Science market\n###Scientific publishing: a hybrid market\n###From readers to authors: hybrid and full open access\n###From publishing to analytics: diversification of revenue streams\n##Open Science Commons\n###The emergence of digital knowledge commons\n###Enclosures of open science commons\n###Consolidation of the common ecosystem (2015-)\n#Cost\n##Editorial work and evaluation\n##Technical infrastructure\n##Commercial services and prestige\n#Benefits\n##Transaction costs\n##Access costs\n##Research efficiency\n##Economic and social development\n#Economic regulation of open science\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Koufax is widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, known for his exceptional control, speed, and dominance on the mound. His impressive career was marked by several milestones, including four no-hitters, one perfect game, and a World Series championship.\n\nEarly life\n\nSandy Koufax was born Sanford Braun on December 30, 1935, in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family. His father, Jack Braun, was a successful business owner, and his mother, Selma Braun, was a homemaker. Koufax grew up in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush, where he developed a passion for baseball at an early age. He attended Lafayette High School, where he played baseball and basketball, and was discovered by the Brooklyn Dodgers during a tryout in 1953.\n\nMajor League tryouts\n\nKoufax's first tryout with the Brooklyn Dodgers was in 1953, when he was 17 years old. He impressed the team's scout, Eddie Brinkman, with his exceptional control and speed, and was offered a contract. However, Koufax was hesitant to sign, as he wanted to attend college. He eventually signed with the Dodgers in 1954, but was assigned to the team's Minor League affiliate, the Montreal Royals.\n\nProfessional career\n\nEarly years (1955–1960)\n\nKoufax made his Major League debut on June 24, 1955, at age 19, against the Philadelphia Phillies. He pitched six innings, allowing three runs on five hits, and earned his first win. Over the next five seasons, Koufax developed into a reliable starting pitcher, averaging over 100 innings per season. However, he struggled with control, walking over 100 batters in each of his first four seasons.\n\nDomination (1961–1964)\n\n1961 season\n\nKoufax's breakout season came in 1961, when he went 18-13 with a 2.70 ERA, striking out 248 batters. He threw 16 complete games, including five shutouts, and earned his first All-Star selection. Koufax's impressive performance earned him the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year award.\n\n1962 season\n\nIn 1962, Koufax continued to dominate on the mound, going 14-11 with a 2.82 ERA. He threw 15 complete games, including four shutouts, and struck out 216 batters. Koufax's impressive performance earned him his second consecutive All-Star selection.\n\n1963 season\n\nKoufax's 1963 season was his best to date, as he went 25-5 with a 1.88 ERA, striking out 306 batters. He threw 16 complete games, including six shutouts, and earned his third consecutive All-Star selection. Koufax's impressive performance earned him the NL Cy Young Award.\n\nSalary dispute\n\n1964 season\n\nIn 1964, Koufax and the Dodgers engaged in a salary dispute, as Koufax demanded a significant raise. The dispute led to Koufax holding out from the team, and he missed the first 22 games of the season. Koufax eventually signed a new contract, but the dispute had a lasting impact on his relationship with the team.\n\nPlaying in pain (1965–66)\n\n1965 season\n\nKoufax's 1965 season was marked by a series of injuries, including a sore elbow and a bruised pitching arm. Despite the injuries, Koufax continued to pitch, going 11-13 with a 3.27 ERA. On June 4, 1965, Koufax pitched his second no-hitter against the Chicago Cubs, becoming the first pitcher in history to throw multiple no-hitters in consecutive seasons.\n\nPerfection\n\nOn September 9, 1965, Koufax pitched his perfect game against the Chicago Cubs, striking out 14 batters in a 1-0 victory. Koufax's perfect game was the first in Dodgers history, and it cemented his status as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history.\n\nWorld Series and Yom Kippur decision\n\nIn the 1965 World Series, Koufax pitched two complete games, including a shutout in Game 6. However, the Dodgers ultimately lost the series to the Minnesota Twins. Koufax was criticized for sitting out Game 1 of the World Series, as he had planned to observe the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. Koufax had decided to sit out the game, despite the pressure from the team and the press, and his decision was widely respected.\n\nHoldout\n\n1966 season\n\nIn 1966, Koufax held out from the team, as he demanded a significant raise. Koufax eventually signed a new contract, but the holdout had a lasting impact on his relationship with the team.\n\nRetirement\n\nKoufax's final season in 1966 was marked by a series of injuries, including a sore elbow and a bruised pitching arm. Despite the injuries, Koufax continued to pitch, going 10-6 with a 2.51 ERA. Koufax officially retired on September 29, 1966, at age 30.\n\nCareer overall\n\nStatistics and achievements\n\nKoufax's career statistics are impressive, with a 2.76 ERA, 2,396 strikeouts, and 137 wins. He threw four no-hitters, including one perfect game, and earned four World Series starts. Koufax was a four-time All-Star and won the NL Cy Young Award in 1963.\n\nPitching style and repertoire\n\nKoufax's pitching style was characterized by his exceptional control, speed, and movement. He threw four pitches: the fastball, curveball, changeup, and slider. Koufax's fastball was considered one of the fastest in the game, with a top speed of over 100 mph. His curveball and changeup were considered among the best in the game, and he was known for his ability to throw a ball that would drop off the table.\n\nPost-playing activities\n\nAfter his retirement, Koufax went on to become a sports broadcaster, working for NBC and ESPN. He also served as a pitching coach for the Dodgers and was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972.\n\nHonors and recognition\n\nKoufax has been recognized for his contributions to baseball, including:\n\n* National Baseball Hall of Fame (1972)\n* MLB All-Century Team (1999)\n* Dodgers Hall of Fame (1990)\n* Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) All-Time Team (1997)\n\nLegacy\n\nImpact within the Jewish community\n\nKoufax's legacy extends beyond his impressive baseball career. He is widely regarded as a hero within the Jewish community, known for his commitment to his faith and his community. Koufax's decision to sit out Game 1 of the 1965 World Series to observe Yom Kippur was widely respected, and it cemented his status as a role model for Jewish athletes.\n\nRelationship with fellow minorities\n\nKoufax's relationship with fellow minorities was marked by his commitment to social justice. He was a vocal supporter of the Civil Rights Movement, and he was a close friend of baseball legend Jackie Robinson. Koufax's friendship with Robinson was particularly significant, as it helped to bridge the gap between the Jewish and African American communities.\n\nIn media culture\n\nTelevision appearances\n\nKoufax has made numerous television appearances, including:\n\n* \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson (1965)\n* \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" (1965)\n* \"The Mike Douglas Show\" (1966)\n\nCultural references\n\nKoufax has been referenced in popular culture, including:\n\n* \"The Simpsons\" (1995)\n* \"Seinfeld\" (1995)\n* \"The Larry Sanders Show\" (1997)\n\nPersonal life\n\nKoufax was married to actress Janice Holt from 1961 until their divorce in 1995.

The term anti-Zionism has been used to describe a wide range of views and actions, from opposition to Zionism as a nationalist movement to outright antisemitism. This article provides an overview of the history and development of anti-Zionism, its different forms and expressions, and its relationship to antisemitism.\n\nAnti-Zionism before 1948\n-------------------------\n\n### Early Jewish Anti-Zionism\n\nJewish opposition to Zionism existed from the early days of the movement. Some Jewish intellectuals, such as Theodor Herzl's critic, Asher Ginzberg, argued that Zionism was a betrayal of Jewish values and that the focus should be on assimilation and integration into European society. Others, such as the Bund, a Jewish socialist organization, opposed Zionism on the grounds that it would lead to the creation of a Jewish state that would be hostile to socialism and labor rights.\n\n### Early Arab Anti-Zionism\n\nArab opposition to Zionism also existed from the early days of the movement. The Arab population of Palestine, which was then under Ottoman rule, saw the arrival of Jewish immigrants as a threat to their land and their way of life. In 1919, the Arab Executive, a leading Arab nationalist organization, issued a statement opposing the Balfour Declaration, which had promised British support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine.\n\n### Reactions to the Balfour Declaration\n\nThe Balfour Declaration, issued by the British government in 1917, was a statement of support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The declaration was met with widespread opposition from Arab leaders, who saw it as a betrayal of British promises to support Arab independence. The Arab population of Palestine also opposed the declaration, fearing that it would lead to the displacement of Arabs and the creation of a Jewish state.\n\n### Anti-Zionism in the 1920s–1930s\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, anti-Zionism became a major issue in Palestinian politics. The Arab Higher Committee, a leading Palestinian nationalist organization, opposed the Zionist movement and called for Arab independence. The Arab opposition to Zionism was also fueled by the growing number of Jewish immigrants to Palestine, which led to tensions and conflicts between Arabs and Jews.\n\n### The Biltmore Programme and its Anti-Zionism Fall-out\n\nThe Biltmore Programme, adopted by the Zionist movement in 1942, called for the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine, regardless of the wishes of the Arab population. The programme was met with widespread opposition from Arab leaders, who saw it as a threat to their independence and their way of life. The Biltmore Programme also led to a split within the Zionist movement, with some opponents arguing that it was too radical and would lead to conflict with the Arab population.\n\n### Religious\n\nReligious opposition to Zionism has existed from the early days of the movement. Some Christian denominations, such as the Greek Orthodox Church, have opposed Zionism on the grounds that it is a secular movement that undermines the authority of the Church. In the Muslim world, some Islamic scholars have argued that Zionism is a heretical movement that seeks to undermine the authority of the Quran and the Hadith.\n\nAnti-Zionism after World War II and the Creation of Israel\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1947–1948\n\nIn 1947, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) recommended the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem to be administered by the United Nations. The Jewish Agency accepted the plan, while the Arab Higher Committee rejected it. In May 1948, Israel declared its independence, and the Arab armies launched a war against the new state.\n\n### Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union was a major supporter of anti-Zionism in the post-war period. The Soviet government saw Zionism as a bourgeois nationalist movement that was opposed to socialism and communism. The Soviet Union also opposed the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine, seeing it as a threat to the interests of the Arab states and the socialist bloc.\n\n### Arab and Palestinian Anti-Zionism\n\nArab and Palestinian opposition to Zionism continued to grow in the post-war period. The Arab League, a leading Arab nationalist organization, opposed the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine and called for Arab independence. The Palestinian people also opposed Zionism, seeing it as a threat to their land and their way of life.\n\n### Perception of Zionism as Racism\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, some critics of Zionism began to argue that the movement was racist in nature. They pointed to the treatment of Arab citizens in Israel, the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the exclusion of Palestinian refugees from the right of return. The 1975 United Nations General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism was a major turning point in the debate, with many countries around the world adopting similar resolutions.\n\n### During the Cold War\n\nDuring the Cold War, anti-Zionism was often linked to anti-Americanism and anti-Westernism. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries saw Zionism as a bourgeois nationalist movement that was opposed to socialism and communism. Many Arab and Muslim countries also saw Zionism as a threat to their independence and their way of life.\n\n### After the Cold War\n\nIn the post-Cold War period, anti-Zionism has continued to evolve and adapt. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War led to a decline in anti-Zionism as a major international issue. However, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has continued to simmer, with many countries around the world opposing the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\n### Islamic Perspectives\n\nIslamic opposition to Zionism has existed from the early days of the movement. Many Islamic scholars have argued that Zionism is a heretical movement that undermines the authority of the Quran and the Hadith. Some Islamic leaders have also called for the boycott of Israel and the support of the Palestinian people.\n\n### Left-Wing Politics\n\nLeft-wing opposition to Zionism has existed from the early days of the movement. Many socialist and communist parties have opposed Zionism on the grounds that it is a bourgeois nationalist movement that is opposed to socialism and labor rights. Some left-wing critics of Zionism have also argued that the movement is racist in nature.\n\n### Christian Anti-Zionism\n\nChristian opposition to Zionism has existed from the early days of the movement. Some Christian denominations, such as the Greek Orthodox Church, have opposed Zionism on the grounds that it is a secular movement that undermines the authority of the Church. In the United States, some Christian leaders have also called for the boycott of Israel and the support of the Palestinian people.\n\nAllegations of Antisemitism\n-------------------------\n\n### Jewish Right to a State\n\nSome critics of anti-Zionism have argued that the movement is inherently antisemitic in nature. They point to the fact that anti-Zionism often involves opposition to the very existence of a Jewish state, which they see as a form of delegitimization and discrimination against the Jewish people.\n\n### Equating and Correlating Anti-Zionism with Antisemitism\n\nIn 2016, the United States State Department issued a report that equated anti-Zionism with antisemitism. The report argued that anti-Zionism often involves a form of delegitimization and discrimination against the Jewish people, which is a hallmark of antisemitism. However, many critics of the report argued that it was a form of censorship and a threat to free speech.\n\n### View that the Two Are Not Interlinked\n\nMany critics of anti-Zionism have argued that the movement is not inherently antisemitic in nature. They point to the fact that anti-Zionism often involves opposition to the Israeli government's policies and actions, rather than the Jewish people as a whole. Some critics of anti-Zionism have also argued that the movement is a form of criticism of Israeli policy, rather than a form of hatred or bigotry against the Jewish people.\n\n### Shifting Positions on the Zionist/Anti-Zionist Spectrum\n\nIn recent years, there has been a shift in the debate over Zionism and anti-Zionism. Some critics of Zionism have begun to argue that the movement is a form of colonialism and imperialism, rather than a form of nationalism or patriotism. Others have argued that Zionism is a form of racism and apartheid, rather than a form of legitimate self-determination.\n\n### Far-Right Politics\n\nFar-right opposition to Zionism has existed from the early days of the movement. Some far-right leaders have argued that Zionism is a form of globalism or internationalism that undermines national sovereignty and identity. Others have argued that Zionism is a form of conspiracy theory or anti-Christian ideology.\n\n### Conspiracy Theories\n\nSome critics of Zionism have argued that the movement is a form of conspiracy theory or anti-Christian ideology. They point to the fact that some critics of Zionism have argued that the movement is controlled by a secret cabal of Jewish leaders or that it is a form of anti-Christian or anti-Islamic ideology. However, many critics of anti-Zionism have argued that these claims are unfounded and lack evidence.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* Zionism\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n* Anti-Semitism\n* Racism\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nCitations\n--------\n\nSources\n-------\n\n* The Oxford Handbook of the History of Zionism.

The DPR and LPR are two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine that declared independence in 2014, following the ousting of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. The international community has responded to this situation with varying degrees of recognition, support, and condemnation.\n\n# History\n\nThe conflict in eastern Ukraine began in April 2014, when pro-Russian protesters in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions demanded greater autonomy from Kyiv. The situation escalated into a full-blown conflict between the Ukrainian government and the separatist groups in the region. In May 2014, the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic were established, with their own governments and constitutions.\n\nThe DPR and LPR declared independence from Ukraine, citing the need for self-determination and protection from the Ukrainian government, which they accused of being anti-Russian and repressive. The Ukrainian government, on the other hand, viewed the separatist movements as terrorist organizations and a threat to national security.\n\n# Aftermath of Russian Recognition\n\nIn February 2015, Russia recognized the DPR and LPR as \"independent states,\" a move that was widely condemned by the international community. The recognition was seen as a clear escalation of Russia's involvement in the conflict, and it led to increased tensions between Russia and the West.\n\nThe recognition of the DPR and LPR as independent states by Russia was a significant departure from Moscow's earlier stance of supporting the separatist groups as \"people's republics\" or \"self-proclaimed entities.\" The change in language was seen as a sign that Russia was taking a more direct role in the conflict and was preparing to provide military support to the separatist groups.\n\n## Countries and Entities that Recognized the DPR and LPR as Independent States\n\n### UN Member States\n\nOnly a handful of UN member states have recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states. These include:\n\n* Russia (February 2015)\n* Nicaragua (May 2018)\n* Venezuela (May 2018)\n* Abkhazia (September 2018)\n* South Ossetia (September 2018)\n* Nagorno-Karabakh (September 2018)\n\nThese countries have recognized the DPR and LPR as sovereign states, although their recognition is not universally accepted and has been met with criticism and condemnation from other countries.\n\n### Non-UN States\n\nSeveral non-UN states have also recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states. These include:\n\n* Transnistria (a breakaway region in Moldova)\n* North Ossetia (a republic in Russia)\n* Chechnya (a republic in Russia)\n* Dagestan (a republic in Russia)\n* Ingushetia (a republic in Russia)\n\nThese non-UN states have recognized the DPR and LPR as sovereign states, although their recognition is not universally accepted and has been met with criticism and condemnation from other countries.\n\n# Positions by Other Countries\n\n## Countries and Entities that Supported Recognizing the DPR and LPR as Independent States\n\n### UN Member States\n\nSeveral UN member states have expressed support for recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states. These include:\n\n* Belarus (which has maintained good relations with both Ukraine and Russia)\n* China (which has supported the \"one-China\" principle and has been critical of Western interference in Ukraine)\n* Cuba (which has supported the DPR and LPR as \"people's republics\")\n* Iran (which has supported the DPR and LPR as \"independent states\")\n* Syria (which has supported the DPR and LPR as \"people's republics\")\n\nThese countries have expressed support for recognizing the DPR and LPR as independent states, although their recognition is not universally accepted and has been met with criticism and condemnation from other countries.\n\n## Countries and Entities that Did Not Support Recognizing the DPR and LPR as Independent States\n\n### UN Member States\n\nMost UN member states have not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states. These include:\n\n* The United States (which has imposed sanctions on Russia and has supported Ukraine's territorial integrity)\n* The European Union (which has imposed sanctions on Russia and has supported Ukraine's territorial integrity)\n* Canada (which has imposed sanctions on Russia and has supported Ukraine's territorial integrity)\n* Australia (which has imposed sanctions on Russia and has supported Ukraine's territorial integrity)\n* Japan (which has imposed sanctions on Russia and has supported Ukraine's territorial integrity)\n\nThese countries have not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states and have instead supported Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n\n### Non-UN States\n\nSeveral non-UN states have also not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states. These include:\n\n* Taiwan (which has maintained good relations with Ukraine and has supported Ukraine's territorial integrity)\n* Kosovo (which has maintained good relations with Ukraine and has supported Ukraine's territorial integrity)\n* Montenegro (which has maintained good relations with Ukraine and has supported Ukraine's territorial integrity)\n\nThese non-UN states have not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states and have instead supported Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n\n### International and Regional Organizations\n\nSeveral international and regional organizations have also not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states. These include:\n\n* The United Nations (which has not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states)\n* The European Union (which has not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states)\n* The Council of Europe (which has not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states)\n* The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) (which has not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states)\n\nThese international and regional organizations have not recognized the DPR and LPR as independent states and have instead supported Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n\n# See Also\n\n* Ukrainian-Russian War\n* Euromaidan\n* Russian annexation of Crimea\n* Separatism in Ukraine\n* Donbas War\n\n# Notes\n\nThe international recognition of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic is a complex and multifaceted issue that has significant implications for international relations and global stability.

She was the youngest of two children, with an older brother, Dianne. Her mother, a science technician, and father, a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, divorced when Rowling was nine years old. The family moved to Winterbourne, Bristol, and later to Tutshill, near Chepstow, Wales, where Rowling spent much of her childhood.\n\n### Secondary School and University\n\nRowling attended St. Michael's Primary School in Winterbourne and later Wyedean School and College in Gloucestershire. She showed a keen interest in writing and drawing from an early age, and her first story, \"Rabbit,\" was written at the age of six. After completing her secondary education, Rowling attended the University of Exeter, where she studied French and Classics. During her time at university, she met her first husband, Jorge Arantes, a Portuguese television journalist, and the couple married in 1992.\n\n### Inspiration and Mother's Death\n\nIn 1990, while on a train ride from Manchester to London, Rowling conceived the idea for Harry Potter and began developing the story over the next five years. Her mother, who had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, passed away in 1991, and Rowling's subsequent grief and guilt influenced the writing of the series. Rowling's mother's death also led to her decision to keep her daughter's name, Jessica, a nod to her mother's name.\n\n### Marriage, Divorce, and Single Parenthood\n\nAfter her marriage to Arantes ended in divorce in 1995, Rowling moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, with her daughter, Jessica. She began teaching English as a foreign language to support herself and her daughter, who was born in 1993. In 2001, Rowling married Neil Murray, a Scottish doctor, with whom she has two sons, David and Mackenzie.\n\n### Publishing Harry Potter\n\nRowling's manuscript for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (published as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States) was rejected by twelve publishers before it was accepted by Bloomsbury in 1997. The book's success was rapid, and the series went on to become a global phenomenon, with the publication of seven subsequent books. The franchise expanded to include film adaptations, merchandise, and theme parks.\n\n### Films\n\nThe Harry Potter film series, produced by Warner Bros., began in 2001 with the release of the first film, directed by Chris Columbus. The series went on to become one of the highest-grossing film franchises in history, with eight films released between 2001 and 2011. Rowling also produced the spin-off film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) and its sequel, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018).\n\n### Religion, Wealth, and Remarriage\n\nRowling is a practicing Christian and has been open about her faith. She has also spoken about the impact of her wealth on her life, stating that she feels a sense of responsibility to use her wealth to make a positive difference. In 2011, Rowling married Neil Murray for the second time, and the couple continues to live in Edinburgh.\n\n### Adult Fiction and Robert Galbraith\n\nIn 2013, Rowling published The Cuckoo's Calling under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, a crime fiction novel that received positive reviews. The book was later revealed to be written by Rowling, and the pseudonym was dropped. The Cormoran Strike series, which includes The Silkworm (2014) and Career of Evil (2015), has been adapted into a television series.\n\n### Later Harry Potter Works\n\nIn 2016, Rowling published the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, a two-part stage play set nineteen years after the events of the original series. The play has been a critical and commercial success, and has been performed in London's West End and on Broadway.\n\n### Children's Stories\n\nIn addition to the Harry Potter series, Rowling has published several children's stories, including The Tales of Beedle the Bard (2008) and the companion book to the Fantastic Beasts film series, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald – The Original Screenplay (2018).\n\n**Influences**\n\nRowling's work has been influenced by various authors, including Philip Pullman, Terry Pratchett, and J.R.R. Tolkien. She has also cited the impact of mythology and folklore on her writing, particularly in the creation of the wizarding world.\n\n**Style and Themes**\n\n### Style and Allusions\n\nRowling's writing style is characterized by her use of vivid descriptions, complex characters, and allusions to mythology and literature. Her use of language is often described as lyrical and imaginative, and her stories often contain hidden meanings and symbolism.\n\n### Themes\n\nRowling's work explores various themes, including prejudice, friendship, love, and the struggle between good and evil. Her stories often examine the complexities of human nature and the importance of empathy and understanding.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Gender and Social Division\n\nRowling's work has been the subject of controversy, particularly with regards to the portrayal of women and social division. Critics have argued that the series reinforces traditional stereotypes and perpetuates a binary view of the world.\n\n### Religious Reactions\n\nThe Harry Potter series has been the subject of criticism from some Christian groups, who have argued that the books promote witchcraft and paganism. Rowling has responded to these criticisms, stating that her work is not intended to promote any particular ideology or worldview.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nRowling's impact on popular culture is significant, and her work has been translated into more than eighty languages. The Harry Potter series has been credited with inspiring a new generation of readers and has been adapted into numerous films, plays, and other forms of media.\n\n**Legal Disputes**\n\nRowling has been involved in several high-profile legal disputes, including a lawsuit against the publisher, Warner Bros., over the film rights to the Harry Potter series. She has also been sued by a former business partner over the ownership of the franchise.\n\n**Philanthropy**\n\nRowling is a philanthropist and has donated to various charitable causes, including the Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Anti-Bullying Alliance, and the Children's Hospice. She has also established the Volant Charitable Trust, which supports various charitable initiatives.\n\n**Views**\n\n### Politics\n\nRowling has expressed her views on various political issues, including the death penalty, poverty, and education. She has also been involved in several high-profile debates on social media.\n\n### Press\n\nRowling has been the subject of numerous interviews and profiles in the press, and has been featured on the cover of various magazines and newspapers. She has also been the subject of several biographies and documentaries.\n\n### Transgender People\n\nRowling has been criticized for her views on transgender people, particularly with regards to the use of the term \"people who menstruate\" in a 2020 article. She has since apologized for any offense caused and has stated that she supports the rights of transgender individuals.\n\n**Awards and Honours**\n\nRowling has received numerous awards and honors for her work, including the National Book Award, the Hugo Award, and the Order of the British Empire. She has also been named one of the most influential people in the world by Time magazine.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997)\n* Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (1998)\n* Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (1999)\n* Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000)\n* Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2003)\n* Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005)\n* Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007)\n* The Tales of Beedle the Bard (2008)\n* The Cuckoo's Calling (2013)\n* The Silkworm (2014)\n* Career of Evil (2015)\n* Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (2016)\n\n**Filmography**\n\n### Film\n\n* Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001)\n* Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)\n* Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)\n* Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)\n* Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)\n* Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)\n* Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 (2010)\n* Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011)\n* Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016)\n* Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018)\n\n### Television\n\n* Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald – The Original Screenplay (2018)\n* The Cormoran Strike series (2017-present)\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article uses the pseudonym \"Robert Galbraith\" to refer to J.K.

From the early days of the Russian Empire to the present day, Russian cinema has evolved significantly, reflecting the country's complex and often tumultuous history.\n\n**Cinema of the Russian Empire**\n\nThe first film screenings in Russia took place in the late 1890s, shortly after the invention of the cinematograph by the Lumière brothers. The first Russian film production company, the Khantov Film Studio, was established in 1907, and the country's first film director, Alexander Drankov, began making films in 1908. During this period, Russian cinema was heavily influenced by Western European and American films, and many Russian filmmakers traveled to Europe to study and work with prominent directors.\n\nSome notable films from this era include \"Stenka Razin\" (1908), directed by Alexander Drankov, and \"Aelita: Queen of Mars\" (1918), directed by Yakov Protasanov. Despite these early successes, the Russian film industry faced significant challenges, including limited resources, censorship, and competition from foreign films.\n\n**Cinema of the Soviet Union**\n\nWith the October Revolution in 1917, the Russian Empire was overthrown, and the Soviet Union was established. The Soviet government actively promoted the development of the film industry, recognizing its potential as a powerful tool for propaganda and education. The first Soviet film studio, Mezhrabpom-Rus, was established in 1921, and the country's first film director, Abram Room, began making films in the 1920s.\n\n**Early Soviet cinema (1917–1953)**\n\nDuring the early years of the Soviet Union, cinema played a significant role in promoting the ideals of socialism and communism. Many films from this era focused on themes of social justice, revolution, and the struggle against capitalism. Some notable films from this period include \"The Battleship Potemkin\" (1925), directed by Sergei Eisenstein, and \"October: Ten Days That Shook the World\" (1928), directed by Sergei Eisenstein and Grigori Aleksandrov.\n\nEisenstein's films, in particular, are considered some of the greatest works of Soviet cinema. His use of montage and other cinematic techniques revolutionized the art of filmmaking and influenced directors around the world.\n\n**Late Soviet cinema (1953–1990)**\n\nDuring the later years of the Soviet Union, cinema continued to play a significant role in promoting the ideals of socialism and communism. However, the industry faced significant challenges, including censorship, bureaucratic red tape, and limited resources. Many Soviet filmmakers turned to science fiction, fantasy, and other genres as a way to express themselves creatively.\n\nSome notable films from this period include \"The Iron Flower\" (1956), directed by Yuli Raizman, and \"The Elusive Avengers\" (1966), directed by Gennadi Vasilyev. Despite these challenges, the Soviet film industry continued to produce high-quality films that were widely acclaimed around the world.\n\n**New Russian cinema**\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian film industry underwent significant changes. Many Soviet filmmakers continued to work in the industry, but new talent and new ideas emerged. The 1990s saw the rise of a new generation of Russian filmmakers who were influenced by Western cinema and eager to experiment with new styles and techniques.\n\n**1990s**\n\nDuring the 1990s, Russian cinema experienced a renaissance, with many talented filmmakers emerging. Some notable films from this period include \"The Return\" (1992), directed by Andrei Zvyagintsev, and \"The Barber of Siberia\" (1998), directed by Nikita Mikhalkov. These films showcased the diversity and creativity of Russian cinema, and many received international recognition and acclaim.\n\n**2000s**\n\nIn the 2000s, Russian cinema continued to evolve and grow. Many filmmakers turned to historical dramas, biographical films, and other genres that explored the complexities of Russian history and culture. Some notable films from this period include \"The Island\" (2006), directed by Pavel Lungin, and \"12\" (2007), directed by Nikita Mikhalkov.\n\n**2010s**\n\nIn the 2010s, Russian cinema continued to produce high-quality films that were widely acclaimed around the world. Many filmmakers turned to science fiction, fantasy, and other genres as a way to express themselves creatively. Some notable films from this period include \"Leviathan\" (2014), directed by Andrei Zvyagintsev, and \"The Journey of a Red Fawn\" (2015), directed by Renat Davletyarov.\n\n**2020s**\n\nIn the 2020s, Russian cinema continued to evolve and grow. Many filmmakers turned to streaming platforms and other new technologies as a way to reach wider audiences and experiment with new styles and techniques. Some notable films from this period include \"The Battle of Durga\" (2020), directed by Andrey Zolotarev, and \"No Letter from You\" (2020), directed by Roman Parfenov.\n\n**2022 boycott**\n\nIn 2022, the Russian film industry faced a significant challenge with the boycott of Russian films and talent in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine. Many international film festivals and organizations announced that they would no longer participate in Russian films or collaborate with Russian filmmakers. This boycott had a significant impact on the Russian film industry, with many filmmakers and studios struggling to access funding and resources.\n\n**Russian film production**\n\nThe Russian film industry is a significant player in the global market, with many studios and production companies producing high-quality films that are widely acclaimed around the world.

The court has ordered the parties to submit a trial plan and to identify potential witnesses and exhibits.\n\n### **Gag order**\n\nThe court has issued a gag order, prohibiting the parties from making public statements about the case. However, some parties have been allowed to make limited statements to the press.\n\n### **Statute of limitations**\n\nThe statute of limitations for the charges is set to expire in 2024.

JWST is a collaborative project between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), with the primary goal of conducting infrared astronomy and making significant advancements in the field of space exploration.\n\n**Features**\n\n#### Location and Orbit\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is in a halo orbit around the L2 (Lagrange point 2), a gravitationally stable location approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. This orbit allows JWST to maintain a stable temperature and minimize the amount of solar radiation it receives, which is essential for its infrared instruments.\n\n#### Sunshield Protection\n\nJWST is equipped with a large sunshield, which is a critical component of its design. The sunshield, composed of five layers of Kapton, measures approximately 21.2 meters in diameter and provides protection from the intense sunlight and heat that JWST would otherwise receive. The sunshield is designed to maintain a temperature difference of approximately 50°C between the warm side and the cold side of the observatory.\n\n#### Optics\n\nJWST is equipped with a 6.5-meter primary mirror made of 18 hexagonal segments made of beryllium. These segments are coated with a thin layer of gold to maximize their reflectivity. The primary mirror is designed to collect and focus infrared radiation from distant objects in space. JWST also has a secondary mirror that is used to focus the light onto the scientific instruments.\n\n#### Scientific Instruments\n\nJWST is equipped with four scientific instruments designed to capture a wide range of data and conduct various types of observations:\n\n* **NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera)**: A camera that captures images in the near-infrared spectrum, which is used to study the formation of galaxies and stars.\n* **NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph)**: A spectrograph that captures the spectrum of objects in space, which is used to study the composition and properties of distant objects.\n* **MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument)**: A camera and spectrograph that captures images and spectra in the mid-infrared spectrum, which is used to study the formation of stars and planets.\n* **FGS/NIRISS (Fine Guidance Sensor and Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph)**: A camera and spectrograph that captures images and spectra in the near-infrared spectrum, which is used to study the formation of galaxies and stars.\n\n#### Spacecraft Bus\n\nThe spacecraft bus, also known as the Service Module, is the core of the JWST spacecraft. It contains the majority of the spacecraft's electronics, power generation, and communication systems. The spacecraft bus is designed to maintain a stable temperature and provide power to the scientific instruments.\n\n#### Servicing\n\nJWST has a limited ability to perform servicing, such as adjusting its orbit or performing routine maintenance. However, it is not designed to be serviced by astronauts or robotic spacecraft.\n\n#### Software\n\nJWST uses a combination of software and firmware to control its various systems and instruments. The spacecraft's onboard computer, called the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), is responsible for managing the flow of data and commands to and from the scientific instruments.\n\n**Comparison with other telescopes**\n\nJWST is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, and it is designed to make significant advancements in the field of infrared astronomy. JWST has several key advantages over Hubble, including its ability to capture higher-resolution images and spectra, and its ability to observe objects at much greater distances.\n\nJWST is also similar to the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is also an infrared observatory. However, JWST has several key advantages over Spitzer, including its ability to capture higher-resolution images and spectra, and its ability to observe objects at much greater distances.\n\n**Development history**\n\n#### Background (development to 2003)\n\nThe concept of the James Webb Space Telescope was first proposed in the late 1990s as a follow-on to the Hubble Space Telescope. The project was initially called the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST), and it was designed to conduct infrared astronomy. The project gained momentum in the early 2000s, and it was officially approved by NASA in 2003.\n\n#### Early development and replanning (2003–2007)\n\nIn the early 2000s, the JWST project underwent significant changes and replanning. The project was moved from the Hubble Space Telescope's prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, to Northrop Grumman. The project also underwent significant changes to its design and budget.\n\n#### Detailed design and construction (2007–2021)\n\nIn 2007, the JWST project entered its detailed design and construction phase. The project's primary mirror was manufactured by Northrop Grumman, and the spacecraft bus was manufactured by Ball Aerospace. The project's scientific instruments were also developed and tested.\n\n#### Cost and schedule issues\n\nThe JWST project experienced significant cost and schedule issues during its development. The project's budget was increased from $3.5 billion to $8.7 billion, and its launch date was delayed several times.\n\n#### Partnership\n\nThe JWST project is a collaborative effort between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The ESA provided a significant portion of the project's budget, and the CSA provided a smaller portion.\n\n#### Naming concerns\n\nThe JWST project was initially called the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST), but it was later renamed in honor of James E. Webb, who was the second administrator of NASA. Some astronomers and engineers objected to the naming of the project after Webb, citing his role in the termination of the Apollo program.\n\n**Mission goals**\n\n#### Orbit design\n\nThe JWST spacecraft is in a halo orbit around the L2 (Lagrange point 2), which is a gravitationally stable location approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. This orbit allows JWST to maintain a stable temperature and minimize the amount of solar radiation it receives.\n\n#### Infrared astronomy\n\nJWST is designed to conduct infrared astronomy, which involves the study of objects and phenomena that emit or reflect infrared radiation. JWST's primary mirror and scientific instruments are designed to capture high-resolution images and spectra of objects in the infrared spectrum.\n\n**Ground support and operations**\n\n#### Micrometeoroid strike\n\nJWST is designed to withstand micrometeoroid strikes, which can damage its primary mirror and other components. The spacecraft has a shield made of Kapton that provides protection from micrometeoroids.\n\n**From launch through commissioning**\n\n#### Launch\n\nJWST was launched on December 25, 2021, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana.\n\n#### Transit and structural deployment\n\nAfter launch, JWST traveled through space for approximately six months, during which time it deployed its sunshield and primary mirror. The spacecraft also conducted a series of tests to ensure that its systems were functioning properly.\n\n#### Commissioning and testing\n\nAfter deploying its primary mirror and sunshield, JWST began its commissioning and testing phase. During this phase, the spacecraft conducted a series of tests to ensure that its scientific instruments and systems were functioning properly.\n\n**Allocation of observation time**\n\n#### Early Release Science program\n\nThe Early Release Science program is a set of observations that were scheduled for JWST's first year of operation. The program included a series of observations of the galaxy Messier 100, which are used to study the formation of stars and galaxies.\n\n#### General Observer Program\n\nThe General Observer Program is a set of observations that are scheduled for JWST on a routine basis. The program includes a wide range of observations, including the study of stars, galaxies, and planets.\n\n**Scientific results**\n\n#### First full-color images\n\nJWST's first full-color images were released in July 2022, and they show the galaxy Messier 100 in unprecedented detail. The images show the galaxy's central bulge and spiral arms, which are home to billions of stars.\n\n#### Bright early galaxies\n\nJWST has also observed several bright early galaxies, which are thought to be among the first galaxies to form in the universe. These galaxies are incredibly luminous and are thought to be powered by massive black holes.\n\n#### Subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations\n\nJWST has made several subsequent noteworthy observations and interpretations, including the discovery of water vapor and organic molecules in the atmospheres of distant planets. The telescope has also observed the formation of stars and planets in the Orion Nebula and other star-forming regions.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* JWST's first full-color image of the galaxy Messier 100\n* JWST's observation of the bright early galaxy GN-z11\n* JWST's observation of the Orion Nebula\n* JWST's observation of the galaxy Messier 83\n\n**See also**\n\n* Hubble Space Telescope\n* Spitzer Space Telescope\n* Keck Observatory\n* Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n* European Space Agency\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a general overview of the James Webb Space Telescope and its mission.\n* The article is not intended to be a comprehensive technical guide to the telescope.\n* The article is based on publicly available information and has not been reviewed by NASA or any other organization.\n\n**References**\n\n* NASA (2022).
