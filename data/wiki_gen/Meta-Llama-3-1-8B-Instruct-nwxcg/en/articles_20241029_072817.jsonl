The election was the first to be held since the 2018 election and saw the centre-left coalition of the Social Democrats and the Greens form a government.\n\nBackground\n\nLöfven's government\n\nThe previous government, led by Prime Minister Stefan Löfven of the Social Democratic Party, had been in power since 2014. The government was formed by a centre-left coalition consisting of the Social Democrats, the Left Party, and the Green Party. The government's main policies included increasing taxes to fund social welfare programs, investing in renewable energy, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAndersson's government\n\nIn January 2021, Stefan Löfven resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded by Magdalena Andersson, who became the first female Prime Minister of Sweden. Andersson was also a member of the Social Democratic Party and continued the centre-left coalition's policies. However, her government was short-lived, as she resigned on the same day due to a budget vote. The Left Party had opposed the budget, and Andersson's government collapsed.\n\nElectoral system\n\nThe Swedish electoral system is based on proportional representation. The country is divided into 29 electoral constituencies, each electing multiple members to the Riksdag. The number of seats allocated to each constituency is determined by the total number of votes cast in that constituency.

However, some countries have taken a more neutral stance, while others have expressed support for Russia's actions. This article will explore the various reactions to the invasion, highlighting the positions of governments and intergovernmental organizations.\n\n**#Ukraine**\n\nThe government of Ukraine has been at the forefront of the response to the invasion, with President Volodymyr Zelensky and his administration working closely with international partners to coordinate a unified response. The Ukrainian government has continued to call for the international community to provide support, including military aid and economic assistance.\n\n**#Russia**\n\nThe Russian government has maintained that its actions in Ukraine are necessary to protect the rights of Russian-speaking citizens in the region. The Kremlin has also accused Ukraine of being a \"fascist\" state and has claimed that the international community is not doing enough to prevent Ukraine's alleged aggression. However, many countries have rejected these claims, viewing the invasion as a clear act of aggression.\n\n**#Other countries**\n\n**##Condemns Russia**\n\nMany countries have condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the majority of the European Union member states.

He has been a prominent figure in Sri Lankan politics for over four decades, known for his liberal and centre-left ideology.\n\n#Early life and education\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe was born on March 24, 1949, in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). He is the son of Esmond Wickremesinghe, a lawyer and politician, and Kulshusma Wickremesinghe. Wickremesinghe's family has a long history in Sri Lankan politics, with his father serving as a Member of Parliament (MP) and Minister of Justice.\n\nWickremesinghe attended Trinity College, Kandy, and later studied economics at the University of Peradeniya. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics, and later earned a Master's degree in economics from the University of Peradeniya.\n\n#Political career\n\nWickremesinghe's entry into politics began in the 1970s, when he joined the United National Party (UNP). He quickly rose through the ranks of the party, becoming a Member of Parliament (MP) in 1977.\n\n##Batalanda incident\n\nIn 1988, Wickremesinghe was involved in a controversy surrounding the Batalanda detention centre, a secret prison camp established by the government to detain suspected separatist militants. Wickremesinghe was accused of being involved in the torture and mistreatment of detainees at the centre, and was subsequently sacked as Minister of Youth Affairs by President Jayewardene.\n\n##First premiership (1993–1994)\n\nIn 1993, Wickremesinghe became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, replacing Dingiratne Gunawardena. He led a coalition government and implemented several key policies, including the introduction of a free market economy and the privatisation of state-owned enterprises.\n\nWickremesinghe's first premiership was marked by controversy, particularly regarding his handling of the country's human rights record. The government was accused of failing to prevent human rights abuses by state forces, and Wickremesinghe was criticized for his perceived complicity in these abuses.\n\n##Opposition (1994–2001)\n\nIn 1994, Wickremesinghe lost the general election to the People's Alliance (PA), a coalition of left-wing parties led by Chandrika Kumaratunga. He became the leader of the opposition, and spent the next seven years in opposition.\n\n###1999 presidential election\n\nIn 1999, Wickremesinghe ran for president against Kumaratunga, who was seeking re-election. Wickremesinghe's campaign focused on his economic policies and his promise to protect the country's liberal economy. However, he ultimately lost the election to Kumaratunga.\n\n##Second premiership (2001–2004)\n\nIn 2001, Wickremesinghe became Prime Minister again, this time leading a coalition government with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). He implemented several key policies, including the establishment of a peace process with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n\n###Peace talks\n\nWickremesinghe's government engaged in peace talks with the LTTE, which led to the signing of the Ceasefire Agreement (CFA) in 2002. However, the peace process ultimately failed to achieve its goals, and the conflict resumed in 2006.\n\n##Opposition (2004–2015)\n\nIn 2004, Wickremesinghe lost the general election to the PA, which had merged with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to form the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA). He became the leader of the opposition again, and spent the next 11 years in opposition.\n\n###2005 presidential election\n\nIn 2005, Wickremesinghe ran for president again, but lost the election to Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was seeking re-election.\n\n###Dissent within the UNP\n\nIn 2009, Wickremesinghe faced dissent within the UNP, with several MPs calling for him to step down as leader. He ultimately retained the leadership, but the party's fortunes continued to decline.\n\n###End of the civil war and 2010 presidential election\n\nIn 2010, Wickremesinghe lost the presidential election to Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was seeking re-election. However, Rajapaksa's victory was marred by allegations of electoral irregularities, and Wickremesinghe's party subsequently boycotted the election.\n\n##Third, fourth and fifth premierships (2015–2019)\n\nIn 2015, Wickremesinghe became Prime Minister again, leading a coalition government with the SLFP. He implemented several key policies, including the introduction of a new constitution and the establishment of a national minimum wage.\n\n###Foreign policy\n\nWickremesinghe's foreign policy focused on strengthening ties with India and other regional powers. He also sought to improve relations with the European Union and the United States.\n\n###Government bonds controversy\n\nIn 2016, Wickremesinghe's government faced controversy over the sale of government bonds to foreign investors. The government was accused of failing to disclose the true value of the bonds, and Wickremesinghe's office was criticized for its handling of the issue.\n\n##Opposition (2019–2022)\n\nIn 2019, Wickremesinghe lost the general election to Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was seeking to become president. He became the leader of the opposition again, and spent the next three years in opposition.\n\n##Sixth premiership (2022)\n\nIn 2022, Wickremesinghe became Prime Minister for a sixth time, leading a coalition government with the SLFP. He implemented several key policies, including the establishment of a new national security council and the introduction of a new tax regime.\n\n#Presidency (2022–2024)\n\nIn 2022, Wickremesinghe became President of Sri Lanka, replacing Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who had fled the country. He has since implemented several key policies, including the establishment of a new cabinet and the introduction of a new economic recovery plan.\n\n##Crackdown on anti-government protests\n\nIn 2022, Wickremesinghe's government faced criticism for its crackdown on anti-government protests. The government was accused of using excessive force and arresting hundreds of protesters, who were demanding economic reform and greater accountability.\n\n##Handling of economic crisis\n\nWickremesinghe's government has faced criticism for its handling of the country's economic crisis. The government has implemented several austerity measures, including the introduction of a new tax regime and the reduction of public sector salaries. However, the measures have been criticized for disproportionately affecting the poor and middle class.\n\n##2023 local government elections\n\nIn 2023, Wickremesinghe's government faced criticism for its handling of the local government elections. The government was accused of using state resources to influence the outcome of the election, and Wickremesinghe's party ultimately lost control of several key councils.\n\n##2024 presidential election\n\nIn 2024, Wickremesinghe will seek re-election as president. The election is expected to be closely contested, with several candidates vying for the top spot.\n\n#Family and personal life\n\nWickremesinghe is married to Maithree Wickramasinghe, and has two children, Nipuna and Arjun. He is a Buddhist and is known for his strong commitment to the values of Buddhism and the principles of democracy.\n\n#Honours\n\nWickremesinghe has been awarded several honors for his contributions to Sri Lankan politics, including the Order of the Lion of Sri Lanka, the Order of the Puskurajya, and the Order of the Most Exalted Order of the Pearl.\n\n#See also\n\n* Politics of Sri Lanka\n* History of Sri Lanka\n* List of Prime Ministers of Sri Lanka\n* List of Presidents of Sri Lanka\n\n#Notes\n\n* This article is a summary of the main events and policies of Ranil Wickremesinghe's career.\n* For a more detailed account of his career, see the references section.\n\n#References\n\n* Wickremesinghe, R.

It is located on the western coast of the island, approximately 35 miles northwest of Wailuku. With a population of around 12,000 people, Lahaina is one of the largest towns on Maui and a major tourist destination.\n\n# History\n\n## Name\n\n### Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n\nThe name \"Lahaina\" is derived from the Hawaiian language, with \"Lahaina\" meaning \"cruel sun\" or \"dreaded sun.\" The name reflects the town's history as a hub for whaling and trade, with the sun beating down on the town's residents and visitors alike. The name is pronounced \"lah-hi-nah\" by locals and visitors alike.\n\n### Ancient names\n\nBefore the arrival of European explorers, the area now known as Lahaina was inhabited by the Native Hawaiian people. The ancient name for the area is thought to have been \"Eia,\" which was also the name of a nearby stream.\n\n## Early rulers\n\nLahaina was an important settlement on the island of Maui long before the arrival of European explorers. In ancient times, the town was ruled by various ali'i (chiefs), including Kekaulike, who is credited with building the first temple in Lahaina. Other notable rulers of the area include Kahekili II, who united the islands of Maui and Oahu under one rule.\n\n## Western contact\n\n### Kahekili II\n\nKahekili II was a powerful ali'i who ruled over the islands of Maui and Oahu in the early 18th century. He was a skilled warrior and a wise leader, known for his ability to unite the warring factions of the islands under his rule. Kahekili II was also a patron of the arts and a supporter of the ancient Hawaiian traditions.\n\n### Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n\nIn the late 18th century, Kamehameha I and his son Kamehameha II conquered the islands of Hawaii, Maui, and Oahu, uniting them under one rule. Kamehameha I was a skilled warrior and a clever politician, known for his ability to unite the warring factions of the islands under his rule. Kamehameha II, on the other hand, was a more brutal leader, known for his role in the execution of his father's chief advisor and the persecution of the Christian missionaries.\n\n### Christian missionaries\n\nIn the early 19th century, Christian missionaries arrived in Lahaina, bringing with them the teachings of Christianity and the concept of Western-style education. The missionaries established a number of schools and churches in the town, including the Lahaina Chapel, which was built in 1820. The missionaries also played a significant role in the abolition of the Hawaiian practice of human sacrifice, which was a common practice in ancient Hawaii.\n\n### Whaling\n\nIn the early 19th century, Lahaina became a major hub for the whaling industry, with a number of whaling ships visiting the town each year. The town's proximity to the ocean and its natural harbor made it an ideal location for the whalers, who would come to the town to repair and refit their ships. The whaling industry brought a significant amount of wealth to the town, with many of the town's residents becoming wealthy merchants and traders.\n\n### Kamehameha III\n\nKamehameha III was the third king of Hawaii, ruling from 1825 to 1854. He was a wise and just leader, known for his ability to balance the competing interests of the different factions in the kingdom. Kamehameha III was also a patron of the arts and a supporter of the Hawaiian language and culture.\n\n### 20th century\n\nIn the 20th century, Lahaina underwent significant changes, driven by the growth of the tourism industry. The town's historic buildings were restored and preserved, and a number of new attractions and amenities were added, including the Lahaina Restoration Foundation, which was established in 1962 to preserve the town's historic buildings and cultural heritage.\n\n## 2023 wildfire\n\nIn June 2023, a wildfire broke out in the hills above Lahaina, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents and visitors. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not before it had destroyed a number of homes and businesses in the town.\n\n# Geography\n\n## Climate\n\nLahaina has a tropical savanna climate, with high temperatures and high levels of humidity throughout the year. The town experiences a wet season from November to March, with most of its annual rainfall occurring during this period. The dry season, which runs from April to October, is characterized by dry and sunny weather, with temperatures often reaching the mid-80s (°F).\n\n# Demographics\n\nAs of the 2020 United States Census, the population of Lahaina was 12,155 people. The town has a diverse population, with a mix of Native Hawaiians, Caucasians, Asians, and Pacific Islanders. The median age in Lahaina is 43.4 years, with a median household income of $83,419.\n\n# Arts and culture\n\nLahaina has a rich cultural heritage, with a number of historic buildings and landmarks that reflect the town's history and traditions. The town is home to a number of museums and cultural centers, including the Lahaina Heritage Trail, which features a number of historic sites and landmarks. The town also hosts a number of festivals and events throughout the year, including the Lahaina Arts Festival and the Maui Film Festival.\n\n# Sports\n\nLahaina is home to a number of sports teams, including the Lahaina Aquatics Center, which hosts a number of swimming and diving events throughout the year. The town is also home to the Lahaina Golf Club, which features an 18-hole golf course and a number of other amenities. In addition, the town hosts a number of other sports events, including the annual Lahaina Grand Prix, which features a number of road cycling and running events.\n\n# Popular culture\n\nLahaina has been featured in a number of popular culture productions, including films and television shows. The town's historic buildings and landmarks have been used as filming locations for a number of productions, including the movie \"50 First Dates\" and the TV show \"Hawaii Five-0.\" The town's rich cultural heritage and natural beauty have also made it a popular destination for musicians and artists, with a number of notable artists having performed in the town over the years.\n\n# Gallery\n\nThe following images are of Lahaina:\n\n* Lahaina Harbor\n* Lahaina Chapel\n* Lahaina Heritage Trail\n* Lahaina Arts Festival\n* Lahaina Golf Club\n* Lahaina Aquatics Center\n* Lahaina Grand Prix\n\n# See also\n\n* Lahaina Restoration Foundation\n* Lahaina Heritage Trail\n* Lahaina Arts Festival\n* Maui Film Festival\n* Hawaii Five-0\n* 50 First Dates\n\n# Notes\n\n* This article uses the Hawaiian language to reflect the town's cultural heritage and traditions.\n* The article is based on a number of sources, including books, articles, and websites.\n* The information in this article is current as of 2023.\n\n# References\n\n(Note: This article does not include any citations or references.)\n\n# External links\n\n* Lahaina Restoration Foundation\n* Lahaina Heritage Trail\n* Lahaina Arts Festival\n* Maui Film Festival\n* Hawaii Five-0\n* 50 First Dates", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Lahaina,_Hawaii\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Name\n###Modern name, etymology and pronunciations\n###Ancient names\n##Early rulers\n##Western contact\n###Kahekili II\n###Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II\n###Christian missionaries\n###Whaling\n###Kamehameha III\n###20th century\n##2023 wildfire\n#Geography\n##Climate\n#Demographics\n#Arts and culture\n#Sports\n#Popular culture\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Established in 1986, the award is considered one of the most prestigious honors in mountaineering, with a long history of recognizing the accomplishments of climbers and mountaineers from around the world.\n\n# History\n\nThe Piolets d'Or was founded in 1986 by the French journalist, editor, and mountaineer, Pierre Tairraz. Tairraz, who was also the founder of the magazine Montagnes, had a vision to create an award that would recognize the achievements of climbers and mountaineers, and to promote the sport of mountaineering. The first Piolets d'Or awards ceremony was held in 1986, and it has since become an annual event.\n\n## Multiple winners\n\nOne of the unique features of the Piolets d'Or award is that it can be won by multiple individuals or teams. This is different from other awards in mountaineering, where the award is typically given to a single individual or team. The Piolets d'Or award has been won by multiple climbers on several occasions, including in 2013, when all 10 climbers on the team that made the first ascent of the north face of the Eiger were awarded the Piolets d'Or.\n\n# Criteria\n\nThe criteria for winning the Piolets d'Or award are strict and include a number of requirements. To be eligible for the award, a climb must be a first ascent, or a new route on a previously climbed peak. The climb must also be a significant achievement, demonstrating exceptional skill and expertise.

The election saw the People's Justice Party (PKR), led by Anwar Ibrahim, emerging as the largest party in the Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of parliament. The election was widely seen as a contest between Anwar Ibrahim's PKR-led coalition and the Perikatan Nasional (PN) alliance, led by Muhyiddin Yassin.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Previous election\n\nThe previous general election was held on 9 May 2020. The election saw the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, led by Muhyiddin Yassin, emerging as the largest party in the Dewan Rakyat. However, the coalition struggled to form a majority government, and Muhyiddin ultimately formed a government with the support of the Perikatan Nasional (PN) alliance.\n\n### Significant events\n\nThe 2020-2022 period was marked by significant events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a major impact on the country's economy and social fabric. The pandemic also led to a decline in the ruling coalition's popularity, with many voters feeling that the government's response to the crisis was inadequate.\n\n### 2020–22 political crisis\n\nIn February 2020, the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, led by Anwar Ibrahim, lost the support of several key allies, including the Malaysian United Indigenous Party (BERSATU) and the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA). The coalition struggled to maintain a majority in the Dewan Rakyat, and Muhyiddin ultimately formed a government with the support of the Perikatan Nasional (PN) alliance.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nMalaysia uses a first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system, in which the candidate with the most votes in each constituency is elected to the Dewan Rakyat. The country is divided into 222 single-member constituencies, each with its own electoral roll.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n### Dissolution of parliament\n\nOn 10 October 2022, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) dissolved the 15th Parliament, paving the way for fresh elections.

The PKR-led coalition, led by Anwar Ibrahim, emerged as a major player in the election, with a strong lineup of candidates and a well-defined manifesto.\n\n### Timetable\n\nThe election was held on 19 November 2022, with polling stations opening at 8 am and closing at 6 pm. The first results began to trickle in around 10 pm, with the official results being announced several hours later.\n\n**Last election pendulum**\n\nThe last election pendulum, published by the website Malaysiakini, showed that the election was likely to be a close contest between the PKR-led coalition and the Perikatan Nasional (PN) alliance.\n\n**Political parties and candidates**\n\n### Parties represented in current legislatures\n\nThe following parties were represented in the current legislatures:\n\n* Pakatan Harapan (PH)\n* Perikatan Nasional (PN)\n* Barisan Nasional (BN)\n* Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS)\n* Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM)\n* Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS)\n\n### Extra-parliamentary parties\n\nSeveral extra-parliamentary parties also contested the election, including:\n\n* Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR)\n* Parti Amanah Negara (AMANAH)\n* Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (BERSATU)\n* Parti Muda Malaysia (MUDA)\n\n### Nominated candidates\n\nSeveral candidates were nominated for the election, including:\n\n* Anwar Ibrahim (PKR)\n* Muhyiddin Yassin (PN)\n* Ismail Sabri Yaakob (BN)\n* Ahmad Zahid Hamidi (UMNO)\n* Hadi Awang (PAS)\n* Khalid Abdul Samad (AMANAH)\n\n**Campaign**\n\n### Timing of election\n\nThe election was held on 19 November 2022, with polling stations opening at 8 am and closing at 6 pm.\n\n### Youth vote\n\nThe youth vote was seen as a critical factor in the election, with many young voters expected to turn out in large numbers.

The province's history is marked by periods of colonization, urbanization, and economic growth, which have shaped the development of its cities, towns, and municipalities.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe municipal history of Quebec begins in 1608, when the first settlement was established by Samuel de Champlain, the founder of Quebec City. Over the centuries, the province's municipalities have evolved through various stages of growth, transformation, and development. This article will explore the key events, trends, and milestones that have shaped the municipal history of Quebec, from the early colonial period to the present day.\n\n# 1599 to 1793\n\n## 1599\n\nThe first recorded mention of a municipal government in Quebec dates back to 1599, when the French crown established a system of governance for the colony. This system was based on the principle of feudalism, where the king held absolute power over the land and its inhabitants. The governor of the colony was responsible for administering justice, collecting taxes, and maintaining law and order.\n\n## 1608\n\nIn 1608, Samuel de Champlain established the first permanent settlement in Quebec City.

From its early days as a Roman settlement to its current status as a local government district, Durham has played a significant role in the history of England.\n\n**Roman and pre-Roman**\n\nThe earliest recorded history of County Durham dates back to the Roman era, when the Romans occupied the area in the 1st century AD. The Romans established a settlement near the River Wear, which they named _Verbeia_. Although the Romans left Britain in the 5th century AD, their legacy can still be seen in the many ancient roads, bridges, and buildings that remain in the county.\n\nBefore the Romans, the area was inhabited by a tribe known as the Brigantes, who were a powerful Celtic tribe that controlled much of northern England. The Brigantes were known for their skilled metalworking and their strong sense of community, and their legacy can still be seen in the many ancient monuments and artifacts that have been discovered in the county.\n\n**Anglo-Saxon**\n\nAfter the Romans left Britain, the area was invaded by the Anglo-Saxons, a group of Germanic tribes who established a number of kingdoms in England. One of these kingdoms was the Anglian Kingdom of Bernicia, which was established in the 6th century AD and covered much of northern England, including County Durham.\n\nThe Kingdom of Bernicia was a powerful and prosperous kingdom, known for its skilled warriors and its rich trade networks. The kingdom was eventually merged with the Kingdom of Deira to form the Kingdom of Northumbria, which became one of the most powerful kingdoms in England.\n\n**Anglian Kingdom of Bernicia**\n\nThe Anglian Kingdom of Bernicia was a small but powerful kingdom that covered much of northern England, including County Durham. The kingdom was established in the 6th century AD and was known for its skilled warriors and its rich trade networks. The kingdom was ruled by a number of powerful kings, including Æthelfrith, who is said to have united the various tribes of Bernicia and established a strong and centralized government.\n\n**Kingdom of Northumbria**\n\nThe Kingdom of Northumbria was a powerful and prosperous kingdom that covered much of northern England, including County Durham. The kingdom was established in the 7th century AD and was known for its skilled warriors and its rich trade networks. The kingdom was ruled by a number of powerful kings, including Oswiu, who is said to have established a strong and centralized government and expanded the kingdom's borders through a series of military campaigns.\n\n**City of Durham founded**\n\nIn the 11th century AD, a new settlement was established on the River Wear, which would eventually become the city of Durham. The city was founded by the Normans, who built a number of castles and churches in the area, including the famous Durham Cathedral, which was completed in the 12th century AD. The city became an important center of trade and commerce, and its strategic location made it a key location for the transportation of goods and people.\n\n**Norman and Anglo-Norman**\n\nAfter the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 AD, County Durham was ruled by William the Conqueror and his successors. The Normans introduced a number of changes to the government and administration of the county, including the establishment of a new system of lordship and the creation of a number of castles and fortifications. The Normans also introduced a number of new technologies and practices, including the use of castles and fortifications to control the population.\n\n**County Palatine of Durham**\n\nIn the 12th century AD, County Durham was granted the status of a County Palatine, which gave the Bishop of Durham a high degree of autonomy and authority over the county. The Bishop of Durham was responsible for the administration of justice, the collection of taxes, and the maintenance of the county's defenses. The Bishop of Durham was also responsible for the appointment of officials, including sheriffs, justices, and other officials.\n\n**Early administration**\n\nThe early administration of County Durham was characterized by a number of different systems and institutions. The county was divided into a number of hundreds, each of which was governed by a reeve who was responsible for the collection of taxes and the maintenance of order. The county also had a number of castles and fortifications, including the famous Durham Castle, which was built by the Normans in the 11th century AD.\n\n**Boundaries, exclaves and population**\n\nThe boundaries of County Durham have changed over the centuries, with the county being extended and reduced in size at different times. The county has also had a number of exclaves, including the town of Seaham, which was separated from the rest of the county by a number of other counties. The population of County Durham has also changed over the centuries, with the county experiencing a number of periods of rapid growth and decline.\n\n**Survey**\n\nThe Survey of County Durham was a series of surveys that were conducted in the 12th century AD to determine the size and value of the county's lands and properties. The surveys were conducted by a number of different officials, including the Bishop of Durham and the sheriffs of the county.

This article provides an overview of the background, negotiations, acquisition, reactions, and impact of the acquisition.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS is one of the largest banking mergers in history. The acquisition was sparked by a series of events, including the 2007-2008 financial crisis, losses in Credit Suisse's investment banking arm, and the March 2023 United States bank failures. The acquisition has far-reaching implications for the banking industry, regulators, and the global economy.\n\n## Background\n\n### Credit Suisse and the 2007-2008 financial crisis\n\nCredit Suisse, a Swiss multinational bank, played a significant role in the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The bank invested heavily in subprime mortgage-backed securities, which lost value significantly during the crisis. Credit Suisse's investment banking arm suffered significant losses, which had a ripple effect on the bank's overall financial health.\n\n### Losses in investment banking arm\n\nCredit Suisse's investment banking arm, Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB), was one of the largest investment banks in the world. However, the bank's investment in subprime mortgage-backed securities led to significant losses. In 2008, CSFB reported a loss of $14.6 billion, which was one of the largest losses in the history of the financial industry.\n\n### March 2023 United States bank failures and contagion\n\nIn March 2023, several major banks in the United States failed, including Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The failures led to a wave of panic in the financial markets, as investors and depositors rushed to withdraw their funds from banks. Credit Suisse was one of the banks that were affected by the contagion, as its stock price plummeted and its deposits declined significantly.\n\n## Negotiations\n\nThe negotiations between Credit Suisse and UBS were complex and involved multiple parties. The negotiations were led by the Swiss government, which was keen to avoid a bank failure that could have far-reaching consequences for the global economy. The Swiss government worked closely with UBS to develop a plan to acquire Credit Suisse, which would involve providing financial support to the bank and integrating its operations into UBS.\n\n## Acquisition\n\nThe acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS was announced on March 15, 2023. The acquisition was valued at approximately $53 billion, which was one of the largest banking mergers in history. The acquisition was structured as a merger, where UBS would acquire all of Credit Suisse's shares in exchange for a combination of cash and UBS shares.\n\n### Reactions\n\nThe acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS was met with a range of reactions. Some analysts praised the acquisition as a necessary step to stabilize the banking industry, while others criticized it as a bailout that would burden UBS with significant liabilities.\n\n#### AT1 bonds issue\n\nOne of the key issues surrounding the acquisition was the treatment of Credit Suisse's Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds. The AT1 bonds were a type of debt that was issued by Credit Suisse to raise capital, but they were not guaranteed by the bank's senior creditors. The acquisition agreement stipulated that the AT1 bonds would be canceled, which led to a controversy among investors who held the bonds.\n\n#### Sale price issue\n\nAnother issue surrounding the acquisition was the sale price of Credit Suisse. The acquisition price of $53 billion was widely criticized as being too high, given the bank's financial condition. Some analysts argued that the acquisition price should have been lower, given the bank's significant losses and liabilities.\n\n#### Lawsuits\n\nThe acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS led to several lawsuits filed by investors who claimed that they were misled by the bank's management and directors. The lawsuits alleged that the bank's management and directors failed to disclose material information about the bank's financial condition, which led to a decline in the bank's stock price.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS has had a significant impact on the banking industry, regulators, and the global economy. The acquisition has led to a consolidation of the banking industry, as smaller banks are acquired by larger ones. The acquisition has also led to a change in the way that banks are regulated, as regulators seek to improve the resilience of the banking system.\n\nThe acquisition has also had a significant impact on the global economy, as it has led to a reduction in the number of banks and a reduction in the amount of capital that is available for lending. The acquisition has also led to a change in the way that banks are governed, as regulators seek to improve the oversight of bank management and directors.\n\n## See also\n\n* Credit Suisse\n* UBS\n* Banking industry\n* Financial crisis\n* Mergers and acquisitions\n* Consolidation of the banking industry\n* Regulatory oversight of banks\n* Bank management and directors", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Acquisition_of_Credit_Suisse_by_UBS\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Credit Suisse and the 2007–2008 financial crisis\n##Losses in investment banking arm\n##March 2023 United States bank failures and contagion\n#Negotiations\n#Acquisition\n##Reactions\n###AT1 bonds issue\n###Sale price issue\n###Lawsuits\n#Impact\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The visit sparked widespread reaction and controversy, both within the United States and internationally.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe visit by Pelosi was the first by a Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives to Taiwan since 1997, when Speaker Newt Gingrich had visited the island. Since then, other high-level U.S. officials, including the Secretary of State and the Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had visited Taiwan, but no Speaker of the House had done so. The visit was seen as a significant gesture of support for Taiwan, which has been a key partner for the United States in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe context of the visit was also influenced by the ongoing tensions between the United States and the PRC over issues such as trade, security, and human rights. The PRC had been increasingly assertive in the region, and the United States had been looking to reinforce its relationships with its allies and partners. Taiwan, which has a democratically elected government, had been a key partner for the United States in the region, and the visit was seen as a way to strengthen ties between the two nations.\n\n**Visit**\n\nPelosi arrived in Taiwan on August 2, 2022, and spent three days in the country. During her visit, she met with the President of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, and other high-ranking officials. The two leaders discussed a range of issues, including security, trade, and human rights. Pelosi also visited the Taiwanese parliament and the National Taiwan University, where she was awarded an honorary doctorate.\n\nThe visit was seen as a significant gesture of support for Taiwan, which has been facing increased pressure from the PRC. The PRC had been issuing warnings and threats to the United States and Taiwan in the run-up to the visit, but Pelosi had made it clear that she would proceed with the visit despite the opposition.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe visit by Pelosi was met with a range of reactions, both within the United States and internationally.\n\n### United States\n\nThe visit was widely seen as a significant gesture of support for Taiwan, and was welcomed by many in the United States. The U.S. State Department issued a statement saying that the visit was a \"strong affirmation of the United States' commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act and to our one-China policy.\" The visit was also seen as a way to counter the growing influence of the PRC in the region.\n\nHowever, some critics in the United States argued that the visit was a provocation to the PRC, and that it could lead to increased tensions in the region. The visit was also seen as a way to boost Pelosi's own profile and to distract from domestic issues.\n\n### People's Republic of China\n\nThe PRC responded to the visit by issuing a range of warnings and threats. The PRC's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying that the visit was a \"serious provocation\" and that it would have \"severe consequences\" for the region. The PRC also suspended talks with the United States on issues such as trade and security.\n\nThe PRC also conducted a series of military exercises in the South China Sea, which were seen as a way to demonstrate its military capabilities and to intimidate Taiwan. The exercises were widely seen as a response to the visit by Pelosi.\n\n### Hong Kong\n\nThe Hong Kong government also responded to the visit by issuing a statement saying that it was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation. The Hong Kong government has been increasingly aligned with the PRC in recent years, and has been seen as a key player in the PRC's efforts to exert influence in the region.\n\n### Sanctions\n\nThe PRC also imposed sanctions on Pelosi and three other U.S. lawmakers who had supported the visit. The sanctions were seen as a way to punish the United States for the visit and to deter other U.S. officials from following in Pelosi's footsteps.\n\n**International**\n\nThe visit by Pelosi was widely watched and commented on by international leaders and organizations. The visit was seen as a significant development in the region, and was widely seen as a way to counter the growing influence of the PRC in the area.\n\n### Intergovernmental organizations\n\nThe visit was widely discussed by intergovernmental organizations such as the United Nations, the European Union, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). These organizations have been increasingly concerned about the growing tensions between the United States and the PRC, and have been looking for ways to promote dialogue and cooperation in the region.\n\n### Nations\n\nThe visit was also widely commented on by other nations in the region, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia. These nations have been increasingly concerned about the growing influence of the PRC in the region, and have been looking for ways to promote their own interests and security.\n\n**Interpretations and popular response**\n\nThe visit by Pelosi was widely seen as a significant gesture of support for Taiwan, and was welcomed by many in the United States and Taiwan. However, the visit was also widely criticized by the PRC and its allies, who saw it as a provocation and a threat to regional stability.\n\nThe visit was also widely discussed and analyzed by scholars and experts, who saw it as a significant development in the region. The visit was seen as a way to counter the growing influence of the PRC in the area, and to promote the interests of Taiwan and the United States.\n\nThe visit was also widely covered by the media, with many outlets providing extensive coverage of the visit and its implications. The visit was seen as a major news story, and was widely discussed and analyzed by pundits and commentators.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe visit by Pelosi had significant consequences for the region, and led to a number of developments in the months and years that followed.\n\nThe visit was widely seen as a significant development in the ongoing tensions between the United States and the PRC, and led to a number of diplomatic and military responses from both sides.
