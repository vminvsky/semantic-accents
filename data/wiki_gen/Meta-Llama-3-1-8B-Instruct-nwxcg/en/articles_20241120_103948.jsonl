the same time when the film's first report appeared, it was reported that Bhansali tried to offer Dixit the role of Chandramukhi, a part written specifically for her [14] [18] She declined it because of her marriage to the cardiovascular surgeon Shriram Madhav Nene on 17 October 1999, but eventually accepted it in September 2000 [14] [20] She said of her excitement about the collaboration: \"Working with Sanjay was a dream He gives you a lot of scope and leeway with the role's interpretation Since he has the whole film worked out in his mind, he is aware of the length of the scene He knows exactly what he wants from each scene in order to keep the storyline crisp.\" [21]\n\n\nSets\nThe production design of Devdas led by Nitin Chandrakant Desai (Bhansali's collaborator in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam), [18] [39] with between sixty and one hundred assistants, including Pune-based architect Dheeraj Alkokar, helped him in several constructions [40] [41] [42] Bhansali wanted the sets to be different from the novel's 1936 and 1955 Hindi remakes and, to fulfill his request, Desai visited the National Film Archive of India to collect the photographs of the previous remake versions and \"to be sure that there is no duplication\" [43] As the film is set in the 1900s, Bhansali, Desai and other crews did extensive research and discussions on house design from the period of the British Raj in Calcutta and Indian culture at the time [18] [44] After this research, Desai came up with the first four different set designs: Paro's haveli and mansion, Devdas' house, and Chandramukhi's brothel [18]\n\n\nCharacters\nAbu Jani, Neeta Lulla, Reza Shariffi, and Sandeep Khosla designed the costumes Lulla claimed to be a fan of the duo Jani and Khosla, adding that \"I do not know them on a personal level, but I received positive vibes We were competing among ourselves not with each other.\" In preparation, the crews watched a number of Bengali films based on Kolkata, talking to locals, and did research on the Bengali culture, including traditional wear and dress patterns at that time [47] [48] They visited several museums, and made intensive discussions on the costumes that, according to The Times of India, \".. would be a blend of  [a look] from the magical period and a look that today's audience could relate to\" [49] All of the clothes by Jani and Khosla were inspired by traditional Bengali clothes from the 1930s and 1940s [2] Beside that, Lulla bought 600 saris from the city and mix-and-matched them: \"Sometimes, I mixed two saris in one, sometimes three.\" [47]

cinematographer for Devdas [57] He met Bhansali when the shooting of 1942: A Love Story and supposed to filmed Khamoshi: The Musical, but he was replaced by Anil Mehta for an unknown reason Pradhan said, \"It took time to adjust to Sanjay's style of work I am known to be a slow cameraman Initially, we would discuss camera angles and how he wanted a scene shot But now, I can read his mind I know exactly what he wants.\" He praised Bhansali for \"handles love stories with a sensitivity that I have never seen on screen before\" While working with Bhansali, Pradhan found the director to be \"meticulous and painstaking\" and it was revealed that the latter did research before the shooting began [58]\n\n\nMusic\nThe entire soundtrack and lyrics for Devdas was composed by Ismail Darbar,

The film stars Shah Rukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai, and Madhuri Dixit in lead roles.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film is set in the early 20th century in a small town in Bengal. Kausalya Mukherjee (Smita Jaykar) is a zamindar's wife who is overjoyed to receive a letter from her son Devdas (Shah Rukh Khan) informing her that he has arrived from London after completing his law studies. Devdas was sent to London by his father, Chandramohan (Vijayendra Ghatge), after he was involved in a scandalous affair with the family's neighbor, Parvati \"Paro\" (Aishwarya Rai). Paro's family is from a lower social class and is considered unsuitable for Devdas.\n\nWhen Devdas returns to India, he and Paro's friendship transforms into deep love. However, their social differences and the disapproval of Devdas' family make their love impossible. Kumud, Devdas' manipulative sister-in-law, fuels her mother-in-law's thoughts against Paro. Devdas is heartbroken and turns to drinking and womanizing as a way to cope with his loss.\n\nCasting\n\nShah Rukh Khan was cast as Devdas, and Aishwarya Rai was cast as Paro. Madhuri Dixit was cast as Chandramukhi, a courtesan who becomes Devdas' mistress. The film's casting was a significant departure from the original novel, where Chandramukhi was a minor character. Dixit was initially hesitant to take on the role, but eventually accepted it after Bhansali convinced her of the character's importance.\n\nProduction\n\nThe film's production design was led by Nitin Chandrakant Desai, who worked closely with Bhansali to create a visually stunning and authentic representation of early 20th-century Bengal. The film's sets, costumes, and jewelry were all designed to reflect the opulence and grandeur of the era. Desai visited the National Film Archive of India to collect photographs of the previous remake versions and to ensure that there was no duplication of sets.\n\nCharacters\n\nAbu Jani and Neeta Lulla designed the costumes for the film, along with Reza Shariffi and Sandeep Khosla.

on 15 May 1970 in Farnborough, Kent [8] [9] His father was a soldier in the 1st King's Dragoon Guards and served in Malaya [10]\n\n\nMilitary career\nAfter training as a cadet at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, in June 1991 Wallace was commissioned into the Scots Guards as a second lieutenant, with a short service commission [13] From 1991 to 1998, he served in Germany, Cyprus, Belize, and

entire IRA active service unit (ASU) attempting to carry out a bomb attack against British troops [2] [16] The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) later said that no one arrested as a result of the patrol was prosecuted [17] In 1996 he was promoted captain [18]\n\n\nPolitical career\nWallace entered politics after leaving the army, citing as a reason for this decision the experience he had commanding men from some of the UK's most economically deprived areas, which he averred could be improved by promoting a more aspirational society [16] Wallace became a Conservative Member of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, as a list MSP for North East Scotland [3] [4] He did not seek re-election at the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, as he sought selection for a Westminster constituency

Member of Parliament for the Lancaster and Wyre constituency at the 2005 general election He gained the seat from Labour with 22,266 votes and a majority of 4,171 (8.0%) [22] Wallace faced local criticism after it was revealed that in 2008 he had made the fourth-highest expenses claim of any MP, claiming £175,523 on top of his £63,000 salary However, he defended this by arguing that his constituency had an electorate that was nearly 20% larger than the average one in England [23]\n\n\nJunior ministerial roles and EU referendum\nFollowing his re-election to Parliament in 2010, Wallace was appointed as parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to the then Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor, and later minister without portfolio in the Cabinet Office, Kenneth Clarke [19] On 4 September

overheard discussing Johnson's controversial prorogation of parliament with Florence Parly, the French Armed Forces minister He suggested that the reason for the prorogation for five weeks was to prevent MPs from blocking the government's Brexit plans, rather than the government's official position that it was to introduce a new legislative agenda [36] 10 Downing Street responded to his comments by admonishing him and stating that he had \"misspoken\" [37] This prorogation was deemed unlawful by the Supreme Court on 24 September 2019 [38]\n\n\nReturn to private life\nIn 2024 Wallace was voluble on defence-related matters In April 2024 after the 300-unit drone strike by Iran on Israel Wallace said the event \"had dashed his own hopes that reformers would one day triumph over the hardliners.\" [84] He wrote an op-ed in the Daily Telegraph and advised the West to \"hit back twice as hard\" against Iran and Russia and \"not stop until they get the message\" The pair \"thrive on the West’s lack of resolve, revel in sowing division, and delight in weakening.\" He also called on Israel to supply Ukraine with weapons in light of the Russian investment in the Iranian drone and missile programme [85] [86]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWallace married Liza Cooke in 2001 They met when she was a researcher in the Scottish Parliament and Wallace was an MSP [91] His wife worked as a

Drishyam was also the first Malayalam film to cross the ₹50 crore mark at the box-office.\n\nThe success of Drishyam catapulted Jeethu to new heights, and he soon became one of the most sought-after directors in the industry. The film was remade in Tamil by Jeethu himself, with Kamal Haasan enacting Mohanlal's role. The film was also remade in Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi by other directors.\n\nJeethu's success with Drishyam was followed by the release of Dileep-starrer Life of Josutty, which further cemented his position as a leading director in the industry.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nJeethu is married to Linta, a costume designer in Malayalam cinema.

He grew up in Orlando, Florida, where he developed a passion for art and animals at a young age. As a child, Ross spent much of his time caring for injured animals, including armadillos, snakes, alligators, and squirrels.

He believed that the use of solvent-based paints and thinners was not necessary, and that a water-based system was just as effective.\n\n## Influences\n\nRoss's painting style was influenced by his love of nature and his desire to capture its beauty on canvas. He was also influenced by the work of other artists, including the Impressionists and the landscape painters of the Hudson River School.

Steve has also said that his father's use of soft, gentle language and his ability to create a sense of calmness in his paintings was a key element in his success.\n\n## See Also\n\nPBS Video Mashup Honors 'Joy Of Painting' Host HuffPost Associated Press July 26, 2012 Archived from the original on July 28, 2012 Retrieved October 29, 2012.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nPBS Video Mashup Honors 'Joy Of Painting' Host HuffPost Associated Press July 26, 2012 Archived from the original on July 28, 2012 Retrieved October 29, 2012.\n\n## External Links\n\nNote: There are no external links provided as the article is based on publicly available information and does not require any external sources.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bob_Ross\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nRoss was born in Daytona Beach, Florida, to Jack and Ollie Ross, a carpenter and a waitress respectively, and raised in Orlando, Florida [1] [2] As an adolescent, Ross cared for injured animals, including armadillos, snakes, alligators and squirrels, one of which was later featured in several episodes of his television show [2] [1] He had a half-brother Jim, whom he mentioned in passing on his show [3] Ross dropped out of high school in the 9th grade While working as a carpenter with his father, he lost part of his left index finger, which did not affect his ability to later hold a palette while painting [4]: 22 \n\n\nMilitary career\nIn 1961, 18-year-old Ross enlisted in the United States Air Force and was put into service as a medical records technician [4]: 15  He rose to the rank of master sergeant and served as the first sergeant of the clinic at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, [5] [6] where he first saw the snow and mountains that later appear as recurring themes in his paintings He developed his quick painting technique during brief daily work breaks [6] Having held military positions that required him to act tough and mean, \"the guy who makes you scrub the latrine, the guy who makes you make your bed, the guy who screams at you for being late to work,\" Ross decided he would not raise his voice when he left the military [6]\n\n\nCareer as a painter\nDuring his 20-year Air Force career, Ross developed an interest in painting after attending an art class at the Anchorage U.S.O club He found himself frequently at odds with many of his painting instructors, who were more interested in abstract painting Ross said, \"They'd tell you what makes a tree, but they wouldn't tell you how to paint a tree.\" [7]\n\n\nTechnique\nRoss used a wet-on-wet oil painting technique of painting over a thin base layer of wet paint The painting could progress without first drying The technique used a limited selection of tools and colors that did not require a large investment in expensive equipment Ross frequently recommended odorless paint thinner (odorless mineral spirits) for brush cleaning.\n\n\nInfluences\nRoss dedicated the first episode of the second season of The Joy of Painting to Bill Alexander, explaining that \"years ago, Bill taught me this fantastic  [wet-on-wet] technique, and I feel as though he gave me a precious gift, and I'd like to share that gift with you.\" [20] As Ross's popularity grew, his relationship with Alexander became increasingly strained \"He betrayed me,\" Alexander told The New York Times in 1991 \"I invented 'wet on wet', I trained him, and .. he thinks he can do it better.\" [7]\n\n\nStyle\nRoss was well known for phrases he tended to repeat while painting, such as \"let's add some happy little trees\" [23]\n\n\nOther media appearances\nRoss was fond of country music and in 1987 was invited on stage by Hank Snow at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee The audience gave him a huge ovation; he was slightly nervous at first, but felt better after cracking a joke to the crowd Snow was later given a private painting lesson by Ross [28]\n\n\nPersonal life\nRoss was married three times and had two children: a child he fathered from a relationship he had as a teenager, [32] and a son, Robert Stephen \"Steve\" Ross [33] with his first wife, Vivian Ridge Steve, also a talented painter, occasionally appeared on The Joy of Painting and became a Ross-certified instructor [9] Steve appeared on camera in the last episode of Season 1, in which he read a series of general \"how-to\" questions sent in by viewers during the season Bob answered them one at a time, technique by technique, until he had completed an entire painting.\n\n\nDeath and aftermath\nA cigarette smoker for most of his adult life, Ross had several health problems over the course of his life, and expected to die prematurely [32] He died at the age of 52 on July 4, 1995, in Orlando, Florida, due to complications from lymphoma [9] [34] [35] At the time of his death he had prepared seven paintings for a potential 32nd season of The Joy of Painting [36]\n\n\nLegacy\nRoss's likeness has become part of popular culture, with his image spoofed in television programs, films and video games like Family Guy, [39] The Boondocks, [40] Deadpool 2 [41] and Smite [42]\n\n\nASMR\nThe Twitch streams created a new interest in Ross and caused his popularity to grow [14] His videos subsequently became popular with devotees of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) [11] ASMR refers to a pleasant form of paresthesia, or tingling, often brought about by specific visual or auditory stimuli [63] Many viewers found that listening to Ross triggered an ASMR response In the 2021 Netflix documentary, Ross' son Steve said that his father was inspired to speak in that manner because his mentor, Bill Alexander, spoke in a harsh tone on television and he wanted to do the opposite of that Since most of the audience of The Joy of Painting was female, he thought \"maybe I'll try to whisper,\" and that became one of his trademarks.\n\n\nSee also\n\"PBS Video Mashup Honors 'Joy Of Painting' Host\" HuffPost Associated Press July 26, 2012 Archived from the original on July 28, 2012 Retrieved October 29, 2012.\n\n\nReferences\n\"PBS Video Mashup Honors 'Joy Of Painting' Host\" HuffPost Associated Press July 26, 2012 Archived from the original on July 28, 2012 Retrieved October 29, 2012.\n\n\nFurther reading\n\"PBS Video Mashup Honors 'Joy Of Painting' Host\" HuffPost Associated Press July 26, 2012 Archived from the original on July 28, 2012 Retrieved October 29, 2012.\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was born on 3 June 1865, in Marlborough House, London, and was baptised at Windsor Castle on 7 July 1865 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Longley.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nGeorge was the second son of the Prince of Wales, and his father was the eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. His mother, Alexandra, was the eldest daughter of King Christian IX and Queen Louise of Denmark. As a young man, George was destined to serve in the navy, and he served for many years under the command of his uncle, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who was stationed in Malta. During his time in Malta, George grew close to and fell in love with his cousin, Princess Marie of Edinburgh. However, their families opposed the match, and Marie eventually married Ferdinand, Crown Prince of Romania, in 1893.\n\n**Duke of York**\n\nThe death of George's elder brother effectively ended his naval career, as he was now second in line to the throne. George was created Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, and Baron Killarney by Queen Victoria on 24 May 1892. As Duke of York, George carried out a wide variety of public duties, including attending state functions and visiting troops. He also received lessons in constitutional history from J R Tanner.\n\n**Prince of Wales**\n\nOn the death of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901, George's father ascended the throne as King Edward VII. George inherited the title of Duke of Cornwall and York, and for much of the rest of that year, he was known as the Duke of Cornwall and York. As Prince of Wales, George carried out numerous public duties, including attending state functions and visiting troops.\n\n**Reign**\n\nOn 6 May 1910, Edward VII died, and George became king. At the time of his accession, George was 44 years old and had been married to his wife, Mary, for over 20 years. He wrote in his diary, \"I held a council at 10:45 to declare war with Germany. It is a terrible catastrophe, but it is not our fault... Please to God it may soon be over.\" From 1914 to 1918, Britain and its allies were at war with the Central Powers, led by the German Empire.\n\n**National politics**\n\nGeorge inherited the throne at a politically turbulent time. Lloyd George's People's Budget had been rejected by the Conservative and Unionist-dominated House of Lords, contrary to the normal convention that the Lords did not veto money bills. Liberal Prime Minister H H Asquith had asked the previous king to give an undertaking that he would create sufficient Liberal peers to allow the passage of Liberal legislation. After the January 1910 general election, the Conservative peers allowed the budget to pass without a vote.\n\n**First World War**\n\nDuring the First World War, George played an active role in the war effort. He visited troops on the front lines and attended numerous military ceremonies. He also worked closely with his government to coordinate military strategy and policy. In 1915, George was seriously injured when he was thrown by his horse at a troop review in France. Despite his injuries, George continued to play an active role in the war effort.\n\n**Post-war reign**\n\nAfter the First World War, George's health began to decline. He suffered from chronic bronchitis and was forced to take frequent breaks from his duties. In 1925, on the instruction of his doctors, he was sent on a recuperative private cruise in the Mediterranean. In 1928, George fell seriously ill with septicaemia, which localized between the base of his right lung and diaphragm. For the next two years, his son Edward took over many of his duties.\n\n**Declining health and death**\n\nGeorge's health continued to decline in 1929, and he was forced to retire to Craigweil House, Aldwick, in the seaside resort of Bognor, Sussex. As a result of his stay, the town acquired the suffix Regis – Latin for \"of the King\". George died on 20 January 1936, at the age of 70, and was succeeded by his son Edward as King Edward VIII.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nGeorge V was a dedicated monarch who worked tirelessly to serve his country. He was a strong supporter of the British Empire and played an active role in the First World War. Despite his declining health in later years, George continued to serve his country with dignity and dedication. He is remembered as a wise and compassionate monarch who played an important role in shaping the course of British history.\n\n**Titles, honours and arms**\n\nAs Duke of York, George's arms were the royal arms, with an inescutcheon of the arms of Saxony, all differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing an anchor azure. The anchor was removed from his coat of arms as the Prince of Wales. As King, he bore the royal arms. In 1917, he removed, by warrant, the Saxony inescutcheon from the arms of all male-line descendants of the Prince Consort domiciled in the United Kingdom.\n\n**Issue**\n\nGeorge V had six children with his wife, Mary:\n\n* Edward, Prince of Wales (1894-1972)\n* George, Duke of York (1895-1952)\n* Mary, Princess Royal (1897-1965)\n* Henry, Duke of Gloucester (1900-1974)\n* George, Duke of Kent (1902-1942)\n* John, Duke of Gloucester (1905-1974)\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nGeorge V was a member of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which was a German royal house. His father, King Edward VII, was the eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. George's mother, Alexandra, was the eldest daughter of King Christian IX and Queen Louise of Denmark.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of British monarchs\n* List of British monarchs' consorts\n* British monarchs by ancestry\n* British monarchs by birth order\n* Royal House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\n\n**References**\n\n* Weir, A.

affecting Scotland took place between the 2016 and 2021 Scottish Parliament elections:\n\n\nLeadership changes\nThree parties underwent leadership changes during the parliamentary term leading up to the election In August 2017, Kezia Dugdale resigned as leader of Scottish Labour and was replaced by Richard Leonard [14] In January 2021, less than four months before the election, Leonard resigned [15] Anas Sarwar won the subsequent leadership election [16]\n\n\nExpansion of the electorate\nThis is the first election after the passage of the Scottish Elections (Franchise and Representation) Act, which extended the franchise to those serving prison sentences of 12 months or less [21] [22] In 2005, the United Kingdom was found in breach of Protocol 1, Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights in regards of prisoner voting rights in the European Court of Human Rights as a result of Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2); the Act brings Scotland in line with the court ruling [23]\n\n\nDate\nUnder the Scotland Act 1998, an ordinary general election to the Scottish Parliament would normally have been held on the first Thursday in May four years after the 2016 election, i.e in May 2020 [26] This would have clashed with the proposed date of a UK general election, although this became a moot point when a snap UK general election was held in June 2017 (a further UK general election was held in December 2019) [27] In November 2015, the Scottish Government published a Scottish Elections (Dates) Bill, which proposed to extend the term of the Parliament to five years [27]

Ross, which required a 6.1% swing The SNP ended up holding both of these constituencies.\n\n\nSNP targets\nThe SNP won 64 seats, falling one seat short of an overall majority [102] Some commentators

members of the Scottish Parliament. It was the fifth election to the Scottish Parliament, which was established in 1999. The election was held four years after the previous election in 2016.\n\n**Background**\n\nAt the 2016 election, the Scottish National Party (SNP) lost its parliamentary majority but was able to continue governing under Nicola Sturgeon as a minority administration. At the same election, the Conservatives overtook Labour to place second, whilst the Greens overtook the Liberal Democrats to place fourth. No representatives of minor parties were elected to the Parliament.\n\n**Electoral events**\n\nThe election was held on 6 May 2021, with all 73 constituencies and all eight regional ballots contested. The SNP, Conservatives, Labour, and Liberal Democrats fielded candidates in all 73 constituencies and all eight of the regional ballots. Five other parties contested both all eight regions and at least one constituency: the Scottish Greens, Scottish Libertarian Party, Scottish Family Party, UKIP, and the Freedom Alliance. Four parties – Abolish the Scottish Parliament Party, Alba Party, All for Unity, and Reform UK – stood in all eight electoral regions, but did not contest any constituencies.\n\n**Leadership changes**\n\nThree parties underwent leadership changes during the parliamentary term leading up to the election. In August 2017, Kezia Dugdale resigned as leader of Scottish Labour and was replaced by Richard Leonard. In January 2021, less than four months before the election, Leonard resigned. Anas Sarwar won the subsequent leadership election.\n\n**Expansion of the electorate**\n\nThis is the first election after the passage of the Scottish Elections (Franchise and Representation) Act, which extended the franchise to those serving prison sentences of 12 months or less. In 2005, the United Kingdom was found in breach of Protocol 1, Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights in regards of prisoner voting rights in the European Court of Human Rights as a result of Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2); the Act brings Scotland in line with the court ruling.\n\n**Date**\n\nUnder the Scotland Act 1998, an ordinary general election to the Scottish Parliament would normally have been held on the first Thursday in May four years after the 2016 election, i.e. in May 2020. This would have clashed with the proposed date of a UK general election, although this became a moot point when a snap UK general election was held in June 2017 (a further UK general election was held in December 2019). In November 2015, the Scottish Government published a Scottish Elections (Dates) Bill, which proposed to extend the term of the Parliament to five years. That Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 25 February 2016 and received Royal Assent on 30 March 2016, setting the new date for the election as 6 May 2021.\n\n**Retiring MSPs**\n\nJames Dornan announced in February 2020 his intention to retire at the next Holyrood election, but reversed this decision some months later.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe election campaign started on 25 March 2021. The Scottish Conservatives launched their campaign the same day, with a focus on promoting Scotland's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Election debates**\n\nThere were no televised debates between the party leaders during the election campaign.\n\n**Opinion polling**\n\nOpinion polling in the run-up to the election suggested that the SNP was likely to win the most seats, but that the party was unlikely to secure an overall majority. The Conservative Party was expected to make gains, and Labour was predicted to lose seats.\n\n**Target seats**\n\nBelow are listed all the constituencies which required a swing of less than 5% from the 2016 result to change hands. The most marginal opportunity for the Greens was in Glasgow Kelvin, which they needed a 7.1% swing to gain. The Liberal Democrats' best bet was Caithness, Sutherland and Ross, which required a 6.1% swing.\n\n**SNP targets**\n\nThe SNP won 64 seats, falling one seat short of an overall majority. Some commentators put this down to unionists voting tactically for Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem candidates. According to psephologist John Curtice, \"Denying the SNP an overall majority was, indeed, a collective effort – at least on the part of Unionist voters, who on the constituency ballot demonstrated a remarkable willingness to back whichever pro-Union party appeared to be best placed locally to defeat the SNP [...] These patterns had a decisive impact on the outcome.\"\n\n**Conservative targets**\n\nThe SNP won 64 seats, falling one seat short of an overall majority.

Her cabinet was approved by the parliament two days later and thus the Third Sturgeon government, a minority government, was formed.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe election result was widely seen as a disappointment for the SNP, who had hoped to secure an overall majority. The party had campaigned on a platform of independence for Scotland, but the result suggested that the issue was not as popular as the SNP had hoped. The Conservative Party was seen as the main beneficiaries of the election, gaining seats and votes across Scotland. The Liberal Democrats also made gains, although the party's overall vote share decreased.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2021_Scottish_Parliament_election\"

instrumentals from YouTube which she downloaded and used to create her own music [32] [33] After becoming fascinated with internet culture and websites like eBaum's World and Myspace, [30] she taught herself to sing, rap and use GarageBand while at home without a job, frequently making music and uploading it to SoundCloud [27] [33] [32] In late 2012, \"So High\" became the first permanent upload on her SoundCloud account [32] Doja Cat began her career in the Los Angeles underground hip-hop scene, performing at parties and cyphers, and connecting with rappers such as Busdriver, Ill Camille and VerBS, the latter of whom claims to have helped hone her craft and find her first gig [34] It was during this time that she met producer Jerry \"Tizhimself\" Powell, who had stumbled upon her SoundCloud account [34] He introduced her to record producer Yeti Beats, [34] who invited her to record at his studio in the neighbourhood of Echo Park, which also served as \"an oasis of sorts for Doja to escape from the turmoil at home\" [12] Yeti Beats then connected her with Kemosabe Records, an imprint of RCA Records, where she signed under label executive Dr Luke and his publishing company Prescription Songs at the age of 17 [10] [21] [35] [36] This deal also came with a temporary artist management partnership with Roc Nation [21]\n\n\n2018–2019: Amala and \"Mooo!\"\n\nHer first major

on the video-sharing platform TikTok went viral in late 2019 [45] The single consequently charted in countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States, with the latter having the song peak at 86 on the Billboard Hot 100, making this her first solo entry on the chart [46]\n\n2019–2020: Breakthrough with Hot Pink\nA remix version of Doja Cat's song \"Juicy\", from the deluxe version of

a sleeper hit after live performances of the song went viral on TikTok [114] TikTok also spawned a viral challenge which uses a mashup of \"Streets\" and \"Put Your Head on My Shoulder\" by Paul Anka [115] This caused the song to enter the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 16 [116] Doja Cat was nominated for three awards at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards: herself for Best New Artist and

had asserted that the album would be \"predominantly rap\", a callback to the musical style of her earliest works, [179] and an effort to diverge from the \"pink and soft things\" and \"pop and glittery sounds\" that she has become noted for, [180] notably denouncing her previous two albums as \"cash grabs\" and \"digestible pop hits\" [181] She also adopted a darker aesthetic and appearance, which she described as \"punk\", \"experimental\" and \"manic\", [182] while some fans deemed these changes \"demonic\", [183] [184] and accused her of being a Satanist, [185] [186] and a

The sport was invented by James Naismith in 1891, and it quickly gained popularity throughout the United States and eventually spread to other parts of the world. The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) was established in 1932 to oversee the sport globally.\n\n**History**\n\nBasketball was invented by James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1891. Within a few decades, the new game became popular throughout the United States as an indoor sport. The popularity of basketball spread overseas, and the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) was organized in 1932 in Geneva, Switzerland. The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) played a significant role in the spread of the sport to many countries, and as many as 21 teams competed in the first Olympic basketball tournament.\n\n**American Dominance**\n\nThe first Olympic basketball tournament was organized in the 1936 Berlin Olympics on outdoor tennis courts. Dr. Naismith presented the medals to the top three teams. According to the Olympic rules of that time, all competitors were amateurs. The tournament was held indoors for the first time in 1948. The American team proved its dominance, winning the first seven Olympic tournaments through 1968, without losing a single game. The Americans were barred from sending a team that contained players from the professional National Basketball Association (NBA), but they instead sent college players. Teams from some other countries sent their best players, as some of their players were classified as \"amateurs\" by FIBA, by earning allowances instead of wages.\n\n**Munich and After**\n\nThe U.S. winning streak ended in 1972, when the Soviet Union controversially won the gold medal game against the United States by one point.\n\n**Professional Era: Renewed American Dominance**\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, putting the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally listed in the military but were in fact paid by the state to train full-time. In April 1989, FIBA approved the rule that allowed NBA players to compete in international tournaments, including the Olympics. In the 1992 Summer Olympics, the U.S. \"Dream Team\" won the gold medal with an average winning margin of 44 points per game, without calling a timeout. By this time, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia no longer existed, but their successor states continued to be among the leading forces. Two newly independent countries of the former Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, Croatia and Lithuania, won the silver and bronze medals respectively.\n\n**Women**\n\nThe women's basketball tournament was introduced at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. The first women's tournament was won by the Soviet Union. The United States has won the most women's basketball gold medals, with a total of seven. The women's tournament has been held every four years since 1976, with the exception of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, which were boycotted by the United States and several other countries.\n\n**Venues**\n\nAll venues for the men's and women's basketball tournaments have been indoor stadiums, except for the 1936 tournament, which was held outdoors on lawn tennis courts.\n\n**Qualifying**\n\nThe qualifying process for the Olympic basketball tournament consists of three stages. The first stage involves continental qualifying tournaments, where teams compete to earn a spot in the second stage. The second stage is the FIBA World Cup, where the top teams from each continent compete to earn a spot in the Olympic tournament. The final stage is the Olympic qualification tournament, where the top teams from each continent compete to earn the remaining spots in the Olympic tournament.\n\n**Men**\n\nThe men's Olympic basketball tournament has been held every four years since 1936. The tournament features 12 teams, which are selected through a combination of continental qualifying tournaments and the FIBA World Cup. The top four teams from each continent compete in the FIBA World Cup, and the top teams from each continent compete in the Olympic qualification tournament.\n\n**Medal Table**\n\nAs of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the medal table for men's basketball stands as follows:\n\n| Rank | Country | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | United States | 16 | 2 | 2 | 20 |\n| 2 | Soviet Union | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n| 3 | Yugoslavia | 0 | 2 | 1 | 3 |\n| 4 | Argentina | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |\n| 5 | Spain | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 |\n| 6 | Australia | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 |\n| 7 | Brazil | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 8 | Canada | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 9 | China | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 10 | Croatia | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 11 | France | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 12 | Great Britain | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 13 | Greece | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 14 | Italy | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 15 | Lithuania | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 16 | Puerto Rico | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 17 | Senegal | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 18 | Serbia | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n\n**Women**\n\nThe women's Olympic basketball tournament has been held every four years since 1976.

The storm caused significant damage and disruption to the region, resulting in power outages, flooding, and damage to infrastructure. This article provides an overview of the meteorological history, preparations, and impact of Hurricane Francine.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nOn August 26, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that a low-pressure area could form in the Central Tropical Atlantic. Two days later, they began tracking a tropical wave producing disorganized showers. Initially, showers from the wave were a bit more concentrated along its axis, becoming more organized by August 31. However, an unfavorable environment for development caused the wave to become disorganized. Several days later, on September 7, the wave crossed into the Bay of Campeche, becoming a low-pressure area the next day. As a result, a few hours later, it was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Six at 21:00 UTC on September 8. Higher wind gusts in the system were enhanced by a barrier jet near the Sierra Madre Oriental. Early the next day, the disturbance intensified into Tropical Storm Francine. The novel storm slowly moved northwest over the next day close to the Mexico–United States border before beginning to move more to the northeast due to a ridge of high pressure over the state of Florida. Steady intensification ensued, with Francine becoming a hurricane at 03:00 UTC on September 11.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nTropical storm watches were issued from Barra del Tordo to the mouth of the Rio Grande. Other parts of Northeast Mexico were placed under tropical storm warning. Tamaulipas shut down schools in Matamoros, San Fernando, and Valle Hermoso.\n\n**Mexico**\n\nSeveral areas in Matamoros flooded from 200 millimeters (7.9 in) of rain; aid from the Mexican Government was requested as a result. Water pumps were set up across the city in response. Plans DN-III and Tamaulipas were initiated to provide aid to areas affected by Francine.\n\n**United States**\n\nExports out to the Gulf of Mexico were disrupted as a result of Francine, and the storm knocked out 39% of oil and natural gas production. Reductions in production caused crude oil national prices to jump by 2% on September 11.\n\n**Texas**\n\nBy September 9, Port O'Connor was experiencing flooding conditions. Rainfall in the state peaked at 7.44 in (189 mm) in Brownsville.\n\n**Louisiana**\n\nFrancine made landfall near Southern Louisiana in Terrebonne Parish with sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) at 22:00 UTC on September 11. Storm surge was greater than 4 feet (1.2 m). A tornado warning was issued for Plaquemines Parish. Around 450,000 people suffered from power outages, most of which were caused by fallen debris, and around 500 people took refuge in emergency shelters. Francine's winds downed numerous trees and power lines, which resulted in blocked roads. Numerous streets sustained flooding as a result of heavy rainfall. The flash flooding resulted in several flash flood emergency alerts being issued. Several rivers crested in Saint Tammany Parish. The Lafourche Parish Sheriff’s Office conducted numerous water rescues northwest of Thibodaux after rising flood waters surrounded multiple housing units, and all residents, including many small children, were safely evacuated. Other water rescues were also carried out in other parts of the Thibodaux area as well as the Kraemer area. A 39-year-old man rescued another man, who had water up to his head, from a sinking truck below an overpass in New Orleans by smashing the truck's back window with a hammer and pulling him out through it and cutting his hand in the process. Two other people were injured: a Louisiana State Police officer who was struck by a falling tree while removing downed trees on Interstate 10, and a woman in Ascension Parish who was also hit and pinned by a fallen tree.\n\n**Mississippi**\n\nStrong winds swept through the Mississippi Coast before sunrise on September 12. The Jackson County Office of Emergency Services reported minor damage across the county, including power outages, downed trees, and flooded streets. As Francine moved further north, it was downgraded to a tropical depression, bringing heavy rainfall to Jackson and central Mississippi. South Mississippi faced significant flooding and related issues during the storm's passage. Other areas of the state also experienced downed trees and power lines. During the morning of September 12, 60,000 customers experienced power outages in Mississippi. Around 500 people were in state shelters. One injury was reported in Jones County.\n\n**Elsewhere**\n\nThere were 39,000 reported power outages in Alabama. Trees and power lines were also downed in the western portion of the state. In Danville, rainfall accumulated to 11.11 in (282 mm).\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of Category 1 Atlantic hurricanes\n* List of tropical cyclones in 2003\n* List of wettest tropical cyclones in the United States\n\n**References**\n\n* National Hurricane Center.

{"title": "Charles_I_of_England", "content": "\nEarly life\nThe second son of King James VI of Scotland and Anne of Denmark, Charles was born in Dunfermline Palace, Fife, on 19 November 1600 [1] At a Protestant ceremony in the Chapel Royal of Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh on 23 December 1600, he was baptised by David Lindsay, Bishop of Ross, and created Duke of Albany, the traditional title of the second son of the king of Scotland, with the subsidiary titles of Marquess of Ormond, Earl of Ross and Lord Ardmannoch [2]\n\n\nHeir apparent\nIn 1613, Charles's sister Elizabeth married Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and moved to Heidelberg [15] In 1617, the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, a Catholic, was elected king of Bohemia The next year, the Bohemians rebelled, defenestrating the Catholic governors In August 1619, the Bohemian diet chose Frederick, who led the Protestant Union, as their monarch, while Ferdinand was elected Holy Roman Emperor in the imperial election Frederick's acceptance of the Bohemian crown in defiance of the emperor marked the beginning of the turmoil that would develop into the Thirty Years' War The conflict, originally confined to Bohemia, spiralled into a wider European war, which the English Parliament and public quickly grew to see as a polarised continental struggle between Catholics and Protestants [16] In 1620, King Frederick was defeated at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague and his hereditary lands in the Electoral Palatinate were invaded by a Habsburg force from the Spanish Netherlands [17] James, however, had been seeking marriage between Prince Charles and Ferdinand's niece, Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, and began to see the Spanish match as a possible diplomatic means of achieving peace in Europe [18]\n\n\nEarly reign\nWith the failure of the Spanish match, Charles and Buckingham turned their attention to France [37] On 1 May 1625 Charles was married by proxy to the 15-year-old French princess Henrietta Maria in front of the doors of Notre Dame de Paris [38] He had seen her in Paris while en route to Spain [39] They met in person on 13 June 1625 in Canterbury Charles delayed the opening of his first Parliament until after the marriage was consummated, to forestall any opposition [40] Many members of the Commons opposed his marriage to a Catholic, fearing that he would lift restrictions on Catholic recusants and undermine the official establishment of the reformed Church of England Charles told Parliament that he would not relax religious restrictions, but promised to do exactly that in a secret marriage treaty with his brother-in-law Louis XIII of France [41] Moreover, the treaty loaned to the French seven English naval ships that were used to suppress the Protestant Huguenots at La Rochelle in September 1625 [42] Charles was crowned on 2 February 1626 at Westminster Abbey, but without his wife at his side, because she refused to participate in a Protestant religious ceremony [43]\n\n\nPersonal rule\nIn January 1629, Charles opened the second session of the English Parliament, which had been prorogued in June 1628, with a moderate speech on the tonnage and poundage issue [77] Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles's policies in light of the case of John Rolle, a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage [78] Many MPs viewed the imposition of the tax as a breach of the Petition of Right When Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 2 March, [79] members held the Speaker, Sir John Finch, down in his chair so that the session could be prolonged long enough for resolutions against Catholicism, Arminianism, and tonnage and poundage to be read out and acclaimed by the chamber [80] The provocation was too much for Charles, who dissolved Parliament and had nine parliamentary leaders, including Sir John Eliot, imprisoned over the matter, [81] thereby turning the men into martyrs [82] and giving popular cause to their protest [83]\n\n\nParliament prorogued\nIn January 1629, Charles opened the second session of the English Parliament, which had been prorogued in June 1628, with a moderate speech on the tonnage and poundage issue [77] Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles's policies in light of the case of John Rolle, a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage [78] Many MPs viewed the imposition of the tax as a breach of the Petition of Right When Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 2 March, [79] members held the Speaker, Sir John Finch, down in his chair so that the session could be prolonged long enough for resolutions against Catholicism, Arminianism, and tonnage and poundage to be read out and acclaimed by the chamber [80] The provocation was too much for Charles, who dissolved Parliament and had nine parliamentary leaders, including Sir John Eliot, imprisoned over the matter, [81] thereby turning the men into martyrs [82] and giving popular cause to their protest [83]\n\n\nFinances\nA large fiscal deficit had arisen during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I [89] Notwithstanding Buckingham's short-lived campaigns against both Spain and France, Charles had little financial capacity to wage wars overseas Throughout his reign, he was obliged to rely primarily on volunteer forces for defence and on diplomatic efforts to support his sister Elizabeth and his foreign policy objective for the restoration of the Palatinate [90] England was still the least taxed country in Europe, with no official excise and no regular direct taxation [91] To raise revenue without reconvening Parliament, Charles resurrected an all-but-forgotten law called the \"Distraint of Knighthood\", in abeyance for over a century, which required any man who earned £40 or more from land each year to present himself at the king's coronation to be knighted Relying on this old statute, Charles fined those who had failed to attend his coronation in 1626 [92] [e]\n\n\nReligious conflicts\nThroughout Charles's reign, the English Reformation was in the forefront of political debate Arminian theology emphasised clerical authority and the individual's ability to reject or accept salvation, which opponents viewed as heretical and a potential vehicle for the reintroduction of Catholicism Puritan reformers considered Charles too sympathetic to Arminianism, [g] and opposed his desire to move the Church of England in a more traditional and sacramental direction [108] In addition, his Protestant subjects followed the European war closely [109] and grew increasingly dismayed by Charles's diplomacy with Spain and his failure to support the Protestant cause abroad effectively [110]\n\n\nBishops' Wars\nCharles perceived the unrest in Scotland as a rebellion against his authority, precipitating the First Bishops' War in 1639 [124] He did not seek subsidies from the English Parliament to wage war, instead raising an army without parliamentary aid and marching to Berwick-upon-Tweed, on the Scottish border [125] The army did not engage the Covenanters, as the king feared the defeat of his forces, whom he believed to be significantly outnumbered by the Scots [126] In the Treaty of Berwick, Charles regained custody of his Scottish fortresses and secured the dissolution of the Covenanters' interim government, albeit at the decisive concession that both the Scottish Parliament and General Assembly of the Scottish Church were called [127]\n\n\nLong Parliament\nThe Long Parliament proved just as difficult for Charles as had the Short Parliament It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach the king's leading counsellors for high treason [151] Strafford was taken into custody on 10 November; Laud was impeached on 18 December; Finch, now Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, was impeached the next day, and consequently fled to The Hague with Charles's permission on 21 December [152] To prevent the king from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the Triennial Act, which required Parliament to be summoned at least every three years, and permitted the Lord Keeper and 12 peers to summon Parliament if the king failed to do so [153] The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill, and to secure the latter, Charles grudgingly granted royal assent in February 1641 [154]\n\n\nTensions escalate\nThe Long Parliament proved just as difficult for Charles as had the Short Parliament It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach the king's leading counsellors for high treason [151] Strafford was taken into custody on 10 November; Laud was impeached on 18 December; Finch, now Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, was impeached the next day, and consequently fled to The Hague with Charles's permission on 21 December [152] To prevent the king

the king failed to do so [153] The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill, and to secure the latter, Charles grudgingly granted royal assent in February 1641 [154]\n\n\nIrish rebellion\nIreland's population was split into three main sociopolitical groups: the Gaelic Irish, who were Catholic; the Old English, who were descended from medieval Normans and also predominantly Catholic; and the New English, who were Protestant settlers from England and Scotland aligned with the English Parliament and the Covenanters Strafford's administration had improved the Irish economy and boosted tax revenue, but had done so by heavy-handedly imposing order [173] He had trained up a large Catholic army in support of the king and weakened the Irish Parliament's authority, [174] while continuing to confiscate land from Catholics for Protestant settlement at the same time as promoting a Laudian Anglicanism that was anathema to presbyterians [175] As a result, all three groups had become disaffected [176] Strafford's impeachment provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby all sides joined to present evidence against him [177] In a similar manner to the English Parliament, the Old English members of the Irish Parliament argued that while opposed to Strafford they remained loyal to Charles They argued that the king had been led astray by malign counsellors, [178] and that, moreover, a viceroy such as Strafford could emerge as a despotic figure instead of ensuring that the king was directly involved in governance [179]\n\n\nFive members\nCharles suspected, probably correctly, that some members of the English Parliament had colluded with the invading Scots [200] On 3 January 1642, Charles directed Parliament to give up five specific members of the Commons—Pym, John Hampden, Denzil Holles, William Strode and Sir Arthur Haselrig—and one peer, Lord Mandeville, on the grounds of high treason [201] When Parliament refused, it was possibly Henrietta Maria who persuaded Charles to arrest the five members by force, which he resolved to do personally [202] But news of the warrant reached Parliament ahead of him, and the wanted men slipped away by boat shortly before Charles entered the House of Commons with an armed guard on 4 January [203] Having displaced Speaker William Lenthall from his chair, the king asked him where the MPs had fled Lenthall, on his knees, [204] famously replied, \"May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.\" [205] Charles abjectly declared \"all my birds have flown\", and was forced to retire empty-handed [206]\n\n\nEnglish Civil War\nIn mid-1642, both sides began to arm Charles raised an army using the medieval method of commission of array, and Parliament called for volunteers for its militia [214] The negotiations proved futile, and Charles raised the royal standard in Nottingham on 22 August 1642 [215] By then, his forces controlled roughly the Midlands, Wales, the West Country and northern England He set up his court at Oxford Parliament controlled London, the south-east and East Anglia, as well as the English navy [216]\n\n\nCaptivity\nParliament held Charles under house arrest at Holdenby House in Northamptonshire until Cornet George Joyce took him by threat of force from Holdenby on 3 June in the name of the New Model Army [238] By this time, mutual suspicion had developed between Parliament, which favoured army disbandment and presbyterianism, and the New Model Army, which was primarily officered by congregationalist Independents, who sought a greater political role [239] Charles was eager to exploit the widening divisions, and apparently viewed Joyce's actions as an opportunity rather than a threat [240] He was taken first to Newmarket, at his own suggestion, [241] and then transferred to Oatlands and subsequently Hampton Court, while more fruitless negotiations took place [242] By November, he determined that it would be in his best interests to escape—perhaps to France, Southern England or Berwick-upon-Tweed, near the Scottish border [243] He fled Hampton Court on 11 November, and from the shores of Southampton Water made contact with Colonel Robert Hammond, Parliamentary Governor of the Isle of Wight, whom he apparently believed to be sympathetic [244] But Hammond confined Charles in Carisbrooke Castle and informed Parliament that Charles was in his custody [245]\n\n\nTrial\nCharles was moved to Hurst Castle at the end of 1648, and thereafter to Windsor Castle [257] In January 1649, the Rump Parliament House of Commons indicted him for treason, however the House of Lords rejected the charge [258] The idea of trying a king was novel [259] The Chief Justices of the three common law courts of England—Henry Rolle, Oliver St John and John Wilde—all opposed the indictment as unlawful [260]\n\n\nExecution\nCharles's execution was scheduled for Tuesday, 30 January 1649 Two of his children remained in England under the control of the Parliamentarians: Elizabeth and Henry They were permitted to visit him on 29 January, and he bade them a tearful farewell [277] The next morning, he called for two shirts to prevent the cold weather causing any noticeable shivers that the crowd could have mistaken for fear: [278] [279] \"the season is so sharp as probably may make me shake, which some observers may imagine proceeds from fear I would have no such imputation.\" [278]\n\n\nLegacy\nTen days after Charles's execution, on the day of his interment, a memoir purportedly written by him appeared for sale [297] This book, the Eikon Basilike (Greek for the \"Royal Portrait\"), contained an apologia for royal policies, and proved an effective piece of royalist propaganda John Milton wrote a Parliamentary rejoinder, the Eikonoklastes (\"The Iconoclast\"), but the response made little headway against the pathos of the royalist book [300] Anglicans and royalists fashioned an image of martyrdom, [301] and in the Convocations of Canterbury and York of 1660 King Charles the Martyr was added to the Church of England's liturgical calendar [302] High church Anglicans held special services on the anniversary of his death Churches, such as those at Falmouth and Tunbridge Wells, and Anglican devotional societies such as the Society of King Charles the Martyr, were founded in his honour [137]\n\n\nArt\nPartly inspired by his visit to the Spanish court in 1623, [310] Charles became a passionate and knowledgeable art collector, amassing one of the finest art collections ever assembled [311] In Spain, he sat for a sketch by Velázquez, and acquired works by Titian and Correggio, among others [312] In England, his commissions included the ceiling of the Banqueting House, Whitehall, by Rubens and paintings by other artists from the Low Countries such as van Honthorst, Mytens, and van Dyck [313] His close associates, including the Duke of Buckingham and the Earl of Arundel, shared his interest and have been dubbed the Whitehall Group [314] In 1627 and 1628, Charles purchased the entire collection of the Duke of Mantua, which included work by Titian, Correggio, Raphael, Caravaggio, del Sarto and Mantegna [315] His collection grew further to encompass Bernini, Bruegel, Leonardo, Holbein, Hollar, Tintoretto and Veronese, and self-portraits by both Dürer and Rembrandt [316] By Charles's death, there were an estimated 1,760 paintings, [317] most of which were sold and dispersed by Parliament [318]\n\n\nAssessments\nIn the words of John Philipps Kenyon, \"Charles Stuart is a man of contradictions and controversy\" [319] Revered by high Tories who considered him a saintly martyr, [137] he was condemned by Whig historians, such as Samuel Rawson Gardiner, who thought him duplicitous and delusional [320] In recent decades, most historians have criticised him, [321] the main exception being Kevin Sharpe, who offered a more sympathetic view that has not been widely adopted [322] Sharpe argued that the king was a dynamic man of conscience, but Barry Coward thought Charles \"the most incompetent monarch of England since Henry VI\", [323] a view shared by Ronald Hutton, who called him \"the worst king we have had since the Middle Ages\" [324]\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\nThe official style of Charles I as king in England was \"Charles, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\" [331] The style \"of France\" was only nominal, and was used by every English monarch from Edward III to George III, regardless of the amount of French territory actually controlled [332] The authors of his death warrant called him \"Charles Stuart, King of England\" [333]\n\n\nTitles and styles\nThe official style of Charles I as king in England was \"Charles, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and

England**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nCharles I was the King of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1625 until his execution in 1649. He was the second son of King James VI of Scotland and Anne of Denmark, and was born on 19 November 1600 at Dunfermline Palace in Fife, Scotland. Charles's reign was marked by a series of conflicts with Parliament, including the English Civil War, which ultimately led to his execution.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nCharles was born as the second son of King James VI of Scotland and Anne of Denmark. He was baptised on 23 December 1600 in the Chapel Royal of Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh, Scotland. At the baptism, Charles was created Duke of Albany, a traditional title given to the second son of the King of Scotland. He also received the subsidiary titles of Marquess of Ormond, Earl of Ross, and Lord Ardmannoch.\n\n**Heir Apparent**\n\nIn 1613, Charles's sister Elizabeth married Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and moved to Heidelberg. This event marked the beginning of Charles's interest in the Palatinate and its Protestant cause. In 1617, the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand of Austria was elected King of Bohemia, which led to a rebellion in Bohemia in 1618. The Bohemians chose Frederick as their monarch, but he was defeated at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague in 1620. The failure of the Spanish match between Charles and Ferdinand's niece, Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, led Charles to turn his attention to France.\n\n**Early Reign**\n\nOn 1 May 1625, Charles was married by proxy to the 15-year-old French princess Henrietta Maria in front of the doors of Notre Dame de Paris. He had seen her in Paris while en route to Spain. They met in person on 13 June 1625 in Canterbury, but Charles delayed the opening of his first Parliament until after the marriage was consummated to forestall any opposition. Many members of the Commons opposed his marriage to a Catholic, fearing that he would lift restrictions on Catholic recusants and undermine the official establishment of the reformed Church of England.\n\n**Personal Rule**\n\nIn January 1629, Charles opened the second session of the English Parliament, which had been prorogued in June 1628, with a moderate speech on the tonnage and poundage issue. Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles's policies in light of the case of John Rolle, a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage. Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 2 March, but members held the Speaker, Sir John Finch, down in his chair so that the session could be prolonged long enough for resolutions against Catholicism, Arminianism, and tonnage and poundage to be read out and acclaimed by the chamber.\n\n**Parliament Prorogued**\n\nIn January 1629, Charles opened the second session of the English Parliament, which had been prorogued in June 1628, with a moderate speech on the tonnage and poundage issue. Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles's policies in light of the case of John Rolle, a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage. Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 2 March, but members held the Speaker, Sir John Finch, down in his chair so that the session could be prolonged long enough for resolutions against Catholicism, Arminianism, and tonnage and poundage to be read out and acclaimed by the chamber.\n\n**Finances**\n\nA large fiscal deficit had arisen during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. Notwithstanding Buckingham's short-lived campaigns against both Spain and France, Charles had little financial capacity to wage wars overseas. Throughout his reign, he was obliged to rely primarily on volunteer forces for defence and on diplomatic efforts to support his sister Elizabeth and his foreign policy objective for the restoration of the Palatinate. England was still the least taxed country in Europe, with no official excise and no regular direct taxation. To raise revenue without reconvening Parliament, Charles resurrected an all-but-forgotten law called the \"Distraint of Knighthood\", in abeyance for over a century, which required any man who earned £40 or more from land each year to present himself at the king's coronation to be knighted.\n\n**Religious Conflicts**\n\nThroughout Charles's reign, the English Reformation was in the forefront of political debate. Arminian theology emphasised clerical authority and the individual's ability to reject or accept salvation, which opponents viewed as heretical and a potential vehicle for the reintroduction of Catholicism. Puritan reformers considered Charles too sympathetic to Arminianism, and opposed his desire to move the Church of England in a more traditional and sacramental direction.\n\n**Bishops' Wars**\n\nCharles perceived the unrest in Scotland as a rebellion against his authority, precipitating the First Bishops' War in 1639. He did not seek subsidies from the English Parliament to wage war, instead raising an army without parliamentary aid and marching to Berwick-upon-Tweed, on the Scottish border. The army did not engage the Covenanters, as the king feared the defeat of his forces, whom he believed to be significantly outnumbered by the Scots.\n\n**Long Parliament**\n\nThe Long Parliament proved just as difficult for Charles as had the Short Parliament. It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach the king's leading counsellors for high treason. Strafford was taken into custody on 10 November; Laud was impeached on 18 December; Finch, now Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, was impeached the next day, and consequently fled to The Hague with Charles's permission on 21 December.\n\n**Tensions Escalate**\n\nThe Long Parliament proved just as difficult for Charles as had the Short Parliament. It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach the king's leading counsellors for high treason. Strafford was taken into custody on 10 November; Laud was impeached on 18 December; Finch, now Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, was impeached the next day, and consequently fled to The Hague with Charles's permission on 21 December.\n\n**Irish Rebellion**\n\nIreland's population was split into three main sociopolitical groups: the Gaelic Irish, who were Catholic; the Old English, who were descended from medieval Normans and also predominantly Catholic; and the New English, who were Protestant settlers from England and Scotland aligned with the English Parliament and the Covenanters. Strafford's administration had improved the Irish economy and boosted tax revenue, but had done so by heavy-handedly imposing order. He had trained up a large Catholic army in support of the king and weakened the Irish Parliament's authority, while continuing to confiscate land from Catholics for Protestant settlement at the same time as promoting a Laudian Anglicanism that was anathema to presbyterians.\n\n**Five Members**\n\nCharles suspected, probably correctly, that some members of the English Parliament had colluded with the invading Scots. On 3 January 1642, Charles directed Parliament to give up five specific members of the Commons—Pym, John Hampden, Denzil Holles, William Strode, and Sir Arthur Haselrig—and one peer, Lord Mandeville, on the grounds of high treason. When Parliament refused, it was possibly Henrietta Maria who persuaded Charles to arrest the five members by force, which he resolved to do personally. But news of the warrant reached Parliament ahead of him, and the wanted men slipped away by boat shortly before Charles entered the House of Commons with an armed guard on 4 January.\n\n**English Civil War**\n\nIn mid-1642, both sides began to arm. Charles raised an army using the medieval method of commission of array, and Parliament called for volunteers for its militia. The negotiations proved futile, and Charles raised the royal standard in Nottingham on 22 August 1642. By then, his forces controlled roughly the Midlands, Wales, the West Country, and northern England. He set up his court at Oxford. Parliament controlled London, the south-east, and East Anglia, as well as the English navy.\n\n**Captivity**\n\nParliament held Charles under house arrest at Holdenby House in Northamptonshire until Cornet George Joyce took him by threat of force from Holdenby on 3 June in the name of the New Model Army. By this time, mutual suspicion had developed between Parliament, which favoured army disbandment and presbyterianism, and the New Model Army, which was primarily officered by congregationalist Independents, who sought a greater political role.

rebelled, defenestrating the Catholic governors In August 1619, the Bohemian diet chose Frederick, who led the Protestant Union, as their monarch, while Ferdinand was elected Holy Roman Emperor in the imperial election Frederick's acceptance of the Bohemian crown in defiance of the emperor marked the beginning of the turmoil that would develop into the Thirty Years' War The conflict, originally confined to Bohemia, spiralled into a wider European war, which the English Parliament and public quickly grew to see as a polarised continental struggle between Catholics and Protestants [16] In 1620, King Frederick was defeated at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague and his hereditary lands in the Electoral Palatinate were invaded by a Habsburg force from the Spanish Netherlands [17] James, however, had been seeking marriage between Prince Charles and Ferdinand's niece, Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, and began to see the Spanish match as a possible diplomatic means of achieving

lift restrictions on Catholic recusants and undermine the official establishment of the reformed Church of England Charles told Parliament that he would not relax religious restrictions, but promised to do exactly that in a secret marriage treaty with his brother-in-law Louis XIII of France [41] Moreover, the treaty loaned to the French seven English naval ships that were used to suppress the Protestant Huguenots at La Rochelle in September 1625 [42] Charles was crowned on 2 February 1626 at Westminster Abbey, but without his wife at his side, because she refused to participate in a Protestant religious ceremony [43]\n\n\nPersonal rule\nIn January 1629, Charles opened the second session of the English Parliament, which had been prorogued in June 1628, with a moderate speech on

a more traditional and sacramental direction [108] In addition, his Protestant subjects followed the European war closely [109] and grew increasingly dismayed by Charles's diplomacy with Spain and his failure to support the Protestant cause abroad effectively [110]\n\n\nBishops' Wars\nCharles perceived the unrest in Scotland as a rebellion against his authority, precipitating the First Bishops' War

disaffected [176] Strafford's impeachment provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby all sides joined to present evidence against him [177] In a similar manner to the English Parliament, the Old English members of the Irish Parliament argued that while opposed to Strafford they remained loyal to Charles They argued that the king had been led astray by malign counsellors, [178] and that,

medieval method of commission of array, and Parliament called for volunteers for its militia [214] The negotiations proved futile, and Charles raised the royal standard in Nottingham on 22 August 1642 [215] By then, his forces controlled roughly the Midlands, Wales, the West Country and northern England He set up his court at Oxford Parliament controlled London, the south-east and East Anglia, as well as the English navy [216]\n\n\nCaptivity\nParliament held Charles under house arrest at Holdenby House in Northamptonshire until Cornet George Joyce took him by threat of force from Holdenby on 3 June in the name of the New Model Army [238] By this time, mutual suspicion had developed between Parliament, which favoured army disbandment and presbyterianism, and the New Model Army, which was primarily officered by congregationalist Independents, who sought a greater political role [239] Charles was eager to exploit the widening divisions, and apparently viewed Joyce's actions as an opportunity rather than a threat [240] He was taken first to Newmarket, at his own suggestion, [241] and then transferred to Oatlands and subsequently Hampton Court, while more fruitless negotiations took place [242] By November, he determined that it would be in his best interests to escape—perhaps to France, Southern England or Berwick-upon-Tweed, near the Scottish border [243] He fled Hampton Court on 11 November, and from the shores of Southampton Water made contact with Colonel Robert Hammond, Parliamentary Governor of the Isle of Wight, whom he apparently believed to be sympathetic [244] But Hammond confined Charles in Carisbrooke Castle and informed Parliament that Charles was in his custody [245]\n\n\nTrial\nCharles was moved to Hurst Castle at the end of 1648, and thereafter to Windsor Castle [257] In January 1649, the Rump Parliament House of Commons indicted him for treason, however the House of Lords rejected the charge [258] The idea of trying a king was novel [259] The Chief Justices of the three common law courts of England—Henry Rolle, Oliver St John and John Wilde—all opposed the indictment as unlawful [260]\n\n\nExecution\nCharles's execution was scheduled for Tuesday, 30 January 1649 Two of his children remained in England under the control of the Parliamentarians: Elizabeth and Henry They were permitted to visit him on 29 January, and he bade them a tearful farewell [277] The next morning, he called for two shirts to prevent the cold weather causing any noticeable shivers that the crowd could have mistaken for fear: [278] [279] \"the season is so sharp as probably may make me shake, which some observers may imagine proceeds from fear I would have no such imputation.\" [278]\n\n\nLegacy\nTen days after Charles's execution, on the day of his interment, a memoir purportedly written by him appeared for sale [297] This book, the Eikon Basilike (Greek for the \"Royal Portrait\"), contained an apologia for royal policies, and proved an effective piece of royalist propaganda John Milton wrote a Parliamentary rejoinder, the Eikonoklastes (\"The Iconoclast\"), but the response made little headway against the pathos of the royalist book [300] Anglicans and royalists fashioned an image of martyrdom, [301] and in the Convocations of Canterbury and York of 1660 King Charles the Martyr was added to the Church of England's liturgical calendar [302] High church Anglicans held special services on the anniversary of his death Churches, such as those at Falmouth and Tunbridge Wells, and Anglican devotional societies such as the Society of King Charles the Martyr, were founded in his honour [137]\n\n\nArt\nPartly inspired by his visit to the Spanish court in 1623, [310] Charles became a passionate and knowledgeable art collector, amassing one of the finest art collections ever assembled [311] In Spain, he sat for a sketch by Velázquez, and acquired works by Titian and Correggio, among others [312] In England, his commissions included the ceiling of the Banqueting House, Whitehall, by Rubens and paintings by other artists from the Low Countries such as van Honthorst, Mytens, and van Dyck [313] His close associates, including the Duke of Buckingham and the Earl of Arundel, shared his interest and have been dubbed the Whitehall Group [314] In 1627 and 1628, Charles purchased the entire collection of the Duke of Mantua, which included work by Titian, Correggio, Raphael, Caravaggio, del Sarto and Mantegna [315] His collection grew further to encompass Bernini, Bruegel, Leonardo, Holbein, Hollar, Tintoretto and Veronese, and self-portraits by both Dürer and Rembrandt [316] By Charles's death, there were an estimated 1,760 paintings, [317] most of which were sold and dispersed by Parliament [318]\n\n\nAssessments\nIn the words of John Philipps Kenyon, \"Charles Stuart is a man of contradictions and controversy\" [319] Revered by high Tories who considered him a saintly martyr, [137] he was condemned by Whig historians, such as Samuel Rawson Gardiner, who thought him duplicitous and delusional [320] In recent decades, most historians have criticised him, [321] the main exception being Kevin Sharpe, who offered a more sympathetic view that has not been widely adopted [322] Sharpe argued that the king was a dynamic man of conscience, but Barry Coward thought Charles \"the most incompetent monarch of England since Henry VI\", [323] a view shared by Ronald Hutton, who called him \"the worst king we have had since the Middle Ages\" [324]\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\nThe official style of Charles I as king in England was \"Charles, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.\" [331] The style \"of France\" was only nominal, and was used by every English monarch from Edward III to George III, regardless of the amount of French territory actually controlled [332] The authors of his death warrant called him \"Charles Stuart, King of England\" [333]\n\n\nTitles and styles\nThe official style of Charles I as king in England was \"Charles, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and

a label Argent of three points, each bearing three torteaux Gules [335] As the Prince of Wales, he bore the royal arms differenced by a plain label Argent of three points [336] As king, Charles bore the royal arms undifferenced: Quarterly, I and IV Grandquarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion rampant within

{"title": "Patrick_Henry_(packet)", "content": "\nHistory\nThe Patrick Henry was designed and constructed by the shipbuilding firm Brown & Bell, at the foot of Stanton Street and Houston Street on the East River in New York City [4] She was registered on November 6, 1839, at 880/905 tons (old/new measurement) and was 159 feet in length, 34 feet 10 inches in beam, and 21 feet 10 inches in depth of hold, with two decks and a draft of eighteen feet [5]\n\n\nPerformance\nThe Patrick Henry's westward passages averaged 34 days, her shortest passage being 22 days, her longest 46 days Beginning in 1852 her westbound passages averaged 32 days, her shortest passage being 26 days, her longest 41 days The vessel's best homeward crossing of 22 days was better than the crossings of either of the grander packets: the Swallowtail's Cornelius Grinnell (built in 1850, 1,100 tons) and the Black Ball Line's Great Western (built in 1851, 1,443 tons)  Her longest run in the London-Portsmouth run at 41 days was even better than the Grinnell (48 days) or the New World (built in 1846, 1,400 tons) (42 days), one of the largest Swallowtails [12] [13] The Patrick Henry was among only four packets of the day—Montezuma, Southampton, St Andrew, and the prestigious clipper Dreadnought—to make the eastbound passage from New York to Liverpool in fourteen days or less  Only two transatlantic sailing packets showed a better average speed record on the westbound crossing for a period of twenty-five years or more (thirty-three days) and only one equaled her average performance [12]\n\n\nConstruction\nThe Patrick Henry mirrored her namesake in her radical nature, according to the Mayor of New York Philip Hone, who kept a diary said to be the most extensive and detailed on the first half of the US in the 19th century \"She is the ne plus ultra, or will be, until another ship of her class shall be built,\" he wrote in October 1839 after touring the \"splendid new ship\" with Henry Grinnell, one of her owners  For five years, the Patrick Henry was the largest packet ship among New York's eight packet lines [15]\n\n\nSaloon and staterooms\n\"The saloon is a splendid apartment, of about fifteen yards in length  [\"Saloon\" refers to shared common space on sailing ships onto which staterooms or cabins opened, often used for dining and drinking.] The sides are beautifully empanelled in the finest choice wood of \"every clime,\" in nearly the same style as the cabin of the \"Roscius,\" forming an exceedingly rich and effective specimen of cabinet work.\n\n\nLaunch\nFive days before her launch, on November 2, 1839, the New York Morning Herald published an article titled, \"Fête On Board The Patrick Henry,\" that documented a \"neat little .. pic-nic, or collation\" given by its widely respected captain, \"aboard the splendid new ship,\" and, \"attended by all the elite.\" The reviewer called the vessel, \"a perfect bijou,\" and wrote that \" [h]er cabins are superb, her quarter-deck very convenient, and the new arrangement in the poop is admirable Captain Delano is filling rapidly up with passengers...\" [18]\n\n\nOwners\nThe Patrick Henry was purchased and owned by the once preeminent New York Shipping House Grinnell, Minturn & Co., a conglomerate of merchant and sailing magnates with New England Quaker roots In 1851, she was owned by: Henry Grinnell (3/16), Moses H Grinnell and Robert B Minturn (8/16), Capt Sheldon G Hubbard (1/16), Capt Joseph Rogers (2/16), and Capt Joseph C Delano (2/16) \"During the days of sailing vessels, the house of Grinnell, Minturn & Co was one of the wealthiest and most extensively engaged in business in the United States, and it is still among the most prominent in its line of business in the city,\" according to an 1881 issue of the New York Times.\n\n\nCaptain\nHer primary commander was Captain Joseph Clement Delano (1796–1886), New Bedford, Mass., of the famed Delano family with its many prominent mariners, whalers and shipbuilders whose commercial success advanced the family into the Massachusetts aristocracy, sometimes referred to as one of the Boston Brahmins (the \"First Families of Boston\") Joseph was first cousin to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's maternal grandfather Warren Delano Jr., the American merchant who made a large fortune smuggling illegal opium into China [31]\n\n\nCrew\nAn early notable crew member was Peter Ogden, who served as steward on the Patrick Henry The steward on packet ships was considered a high-ranking service position He was generally responsible for feeding and dressing the captain, mates and passengers An early description of the steward refers to him wearing \"a brilliant-coloured morning-gown and red slippers\" though this is considered to romanticize the role Oftentimes, the steward was free, Black and multilingual.\n\n\nNotable voyages\nBetween 1839 and 1864, the packet ship Patrick Henry made at least 60 (documented) roundtrip crossings, carrying passengers, specie, a wide range of newspapers, magazines and periodicals, personal letters and packages, business mail, transactions and documents, merchandise, freight and cargo, including large shipments of wheat and flour on commission for the Baring Brothers [44]\n\n\nEarly career\nThe Patrick Henry hosted six of the Twelve Apostles of the Latter Day Saint movement including George A Smith and Brigham Young on a voyage from New York to Liverpool, where they began their mission in England as prophesied by Joseph Smith At sea for 28 days in March 1840, Captain Joseph Delano and crew teased the group, calling them \"landlubbers.\" \"During our passage over we had two very heavy gales;\" wrote Apostle Heber C Kimball \"The ship's mate said he had not seen such for fifteen years back: the ship's crew was kind to us.\" [45] Brigham Young was \"so sick that he was confined to his berth nearly the entire voyage\" The ailing Young was so thankful to set foot on land that he \"gave a loud shout of hosanna.\" [46] In June 1845, the Patrick Henry, commanded by Captain Joseph Delano, hosted Horatio Potter, the educator and the sixth bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, who was offered free passage on the Patrick Henry by one of its owners, Robert Bowne Minturn, after he spoke to his friend about a \"slight irritation about the throat\" and a need for rest Potter wrote in a letter dated May 26, 1845, to the vestry of St Peter's Church, in Albany, where he was rector: \"I feel that a sea voyage, removing me from all labor and care, giving me the benefit of sea air and travel in a foreign land, with time and opportunity to refresh my mind as well as my body, would be a great relief and a great benefit, not only to myself personally, but to my spiritual charge.\" [47]\n\n\nVs. the William J. Romer\nOn February 9, 1846, hundreds of people gathered at the Battery overlooking the East River to watch the beginning of a notable, singular regatta from New York to Liverpool between what was considered one of the fastest pilot boats, the fifty-ton schooner William J Romer, and the Patrick Henry, captained by Joseph's younger brother and former first mate, John Allerton Delano (1809–1893) Rumors circulated about the \"mysterious\" mission of the Romer Was she to bring Queen Victoria? Did she carry news of the Oregon negotiation? Another was that she took six \"heavy brass cannon\" and was going \"pirating or privateering.\"\n\n\nFare and conditions\nThe \"real price\" in today's currency for what would have been a single, first-class (cabin or stateroom) passage on the Patrick Henry in January 1846 is $3037.92, or 25£ in 1846; the price for one adult steerage ticket is between $500 and $750 today, or 4£ and 6£ in 1846 Steerage refers to the cargo hold [49] The gross receipts from passengers (at full capacity) on a single crossing of the PH across the Atlantic, from Liverpool to New York, would amount to as much as $225,000 today [50]\n\n\nBlack '47\nIn arguably the worst year of the Great Famine, on May 6 and again on September 7, 1847, the Patrick Henry, under Captain Joseph Delano, left the Burling Slip on South Street in New York and transported relief from societies in Brooklyn (primarily May 6 run), Albany, Rochester, New York, the State of Ohio, and Burlington, New Jersey, that included clothing, Indian corn, cornmeal, rye, wheat, peas, beans, flour, meal, barley, buckwheat, bread and pork, to Liverpool, valued at the time at $4,636.22 (May: $1,166.07; Sept: $3,470.15), today worth about $150,000, [53] to be distributed by the Committee of Society of Friends in Dublin to the people of Ireland [54] [3] [55] The Patrick Henry under Captain Delano may have made her first humanitarian voyage in February 1846, when she was reported to carry \"a very large cargo, principally of breadstuffs\" to Cork, Ireland [56]\n\n\nOwner passage\nThe following May (1848), Captain Joseph Delano hosted shipowner Robert Minturn, his wife, sister-in-law, six children and servants on a voyage to England \" [The Patrick Henry] was one of the vessels which had so often before carried invalids, or tired clergymen, or young men broken down by study, sent by Mr Minturn to recruit their strength by a voyage,\" a family member wrote in an hagiography published privately after his death \"He had so frequently done these kindnesses, that the application for them at last became incessant Sometimes it was for an individual, sometimes for a family of foreigners, who had come to America in search of what they did not find — a living — and were most thankful to be sent back to their homes across the Atlantic.\" [67] The Minturns took an eighteen-month tour of England, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Jerusalem and Egypt that was said to have inspired plans that led to the creation of New York's Central Park [68]\n\n\nAt quarantine\nOn August 8, 1849, the Patrick Henry landed at New York and reported seven cabin passengers and 278 steerage passengers [72] The New York papers did not mention that seven people died on the 46-day passage nor that fever had broken out nor that the ship may have quarantined at the New York Marine Hospital on Staten Island, site of the later Staten Island Quarantine War Minister and publisher Joseph Barker and a reporter, aboard the ship Hartford, which landed in New York after a 53-day passage, reported that 17 passengers aboard the Patrick Henry had died on the journey and the ship \"had, in consequence, to remain some time in quarantine.\" He wrote that many of the passengers aboard the Hartford, including himself, had \"regretted\" not sailing on the Patrick Henry.\n\n\nRough crossings\nBy 1851, J.E Mulland was listed captain and on November 3, he arrived in New York (from London) with 374 passengers, 14 first-class and 360 steerage, with seven dead It was his last voyage commanding the PH [74]\n\n\nCommerce and journalism\nReceiving information as quickly as possible—whether regarding particulars about trade, foreign markets, decision-making, professional partnerships, business documents, legal contracts, personal letters and political, government and military news—was of urgent importance to 19th-century commerce Industry and business made special arrangements to beat their competitors so that sailing ships, especially packet ships involved in the packet trade, emerged as the central information superhighway of the era, and for the development of journalism as well.\n\n\nFinal days\nIn 1860, Captain William B Moore is listed master, and in 1864, after a quarter century of service, the Patrick Henry was \"sold British\" at Londonderry, due to the Civil War, to J.P Allen & Co., Naval and Military Tailors, Londonderry Her final voyage, with passengers, may have begun on June 26, 1871, when she left port at Pensacola, Florida, and sailed to Liverpool, arriving August 19.\n\n\nIn art\nIn 1858, Philip John Ouless (British, 1817–1885), a successful workmanlike painter of marine subjects, made preliminary sketches of the Patrick Henry [90] and in 1859 completed, \"The American Packet Ship \"Patrick Henry\" Off the Cliffs of Dover.\" Oil on canvas, 26 3/4 × 37 1/2 inches Signed with the artist's monogram \"PJO\" and dated 1859, l.r In a gilt period frame In a private collection [91]\n\n\nIn literature\nThe American packet ships of the early to mid-nineteenth century played a large role in the making of a nation, according to The Western Ocean Packets; by their \"sheer virility and heroic energy,\" \"superb strength of brain and muscle,” the \"gallant, hard-sailed packets with their 'tween decks crowded with emigrants,\" became \"one of the most, if not the most, important factor in this world's development along the lines of steady progress, whether moral or physical.\" [92]\n\n\nAdditional mentions in print\nAlbion, Robert Greenhalgh Square-riggers on Schedule: The New York Sailing Packets to England, France, and the Cotton Ports Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1938.\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Patrick Henry (packet)**\n\nThe Patrick Henry was a packet ship that operated in the 19th century, playing a significant role in the transatlantic trade and passenger traffic.

complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Patrick_Henry_(packet)\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe Patrick Henry was designed and constructed by the shipbuilding firm Brown & Bell, at the foot of Stanton Street and Houston Street on the East River in New York City [4] She was registered on November 6, 1839, at 880/905 tons (old/new measurement) and was 159 feet in length, 34 feet 10 inches in beam, and 21 feet 10 inches in depth of hold, with two decks and a draft of eighteen feet [5]\n\n\nPerformance\nThe Patrick Henry's westward passages averaged 34 days, her shortest passage being 22 days, her longest 46 days Beginning in 1852 her westbound passages averaged 32 days, her shortest passage being 26 days, her longest 41 days The vessel's best homeward crossing of 22 days was better than the crossings of either of the grander packets: the Swallowtail's Cornelius Grinnell (built in 1850, 1,100 tons) and the Black Ball Line's Great Western (built in 1851, 1,443 tons)  Her longest run in the London-Portsmouth run at 41 days was even better than the Grinnell (48 days) or the New World (built in 1846, 1,400 tons) (42 days), one of the largest Swallowtails [12] [13] The Patrick Henry was among only four packets of the day—Montezuma, Southampton, St Andrew, and the prestigious clipper Dreadnought—to make the eastbound passage from New York to Liverpool in fourteen days or less  Only two transatlantic sailing packets showed a better average speed record on the westbound crossing for a period of twenty-five years or more (thirty-three days) and only one equaled her average performance [12]\n\n\nConstruction\nThe Patrick Henry mirrored her namesake in her radical nature, according to the Mayor of New York Philip Hone, who kept a diary said to be the most extensive and detailed on the first half of the US in the 19th century \"She is the ne plus ultra, or will be, until another ship of her class shall be built,\" he wrote in October 1839 after touring the \"splendid new ship\" with Henry Grinnell, one of her owners  For five years, the Patrick Henry was the largest packet ship among New York's eight packet lines [15]\n\n\nSaloon and staterooms\n\"The saloon is a splendid apartment, of about fifteen yards in length  [\"Saloon\" refers to shared common space on sailing ships onto which staterooms or cabins opened, often used for dining and drinking.] The sides are beautifully empanelled in the finest choice wood of \"every clime,\" in nearly the same style as the cabin of the \"Roscius,\" forming an exceedingly rich and effective specimen of cabinet work.\n\n\nLaunch\nFive days before her launch, on November 2, 1839, the New York Morning Herald published an article titled, \"Fête On Board The Patrick Henry,\" that documented a \"neat little .. pic-nic, or collation\" given by its widely respected captain, \"aboard the splendid new ship,\" and, \"attended by all the elite.\" The reviewer called the vessel, \"a perfect bijou,\" and wrote that \" [h]er cabins are superb, her quarter-deck very convenient, and the new arrangement in the poop is admirable Captain Delano is filling rapidly up with passengers...\" [18]\n\n\nOwners\nThe Patrick Henry was purchased and owned by the once preeminent New York Shipping House Grinnell, Minturn & Co., a conglomerate of merchant and sailing magnates with New England Quaker roots In 1851, she was owned by: Henry Grinnell (3/16), Moses H Grinnell and Robert B Minturn (8/16), Capt Sheldon G Hubbard (1/16), Capt Joseph Rogers (2/16), and Capt Joseph C Delano (2/16) \"During the days of sailing vessels, the house of Grinnell, Minturn & Co was one of the wealthiest and most extensively engaged in business in the United States, and it is still among the most prominent in its line of business in the city,\" according to an 1881 issue of the New York Times.\n\n\nCaptain\nHer primary commander was Captain Joseph Clement Delano (1796–1886), New Bedford, Mass., of the famed Delano family with its many prominent mariners, whalers and shipbuilders whose commercial success advanced the family into the Massachusetts aristocracy, sometimes referred to as one of the Boston Brahmins (the \"First Families of Boston\") Joseph was first cousin to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's maternal grandfather Warren Delano Jr., the American merchant who made a large fortune smuggling illegal opium into China [31]\n\n\nCrew\nAn early notable crew member was Peter Ogden, who served as steward on the Patrick Henry The steward on packet ships was considered a high-ranking service position He was generally responsible for feeding and dressing the captain, mates and passengers An early description of the steward refers to him wearing \"a brilliant-coloured morning-gown and red slippers\" though this is considered to romanticize the role Oftentimes, the steward was free, Black and multilingual.\n\n\nNotable voyages\nBetween 1839 and 1864, the packet ship Patrick Henry made at least 60 (documented) roundtrip crossings, carrying passengers, specie, a wide range of newspapers, magazines and periodicals, personal letters and packages, business mail, transactions and documents, merchandise, freight and cargo, including large shipments of wheat and flour on commission for the Baring Brothers [44]\n\n\nEarly career\nThe Patrick Henry hosted six of the Twelve Apostles of the Latter Day Saint movement including George A Smith and Brigham Young on a voyage from New York to Liverpool, where they began their mission in England as prophesied by Joseph Smith At sea for 28 days in March 1840, Captain Joseph Delano and crew teased the group, calling them \"landlubbers.\" \"During our passage over we had two very heavy gales;\" wrote Apostle Heber C Kimball \"The ship's mate said he had not seen such for fifteen years back: the ship's crew was kind to us.\" [45] Brigham Young was \"so sick that he was confined to his berth nearly the entire voyage\" The ailing Young was so thankful to set foot on land that he \"gave a loud shout of hosanna.\" [46] In June 1845, the Patrick Henry, commanded by Captain Joseph Delano, hosted Horatio Potter, the educator and the sixth bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, who was offered free passage on the Patrick Henry by one of its owners, Robert Bowne Minturn, after he spoke to his friend about a \"slight irritation about the throat\" and a need for rest Potter wrote in a letter dated May 26, 1845, to the vestry of St Peter's Church, in Albany, where he was rector: \"I feel that a sea voyage, removing me from all labor and care, giving me the benefit of sea air and travel in a foreign land, with time and opportunity to refresh my mind as well as my body, would be a great relief and a great benefit, not only to myself personally, but to my spiritual charge.\" [47]\n\n\nVs. the William J. Romer\nOn February 9, 1846, hundreds of people gathered at the Battery overlooking the East River to watch the beginning of a notable, singular regatta from New York to Liverpool between what was considered one of the fastest pilot boats, the fifty-ton schooner William J Romer, and the Patrick Henry, captained by Joseph's younger brother and former first mate, John Allerton Delano (1809–1893) Rumors circulated about the \"mysterious\" mission of the Romer Was she to bring Queen Victoria? Did she carry news of the Oregon negotiation? Another was that she took six \"heavy brass cannon\" and was going \"pirating or privateering.\"\n\n\nFare and conditions\nThe \"real price\" in today's currency for what would have been a single, first-class (cabin or stateroom) passage on the Patrick Henry in January 1846 is $3037.92, or 25£ in 1846; the price for one adult steerage ticket is between $500 and $750 today, or 4£ and 6£ in 1846 Steerage refers to the cargo hold [49] The gross receipts from passengers (at full capacity) on a single crossing of the PH across the Atlantic, from Liverpool to New York, would amount to as much as $225,000 today [50]\n\n\nBlack '47\nIn arguably the worst year of the Great Famine, on May 6 and again on September 7, 1847, the Patrick Henry, under Captain Joseph Delano, left the Burling Slip on South Street in New York and transported relief from societies in Brooklyn (primarily May 6 run), Albany, Rochester, New York, the State of Ohio, and Burlington, New Jersey, that included clothing, Indian corn, cornmeal, rye, wheat, peas, beans, flour, meal, barley, buckwheat, bread and pork, to Liverpool, valued at the time at $4,636.22 (May: $1,166.07; Sept: $3,470.15), today worth about $150,000, [53] to be distributed by the Committee of Society of Friends in Dublin to the people of Ireland [54] [3] [55] The Patrick Henry under Captain Delano may have made her first humanitarian voyage in February 1846, when she was reported to carry \"a very large cargo, principally of breadstuffs\" to Cork, Ireland [56]\n\n\nOwner passage\nThe following May (1848), Captain Joseph Delano hosted shipowner Robert Minturn, his wife, sister-in-law, six children and servants on a voyage to England \" [The Patrick Henry] was one of the vessels which had so often before carried invalids, or tired clergymen, or young men broken down by study, sent by Mr Minturn to recruit their strength by a voyage,\" a family member wrote in an hagiography published privately after his death \"He had so frequently done these kindnesses, that the application for them at last became incessant Sometimes it was for an individual, sometimes for a family of foreigners, who had come to America in search of what they did not find — a living — and were most thankful to be sent back to their homes across the Atlantic.\" [67] The Minturns took an eighteen-month tour of England, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Jerusalem and Egypt that was said to have inspired plans that led to the creation of New York's Central Park [68]\n\n\nAt quarantine\nOn August 8, 1849, the Patrick Henry landed at New York and reported seven cabin passengers and 278 steerage passengers [72] The New York papers did not mention that seven people died on the 46-day passage nor that fever had broken out nor that the ship may have quarantined at the New York Marine Hospital on Staten Island, site of the later Staten Island Quarantine War Minister and publisher Joseph Barker and a reporter, aboard the ship Hartford, which landed in New York after a 53-day passage, reported that 17 passengers aboard the Patrick Henry had died on the journey and the ship \"had, in consequence, to remain some time in quarantine.\" He wrote that many of the passengers aboard the Hartford, including himself, had \"regretted\" not sailing on the Patrick Henry.\n\n\nRough crossings\nBy 1851, J.E Mulland was listed captain and on November 3, he arrived in New York (from London) with 374 passengers, 14 first-class and 360 steerage, with seven dead It was his last voyage commanding the PH [74]\n\n\nCommerce and journalism\nReceiving information as quickly as possible—whether regarding particulars about trade, foreign markets, decision-making, professional partnerships, business documents, legal contracts, personal letters and political, government and military news—was of urgent importance to 19th-century commerce Industry and business made special arrangements to beat their competitors so that sailing ships, especially packet ships involved in the packet trade, emerged as the central information superhighway of the era, and for the development of journalism as well.\n\n\nFinal days\nIn 1860, Captain William B Moore is listed master, and in 1864, after a quarter century of service, the Patrick Henry was \"sold British\" at Londonderry, due to the Civil War, to J.P Allen & Co., Naval and Military Tailors, Londonderry Her final voyage, with passengers, may have begun on June 26, 1871, when she left port at Pensacola, Florida, and sailed to Liverpool, arriving August 19.\n\n\nIn art\nIn 1858, Philip John Ouless (British, 1817–1885), a successful workmanlike painter of marine subjects, made preliminary sketches of the Patrick Henry [90] and in 1859 completed, \"The American Packet Ship \"Patrick Henry\" Off the Cliffs of Dover.\" Oil on canvas, 26 3/4 × 37 1/2 inches Signed with the artist's monogram \"PJO\" and dated 1859, l.r In a gilt period frame In a private collection [91]\n\n\nIn literature\nThe American packet ships of the early to mid-nineteenth century played a large role in the making of a nation, according to The Western Ocean Packets;

It connects the southern Baltimore neighborhoods of Hawkins Point and Sollers Point to the southeastern part of the city. The bridge is a vital part of the Baltimore region's transportation infrastructure, providing a critical crossing of the Patapsco River and connecting the city to the nearby Interstate 695.\n\nHistory\n----------\n\nBy the early 1960s, the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel (Interstate 895), the first crossing of Baltimore's Harbor, had reached its traffic capacity. The Maryland State Roads Commission concluded there was a need for a second harbor crossing. They began planning another single-tube tunnel under the Patapsco River, downstream and to the southeast, between Hawkins Point and Sollers Point in the outer harbor. In October 1968, this Outer Harbor Tunnel project received financing through a $220 million bond issue that also funded the twinning of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. However, when the bids to build the tunnel were opened in July 1970, they were substantially higher than expected. So officials drafted alternative proposals, including a four-lane bridge, which had the advantage of providing a route across Baltimore Harbor for vehicles carrying hazardous materials barred from tunnels.\n\nConstruction\n------------\n\nThe construction of the Francis Scott Key Bridge began in the early 1970s after the alternative proposal of a four-lane bridge was chosen. The bridge was designed by the engineering firm of Bechtel Group Inc. and built by the Bechtel-Obayashi joint venture. The bridge's design was influenced by the long-span steel arch bridge, with a main span of 1,160 feet (353 meters). The bridge's construction required the use of advanced engineering techniques, including the use of falsework to support the arches during construction. The bridge's foundation was designed to transfer the loads of the bridge to the underlying rock, ensuring the stability of the bridge.\n\nOperation\n----------\n\nThe Key Bridge opened to traffic on March 23, 1977. Including its connecting approaches, the bridge project was 1.6 miles (2.57 kilometers) in length with 8.7 miles (14.00 kilometers) of approach road. In 1978, the bridge received an Award of Merit from the American Institute of Steel Construction in the Long Span category. In 1980, a cargo ship collided with the Key Bridge, but the bridge was relatively undamaged. The bridge has undergone several maintenance and repair projects over the years, including the replacement of the original lighting system and the installation of a new traffic monitoring system.\n\nCollapse\n--------\n\nOn March 26, 2024, at 01:28 EDT (05:28 UTC), the main spans of the bridge collapsed after the Singapore-registered container ship MV Dali lost power and collided with the southwest supporting pier of the main truss section. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the collapse and noted that the Key Bridge was built before the introduction of redundant support structures, which are widely used in modern bridges and would have prevented such a collapse.\n\nReplacement\n------------\n\nHours after the collapse, President Joe Biden said that the federal government would pay for the entire cost of reconstructing the bridge. On May 2, 2024, Maryland Department of Transportation officials said they plan to replace the bridge by autumn 2028 at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. The replacement bridge will be designed with redundant support structures to prevent a similar collapse. The project will also include the installation of new safety features, including advanced collision detection systems and improved emergency response plans.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThe Francis Scott Key Bridge was an important part of the Baltimore region's transportation infrastructure, providing a critical crossing of the Patapsco River. The bridge's collapse on March 26, 2024, highlighted the importance of investing in modern infrastructure and incorporating new technologies and safety features. The replacement bridge will be designed to meet modern safety standards and provide a safe and efficient crossing of the Patapsco River for decades to come.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Francis_Scott_Key_Bridge_(Baltimore)\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nBy the early 1960s, the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel (Interstate 895), the first crossing of Baltimore's Harbor, had reached its traffic capacity The Maryland State Roads Commission concluded there was a need for a second harbor crossing [11] They began planning another single-tube tunnel under the Patapsco River, downstream and to the southeast, between Hawkins Point and Sollers Point in the outer harbor In October 1968, this Outer Harbor Tunnel project received financing through a $220 million bond issue (equivalent to $1.9 billion in 2023) that also funded the twinning of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge [12] But when the bids to build the tunnel were opened in July 1970, they were substantially higher than expected [13] So officials drafted alternative proposals, including a four-lane bridge, which had the advantage of providing a route across Baltimore Harbor for vehicles carrying hazardous materials barred from tunnels [14]\n\n\nConstruction\nBy the early 1960s, the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel (Interstate 895), the first crossing of Baltimore's Harbor, had reached its traffic capacity The Maryland State Roads Commission concluded there was a need for a second harbor crossing [11] They began planning another single-tube tunnel under the Patapsco River, downstream and to the southeast, between Hawkins Point and Sollers Point in the outer harbor In October 1968, this Outer Harbor Tunnel project received financing through a $220 million bond issue (equivalent to $1.9 billion in 2023) that also funded the twinning of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge [12] But when the bids to build the tunnel were opened in July 1970, they were substantially higher than expected [13] So officials drafted alternative proposals, including a four-lane bridge, which had the advantage of providing a route across Baltimore Harbor for vehicles carrying hazardous materials barred from tunnels [14]\n\n\nOperation\nThe Key Bridge opened to traffic on March 23, 1977 [24] Including its connecting approaches, the bridge project was 1.6 miles (2.57 km) in length with 8.7 miles (14.00 km) of approach road [24] In 1978, the bridge received an Award of Merit from the American Institute of Steel Construction in the Long Span category [17] In 1980, a cargo ship collided with the Key Bridge, but the bridge was relatively undamaged [25]\n\n\nCollapse\nOn March 26, 2024, at 01:28 EDT (05:28 UTC), the main spans of the bridge collapsed after the Singapore-registered container ship MV Dali lost power [29] and collided with the southwest supporting pier of the main truss section [30] [31] The NTSB noted that the Key Bridge was built before the introduction of redundant support structures, which are widely used in modern bridges and would have prevented such a collapse [32]\n\n\nReplacement\nHours after the collapse, President Joe Biden said that the federal government would pay for the entire cost of reconstructing the bridge [46] On May 2, 2024, Maryland Department of Transportation officials said they plan to replace the bridge by autumn 2028 at an estimated cost of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion [7]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His tenure was marked by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, a brutal crackdown on Indian nationalists that left over 1,500 people dead. O'Dwyer's actions and policies have been widely criticized for their role in suppressing Indian independence movements and perpetuating colonial rule.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nMichael O'Dwyer was born on April 28, 1864, in Barronstown, County Tipperary, Ireland, to John and Margaret O'Dwyer. He was the sixth son in a family of 14 children. At the age of seven, he was sent to St. Stanislaus College in Rahan, County Offaly, where he was educated. In 1885, O'Dwyer traveled to India as an Indian Civil Service (ICS) officer, where he was posted to Shahpur in Punjab.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nO'Dwyer distinguished himself in land revenue settlement work in Punjab and was made director of land records and agriculture in 1896. He was later placed in charge of the settlements of Alwar and Bharatpur states. During World War I, O'Dwyer worked closely with military authorities to organize a centralized system for the recruitment of soldiers from rural areas of Punjab, offering land grants and formal titles in exchange for their service.\n\n**First World War Recruitment**\n\nThe recruitment drive was a significant success, with most of the recruits coming from rural areas of Punjab. However, this left a number of families without their breadwinners. Those who returned from the war aspired to a reward and a better life. The co-operation between the civil and military leaders and the leading rural Punjabis laid the foundations of a militarized bureaucracy in colonial Punjab.\n\n**Defence of India Act 1915**\n\nO'Dwyer played a significant role in persuading the British government to pass the 1915 Defence of India Act, which gave him considerable powers. The Act allowed special tribunals for revolutionary crimes to be tried without the possibility of appeal. O'Dwyer opposed the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, fearing that his efforts in recruiting troops would be destroyed by increasing powers to urban elites.\n\n**Surveillance in 1919**\n\nFrom mid-March 1919, O'Dwyer's orders led to the close surveillance of two Gandhian non-violent Indian nationalists, Saifuddin Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal. They were summoned to Deputy Commissioner Miles Irving's house, where they were arrested and secretly escorted to Dharamasala, a town at the foot of the Himalayas.\n\n**Amritsar Massacre**\n\nIt was during O'Dwyer's tenure as Lieutenant Governor of Punjab that the Jallianwala Bagh massacre occurred in Amritsar on April 13, 1919. A detachment of 50 British Indian Army soldiers under the command of Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer fired on a crowd, killing over 1,500 people. According to the civil surgeon, Dr. Smit, 1,526 people were killed. O'Dwyer was informed of the event at 3 am the following day and gave permission for General William Beynon to send a telegram to Dyer, stating \"your action correct and the lieutenant-governor approves.\"\n\n**O'Dwyer v. Nair**\n\nIn 1922, Sir Sankaran Nair referred to O'Dwyer in his book Gandhi and Anarchy, stating that \"before the reforms it was in the power of the Lieutenant-Governor, a single individual, to commit the atrocities in the Punjab which we know only too well.\" O'Dwyer successfully sued Nair for libel and was awarded £500 damages. The trial was one of the longest civil law hearings in legal history and provided justifications for Dyer's actions at the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\n\n**Assassination**\n\nOn March 13, 1940, O'Dwyer, aged 75, was shot dead at a joint meeting of the East India Association and the Central Asian Society in Caxton Hall, Westminster, London, by Indian revolutionary Udham Singh, in retaliation for the massacre in Amritsar.\n\n**Personal Life and Family**\n\nO'Dwyer married Una Eunice, daughter of Antoine Bord of Castres, France, on November 21, 1896. The couple had two children. Una Eunice established the 'Lady O'Dwyer's Punjab Comforts Fund,' a charitable organization created in India during World War I to raise money and gifts to provide comforts for troops serving with the Indian Army. She was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919, in which their daughter, Una Mary O'Dwyer, was created a Member of the Order of the British Empire.\n\n**Writing**\n\nIn his book India as I knew it (1925), O'Dwyer disclosed that his time as administrator in Punjab was preoccupied by the threat of terrorism and the spread of political agitation.\n\n**References**\n\nFor further reading, see:\n\n* Tan Tai Yong, _The Garrison State: Military, Government and Society in Colonial Punjab, 1849-1947_ (Sage Publications, 2005)\n* Ian Talbot, _Pakistan: A Modern History_ (Hurst & Company, 1998)\n* Ian Copland, _The Princes of India in the Endgame of Empire, 1917-1947_ (Cambridge University Press, 1997)\n\n**External Links**\n\n* British Library: _Michael O'Dwyer papers_\n* Wikipedia: _Jallianwala Bagh massacre_", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Michael_O'Dwyer\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nMichael Francis O'Dwyer was born on 28 April 1864 in Barronstown, Limerick Junction, County Tipperary, to John, a landowner of Barronstown, Solohead, and Margaret (née Quirke) O'Dwyer, of Toem, both in County Tipperary, Ireland [1] He was the sixth son in a family of fourteen children, [1] [2] At the age of seven, he was sent to be schooled at St Stanislaus College, Rahan, County Offaly [1]\n\n\nEarly career\nIn 1885, he travelled to India [6] as an ICS officer and was first posted to Shahpur in Punjab [7] He distinguished himself in land revenue settlement work and in 1896 was made director of land records and agriculture in Punjab Subsequently, he was placed in charge of the settlements of Alwar and Bharatpur states [1]\n\n\nFirst World War recruitment\nO'Dwyer worked closely with the military authorities and sought the aid of local rural Punjabi leaders to organise a centralised system for the recruitment of soldiers for the First World War effort in exchange for compensation, including major land grants and formal titles [9] [10] As a result, most of the recruits were drawn from rural areas of the Punjab, which ultimately left a number of families without their breadwinners Those who returned from the war aspired to a reward and a better life [2] The co-operation between the civil and military leaders and the leading rural Punjabis, as later described by the historian Tan Tai Yong, laid \"the foundations of a militarized bureaucracy in colonial Punjab\" [9] [10]\n\n\nDefence of India Act 1915\nHe played a significant role in persuading the British government in India to pass the 1915 Defence of India Act, [1] which gave him considerable powers Passed on 18 March 1915, the Act allowed special tribunals for revolutionary crimes to take place without possibilities for appeal [12] He opposed the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms for fear that his efforts in recruitment through the rural leaders would be destroyed by increasing powers to “urban elites” [13]\n\n\nSurveillance in 1919\nFrom mid-March 1919, under O’Dwyer's orders, the CID in Amritsar kept a close surveillance of two Gandhian non-violent Indian nationalists; the Muslim barrister Saifuddin Kitchlew and the Hindu physician Dr Satyapal O'Dwyer subsequently summoned both to Deputy Commissioner Miles Irving's house in the Civil Lines on 10 April 1919 from where they were arrested and secretly escorted to Dharamasala, at the foot of the Himalayas, to be kept under house arrest [14] [15] [16] As the news of the arrest became widespread, supporters began to gather near Irving's home, and what initially began as a peaceful attempt to make enquiries ended up in a violent clash [17] [18] On 13 April 1919, a meeting was called to take place at Jallianwala Bagh to protest the arrest [16]\n\n\nAmritsar massacre\nIt was during O'Dwyer's tenure as Lieutenant Governor of Punjab that the Jallianwala Bagh massacre occurred in Amritsar on 13 April 1919, three days after the onset of the riots [15] [19] A detachment of 50 British Indian Army soldiers under the command of Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer fired on a crowd in Amritsar, killing more than 1,500 people [20] According to then civil surgeon Dr Smit 1,526 people [21] had been killed O'Dwyer was informed of the event at 3 am the following day [22] When he received Dyer's initial report, O'Dwyer gave permission to General William Beynon to send a telegram to Dyer that stated \"your action correct and the lieutenant-governor approves\" [6] [23]\n\n\nO'Dwyer v.

He has also been praised for his attendance record, having the second-highest attendance rate among the West Midlands' 57 MPs.\n\nPincher's time as an MP has been marked by a number of significant events and controversies. In 2017, he was accused of sexual assault by former Olympic rower and Conservative candidate Alex Story. Pincher denied the allegations, but was subsequently suspended from the Conservative Party and referred to the police.\n\n**Sexual Misconduct Allegations**\n\nThe allegations against Pincher were made in November 2017, when Story alleged that Pincher had made unwanted advances towards him in 2001. Story claimed that Pincher had invited him to his flat, where he had massaged his neck and talked about his \"future in the Conservative Party\". Story described the encounter as feeling like being \"touched up\" by a \"pound shop Harvey Weinstein\".\n\nPincher denied the allegations, stating that he did not recognize the events or the interpretation placed on them. However, he did apologize to Story if he had ever felt offended by anything he had said.\n\nThe allegations against Pincher were the subject of a number of investigations and controversies. In December 2017, the Conservative Party's investigating panel determined that Pincher had not breached the code of conduct. However, the incident had a significant impact on Pincher's career and reputation, and he was subsequently stripped of his role as Comptroller of the Household.\n\n**Honours**\n\nIn 2018, Pincher was sworn as a member of the Privy Council at Buckingham Palace. This entitled him to the honorific prefix \"The Right Honourable\" for life. Pincher's appointment to the Privy Council was seen as a significant honor, and marked a major milestone in his career.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nPincher is openly LGBT+, and has been an advocate for LGBT+ rights throughout his career. He has spoken publicly about the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion within the Conservative Party and beyond.\n\nPincher's personal life has been the subject of some controversy, with some critics accusing him of being out of touch with the concerns and experiences of LGBT+ individuals. However, Pincher has maintained that he is committed to promoting LGBT+ rights and advocating for the needs and interests of LGBT+ people.\n\nIn conclusion, Chris Pincher is a complex and multifaceted individual with a long and varied career in politics. From his early days as a young Conservative to his current role as a Member of Parliament, Pincher has been a significant figure in British politics. While his personal life and career have been marked by controversy and scandal, Pincher remains a prominent and influential figure in the Conservative Party and beyond.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chris_Pincher\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nPincher was born in Walsall, [10] and grew up in Wombourne, Staffordshire He has been a member of the Conservative Party since 1987, [11] having been politicised by the 1984–85 miners' strike [12] He was deputy director of the Conservative Collegiate Forum, followed by chairman of Islington North Constituency Association, the constituency represented by Jeremy Corbyn since 1983 [12] He was tipped as a future cabinet member ahead of the 1997 general election, [12] in which he ran for Parliament for the newly created safe Labour seat of Warley, in Sandwell; [11] he came second, with 24% of the vote [13]\n\n\nMember of Parliament\nPincher was re-selected to contest Tamworth for the 2010 election, gaining the seat on a 9.5% swing, taking him to 45.8% of the vote and a majority of 6,090 or 13.1%, over Brian Jenkins [4]  Pincher made his Maiden Speech in the Commons in June 2010 [18] In his first 10 months as an MP, Pincher had the second-highest House of Commons attendance rate of the West Midlands' 57 MPs, after James Morris [19] In his first year, he spoke in 94 debates; top amongst Staffordshire's 11 MPs [20]\n\n\nSexual misconduct allegations\nOn 5 November 2017, Pincher resigned as Comptroller of the Household (Assistant Whip) and voluntarily referred himself to the Conservative Party's complaints procedure and the police, as part of the 2017 Westminster sexual misconduct allegations He was accused of sexual assault by former Olympic rower and Conservative candidate Alex Story [38]\nIn 2017, Story alleged that he had been the subject of unwanted sexual advances from Pincher in 2001, when the MP invited Story to his flat, where Pincher massaged his neck and talked about his \"future in the Conservative Party\", before changing into a bathrobe Recounting the episode, Story said that Pincher's advances had made him seem like a \"pound shop Harvey Weinstein\" [a] [39] Pincher said that \"I do not recognise either the events or the interpretation placed on them\" and that \"if Mr Story has ever felt offended by anything I said then I can only apologise to him\" [39] Pincher was also accused of \"touching up\" former Labour MP Tom Blenkinsop, who told him to \"fuck off\" [38] On 23 December 2017, the Conservative Party's investigating panel determined that Pincher had not breached the code of conduct [40]\n\n\nHonours\nHe was sworn as a member of the Privy Council at Buckingham Palace on 12 December 2018, entitling him to the honorific prefix \"The Right Honourable\" for life [53] [54]\n\n\nPersonal life\nPincher is LGBT+ [55] [better source needed]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

American [3]: 76–9  After a marriage of less than four years, Falco left her for another woman [3]: 76  Berkowitz's biological father, Joseph Kleinman, was a married businessman who, like Berkowitz's mother, was Jewish [4] [5]\n\n\nBeginning of crimes (late 1975 to early 1977)\nDuring the mid-1970s, Berkowitz began committing violent crimes He bungled his first attempt at murder using a knife, then switched to a handgun and began a lengthy crime spree throughout the New York boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, seeking young female victims All but one of the crime scenes involved two victims; he infamously committed some of his attacks while the women sat with boyfriends in parked cars [29] Berkowitz exhibited an enduring enjoyment of his activities, often returning to the scenes of his crimes [29]\n\n\nForman stabbing (December 1975)\nBerkowitz claimed when he was 22, he committed his first attack on Christmas Eve 1975, when he used a hunting knife to stab two women in Co-op City [19] [30] The first alleged victim, a Hispanic woman, was never identified by police The second was 15-year-old Michelle Forman, a sophomore at Truman High School, whom he stabbed six times on a bridge near Dreiser Loop and whose injuries were serious enough for her to be hospitalized for a week [19] [31] [32] [33] [34] Berkowitz was not suspected of these crimes, and soon afterward he relocated to an apartment in Yonkers [34] [35] [27]\n\n\nLauria and Valenti shooting (July 1976)\nThe first shooting attributed to Berkowitz occurred in the Pelham Bay neighborhood of the Bronx At about 1:10 a.m on July 29, 1976, Donna Lauria (18), an emergency medical technician, and her friend Jody Valenti (19), a nurse, were sitting in Valenti's double-parked Oldsmobile discussing their evening at Peachtree's, a New Rochelle discotheque [36] [37] Lauria opened the car door to leave and noticed a man quickly approaching Startled and angered by the man's sudden appearance, she said, \"Now what is this...\" [37] The man produced a gun from the paper bag he carried and crouched Bracing one elbow on his knee, he aimed his weapon with both hands and fired [37] Lauria was struck by one bullet that killed her instantly [38] Valenti was shot in her thigh, and a third bullet missed both women The shooter turned and walked away quickly [37]\n\n\nDenaro and Keenan shooting (October 1976)\nOn October 23, 1976, a similar shooting occurred in a secluded residential area of Flushing, Queens, next to Bowne Park Carl Denaro (20), a Citibank security guard, and Rosemary Keenan (18), a Queens College student, were sitting in Keenan's parked car when the windows suddenly shattered [39] [36] \"I felt the car exploded,\" Denaro said later [40] Keenan quickly started the car and sped away for help The panicked couple did not realize someone had been shooting at them, even though Denaro was bleeding from a bullet wound to his head Keenan had only superficial injuries from the broken glass, but Denaro eventually needed a metal plate to replace a portion of his skull Neither victim saw the attacker [41]\n\n\nDeMasi and Lomino shooting (November 1976)\nHigh school students Donna DeMasi (16) and Joanne Lomino (18) had walked home from a movie shortly after midnight on November 27, 1976 [44] [36] They were chatting on the porch of Lomino's home in Floral Park when a young man dressed in military fatigues approached them and began to ask directions [45]\n\n\nFreund and Diel shooting (January 1977)\nAt about 12:40 a.m on January 30, 1977, secretary Christine Freund (26) and her fiancé, bartender John Diel (30), were sitting in Diel's car near the Forest Hills LIRR station in Queens, preparing to drive to a dance hall after having seen the movie Rocky [47] Three gunshots penetrated the car In a panic, Diel drove away for help He sustained minor superficial injuries, but Freund was shot twice and died several hours later at the hospital Neither victim had seen their attacker.\n\n\nVoskerichian shooting (March 8, 1977)\nAt about 7:30 p.m on March 8, 1977, Columbia University student Virginia Voskerichian (20) was walking home from school when she was confronted by an armed man She lived about a block from where Freund had been shot [51] In a desperate move to defend herself, Voskerichian lifted her textbooks between herself and her killer, but the makeshift shield was penetrated The bullet struck her head and ultimately killed her [52]\n\n\nPress and publicity (March 10, 1977)\nIn a March 10, 1977, press conference, NYPD officials and Mayor Abraham Beame declared the same .44 Bulldog revolver had fired the shots that killed Lauria and Voskerichian [53] Official documents were later brought to the public eye, revealing that while police strongly suspected the same .44 Bulldog had been used in the shootings, the evidence was actually inconclusive [53]\n\n\nCrimes continue (April to July 1977)\nAt about 3:00 a.m on April 17, 1977, Alexander Esau (20), a tow truck operator, and Valentina Suriani (18), a Lehman College student and an aspiring actress and model, were sitting in a car belonging to Esau's brother on the Hutchinson River Parkway service road in the Bronx, about a block from Suriani's home and only a few blocks away from the scene of the Lauria–Valenti shooting A resident of a nearby building heard four shots and called the police Suriani, who was sitting in the driver's seat, was shot once and Esau twice, both in the head [55] [56] Suriani died at the scene, and Esau died in the hospital several hours later without being able to describe his attacker(s) Police said the weapon used for the crime was the same as the one which they had suspected in the earlier shootings [55] In 1993,  Berkowitz confirmed he was the shooter.\n\n\nEsau and Suriani shooting (April)\nAt about 3:00 a.m on April 17, 1977, Alexander Esau (20), a tow truck operator, and Valentina Suriani (18), a Lehman College student and an

as the one which they had suspected in the earlier shootings [55] In 1993,  Berkowitz confirmed he was the shooter.\n\n\nCrime-scene letters (May)\nPolice discovered a handwritten letter near the bodies of Esau and Suriani, written mostly in block capitals with a few lower-case letters, and addressed to NYPD Captain Joseph Borrelli [57] With this letter, Berkowitz identified himself as \"Son of Sam\" for the first time [57] The press had previously dubbed the killer \"the .44 Caliber Killer\" because of his weapon of choice [58] The letter was initially withheld from the public, but some of its contents were revealed to the press and the name \"Son of Sam\" quickly replaced the old name [58]\n\n\nSon of Sam letter\nPolice discovered a handwritten letter near the bodies of Esau and

first time [57] The press had previously dubbed the killer \"the .44 Caliber Killer\" because of his weapon of choice [58] The letter was initially withheld from the public, but some of its contents were revealed to the press and the name \"Son of Sam\" quickly replaced the old name [58]\n\n\nLetter to Jimmy Breslin\nOn May 30, 1977, Daily News columnist Jimmy Breslin received a handwritten letter from someone who claimed to be the .44 Caliber Killer The letter was postmarked early that same day in Englewood, New Jersey On the reverse of the envelope, neatly hand-printed in four precisely centered lines, were the words: Blood and Family – Darkness and Death – Absolute Depravity – .44 The letter inside read:\n\n\nLupo and Placido shooting (June)\nOn June 26, 1977, Salvatore Lupo (20), a mechanic's helper, and Judy Placido (17), a recent high school graduate, had left the Elephas discotheque in Bayside, Queens, and were sitting in Lupo's parked car at about 3:00 a.m when three gunshots blasted through the vehicle [71] [72] [73] Lupo was wounded in the right forearm, while Placido was shot in the right temple, shoulder, and back of the neck; both victims survived their injuries [74] Lupo told police they had been discussing the Son of Sam case only moments before the shooting [74] [75] Neither Lupo nor Placido had seen their attacker, but two witnesses reported a tall, dark-haired man in a leisure suit fleeing from the area; one claimed to see him leave in a car and even supplied a partial license plate number [74]\n\n\nMoskowitz and Violante shooting (July)\nWith the first anniversary of the initial .44 caliber shootings approaching, police established a sizable dragnet that emphasized past hunting grounds in Queens and the Bronx However, the next and final .44 shooting occurred in Brooklyn [76]\n\n\nSuspicion and capture (August 1977)\nLocal resident Cacilia Davis was walking her dog at the scene of the Moskowitz-Violante shooting when she saw patrol officer Michael Cataneo ticketing a car parked near a fire hydrant Moments after the traffic police had left, a young man walked past her from the area of the car and seemed to study her with some interest Davis felt concerned because he was holding some kind of \"dark object\" in his hand She ran to her home only to hear shots fired behind her in the street Davis remained silent about this experience for four days until she finally contacted police, who closely checked every car that had been ticketed in the area that night [3]: 5–6  Berkowitz's yellow 1970 Ford Galaxie was among the cars they investigated [3]: 6 \n\n\nSuspicion (August 9)\nLocal resident Cacilia Davis was walking her dog at the scene of the Moskowitz-Violante shooting when she saw patrol officer Michael Cataneo ticketing a car parked near a fire hydrant Moments after the traffic police had left, a young man walked past her from the area of the car and seemed to study her with some interest Davis felt concerned because he was holding some kind of \"dark object\" in his hand She ran to her home only to hear shots fired behind her in the street Davis remained silent about this experience for four days until she finally contacted police, who closely checked every car that had been ticketed in the area that night [3]: 5–6  Berkowitz's yellow 1970 Ford Galaxie was among the cars they investigated [3]: 6 \n\n\nArrest (August 10)\nThe following day, on August 10, 1977, police investigated Berkowitz's car, which was parked outside his apartment building at 35 Pine Street, Yonkers They saw a gun in the back seat, searched the car, and found a duffel bag filled with ammunition, maps of the crime scenes, and a threatening letter addressed to Inspector Timothy Dowd of the Son of Sam task force Police decided to wait for Berkowitz to leave the apartment rather than risk a violent confrontation in the building's narrow hallway; they also waited to obtain a search warrant for the apartment, worried their search might be challenged in court The initial search of the vehicle was based on the handgun visible in the back seat, although possession of such a gun was legal in New York State and required no special permit The warrant still had not arrived when Berkowitz exited the apartment building at about 10:00 p.m and entered his car Detective John Falotico approached the driver's side of the car and pointed his gun close to Berkowitz's temple, while Detective Sgt William Gardella pointed his gun from the passenger's side [79]\n\n\nConfession (August 11)\nBerkowitz was interrogated for about thirty minutes in the early morning of August 11, 1977 He quickly confessed to the shootings and expressed an interest in pleading guilty The investigation was led by John Keenan, who took the confession [90] During questioning, Berkowitz claimed his neighbor's dog was one of the reasons he killed, stating the dog demanded the blood of pretty young girls He said the \"Sam\" mentioned in the first letter was his former neighbor Sam Carr, and that Harvey, Carr's black Labrador, was possessed by an ancient demon which issued irresistible commands that Berkowitz kill people [29]\n\n\nSentencing and prison\nThree separate mental health examinations determined Berkowitz was competent to stand trial [96] Despite this, defense lawyers advised Berkowitz to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, but he refused [97] Berkowitz appeared calm in court on May 8, 1978, as he pleaded guilty to all of the shootings [98] At his sentencing two weeks later, Berkowitz caused an uproar when he attempted to jump out of a window of the seventh-floor courtroom After he was restrained, he repeatedly chanted, \"Stacy  [his last victim] was a whore\" and shouted, \"I'd kill her again! I'd kill them all again!\" [97] The court ordered another psychiatric examination before sentencing could proceed During the evaluation, Berkowitz drew a sketch of a jailed man surrounded by numerous walls; at the bottom he wrote, \"I am not well Not well at all\" [29] Nonetheless, Berkowitz was again found competent to stand trial [97]\n\n\nSentencing\nThree separate mental health examinations determined Berkowitz was competent to stand trial [96] Despite this, defense lawyers advised Berkowitz to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, but he refused [97] Berkowitz appeared calm in court on May 8, 1978, as he pleaded guilty to all of the shootings [98] At his sentencing two weeks later, Berkowitz caused an uproar when he attempted to jump out of a window of the seventh-floor courtroom After he was restrained, he repeatedly chanted, \"Stacy  [his last victim] was a whore\" and shouted, \"I'd kill her again!

walls; at the bottom he wrote, \"I am not well Not well at all\" [29] Nonetheless, Berkowitz was again found competent to stand trial [97]\n\n\nDetention\nAfter his arrest, Berkowitz was initially confined to a psychiatric ward in Kings County Hospital, where the staff reported he seemed remarkably troubled by his new environment [101]\n\n\nEvangelical faith\nIn 1987, Berkowitz became an evangelical Christian in prison According to his personal testimony, his moment of conversion occurred after reading Psalm 34:6 from a Bible given to him by a fellow inmate He says he is no longer to be referred to as the \"Son of Sam\" but the \"Son of Hope.\" [102]\n\n\nParole hearings\nBerkowitz is entitled to a parole hearing every two years as mandated by state law, though he has consistently refused to ask for his release, sometimes skipping the hearings altogether [108] [109] [110] Before his first parole hearing in 2002, Berkowitz sent a letter to New York Governor George Pataki requesting that it be canceled He wrote, \"In all honesty, I believe that I deserve to be in prison for the rest of my life I have, with God's help, long ago come to terms with my situation and I have accepted my punishment.\" [111] [112] Officials at the Sullivan facility rejected his request [111]\n\n\nOther activities\nIn 2002, during the D.C sniper attacks, Berkowitz wrote a letter telling the sniper to \"stop hurting innocent people.\" He made his comments in a three-page letter to Fox News personality Rita Cosby after she wrote to him seeking his comment on the sniper attacks [115] During June 2005, Berkowitz sued one of his previous lawyers for the misappropriation of a large number of letters, photographs, and other personal possessions [116] Hugo Harmatz, a New Jersey attorney, had represented Berkowitz in an earlier legal effort to prevent the National Enquirer from buying one of his letters [116] Harmatz then self-published his own collection of letters and memorabilia—Dear David (2005)—which he had obtained from Berkowitz during their consultations [116] Berkowitz stated that he would drop the lawsuit only if the attorney signed over all the money he made to the victims' families In October 2006, Berkowitz and Harmatz settled out of court, with Harmatz agreeing to return the disputed items and to donate part of his book profits to the New York State Crime Victims Board [117]\n\n\nSatanic cult accomplice claims\nIn 1979, Berkowitz mailed a book about witchcraft to police in North Dakota He had underlined several passages and written a few marginal notes, including the phrase: \"Arliss   [sic] Perry, Hunted, Stalked and Slain Followed to Calif Stanford University.\" [118] The reference was to Arlis Perry, a 19-year-old North Dakota newlywed who had been murdered at Stanford on October 12, 1974 Her death, and the notorious abuse of her corpse in a chapel on campus, was a widely reported case Berkowitz mentioned the Perry attack in other letters, suggesting that he knew details of it from the perpetrator himself Local police investigators interviewed him but by 2004 had concluded he had \"nothing of value to offer.\" [119] The Perry case was solved in 2018 [120]\n\n\nMedia re-examination\nJournalist John Hockenberry asserted that, even apart from the Satanic cult claims, many officials doubted the single-shooter theory, writing: \n\n\nSkeptics\nBerkowitz's later claims about having been in a Satanic cult were widely dismissed Breslin rejected his story of Satanic cult accomplices, stating that \"when they talked to David Berkowitz that night, he recalled everything step by step by step The guy has 1,000 percent recall and that's it He's the guy and there's nothing else to look at.\" [40] Other skeptics included former FBI profiler John Edward Douglas, who spent hours interviewing Berkowitz and concluded he was an \"introverted loner, not capable of being involved in group activity.\" [40] NYPD psychologist Dr Harvey Schlossberg stated in Against The Law, a documentary about the Son of Sam case, that he believes that the Satanic cult claims are nothing but a fantasy concocted by Berkowitz to absolve himself of guilt In his book Hunting Humans (2001), Elliott Leyton argued that \"recent journalistic attempts to abridge—or even deny—Berkowitz's guilt have lacked all credibility.\" [135]\n\n\nLegacy\nDecades after his arrest, the name \"Son of Sam\" remains widely recognized as that of a notorious serial killer, with popular culture manifestations perpetuating this [136] Berkowitz himself continues to express remorse on Christian websites [137] and on more mainstream news, including speaking out against gun violence and instead spreading the message to \"take the glory out of guns\" [138]\n\n\nLegal effects\nAfter rampant speculation about publishers offering Berkowitz large sums of money for his story, the New York State Legislature swiftly passed a new law that prevented convicted criminals (and their relatives) from making any financial profit from books, movies, or other enterprises related to the stories of their crimes The United States Supreme Court struck down the so-called \"Son of Sam law\" for violating the First Amendment's right of free expression in the 1991 case of Simon & Schuster, Inc v Crime Victims Board, but New York produced a constitutionally revised version of the law in the following year [140] [141] Similar laws have since been enacted in 41 states and at the federal level [140]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nBreslin, in collaboration with writer Dick Schaap, published a novelized account of the murders, .44 (1978), less than a year after Berkowitz's arrest [142] The highly fictionalized plot recounts the exploits of a Berkowitz-based character dubbed \"Bernard Rosenfeld.\" Outside of North America, the book was renamed Son of Sam [143]\n\n\nLiterature\nBreslin, in collaboration with writer Dick Schaap, published

Rosenfeld.\" Outside of North America, the book was renamed Son of Sam [143]\n\n\nTV and film\nThe Spike Lee drama Summer of Sam was released in 1999, with actor Michael Badalucco in the role of Berkowitz [145] The film depicts the tensions that develop in a Bronx neighborhood during the shootings, and Berkowitz's part is largely symbolic A minor character in the script, he functions \"mostly as a berserk metaphor for Lee's view of the seventies as a period of amoral excess.\" [146] Berkowitz was reported to be disturbed by what he called exploitation of \"the ugliness of the past\" in Lee's film [136]\n\n\nMusic\nSon of Sam has been mistakenly associated with the contemporaneous song \"Psycho Killer\" (1977) by Talking Heads [149] Likewise, Elliott Smith stated that his song \"Son of Sam\" is not literally about Berkowitz, a claim some have found hard to believe due to the song's lyrics [153] Compositions more directly inspired by the events include:\n\n\nSee

evening at Peachtree's, a New Rochelle discotheque [36] [37] Lauria opened the car door to leave and noticed a man quickly approaching Startled and angered by the man's sudden appearance, she said, \"Now what is this...\" [37] The man produced a gun from the paper bag he carried and crouched Bracing one elbow on his knee, he aimed his weapon with both hands and fired [37] Lauria was struck by one bullet that killed her instantly [38] Valenti was shot in her thigh, and a third bullet missed both women The shooter turned and walked away quickly [37]\n\n\nDenaro and Keenan shooting (October 1976)\nOn October 23, 1976, a similar shooting occurred in a secluded residential area of Flushing, Queens, next to Bowne Park Carl Denaro (20), a Citibank security guard, and Rosemary Keenan (18), a Queens College student, were sitting in Keenan's parked car when the windows suddenly shattered [39] [36] \"I felt the car exploded,\" Denaro said later [40] Keenan quickly started the car and sped away for help The panicked couple did not realize someone had been shooting at them, even though Denaro was bleeding from a bullet wound to his head Keenan had only superficial injuries from the broken glass, but Denaro eventually needed a metal plate to replace a portion of his skull Neither victim saw the attacker [41]\n\n\nDeMasi and Lomino shooting (November 1976)\nHigh school students Donna DeMasi (16) and Joanne Lomino (18) had walked home from a movie shortly after midnight on November 27, 1976 [44] [36] They were chatting on the porch of Lomino's home in Floral Park when a young man dressed in military fatigues approached them and began to ask directions [45]\n\n\nFreund and Diel shooting (January 1977)\nAt about 12:40 a.m on January 30, 1977, secretary Christine Freund (26) and her fiancé, bartender John Diel (30), were sitting in Diel's car near the Forest Hills LIRR station in Queens, preparing to drive to a dance hall after having seen the movie Rocky [47] Three gunshots penetrated the car In a panic, Diel drove away for help He sustained minor superficial injuries, but Freund was shot twice and died several hours later at the hospital Neither victim had seen their attacker.\n\n\nVoskerichian shooting (March 8, 1977)\nAt about 7:30 p.m on March 8, 1977, Columbia University student Virginia Voskerichian (20) was walking home from school when she was confronted by an armed man She lived about a block from where Freund had been shot [51] In a desperate move to defend herself, Voskerichian lifted her textbooks between herself and her killer, but the makeshift shield was penetrated The bullet struck her head and ultimately killed her [52]\n\n\nPress and publicity (March 10, 1977)\nIn a March 10, 1977, press conference, NYPD officials and Mayor Abraham Beame declared the same .44 Bulldog revolver had fired the shots that killed Lauria and Voskerichian [53] Official documents were later brought to the public eye, revealing that while police strongly suspected the same .44 Bulldog had been used in the shootings, the evidence was actually inconclusive [53]\n\n\nCrimes continue (April to July 1977)\nAt about 3:00 a.m on April 17, 1977, Alexander Esau (20), a tow truck operator, and Valentina Suriani (18), a Lehman College student and an aspiring actress and model, were sitting in a car belonging to Esau's brother on the Hutchinson River Parkway service road in the Bronx, about a block from Suriani's home and only a few blocks away from the scene of the Lauria–Valenti shooting A resident of a nearby building heard four shots and called the police Suriani, who was sitting in the driver's seat, was shot once and Esau twice, both in the head [55] [56] Suriani died at the scene, and Esau died in the hospital several hours later without being able to describe his attacker(s) Police said the weapon used for the crime was the same as the one which they had suspected in the earlier shootings [55] In 1993,  Berkowitz confirmed he was the shooter.\n\n\nEsau and Suriani shooting (April)\nAt about 3:00 a.m on April 17, 1977, Alexander Esau (20), a tow truck operator, and Valentina Suriani (18), a Lehman College student and an aspiring actress and model, were sitting in a car belonging to Esau's brother on the Hutchinson River Parkway service road in the Bronx, about a block from Suriani's home and only a few blocks away

as the one which they had suspected in the earlier shootings [55] In 1993,  Berkowitz confirmed he was the shooter.\n\n\nCrime-scene letters (May)\nPolice discovered a handwritten letter near the bodies of Esau and Suriani, written mostly in block capitals with a few lower-case letters, and addressed to NYPD Captain Joseph Borrelli [57] With this letter, Berkowitz identified himself as \"Son of Sam\" for the first time [57] The press had previously dubbed the killer \"the .44 Caliber Killer\" because of his weapon of choice [58] The letter was initially withheld from the public, but some of its contents were revealed to the press and the name \"Son of Sam\" quickly replaced the old name [58]\n\n\nSon of Sam letter\nPolice discovered a handwritten letter near the bodies of Esau and

letter from someone who claimed to be the .44 Caliber Killer The letter was postmarked early that same day in Englewood, New Jersey On the reverse of the envelope, neatly hand-printed in four precisely centered lines, were the words: Blood and Family – Darkness and Death – Absolute Depravity – .44 The letter inside read:\n\n\nLupo and Placido shooting (June)\nOn June 26, 1977, Salvatore Lupo (20), a mechanic's helper, and Judy Placido (17), a recent high school graduate, had left the Elephas discotheque in Bayside, Queens, and were sitting in Lupo's parked car at about 3:00 a.m when three gunshots blasted through the vehicle [71] [72] [73] Lupo was wounded in the right forearm, while Placido was shot in the right temple, shoulder, and back of the neck; both victims survived their injuries [74] Lupo told police they had been discussing the Son of Sam case only moments before the shooting [74] [75] Neither Lupo nor Placido had seen their attacker, but two witnesses reported a tall, dark-haired man in a leisure suit fleeing from the area; one claimed to see him leave in a car and even supplied a partial license plate number [74]\n\n\nMoskowitz and Violante shooting (July)\nWith the first anniversary of the initial .44 caliber shootings approaching, police established a sizable dragnet that emphasized past hunting grounds in Queens and the Bronx However, the next and final .44 shooting occurred in Brooklyn [76]\n\n\nSuspicion and capture (August 1977)\nLocal resident Cacilia Davis was walking her dog at the scene of the Moskowitz-Violante shooting when she saw patrol officer Michael Cataneo ticketing a car parked near a fire hydrant Moments after the traffic police had left, a young man walked past her from the area of the car and seemed to study her with some interest Davis felt concerned because he was holding some kind of \"dark object\" in his hand She ran to her home only to hear shots fired behind her in the street Davis remained silent about this experience for four days until she finally contacted police, who closely checked every car that had been ticketed in the area that night [3]: 5–6  Berkowitz's yellow 1970 Ford Galaxie was among the cars they investigated [3]: 6 \n\n\nSuspicion (August 9)\nLocal resident Cacilia Davis was walking her dog at the scene of the Moskowitz-Violante shooting when she saw patrol officer Michael Cataneo ticketing a car parked near a fire hydrant Moments after the traffic police had left, a young man walked past her from the area of the car and seemed to study her with some interest Davis felt concerned because he was holding some kind of \"dark object\" in his hand She ran to her home only to hear shots fired behind her in the street Davis remained silent about this experience for four days until she finally contacted police, who closely checked every car that had been ticketed in the area that night [3]: 5–6  Berkowitz's yellow 1970 Ford Galaxie was among the cars they investigated [3]: 6 \n\n\nArrest (August 10)\nThe following day, on August 10, 1977, police investigated Berkowitz's car, which was parked outside his apartment building at 35 Pine Street, Yonkers They saw a gun in the back seat, searched the car, and found a duffel bag filled with ammunition, maps of the crime scenes, and a threatening letter addressed to Inspector Timothy Dowd of the Son of Sam task force Police decided to wait for Berkowitz to leave the apartment rather than risk a violent confrontation in the building's narrow hallway; they also waited to obtain a search warrant for the apartment, worried their search might be challenged in court The initial search of the vehicle was based on the handgun visible in the back seat, although possession of such a gun was legal in New York State and required no special permit The warrant still had not arrived when Berkowitz exited the apartment building at about 10:00 p.m and entered his car Detective John Falotico approached the driver's side of the car and pointed his gun close to Berkowitz's temple, while Detective Sgt William Gardella pointed his gun from the passenger's side [79]\n\n\nConfession (August 11)\nBerkowitz was interrogated for about thirty minutes in the early morning of August 11, 1977 He quickly confessed to the shootings and expressed an interest in pleading guilty The investigation was led by John Keenan, who took the confession [90] During questioning, Berkowitz claimed his neighbor's dog was one of the reasons he killed, stating the dog demanded the blood of pretty young girls He said the \"Sam\" mentioned in the first letter was his former neighbor Sam Carr, and that Harvey, Carr's black Labrador, was possessed by an ancient demon which issued irresistible commands that Berkowitz kill people [29]\n\n\nSentencing and prison\nThree separate mental health examinations determined Berkowitz was competent to stand trial [96] Despite this, defense lawyers advised Berkowitz to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, but he refused [97] Berkowitz appeared calm in court on May 8, 1978, as he pleaded guilty to all of the shootings [98] At his sentencing two weeks later, Berkowitz caused an uproar when he attempted to jump out of a window of the seventh-floor courtroom After he was restrained, he repeatedly chanted, \"Stacy  [his last victim] was a whore\" and shouted, \"I'd kill her again! I'd kill them all again!\" [97] The court ordered another psychiatric examination before sentencing could proceed During the evaluation, Berkowitz drew a sketch of a jailed man surrounded by numerous walls; at the bottom he wrote, \"I am not well Not well at all\" [29] Nonetheless, Berkowitz was again found competent to stand trial [97]\n\n\nSentencing\nThree separate mental health examinations determined Berkowitz was competent to stand trial [96] Despite this, defense lawyers advised Berkowitz to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, but he refused [97] Berkowitz appeared calm in court on May 8, 1978, as he pleaded guilty to all of the shootings [98] At his sentencing two weeks later, Berkowitz caused an uproar when he attempted to jump out of a window of the seventh-floor courtroom After he was restrained, he repeatedly chanted, \"Stacy  [his last victim] was a whore\" and shouted, \"I'd kill her again!

walls; at the bottom he wrote, \"I am not well Not well at all\" [29] Nonetheless, Berkowitz was again found competent to stand trial [97]\n\n\nDetention\nAfter his arrest, Berkowitz was initially confined to a psychiatric ward in Kings County Hospital, where the staff reported he seemed remarkably troubled by his new environment [101]\n\n\nEvangelical faith\nIn 1987, Berkowitz became an evangelical Christian in prison According to his personal testimony, his moment of conversion occurred after reading Psalm 34:6 from a Bible given to him by a fellow inmate He says he is no longer to be referred to as the \"Son of Sam\" but the \"Son of Hope.\" [102]\n\n\nParole hearings\nBerkowitz is entitled to a parole hearing every two years as mandated by state law, though he has consistently refused to ask for his release, sometimes skipping the hearings altogether [108] [109] [110] Before his first parole hearing in 2002, Berkowitz sent a letter to New York Governor George Pataki requesting that it be canceled He wrote, \"In all honesty, I believe that I deserve to be in prison for the rest of my life I have, with God's help, long ago come to terms with my situation and I have accepted my punishment.\" [111] [112] Officials at the Sullivan facility rejected his request [111]\n\n\nOther activities\nIn 2002, during the D.C sniper attacks, Berkowitz wrote a letter telling the sniper to \"stop hurting innocent people.\" He made his comments in a three-page letter to Fox News personality Rita Cosby after she wrote to him seeking his comment on the sniper attacks [115] During June 2005, Berkowitz sued one of his previous lawyers for the misappropriation of a large number of letters, photographs, and other personal possessions [116] Hugo Harmatz, a New Jersey attorney, had represented Berkowitz in an earlier legal effort to prevent the National Enquirer from buying one of his letters [116] Harmatz then self-published his own collection of letters and memorabilia—Dear David (2005)—which he had obtained from Berkowitz during their consultations [116] Berkowitz stated that he would drop the lawsuit only if the attorney signed over all the money he made to the victims' families In October 2006, Berkowitz and Harmatz settled out of court, with Harmatz agreeing to return the disputed items and to donate part of his book profits to the New York State Crime Victims Board [117]\n\n\nSatanic cult accomplice claims\nIn 1979, Berkowitz mailed a book about witchcraft to police in North Dakota He had underlined several passages and written a few marginal notes, including the phrase: \"Arliss   [sic] Perry, Hunted, Stalked and Slain Followed to Calif Stanford University.\" [118] The reference was to Arlis Perry, a 19-year-old North Dakota newlywed who had been murdered at Stanford on October 12, 1974 Her death, and the notorious abuse of her corpse in a chapel on campus, was a widely reported case Berkowitz mentioned the Perry attack in other letters, suggesting that he knew details of it from the perpetrator himself Local police investigators interviewed him but by 2004 had concluded he had \"nothing of value to offer.\" [119] The Perry case was solved in 2018 [120]\n\n\nMedia re-examination\nJournalist John Hockenberry asserted that, even apart from the Satanic cult claims, many officials doubted the single-shooter theory, writing: \n\n\nSkeptics\nBerkowitz's later claims about having been in a Satanic cult were widely dismissed Breslin rejected his story of Satanic cult accomplices, stating that \"when they talked to David Berkowitz that night, he recalled everything step by step by step The guy has 1,000 percent recall and that's it He's the guy and there's nothing else to look at.\" [40] Other skeptics included former FBI profiler John Edward Douglas, who spent hours interviewing Berkowitz and concluded he was an \"introverted loner, not capable of being involved in group activity.\" [40] NYPD psychologist Dr Harvey Schlossberg stated in Against The Law, a documentary about the Son of Sam case, that he believes that the Satanic cult claims are nothing but a fantasy concocted by Berkowitz to absolve himself of guilt In his book Hunting Humans (2001), Elliott Leyton argued that \"recent journalistic attempts to abridge—or even deny—Berkowitz's guilt have lacked all credibility.\" [135]\n\n\nLegacy\nDecades after his arrest, the name \"Son of Sam\" remains widely recognized as that of a notorious serial killer, with popular culture manifestations perpetuating this [136] Berkowitz himself continues to express remorse on Christian websites [137] and on more mainstream news, including speaking out against gun violence and instead spreading the message to \"take the glory out of guns\" [138]\n\n\nLegal effects\nAfter rampant speculation about publishers offering Berkowitz large sums of money for his story, the New York State Legislature swiftly passed a new law that prevented convicted criminals (and their relatives) from making any financial profit from books, movies, or other enterprises related to the stories of their crimes The United States Supreme Court struck down the so-called \"Son of Sam law\" for violating the First Amendment's right of free expression in the 1991 case of Simon & Schuster, Inc v Crime Victims Board, but New York produced a constitutionally revised version of the law in the following year [140] [141] Similar laws have since been enacted in 41 states and at the federal level [140]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nBreslin, in collaboration with writer Dick Schaap, published a novelized account of the murders, .44 (1978), less than a year after Berkowitz's arrest [142] The highly fictionalized plot recounts the exploits of a Berkowitz-based character dubbed \"Bernard Rosenfeld.\" Outside of North America, the book was renamed Son of Sam [143]\n\n\nLiterature\nBreslin, in collaboration with writer Dick Schaap, published

Rosenfeld.\" Outside of North America, the book was renamed Son of Sam [143]\n\n\nTV and film\nThe Spike Lee drama Summer of Sam was released in 1999, with actor Michael Badalucco in the role of Berkowitz [145] The film depicts the tensions that develop in a Bronx neighborhood during the shootings, and Berkowitz's part is largely symbolic A minor character in the script, he functions \"mostly as a berserk metaphor for Lee's view of the seventies as a period of amoral excess.\" [146] Berkowitz was reported to be disturbed by what he called exploitation of \"the ugliness of the past\" in Lee's film [136]\n\n\nMusic\nSon of Sam has been mistakenly associated with the contemporaneous song \"Psycho Killer\" (1977) by Talking Heads [149] Likewise, Elliott Smith stated that his song \"Son of Sam\" is not literally about Berkowitz, a claim some have found hard to believe due to the song's lyrics [153] Compositions more directly inspired by the events include:\n\n\nSee

Two years later, the fallen-from-grace Bryce survives by protecting drug-addicted corporate executives. His life changes when he is hired to protect the world's most wanted hitman, Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson), who is accused of murdering a diplomat's wife.\n\nBryce and Kincaid are forced to work together to evade the villainous Amelia Roussel (Gemma Chan), a ruthless dictator's wife, who is seeking to assassinate Kincaid. As they navigate through various locations, including London, Amsterdam, and Sofia, Bryce and Kincaid develop an unlikely friendship, despite their vastly different backgrounds and personalities.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented ensemble cast, including Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, Salma Hayek, and Gary Oldman. Reynolds plays the lead role of Michael Bryce, a former special forces operative turned private bodyguard.

(Bayley, Dakota Kai, and Iyo Sky) and Becky Lynch entered the women's Royal Rumble match Although Lynch eliminated Kai and Sky, Bayley eliminated Lynch, who was eliminated immediately afterwards Following this, a brawl ensued between Lynch and Damage CTRL which spilled out of the ring and into the crowd [28] Lynch then goaded Bayley on the following episode of Raw into facing her in their initial Steel Cage match Bayley refused, however, she was forced to accept due as Lynch threatened to injure Kai's leg with a chair The Steel Cage match was subsequently rescheduled for the February 6 episode, [29] where a returning Lita fended off interference from Kai and Sky, and assisted Lynch in defeating Bayley [30] After another WWE Hall of Famer, Trish Stratus, helped Lynch and Lita defeated Kai and Sky for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship on the February 27 episode, [31] a six-woman tag team match pitting Lynch, Lita, and Stratus against Damage CTRL was scheduled for WrestleMania 39 [32]\n\n\nResults\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Freedom_Convoy_2022", "content": "\nBackground\nThe protest called for the end of vaccine mandates in Canada during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [31] [32] [1] Freedom Convoy's spokesperson Ben Dichter stated on Fox News that, \"we want to get rid of the vaccine mandates and the  [vaccine] passports And that passport, that's the really concerning one.\"\n\n\nProtest goals\nThe protest called for the end of vaccine mandates in Canada during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [31] [32] [1] Freedom Convoy's spokesperson Ben Dichter stated on Fox News that, \"we want to get rid of the vaccine mandates and the  [vaccine] passports And that passport, that's the really concerning one.\"\n\n\nInitial events and the start of the protest\nOn November 16, 2021, Canadian Border Services Agency officers refused truck driver Brigitte Belton entry to Canada at the Detroit–Windsor tunnel due to her failure to wear a face mask [40]\n\n\nAmerican influence\nOttawa's police chief, Peter Sloly, described a \"significant element\" of American involvement in the organization and funding of the convoys [42] Some of the donors participating in the protest's GoFundMe campaign were from the United States, [43] and many used false names or remained anonymous [44]  [43] CBC News and The New York Times described the protests as a \"cause célèbre\" for the American right [45] [46] The convoys and protests were widely praised and promoted by American conservative political figures, [47] [43] who have been accused of propagating exaggerated claims about the protest, or making unfounded claims about the roles and actions of Canadian authorities and politicians with respect to the protest [48] The protest was endorsed by Trump, who, during his time in power, had regularly clashed with Trudeau over policy differences [49] In response to the convoy, Trump referred to Trudeau as a \"far-left lunatic\" who \"has destroyed Canada\", and invited protesters to organize on Truth Social, his proposed social network [50] Various commentators have called the Freedom Convoy an example of Canadian Trumpism [51]\n\n\nFundraising\nFundraising started on January 14, 2022, through the crowdsourced fundraising platform GoFundMe Listed as organizers were Tamara Lich, secretary of the western separatist Maverick Party, [53] and B J Dichter, a 2015 federal Conservative Party candidate now associated with the People's Party of Canada [33] The Maverick Party has denied involvement in the convoy and said it was not the recipient of any funds raised [34]\n\n\nDonor list hacked\nOn February 13, 2022, the GiveSendGo website was hacked and its data on donations was released to journalists and researchers through Distributed Denial of Secrets [75] [76] Four days later, it was revealed that the hacker who had claimed credit, Aubrey Cottle, had been threatened with murder In the meantime, GiveSendGo had contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation to see if he could be prosecuted [77] Of the 92,845 donations, 55.7 per cent of donors were from the United States, and 39 per cent from Canada Many of the American donors' names correspond to the names of Donald Trump donors [78] [79] The hack also revealed that one $90,000 donation allegedly came from American software billionaire Thomas Siebel [79] Some members of the Ontario Provincial Police were revealed to have donated to the convoy on GiveSendGo, prompting the OPP to launch an internal conduct investigation [80]\n\n\nVaccine mandates and passports\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine mandates targeting federal public servants in the Core Public Administration were announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in October 2021 [85] Many government departments and organizations faced forced administrative leaves without pay if they failed to ensure employees were vaccinated by October 30, 2021 [85] Many of the Provinces implemented their own vaccine mandates and passports at their own discretion, separate from the Federal mandates [86]\n\n\nVaccination requirements for US–Canada cross-border travel\nThese new United States Department of Homeland Security regulations, released in October 2021, were regarding cross-border travel between the Canada and the United States and were based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention To prevent supply chain disruptions, the DHS allowed for a window of four months—until January 22, 2022—for Canadian truckers to get fully vaccinated against COVID-19 [94] [95] On November 19, 2021, the Public Health Agency of Canada announced upcoming adjustments to Canada's border measures [96] This would include the requirement for essential service providers, including truck drivers, to be fully vaccinated after January 15, 2022 The announcement clarified that unvaccinated or partially vaccinated foreign national truck drivers would be prohibited from entering Canada after that date Unvaccinated Canadian truck drivers could enter Canada but would have to quarantine for two weeks According to the Canadian Press and CBC, as of January 22, the mandates would impact an estimated 26,000 unvaccinated truckers of the 160,000 truck drivers who regularly cross the border in both the United States and Canada [97] When asked in the House of Commons to produce data linking truckers to COVID-19 infections in Canada, neither the minister of health Jean-Yves Duclos nor the chief public health officer Theresa Tam were able to do so [98]\n\n\nConvoy to Ottawa\nThe first convoy departed Prince Rupert on January 22, arriving in Prince George in the evening The following day, another convoy left from Delta with supporters gathering along Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway [107]\n\n\nOttawa protest\nAccording to the Ottawa Police Service, crowd estimates ranged from 5,000 to 18,000 protesters on January 29, [13] [9] [128] [129] [11] dwindling to approximately 3,000 demonstrators the following day [10] [130] By February 1, they estimated as few as 250 protesters remained [10]\n\n\nPeak size of Parliament Hill demonstration\nAccording to the Ottawa Police Service, crowd estimates ranged from 5,000 to 18,000 protesters on January 29, [13] [9] [128] [129] [11] dwindling to approximately 3,000 demonstrators the following day [10] [130] By February 1, they estimated as few as 250 protesters remained [10]\n\n\nDesecration and community harassment\nVarious images of specific acts during January 29 received wide condemnation Images of a Canadian flag marked with a swastika were seen, [136] as was a Confederate flag [137] Protesters were seen drinking and dancing on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the National War Memorial Chief of the Defence Staff Gen Wayne Eyre described it as a desecration, and the Royal Canadian Legion condemned the actions [138] A statue of cancer fundraiser Terry Fox was decorated with an upside-down Canadian flag and a protest sign The Terry Fox Foundation said Fox \"believed in science and gave his life to help others\" [136] [139] The statue was cleaned later by other protesters [140]\n\n\nOttawa protests and entrenchment\nThe January 29 protest had a party-like atmosphere, with some handing out coffee and cookies and consuming beer and marijuana [152] Protesters barbecued food, played hockey, and set up bouncy castles for their children to play in [153] Ottawa Police reported de-escalating multiple \"high-risk situations,\" but made no arrests [142]\n\n\nAfter clearance\nOrganizers Chris Barber and Tamara Lich were each arrested on February 17 Lich's bank account had previously been frozen [192] [193] [194] Organizer Pat King was later arrested on February 18, and an Alberta woman in the convoy, Kerry Komix, offered $50,000 for bail [195] The Crown lawyer noted that allowing her to act as surety was like \"one thief being tasked to supervise another burglar.\" [196] [197] Komix was listed as the co-creator of a crypto donation platform [198] King was denied bail on February 25, after the presiding Justice ruled that Komix was not suitable surety, and expressed concern that King had a high risk of reoffending [199] On February 28, a convoy leader from High Prairie, Alberta named Tyson 'Freedom George' Billings was denied bail [200]\n\n\nMajor blockades\nOn January 29, the date that the Freedom Convoy arrived in Ottawa, a group of truckers blockaded the Sweetgrass–Coutts Border Crossing—one of the busiest ports of entry west of the Great Lakes which connects Sweet Grass, Montana, via US Interstate 15 with the village of Coutts, Alberta, via Alberta Highway 4 [214] [215] The United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service is located at this crossing, making it the principal port of entry for Alberta's large meat industry, and one of three main points where all meat products from the rest of western Canada cross the border, according to the Canadian Meat Council [216] [217] The group of around 100 protesters demanded an end to all COVID-19 restrictions [218] [219] The blockade, which extended about 2 km (1.2 mi) into Canada, also blocked public and emergency vehicle access to the village of Coutts, prompting condemnation from the town's mayor [220] Alberta Premier Jason Kenney called the blockade illegal, and threatened that protesters would face penalties under the province's Critical Infrastructure Defence Act [221] [222]\n\n\nAlberta–Montana\nAccording to a February 3 CTV News report, the economic loss of the Sweetgrass–Coutts Border Crossing border crossing closure was estimated at CA$220 million [434] Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters estimated on February 3, that $44 million in daily cross-border trade was affected by the blockade at the border crossing that averages CA$15.9 billion annually in two-way trade [434] [435]\n\n\nOntario–Michigan\nThe economic loss caused by the blockade at the Ambassador Bridge connecting Windsor and Detroit, due to initial delays, was estimated at US$50 million per day when border crossing was still open but at a standstill, according to a February 9 Guardian article [439]\n\n\nParticipants and response\nIn the lead-up to the planned arrival in Ottawa, it was reported on January 25 that far-right and white supremacist groups were hoping for violence on Parliament Hill akin to the 2021 United States Capitol attack [252] This has caused organizer Tamara Lich to address convoy members and denounce political violence, saying that protesters should \"hold a peaceful protest\" instead [253] [254] Organizers and leaders of the convoy condemned extremist groups, and asked that participants report lawbreakers to the police [255] They also stated that any extremists found would be \"removed\" from the convoy [256] Despite this, some protesters were photographed waving Nazi flags at the rally [257] [258] The Globe and Mail noted that \"signs comparing vaccine mandates to the persecution of Jewish people by the Nazis remained\" until the clearance [204] On January 28, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed concern that a small group of protesters were going to be posing a threat during the weekend [259]\n\n\nGroups\nIn the lead-up to the planned arrival in Ottawa, it was reported on January 25 that far-right and white

Trudeau expressed concern that a small group of protesters were going to be posing a threat during the weekend [259]\n\n\nCounter-protests\nCounter-protests in favour of public health measures were held throughout the convoy's duration In Ottawa, with protestors in the parliament area spilling into residential neighbourhoods nearby, lawsuits and injunction requests were filed by residents to silence the trucks that were honking their horns at all hours [274]\n\n\nOttawa Police Service response\nOttawa Police Service faced criticism for how it responded to the convoy during the first three weeks, culminating with the resignation of Chief Peter Sloly [297] At a January 31 press conference, Ottawa Police Service (OPS) Chief Peter Sloly described the demonstration as \"unique in nature, massive in scale, polarizing in context and dangerous in literally every other aspect of the event itself\" [298] He said that starting on January 28, there was a \"traffic gridlock\" which turned into \"traffic chaos\" over the next two days, as \"thousands of vehicles, particularly heavy trucks\" arrived in Ottawa [298] Security forces included police forces from the federal, provincial and municipal levels: the RCMP, Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), Gatineau Police, Sûreté du Québec, London Police Service, Hamilton Police Service, Peel Regional Police, Toronto Police Service, York Regional Police, and Durham Regional Police who worked with the OPS Incident Command System [298] OPS Chief Sloly advised people to avoid downtown Ottawa during the weekend protest, adding that \"we are prepared to investigate, arrest if necessary, charge and prosecute anyone who acts violently or breaks the law in the demonstrations, or in association with the demonstrations\" [299] Chief Sloly said that since the scaling down of the demonstration on January 31, the crime prevention teams normally providing support in around the core, but who were deployed elsewhere during the height of the protests, have returned to their neighbourhoods [298]\n\n\nIntegrated Command Centre response\nPlans for the creation of the new Integrated Command Centre were in place by February 12 The Integrated Command Centre was created to help Ottawa Police Services (OPS) coordinate with Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and RCMP when the anticipated reinforcements would arrive [310] As an estimated 4,000 protesters converged on Parliament Hill on February 12, the extra reinforcements requested by Chief Sloly a week earlier had not yet arrived [310]\n\n\nClearance\nAs of February 10, there was general agreement by government and police that vigorous efforts to clear the blockades were dangerous, possibly leading to expanded or violent reactions A variety of options were legally possible and some, such as issuing tickets, were employed Tow-truck drivers in several locations declined to tow trucks [321] [322]\n\n\nMunicipal response\nOttawa Mayor Jim Watson described the situation as \"the most serious emergency our city has ever faced\" [336] [337]\n\n\nProvincial response\nOn February 11, Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency in the province [338] On the same day, Ontario Superior Court granted an injunction to remove protesters from the Ambassador Bridge [339] The injunction was sought by multiple industry groups affected by the blockade including the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association [340] On February 23 at 5:00 pm, Ontario ended the state of emergency [341]\n\n\nFederal response\nOn February 14, Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act The Act gave police extraordinary powers to \"end border blockades and the occupation of downtown Ottawa by so-called 'Freedom Convoy' protesters.\" [342] [82] [343] Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said that under the Act, protesters' \"trucks can be seized, their corporate accounts frozen and vehicle insurance suspended\" [344] While Trudeau insisted that the military would not be deployed, Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair did not rule out deployment, and called the lack of enforcement by Ottawa Police \"inexplicable\" [345] The Emergencies Act replaced the former War Measures Act, which was famously invoked by Trudeau's father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, to deploy the Canadian Forces against the Front de libération du Québec during the 1970 October Crisis [82] This was the first time the act had been invoked since its 1988 inception [82]\n\n\nEmergencies Act\nOn February 14, Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act The Act gave police extraordinary powers to \"end border

February 11, 2022, prohibiting protest participants from causing incessant sound with horns and megaphones within city limits [370] Edmonton Police Service (EPS) was criticized by City Councilor Michael Janz for taking stronger enforcement measures against a counter protest than it did with the main protest [371] According to EPS, the responses varied as they tried to protect public and officer safety, and keep traffic moving [371]\n\n\nOther\nTruckers and protesters have gathered in Oakville, Mississauga, Vaughan, other parts of the Greater Toronto Area, Orangeville, Quebec City, Calgary, Vancouver, Vancouver Island, Kelowna, Regina, and Victoria [359] [372] [373] [374] [375] [376] A convoy in Charlottetown attracted hundreds of protesters on February 12, mostly driving personal vehicles and farm equipment [377]\n\n\nInternational protests\nThe Freedom Convoy also inspired several Facebook and Telegram groups organizing similar protests in 34 countries including Argentina, Austria, Cyprus, New Zealand, Australia and the United States [378] [379] As is the case in Canada, demonstrations were partly supported by local far-right groups; in Finland by members of neo-fascist Blue-and-Black Movement, Soldiers of Odin and Power Belongs to the People, and in Germany by the Reichsbürger movement and Alternative for Germany [380] [381] [382]\n\n\nRolling Thunder

and various municipal police services [395] Up to 831 RCMP are available as special constables [396]\n\n\nResults and aftermath\nThe House of Commons committee structure lent itself to ongoing investigations, in the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance (FINA), the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security (SECU) and the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs (PROC).\n\n\nParliamentary committee investigations\nThe House of Commons committee structure lent itself to ongoing investigations, in the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance (FINA), the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security (SECU) and the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs (PROC).\n\n\nFINA Committee\nThe FINA committee had its first session on the Invocation of the Emergency Act and Related Measures on February 22 and, as of April 28, had elicited testimony from 22 witnesses over seven hearings [403]\n\n\nSECU Committee\nAs early as February 10, before the protest ended, the SECU committee devoted two sessions to the Crowdfunding Platforms and Extremism Financing investigation, [404] and interviewed 17 witnesses in the Occupation of Ottawa and the Federal Government's Response to Convoy Blockades segment [405]\n\n\nPROC Committee\nOn May 17, the PROC committee heard sworn testimony from interim Ottawa Police Chief Steve Bell that at no time did he request the invocation of the Emergencies Act from the Trudeau government [410] [409] [411] [412]\n\n\nDEDC Committee\nEarly on in the life of the DECD committee its NDP co-chair, Matthew Green, said that committee members \"have a 'responsibility' to work together\" in light of the disagreement of the Official Opposition over the constitution of the committee It consisted of seven MPs and four senators On March 6, co-chair Green was \"interested in looking at the actions of police (or the lack of them), the role played by 'dark money' raised through\" the GoFundMe and GiveSendGo crowdfunding platforms [401] The Senate co-chair (one of three), Gwen Boniface, [402] was the OPP commissioner from 1998 until 2006 [401]\n\n\nPublic Order Emergency Commission\nOn April 25, Trudeau announced the establishment of the Public Order Emergency Commission, an independent inquiry into the invocation of the Emergencies Act headed by Justice Paul Rouleau [414] The inquiry is independent of the parliamentary review committee [415] [414] By law, the inquiry must complete its report and submit it to Parliament by February 20, 2023 [415] [414] The inquiry was scheduled initially to start on September 19, 2022, and run until October 28, 2022 [416] Due to Justice Rouleau undergoing surgery to address a health issue, it is now expected to complete its public hearings on November 25, 2022 [416]\n\n\nEconomic loss and costs\nOn February 15, there were reports that the blockage of the Ambassador Bridge could result in and costs to the automobile industry representing approximately US$1.2 billion in the economies of both the United States and Canada [27] [420]\n\n\nIn Ottawa\nCanadian economist Armine Yalnizyan estimated losses such as workers' wages—CA$11 million a day for a total of $264 million—as well as other costs that Canadian taxpayers would have to pay for damages caused by the \"Ottawa occupation\" The estimated loss of sales at the Rideau Centre—$3 million a day according to the Retail Council of Canada—amounts to a total of $72 million Over 50 per cent of the 235 businesses in the area that was blockaded lost revenue Taxpayers will pay for the $300 a week for those workers who are eligible for the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit They will also pay for the $20 million the federal government will provide to local businesses who lost revenues The $2.5 million for Ottawa LRT free public transit will be paid by taxpayers, as will the millions of dollars for extra police reinforcements Yalnizyan also noted the \"incalculable damage\" to Canada's international reputation as a trade partner which could have a negative impact on supply chains and \"political discourse.\" She did not include the cost to those who lived in the neighbourhoods most impacted, who could not leave their homes and in some cases were \"unable to sleep or access clean air or, at times, even food.\" As well, other communities and neighbourhoods had to live with a reduced police force and therefore reduced safety, as officers were seconded to Ottawa's downtown core [425]\n\n\nAlberta–Montana\nAccording to a February 3 CTV News report, the economic loss of the Sweetgrass–Coutts Border Crossing border crossing closure was estimated at CA$220 million [434] Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters estimated on February 3, that $44 million in daily cross-border trade was affected by the blockade at the border crossing that averages CA$15.9 billion annually in two-way trade [434] [435]\n\n\nOntario–Michigan\nThe economic loss caused by the blockade at the Ambassador Bridge connecting Windsor and Detroit, due to initial delays, was estimated at US$50 million per day when border crossing was still open but at a standstill, according to a February 9 Guardian article [439]\n\n\nManitoba–North Dakota\nThe blockade in Emerson, Manitoba, was estimated to be causing CA$70–73 million in economic loss each day [356] [357]\n\n\nCriticism of Ottawa Police\nIn response to criticism that police had been too soft on \"disruptive protesters\", on February 1, Chief Sloly said that it was a \"measure of success\" that there were \"no riots, no injuries, no deaths\" [440] By February 4, Ottawa Police's response to the protests and later encampments of lingering protesters drew criticism from local residents Complaints focused around lack of enforcement on noise due to constant horn-honking, [441] [442] disruption of livelihoods [442] and continued gridlock [443] Police later addressed some concerns by issuing 30 tickets on February 3 [444]\n\n\nCriminal investigations\nActive investigations are underway for a number of widely publicized incidents including those related to the Unknown Soldier's memorial and the Terry Fox statue as well as for more general incidents, including bribery, threats, assault, dangerous driving, and setting a fire in a building [160] [155] [457] [9] [458] An OPS hotline has been set up where victims can report crimes, including hate crimes [298]\n\n\nLawsuits\nOn February 4, 2022, Ottawa human rights lawyer Paul Champ filed a $9.8 million class action lawsuit against Chris Barber, Benjamin Ditcher, Tamara Lich, Patrick King and others as organizers of the Freedom Convoy on behalf of downtown Ottawa residents over continuous air horn and train horn noise [462] Zexi Li, who lived in a high rise building in the centre of Ottawa and was a data analyst for Shared Services Canada, was chosen by Champ to be the lawsuit's lead complainant [463] [464] [465] [466] In response to the suit, convoy organizers agreed to cease horn noise until 1:00 p.m on February 6 Many protesters ignored the agreement [467]\n\n\nClass-action lawsuit\nOn February 4, 2022, Ottawa human rights lawyer Paul Champ filed a $9.8 million class action lawsuit

February 17, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) announced it was suing the federal government over the Act's invocation, stating that the Emergencies Act must be reserved for national emergencies, which they argued was a \"legal standard that has not been met.\" [474] The CCLA criticized the invocation of the Act in a press release, saying, \"The federal government has not met the threshold necessary to invoke the Emergencies Act This law creates a high and clear standard for good reason: the Act allows government to bypass ordinary democratic processes This standard has not been met.\" In the same press release, the CCLA stated that the normalization of emergency legislation, \"threatens our democracy and our civil liberties.\" [475]\n\n\nStatements and reactions\n\"Freedom of expression, assembly and association are cornerstones of democracy, but Nazi symbolism, racist imagery and desecration of war memorials are not.\"\n\n\nCanadian politicians\n\"Freedom of expression, assembly and association are cornerstones of democracy, but Nazi symbolism, racist imagery and desecration of war memorials are not.\"\n\n\nLiberal Party\n\"Freedom of expression, assembly and association are cornerstones of democracy, but Nazi symbolism, racist imagery and desecration of war memorials are not.\"\n\n\nConservative Party\nErin O'Toole, Leader of the Official Opposition and the Conservative Party as the convoys started, initially declined to support the protest, saying instead that the best way to maintain supply chains is for truckers to get vaccinated [484] O'Toole then later said he would meet with the protesters, but would not participate in nor attend their demonstration in Ottawa [494] O'Toole tweeted \"I support their right to be heard, and I call on Justin Trudeau to meet with these hard-working Canadians to hear their concerns\" [166] O'Toole, a veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces, later condemned the protesters for desecrating the war memorials on Parliament Hill [258] [495] O'Toole was ousted on a leadership review on February 2, some party members citing his policy reversals on issues such as his support for the protest [496]\n\n\nOther Canadian politicians\nPeople's Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier, Ontario Party Leader Derek Sloan, [516] [517] and independent Ontario MPP Randy Hillier expressed support for the convoy protests The People's Party organized a rally in Waterloo on January 23 supporting the convoy, at which Bernier and Hillier both spoke [518] Bernier also attended the January 29 event at Parliament Hill, criticizing Erin O'Toole for not attending [519] Hillier would later speak at the convoy, stating \"this is the hill we die on.\" [520] Hillier also spoke on Russia Today about the convoy, and later tweeted \"Russia news provides a platform for objective journalism where Canadian msm  [sic] creates fabrications\" [521]\n\n\nAmerican politicians and media figures\nMultiple Republican politicians and media figures endorsed the Freedom Convoy including US Senators Marsha Blackburn, [529] Ted Cruz, [46] Steve Daines, [530] and Rand Paul, [531] US Representatives Jim Banks, [532] Dan Bishop, [530] Lauren Boebert, [533] Ken Buck, [530] Madison Cawthorn, [533] Paul Gosar, [534] Marjorie Taylor Greene, [535] Jim Jordan, [536] Kevin McCarthy, [537] Chip Roy, [530] Steve Scalise, [533] Governor Ron DeSantis, [538] Kay Ivey, [539] former US President Donald Trump, [540] former Governor Mike Huckabee, [81] former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, [541] TV personalities Donald Trump Jr., [542] Lara Trump, [543] and singer Ted Nugent [544] Fox News' personalities Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham [545] expressed support for the protestors in broadcasts.\n\n\nTrucking industry and labour groups\nIn their February 7 statement, Teamsters Canada, representing more than 55,000 professional drivers, including approximately 15,000 long-haul truck drivers, of whom 90 per cent are vaccinated, said that the protest \"serves to delegitimize the real concerns of most truck drivers today\" The statement said that the convoy and \"the despicable display of hate led by the political right and shamefully encouraged by elected conservative politicians does not reflect the values of Teamsters Canada.\" [554]\n\n\nMass media outlets\nAccording to The New York Times, \"In an increasingly polarized political environment, the Canadian truckers became an instant cause célèbre.\" [46] Though declaring \"We disagree with protestors' cause\", the newspaper conceded that \" [protestors] have a right to be noisy and even disruptive.\" [46] [564] In late January, CBC host Nil Köksal pondered that \"there is concern that Russian actors could be continuing to fuel things as this protest grows But perhaps even instigating it from, from the outset\" [565] [566] In October 2022, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service said no foreign actors had funded or supported the convoy protests [567] A 2023 study by Caroline Orr Bueno found that RT covered the protests far more than any other outlet [568]\n\n\nMiscellaneous\nCanadian scholar Peter McLaren criticized the convoy protesters' \"concept of freedom\" as \"sorely lacking in dialectical analysis\", arguing that \"they often limited their analysis to the blanket assertion that 'freedom' means the right to say no to any government restrictions on vaccinations, especially those impeding their ability to cross national borders, in this case, crossing freely between Canada and the United States\" McLaren also argued that their concept of freedom \"is historically linked to settler colonialism, that is, a form of colonialism grounded in exogenous domination, a form of colonialism that seeks to displace the original population of the colonized territory with new groups of settlers who typically justify such colonization through an identification with imperial authority.\" [570]\n\n\nOpinion polls\nIn an Abacus Data survey of 1,410 Canadian adults, undertaken before the protest turned into an occupation, between January 31 and February 2, 2022, 68 per cent stated that they \"had very little in common\" with the demonstrators and their ideology and 32 per cent of respondents stated that they \"had a lot in common\" with the protestors and their worldview Furthermore, 43 per cent of respondents stated that they felt the protest was \"respectful and appropriate\", while 57 per cent viewed it as \"offensive and inappropriate\" [607] [608]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The Freedom Convoy 2022 was a protest convoy that originated in Canada in January 2022, in opposition to COVID-19 vaccine mandates and other public health measures. The convoy, which was largely organized through social media, drew support from truckers and other Canadians who felt that the government's health measures were an overreach of authority.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe protest was called for the end of vaccine mandates in Canada during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Freedom Convoy's spokesperson, Ben Dichter, stated that the goal was to get rid of the vaccine mandates and the vaccine passports. These passports, which required individuals to provide proof of vaccination to access certain services and events, were a major point of contention for the protesters.\n\n**Protest Goals**\n\nThe protest called for the end of vaccine mandates in Canada during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Freedom Convoy's spokesperson, Ben Dichter, stated that the goal was to get rid of the vaccine mandates and the vaccine passports. The protesters also demanded an end to all COVID-19 restrictions and an increase in personal freedoms.\n\n**Initial Events and the Start of the Protest**\n\nOn November 16, 2021, Canadian Border Services Agency officers refused truck driver Brigitte Belton entry to Canada at the Detroit–Windsor tunnel due to her failure to wear a face mask. This incident sparked outrage among truckers and other Canadians who felt that the government's health measures were an overreach of authority.\n\n**American Influence**\n\nOttawa's police chief, Peter Sloly, described a \"significant element\" of American involvement in the organization and funding of the convoys. Some of the donors participating in the protest's GoFundMe campaign were from the United States, and many used false names or remained anonymous. The convoys and protests were widely praised and promoted by American conservative political figures, who have been accused of propagating exaggerated claims about the protest, or making unfounded claims about the roles and actions of Canadian authorities and politicians with respect to the protest.\n\n**Fundraising**\n\nFundraising started on January 14, 2022, through the crowdsourced fundraising platform GoFundMe. Listed as organizers were Tamara Lich, secretary of the western separatist Maverick Party, and B J Dichter, a 2015 federal Conservative Party candidate now associated with the People's Party of Canada. The Maverick Party has denied involvement in the convoy and said it was not the recipient of any funds raised.\n\n**Donor List Hacked**\n\nOn February 13, 2022, the GiveSendGo website was hacked and its data on donations was released to journalists and researchers through Distributed Denial of Secrets. Of the 92,845 donations, 55.7 per cent of donors were from the United States, and 39 per cent from Canada. Many of the American donors' names correspond to the names of Donald Trump donors.\n\n**Vaccine Mandates and Passports**\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine mandates targeting federal public servants in the Core Public Administration were announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in October 2021. Many government departments and organizations faced forced administrative leaves without pay if they failed to ensure employees were vaccinated by October 30, 2021. Many of the Provinces implemented their own vaccine mandates and passports at their own discretion, separate from the Federal mandates.\n\n**Vaccination Requirements for US–Canada Cross-Border Travel**\n\nThese new United States Department of Homeland Security regulations, released in October 2021, were regarding cross-border travel between the Canada and the United States and were based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To prevent supply chain disruptions, the DHS allowed for a window of four months—until January 22, 2022—for Canadian truckers to get fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\n**Convoy to Ottawa**\n\nThe first convoy departed Prince Rupert on January 22, arriving in Prince George in the evening. The following day, another convoy left from Delta with supporters gathering along Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway.\n\n**Ottawa Protest**\n\nAccording to the Ottawa Police Service, crowd estimates ranged from 5,000 to 18,000 protesters on January 29. The protest had a party-like atmosphere, with some handing out coffee and cookies and consuming beer and marijuana. Protesters barbecued food, played hockey, and set up bouncy castles for their children to play in.\n\n**Clearance**\n\nAs of February 10, there was general agreement by government and police that vigorous efforts to clear the blockades were dangerous, possibly leading to expanded or violent reactions. Various options were legally possible and some, such as issuing tickets, were employed. Tow-truck drivers in several locations declined to tow trucks.\n\n**Municipal Response**\n\nOttawa Mayor Jim Watson described the situation as \"the most serious emergency our city has ever faced.\"\n\n**Provincial Response**\n\nOn February 11, Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency in the province. On February 23 at 5:00 pm, Ontario ended the state of emergency.\n\n**Federal Response**\n\nOn February 14, Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act. The Act gave police extraordinary powers to \"end border blockades and the occupation of downtown Ottawa by so-called 'Freedom Convoy' protesters.\" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said that under the Act, protesters' \"trucks can be seized, their corporate accounts frozen and vehicle insurance suspended.\"\n\n**Economic Loss and Costs**\n\nOn February 15, there were reports that the blockage of the Ambassador Bridge could result in costs to the automobile industry representing approximately US$1.2 billion in the economies of both the United States and Canada.

The protest drew widespread attention and support from Canadians and international observers, and sparked a national conversation about freedom, individual rights, and the role of government in public

[42] Some of the donors participating in the protest's GoFundMe campaign were from the United States, [43] and many used false names or remained anonymous [44]  [43] CBC News and The New York Times described the protests as a \"cause célèbre\" for the American right [45] [46] The convoys and protests were widely praised and promoted by American conservative political figures, [47] [43] who have been accused of propagating exaggerated claims about the protest, or making unfounded claims about the roles and actions of Canadian authorities and politicians with respect to the protest [48] The protest was endorsed by Trump, who, during his time in power, had regularly clashed with Trudeau over policy differences [49] In response to the convoy, Trump referred to Trudeau as a \"far-left lunatic\" who \"has destroyed Canada\", and invited protesters to organize on Truth Social, his proposed social network [50] Various commentators have called the Freedom Convoy an example of Canadian Trumpism [51]\n\n\nFundraising\nFundraising started on January 14, 2022, through the crowdsourced fundraising platform GoFundMe Listed as organizers were Tamara Lich, secretary of the western separatist Maverick Party, [53] and B J Dichter, a 2015 federal Conservative Party candidate now associated with the People's Party of Canada [33] The Maverick Party has denied involvement in the convoy and said it was not the recipient of any funds raised [34]\n\n\nDonor list hacked\nOn February 13, 2022, the GiveSendGo website was hacked and its data on donations was released to journalists and researchers through Distributed Denial of Secrets [75] [76] Four days later, it was revealed that the hacker who had claimed credit, Aubrey Cottle, had been threatened with murder In the meantime, GiveSendGo had contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation to see if he could be prosecuted [77] Of the 92,845 donations, 55.7 per cent of donors were from the United States, and 39 per cent from Canada Many of the American donors' names correspond to the names of Donald Trump donors [78] [79] The hack also revealed that one $90,000 donation allegedly came from American software billionaire Thomas Siebel [79] Some members of the Ontario Provincial Police were revealed to have donated to the convoy on GiveSendGo, prompting the OPP to launch an internal conduct investigation [80]\n\n\nVaccine mandates and passports\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine mandates targeting federal public servants in the Core Public Administration were announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in October 2021 [85] Many government departments and organizations faced forced administrative leaves without pay if they failed to ensure employees were vaccinated by October 30, 2021 [85] Many of the Provinces implemented their own vaccine mandates and passports at their own discretion, separate from the Federal mandates [86]\n\n\nVaccination requirements for US–Canada cross-border travel\nThese new United States Department of Homeland Security regulations, released in October 2021, were regarding cross-border travel between the Canada and the United States and were based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention To prevent supply chain disruptions, the DHS allowed for a window of four months—until January 22, 2022—for Canadian truckers to get fully vaccinated against COVID-19 [94] [95] On November 19, 2021, the Public Health Agency of Canada announced upcoming adjustments to Canada's border measures [96] This would include the requirement for essential service providers, including truck drivers, to be fully vaccinated after January 15, 2022 The announcement clarified that unvaccinated or partially vaccinated foreign national truck drivers would be prohibited from entering Canada after that date Unvaccinated Canadian truck drivers could enter Canada but would have to quarantine for two weeks According to the Canadian Press and CBC, as of January 22, the mandates would impact an estimated 26,000 unvaccinated truckers of the 160,000 truck drivers who regularly cross the border in both the United States and Canada [97] When asked in the House of Commons to produce data linking truckers to COVID-19 infections in Canada, neither the minister of health Jean-Yves Duclos nor the chief public health officer Theresa Tam were able to do so [98]\n\n\nConvoy to Ottawa\nThe first convoy departed Prince Rupert on January 22, arriving in Prince George in the evening The following day, another convoy left from Delta with supporters gathering along Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway [107]\n\n\nOttawa protest\nAccording to the Ottawa Police Service, crowd estimates ranged from 5,000 to 18,000 protesters on January 29, [13] [9] [128] [129] [11] dwindling to approximately 3,000 demonstrators the following day [10] [130] By February 1, they estimated as few as 250 protesters remained [10]\n\n\nPeak size of Parliament Hill demonstration\nAccording to the Ottawa Police Service, crowd estimates ranged from 5,000 to 18,000 protesters on January 29, [13] [9] [128] [129] [11] dwindling to approximately 3,000 demonstrators the following day [10] [130] By February 1, they estimated as few as 250 protesters remained [10]\n\n\nDesecration and community harassment\nVarious images of specific acts during January 29 received wide condemnation Images of a Canadian flag marked with a swastika were seen, [136] as was a Confederate flag [137] Protesters were seen drinking and dancing on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the National War Memorial Chief of the Defence Staff Gen Wayne Eyre described it as a desecration, and the Royal Canadian Legion condemned the actions [138] A statue of cancer fundraiser Terry Fox was decorated with an upside-down Canadian flag and a protest sign The Terry Fox Foundation said Fox \"believed in science and gave his life to help others\" [136] [139] The statue was cleaned later by other protesters [140]\n\n\nOttawa protests and entrenchment\nThe January 29 protest had a party-like atmosphere, with some handing out coffee and cookies and consuming beer and marijuana [152] Protesters barbecued food, played hockey, and set up bouncy castles for their children to play in [153] Ottawa Police reported de-escalating multiple \"high-risk situations,\" but made no arrests [142]\n\n\nAfter clearance\nOrganizers Chris Barber and Tamara Lich were each arrested on February 17 Lich's bank account had previously been frozen [192] [193] [194] Organizer Pat King was later arrested on February 18, and an Alberta woman in the convoy, Kerry Komix, offered $50,000 for bail [195] The Crown lawyer noted that allowing her to act as surety was like \"one thief being tasked to supervise another burglar.\" [196] [197] Komix was listed as the co-creator of a crypto donation platform [198] King was denied bail on February 25, after the presiding Justice ruled that Komix was not suitable surety, and expressed concern that King had a high risk of reoffending [199] On February 28, a convoy leader from High Prairie, Alberta named Tyson 'Freedom George' Billings was denied bail [200]\n\n\nMajor blockades\nOn January 29, the date that the Freedom Convoy arrived in Ottawa, a group of truckers blockaded the Sweetgrass–Coutts Border Crossing—one of the busiest ports of entry west of the Great Lakes which connects Sweet Grass, Montana, via US Interstate 15 with the village of Coutts, Alberta, via Alberta Highway 4 [214] [215] The United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service is located at this crossing, making it the principal port of entry for Alberta's large meat industry, and one of three main points where all meat products from the rest of western Canada cross the border, according to the Canadian Meat Council [216] [217] The group of around 100 protesters demanded an end to all COVID-19 restrictions [218] [219] The blockade, which extended about 2 km (1.2 mi) into Canada, also blocked public and emergency vehicle access to the village of Coutts, prompting condemnation from the town's mayor [220] Alberta Premier Jason Kenney called the blockade illegal, and threatened that protesters would face penalties under the province's Critical Infrastructure Defence Act [221] [222]\n\n\nAlberta–Montana\nAccording to a February 3 CTV News report, the economic loss of the Sweetgrass–Coutts Border Crossing border crossing closure was estimated at CA$220 million [434] Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters estimated on February 3, that $44 million in daily cross-border trade was affected by the blockade at the border crossing that averages CA$15.9 billion annually in two-way trade [434] [435]\n\n\nOntario–Michigan\nThe economic loss caused by the blockade at the Ambassador Bridge connecting Windsor and Detroit, due to initial delays, was estimated at US$50 million per day when border crossing was still open but at a standstill, according to a February 9 Guardian article [439]\n\n\nParticipants and response\nIn the lead-up to the planned arrival in Ottawa, it was reported on January 25 that far-right and white supremacist groups were hoping for violence on Parliament Hill akin to the 2021 United States Capitol attack [252] This has caused organizer Tamara Lich to address convoy members and denounce political violence, saying that protesters should \"hold a peaceful protest\" instead [253] [254] Organizers and leaders of the convoy condemned extremist groups, and asked that participants report lawbreakers to the police [255] They also stated that any extremists found would be \"removed\" from the convoy [256] Despite this, some protesters were photographed waving Nazi flags at the rally [257] [258] The Globe and Mail noted that \"signs comparing vaccine mandates to the persecution of Jewish people by the Nazis remained\" until the clearance [204] On January 28, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed concern that a small group of protesters were going to be posing a threat during the weekend [259]\n\n\nGroups\nIn the lead-up to the

[259]\n\n\nCounter-protests\nCounter-protests in favour of public health measures were held throughout the convoy's duration In Ottawa, with protestors in the parliament area spilling into residential neighbourhoods nearby, lawsuits and injunction requests were filed by residents to silence the trucks that were honking their horns at all hours [274]\n\n\nOttawa Police Service response\nOttawa Police Service faced criticism for how it responded to the convoy during the first three weeks, culminating with the resignation of Chief Peter Sloly [297] At a January 31 press conference, Ottawa Police Service (OPS) Chief Peter Sloly described the demonstration as \"unique in nature, massive in scale, polarizing in context and dangerous in literally every other aspect of the event itself\" [298] He said that starting on January 28, there was a \"traffic gridlock\" which turned into \"traffic chaos\" over the next two days, as \"thousands of vehicles, particularly heavy trucks\" arrived in Ottawa [298] Security forces included police forces from the federal, provincial and municipal levels: the RCMP, Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), Gatineau Police, Sûreté du Québec, London Police Service, Hamilton Police Service, Peel Regional Police, Toronto Police Service, York Regional Police, and Durham Regional Police who worked with the OPS Incident Command System [298] OPS Chief Sloly advised people to avoid downtown Ottawa during the weekend protest, adding that \"we are prepared to investigate, arrest if necessary, charge and prosecute anyone who acts violently or breaks the law in the demonstrations, or in association with the demonstrations\" [299] Chief Sloly said that since the scaling down of the demonstration on January 31, the crime prevention teams normally providing support in around the core, but who were deployed elsewhere during the height of the protests, have returned to their neighbourhoods [298]\n\n\nIntegrated Command Centre response\nPlans for the creation of the new Integrated Command Centre were in place by February 12 The Integrated Command Centre was created to help Ottawa Police Services (OPS) coordinate with Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and RCMP when the anticipated reinforcements would arrive [310] As an estimated 4,000 protesters converged on Parliament Hill on February 12, the extra reinforcements requested by Chief Sloly a week earlier had not yet arrived [310]\n\n\nClearance\nAs of February 10, there was general agreement by government and police that vigorous efforts to clear the blockades were dangerous, possibly leading to expanded or violent reactions A variety of options were legally possible and some, such as issuing tickets, were employed Tow-truck drivers in several locations declined to tow trucks [321] [322]\n\n\nMunicipal response\nOttawa Mayor Jim Watson described the situation as \"the most serious emergency our city has ever faced\" [336] [337]\n\n\nProvincial response\nOn February 11, Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency in the province [338] On the same day, Ontario Superior Court granted an injunction to remove protesters from the Ambassador Bridge [339] The injunction was sought by multiple industry groups affected by the blockade including the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association [340] On February 23 at 5:00 pm, Ontario ended the state of emergency [341]\n\n\nFederal response\nOn February 14, Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act The Act gave police extraordinary powers to \"end border blockades and the occupation of downtown Ottawa by so-called 'Freedom Convoy' protesters.\" [342] [82] [343] Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said that under the Act, protesters' \"trucks can be seized, their corporate accounts frozen and vehicle insurance suspended\" [344] While Trudeau insisted that the military would not be deployed, Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair did not rule out deployment, and called the lack of enforcement by Ottawa Police \"inexplicable\" [345] The Emergencies Act replaced the former War Measures Act, which was famously invoked by Trudeau's father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, to deploy the Canadian Forces against the Front de libération du Québec during the 1970 October Crisis [82] This was the first time the act had been invoked since its 1988 inception [82]\n\n\nEmergencies Act\nOn

several Facebook and Telegram groups organizing similar protests in 34 countries including Argentina, Austria, Cyprus, New Zealand, Australia and the United States [378] [379] As is the case in Canada, demonstrations were partly supported by local far-right groups; in Finland by members of neo-fascist Blue-and-Black Movement, Soldiers of Odin and Power Belongs to the People, and in Germany

from interim Ottawa Police Chief Steve Bell that at no time did he request the invocation of the Emergencies Act from the Trudeau government [410] [409] [411] [412]\n\n\nDEDC Committee\nEarly on in the life of the DECD committee its NDP co-chair, Matthew Green, said that committee members \"have a 'responsibility' to work together\" in light of the disagreement of the Official Opposition over the constitution of the committee It consisted of seven MPs and four senators On March 6, co-chair Green was \"interested in looking at the actions of police (or the lack of them), the role played by 'dark money' raised through\" the GoFundMe and GiveSendGo crowdfunding platforms [401] The Senate co-chair (one of three), Gwen Boniface, [402] was the OPP commissioner from 1998 until 2006 [401]\n\n\nPublic Order Emergency Commission\nOn April 25, Trudeau announced the establishment of the Public Order Emergency Commission, an independent inquiry into the invocation of the Emergencies Act headed by Justice Paul Rouleau [414] The inquiry is independent of the parliamentary review committee [415] [414] By law, the inquiry must complete its report and submit it to Parliament by

Yalnizyan estimated losses such as workers' wages—CA$11 million a day for a total of $264 million—as well as other costs that Canadian taxpayers would have to pay for damages caused by the \"Ottawa occupation\" The estimated loss of sales at the Rideau Centre—$3 million a day according to the Retail Council of Canada—amounts to a total of $72 million Over 50 per cent of the 235 businesses in the area that was blockaded lost revenue Taxpayers will pay for the $300 a week for those workers who are eligible for the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit They will also pay for the $20 million the federal government will provide to local businesses who lost revenues The $2.5 million for Ottawa LRT free public transit will be paid by taxpayers, as will the millions of dollars for extra police reinforcements Yalnizyan also noted the \"incalculable damage\" to Canada's international reputation as a trade partner which could have a negative impact on supply chains and \"political discourse.\" She did not include the cost to those who lived in the neighbourhoods most impacted, who could not leave their homes and in some cases were \"unable to sleep or access clean air or, at times, even food.\" As well, other communities and neighbourhoods had to live with a reduced police force and therefore reduced safety, as officers were seconded to Ottawa's downtown core [425]\n\n\nAlberta–Montana\nAccording to a February 3 CTV News report, the economic loss of the Sweetgrass–Coutts Border Crossing border crossing closure was estimated at CA$220 million [434] Canadian

said that it was a \"measure of success\" that there were \"no riots, no injuries, no deaths\" [440] By February 4, Ottawa Police's response to the protests and later encampments of lingering protesters drew criticism from local residents Complaints focused around lack of enforcement on noise due to constant horn-honking, [441] [442] disruption of livelihoods [442] and continued gridlock [443] Police later addressed some concerns by issuing 30 tickets on February 3 [444]\n\n\nCriminal investigations\nActive investigations are underway for a number of widely publicized incidents including those related to the Unknown Soldier's memorial and the Terry Fox statue as well as for more general incidents, including bribery, threats, assault, dangerous driving, and setting a fire in

it was suing the federal government over the Act's invocation, stating that the Emergencies Act must be reserved for national emergencies, which they argued was a \"legal standard that has not been met.\" [474] The CCLA criticized the invocation of the Act in a press release, saying, \"The federal government has not met the threshold necessary to invoke the Emergencies Act This law creates a high and clear standard for good reason: the Act allows government to bypass ordinary democratic processes This standard has not been met.\" In the same press release, the CCLA stated that the normalization of emergency legislation, \"threatens our democracy and our civil liberties.\" [475]\n\n\nStatements and reactions\n\"Freedom of expression, assembly and association are cornerstones of

racist imagery and desecration of war memorials are not.\"\n\n\nConservative Party\nErin O'Toole, Leader of the Official Opposition and the Conservative Party as the convoys started, initially declined to support the protest, saying instead that the best way to maintain supply chains is for truckers to get vaccinated [484] O'Toole then later said he would meet with the protesters, but would not participate in nor attend their demonstration in Ottawa [494] O'Toole tweeted \"I support their right to be heard, and I call on Justin Trudeau to meet with these hard-working Canadians to hear their concerns\" [166] O'Toole, a veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces, later condemned the protesters for desecrating the war memorials on Parliament Hill [258] [495] O'Toole was ousted on a leadership review on February 2, some party members citing his policy reversals on issues such as his support for the protest [496]\n\n\nOther Canadian politicians\nPeople's Party of Canada leader Maxime Bernier, Ontario Party Leader Derek Sloan, [516] [517] and independent Ontario MPP Randy Hillier expressed support for the convoy protests The People's Party organized a rally in Waterloo on January 23 supporting the convoy, at which Bernier and Hillier both spoke [518] Bernier also attended the January 29 event at Parliament Hill, criticizing Erin O'Toole for not attending [519] Hillier would later speak at the convoy, stating \"this is the hill we die on.\" [520] Hillier also spoke on Russia Today about the convoy, and later tweeted \"Russia news provides a platform for objective

[544] Fox News' personalities Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham [545] expressed support for the protestors in broadcasts.\n\n\nTrucking industry and labour groups\nIn their February 7 statement, Teamsters Canada, representing more than 55,000 professional drivers, including approximately 15,000 long-haul truck drivers, of whom 90 per cent are vaccinated, said that the protest \"serves to delegitimize the real concerns of most truck drivers today\" The statement said that the convoy and \"the despicable display of hate led by the political right and shamefully encouraged by elected conservative politicians does not reflect the values of Teamsters Canada.\" [554]\n\n\nMass media outlets\nAccording to The New York Times, \"In an increasingly polarized political environment, the Canadian truckers became an instant cause célèbre.\" [46] Though declaring \"We disagree with protestors' cause\", the newspaper conceded that \" [protestors] have a right to be noisy and even disruptive.\" [46] [564] In late January, CBC host Nil Köksal pondered that \"there is concern that Russian actors could be continuing to fuel things as this protest grows But perhaps even instigating it from, from the outset\" [565] [566] In October 2022, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service said no foreign actors had funded or supported the convoy protests [567] A 2023 study by Caroline Orr Bueno found that RT covered the protests far more than any other outlet [568]\n\n\nMiscellaneous\nCanadian scholar Peter McLaren criticized the convoy protesters' \"concept of freedom\" as \"sorely lacking in dialectical analysis\", arguing that \"they often limited their analysis to the blanket assertion that 'freedom' means the right to say no to any government restrictions on vaccinations, especially those impeding their ability to cross national borders, in this case, crossing freely between Canada and the United States\" McLaren also argued that their concept of freedom \"is historically linked to settler colonialism, that is, a form of colonialism grounded in exogenous domination, a form of colonialism that seeks to displace the original population of the colonized territory with new groups of settlers who typically justify such colonization through an identification with imperial authority.\" [570]\n\n\nOpinion polls\nIn an Abacus Data survey of 1,410 Canadian adults, undertaken before the protest turned into an occupation, between January 31 and February 2, 2022, 68 per cent stated that they \"had very little in common\" with the demonstrators and their ideology and 32 per cent of respondents stated that they \"had a lot in common\" with the protestors and their worldview Furthermore, 43 per cent of respondents stated that they felt the protest was \"respectful and appropriate\", while 57 per cent viewed it as \"offensive and inappropriate\" [607] [608]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Martin_Bowes", "content": "\nOrigins\nMartin Bowes was born into a family well-established in the civic life of the city of York in earlier generations The merchant William Bowes the elder, MP for York in 1413 and 1417, was Lord Mayor of York in 1417 and 1428, and in around 1430 rebuilt the parish church of St Cuthbert at Peaseholme Green; in 1443 a younger William Bowes was also mayor [5] Reputedly, Martin was born in the old timbered house, the Bowes family home in Peaseholme Green, at the sign of the Black Swan [6]\n\n\nIn Henry's time\nIn 1526 (by which year Bowes had already embarked upon his first marriage, to Cecily Eliott) Amadas appointed Bowes his deputy at the Royal Mint, of which he became one of the three or four master-workers These men, together with the Treasurer William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy, were entitled to equal shares of the Mint's profit The arrangement caused friction between the master-workers and their superior, who claimed to have been denied his fair share [11] The official allowances paid to the master-workers were considerably lower than they had formerly been, during the Yorkist period, and the managers made up for this by \"seizing every opportunity to make the Mint pay\" [12] In 1530 Lord Mountjoy attempted to hold the two Deputy Masters, Robert Amadas and Ralph Rowlett (died 1543), to account, [13] but they brought counter-claims at law: by 1533, Amadas having died (buried in St Mary Woolnoth), [14] Mountjoy had resigned his patent and Bowes and Rowlett became joint Masters of the Mint [3] [15] [16]\n\n\nThe London mint\nIn 1526 (by which year Bowes had already embarked upon his first marriage, to Cecily Eliott) Amadas appointed Bowes his deputy at the Royal Mint, of which he became one of the three or four master-workers These men, together with the Treasurer William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy, were entitled to equal shares of the Mint's profit The arrangement caused friction between the master-workers and their superior, who claimed to have been denied his fair share [11] The official allowances paid to the master-workers were considerably lower than they had formerly been, during the Yorkist period, and the managers made up for this by \"seizing every opportunity to make the Mint pay\" [12] In 1530 Lord Mountjoy attempted to hold the two Deputy Masters, Robert Amadas and Ralph Rowlett (died 1543), to account, [13] but they brought counter-claims at law: by 1533, Amadas having died (buried in St Mary Woolnoth), [14] Mountjoy had resigned his patent and Bowes and Rowlett became joint Masters of the Mint [3] [15] [16]\n\n\nCivic opportunities\nBowes was, meanwhile, advancing in civic affairs, progressing through two Warden-ships of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1532-33 and 1534–36, and in 1536, having served as auditor, was chosen an alderman for the Aldgate ward [17] Accepting this, his petition was granted that he should not be called upon to serve as Sheriff for three years to come  His status as alderman gave him a special importance within the Company of Goldsmiths, and he served his first term as Prime Warden (a role which he resumed under Edward, Mary and Elizabeth) in 1537–38 He had built, and now occupied, that distinguished residence mentioned by John Stow in Lombard Street, near the parish church of St Mary Woolnoth, among the \"diverse faire houses, namely one with a verie faire forefront towards the streete, builded by Sir Martin Bowes, Goldsmith.\" The back gate opened towards the conduit in Cornhill [18] In 1539/40 the advowson of this church, which had belonged to the Priory and convent of St Helen (Bishopsgate), [19] was granted to him, and later remained to his descendants [20] [21]\n\n\nWives and lands\nHis first wife Cicely having died leaving him with two, perhaps three sons, she was buried at St Mary Woolnoth: Bowes remarried by 1538 to Anne Barrett of Aveley (Essex), upon whom he sired several more children through the 1540s, including Joan (1541), Francis (1542), William (1543/44), another Francis (1545), Charity (1548) and Henry (1550) [22] However, in 1541 he lost a daughter Elizabeth, and in 1543 he lost his ward Elizabeth Strong, a gentlewoman; one Francis was buried on the day of the second Francis' baptism [23]\n\n\nShrievalty, 1540-1541\nIn 1540, transferring to the Castle Baynard ward, [17] he was appointed Sheriff together with the eminent citizen and Grocer William Laxton, in the mayoralty of Sir William Roche [28] It was a big year for executions (an important part of a sheriff's work): although the beheading of Thomas Cromwell and the royal marriage to Katherine Howard had already occurred before these sheriffs took office at Michaelmas, it is particularly recorded that Bowes and Laxton as Sheriffs attended Lord Dacre of the South at the Tower of London on 29 July 1541 and accompanied him on foot to Tyburn where he was to be hanged [29] As the summer of 1541 approached, the executions of the Countess of Salisbury and of Lord Leonard Gray took place at the Tower [30] During the course of that year Bowes received knighthood [31]\n\n\nCoinage debasement and reforms\nWhereas Henry VII had maintained close control over the Mints, under Henry VIII the Crown \"did little more than making the ends meet\", [36] leaving the master-workers to manage their own work Investigations leading to reorganization of the Mint in 1544 showed that Bowes and Ralph Rowlett (died 1543) [37] were responsible for systematic unauthorized debasement of silver supplied by the Crown Thousands of pounds in \"surplus\" coinage remained unaccounted for; [12] but Bowes survived the scrutiny Official indentures from 1542/43 forwards, directed to Bowes and his officers, specified the required degrees of adulteration of the metal [38] The debasement of French coinage had resulted in large quantities of finer English currency being exported, so by this method the price of English gold and silver was raised [39]\n\n\nMayoralty, 1545-1546\nSir William Laxton having served as Lord Mayor of London for 1544–1545, Bowes succeeded him, transferring at the same time to the Langbourn ward: [17] the election on St Edward's Day (13 October) 1545 was the occasion when the new gold mayoral Livery collar presented to the city by the late Sir John Alleyn was worn, for the first time, by Laxton as outgoing mayor [49]  The month of June 1546 was a particularly busy one Bowes, fearing food shortages in the city, had a large quantity of corn imported from overseas, which arrived in London in that month At the same time the king required the city to take in 20,000 quarters of barley and rye which he had laid in against his foreign wars, and Bowes was obliged to raise a great sum of money to pay for it, and to commandeer every mill within seven miles of the city for the grinding thereof [50]\n\n\nProclamation of peace\nHowever, on 13 June a solemn peace was proclaimed in the city for the Treaty of Ardres, involving a great ceremony in St Paul's in which the Mayor was prominent, with full representation of the Crafts, and a heraldic and ecclesiastic procession into Cheap to the Cornhill and to Leadenhall corner, and so back to St Paul's (It was the last great show of the rich crosses and copes in London, for they were soon afterwards called into the King's Wardrobe.) Fires were lit in the street, banquets held, and hogsheads of wine and beer with spicebread were set out before the Lord Mayor's gate for passers-by to enjoy The next day was a sumptuous feast at the Lord Mayor's place, where Oudard du Biez  [fr], Marshal of France and captain of the fortress at Boulogne, and other French Captains, were the guests On that occasion, while \"at waffers and ipocras\", Bowes (to illustrate his authority) chose alderman Richard Jerveys [52] to be sheriff for the next year, and drank the health of one of the current sheriffs who was present with his wife: which much impressed the French Captain [53]\n\n\nMidsummer Watch\nThe Court of Aldermen permanently set aside the Midsummer Watch procession, but Sir Martin Bowes performed it at his own expense on Midsummer Eve, riding to St Peter's with a hundred constables with cresset lights and bearers going before him, all his servants and officers in cassocks and jerkins of yellow satin, three squires in yellow damask, the sword-bearer riding in a cassock of yellow velvet: the mayor's footmen in doublets of yellow velvet embroidered with his arms on the breast and back, the two sheriffs and their officers following, and lastly forty more constables with their lights: \"which was a proper sight\" [54] The Sheriffs were George Barne and Ralph Alleyn [28] The Goldsmiths were put to some expense during the mayoralty as it was necessary for Bowes to be accompanied by his sheriffs and other officers at corporate events, such that in 1547 they stipulated that these additional payments should not be taken as a precedent except when a member of the company should be Mayor [55]\n\n\nAnne Askew\nOn 18 June 1546 the Protestant gentlewoman Anne Askew was brought once more to the Guildhall of London to be arraigned for heresy, before a daunting board of ecclesiastical and secular justices led by Sir Martin Bowes She had been acquitted, after a period of imprisonment during which she was questioned by Laxton, on a similar charge in the previous year, but had now resumed her offence by perfecting herself in faith She was taken to the Tower on 19 June, and her inquisition and torture followed, ending in her burning for heresy at West Smithfield on 17 July [56] This was the notorious occasion of her interrogation under torture on the rack, not only in the presence of Chancellor Wriothesley and Richard Rich, but actually at their own hands Her denial of the Real Presence, her refusal to believe that God was in the piece of bread which they called the Sacrament, left her condemnation inevitable under the prevailing system of law [57] The secular authorities had responsibility for pronouncing the condemnation and carrying out the sentence [58]\n\n\nWelfare\nAs Lord Mayor, Martin Bowes had imposed a tax of two fifteenths on the inhabitants of London to bring a supply of fresh water from Hackney, and an improved supply was brought from Finsbury by the end of his term [59] [60] He sought to arrange with the King for the purchase of St Bartholomew's Hospital in Smithfield, and the former London Greyfriars, for the purpose of rebuilding the former in its continuing role as Hospital, and founding Christ's Hospital on the site of the latter [3] He was succeeded as Mayor by Henry Huberthorn at Michaelmas 1546 The grant to the Mayor and citizens of these two sites and of the Hospital of Bedlam was agreed on 27 December 1546 [61] and issued on 13 January following, [62] the reform of the Court of Augmentations and of the Court of General Surveyors of the King's Lands (\"in which there has been great disorder\") having intervened on 1 January 1546/47 [63]\n\n\nEdwardian and Marian dignitary\nBowes kept his cloak for the ward of Langbourn for another twenty years, until his death [17] As Edward VI took the throne, Bowes was chosen one of the four MPs to represent London in the parliament of 1547–1552, and was returned again for its successor parliament in March 1553 [3]\n\n\nIconoclasm\nBowes made his own distinct contribution to the iconoclasm, or dismantling of superstitious uses then enacted Appointed a commissioner for chantries in London, Westminster and Middlesex in 1546, [3] in October 1547 at an assembly of the Goldsmiths he was instructed by them to break up the company's image of its patron, St Dunstan, and to sell it for the best profit, and also to have the company's standing cup (with an image of St Dunstan on its lid) broken up and converted into some other piece of plate [64] A Chantry Certificate for St Mary Woolnoth for 1 January 1547/48 declares a rent charge of £13.13s.04d (for the maintenance of a priest) going out of \"a capital messuage in Lumbard Street wherein Sir Marten Bowes, Knight, inhabiteth.\" Bowes made his first presentation to St Mary Woolnoth in April 1549 in Humfry Edwards, M.A (of the University of Oxford), who was installed by Bishop Bonner [65] [20]\n\n\nHospital foundation\nAppointed Treasurer of St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1547, in seeking to fund his hospital projects he had the tombs of the Greyfriars utterly ransacked for their stone slabs and brass plates [3] Sir Martin Bowes and Sir Andrew Judd headed a great meeting of hospital governors in October 1552 at Christ's Hospital: [68] he also headed a deputation, accompanied by Bishop Ridley, to petition the king for the use of the Bridewell Palace to provide shelter for vagrants and mendicants, against whom severe prohibitions had been proclaimed in the king's first year [69] King Edward VI's Foundation Charter of the hospitals of Christ, Bridewell and St Thomas was issued on 26 June 1553 [70]\n\n\nA civic funeral\nLate in 1553, when the succession had been decided in favour of Queen Mary, and Sir George Barne's mayoralty was drawing to a close, Dame Anne Bowes died and was accorded a full heraldic funeral on 22 October, described by Henry Machyn The house, the street and the church of St Mary Woolnoth [73] were hung with black cloth decorated with armorial bearings The Heralds accompanied 100 men and women in gowns in the procession: great gilt candlesticks, tapers and branch-lights were borne along, with the company of priests and the singing clerks, leading the corpse with four pennons of arms around her and 12 servants bearing torches The chief mourners followed, and after them the Lord Mayor with his swordbearer, Sir Henry Huberthorn and Sir Rowland Hill, many other mourners, and lastly the Craft of the Goldsmiths Having sung the dirige in the evening, on the morrow was the mass, the sermon, and the dinner [74]\n\n\nStatus and acquiescence\nBowes did not sit in the winter parliament of 1553, but he was returned again for London in April 1554 and again in November of that year [3] Dame Anne leaving him with several children, in 1554 he remarried to Elizabeth Harlow, widow of the assay-master at the Tower and Southwark mints William Billingsley, citizen and Haberdasher, who had died in 1553 [75] Elizabeth had sons including Henry Billingsley, the third son (then studying in Cambridge), who later translated the works of Euclid and became Lord Mayor of London [76] There was at least one son, William Bowes, from her marriage to Sir Martin, and he was baptized on 8 December 1556 [77] From 1553 Bowes entered upon his longest term as Upper Warden of the Goldmiths, holding for consecutive years through to 1557, and then intermitting only for one year During this term he continued also as a Member of Parliament for London in Mary's time, sitting in the parliaments of November 1554 and of October–December 1555 [3]\n\n\nHospitals 1557\nAt a General Court held at Christ's Hospital on 27 September 1557, in the mayoralty of Sir Thomas Offley and under the authority of the Mayor, commonalty and citizens of the City of London, the governors of St Bartholomew's, Christ's, the Bridewell and St Thomas's Hospitals agreed that the Hospital of St Bartholomew should be united with the others; that for the government of these hospitals Sir Martin Bowes should be Controller General and Sir Andrew Judd Surveyor General; and that three aldermen, a treasurer and eight other citizens named in their agreement were to be governors for each of the individual hospitals [85] [86] On the next day the Ordinances and Rules for the governance of the hospitals, which had been devised by Sir Martin Bowes and Sir Rowland Hill assisted by various other city leaders, were read before the court, entered into record, and ordered to be put into execution [87] The arrangements so continued down to 1564, when on 21 September (St Matthew's Day) a President, Treasurer and other governors were chosen at Christ's Hospital for each of the hospitals, after which elections were kept annually [85] [17]\n\n\nElizabethan\nIn 1558 Martin Bowes embarked on his final, four-year term of service as Upper Warden of the Goldsmiths' Company [4] He did not sit in the parliament of 1558, but following its automatic dissolution in the second session on 17 November 1558, owing to Queen Mary's death, on 6 December following he was summoned to the first parliament of Queen Elizabeth's reign, which sat from 23 January to 8 May 1559 In its aim to re-establish a Protestant religious statehood, the new Act of Supremacy 1558 and Act of Uniformity 1558 were passed (those of Henry VIII having been repealed by Queen Mary), which became the foundation of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement [88] This was Bowes's last parliamentary term.\n\n\nSt Mary Woolnoth\nIn the meantime his newly presented rector for St Mary Woolnoth had died, and on 30 November 1558 his replacement, Miles Gerard, was installed by Edmund Bonner (who hung on as Bishop of London until 1560) [20] Little time was lost in removing the roodloft (and presumably the recently repainted and gilded figures), the timber of which was delivered in 1560, at Bowes's order, to the governors of the Bridewell and Bethlehem Hospitals, which had been brought under united administration in 1557 The brass candlesticks and the Latin service-books were sold, with the approval of the congregation, a table of the Ten Commandments was set up, and in May 1562, at Bowes's bidding, the old leaden organ pipes were sold off, 102 lbs weight at twopence the pound This however was not wholesale destruction, but rather a renovation of the existing organ In April 1561 the child choristers of St Paul's were brought in to assist the church choir at the marriage of Lady Bowes's daughter Cicely Billingsley [89] Cicely's sister Elizabeth Billingsley had died in late February 1560/61 [90]\n\n\nThe Bowes Cup, and other gifts\nIt is as a civic figure, the continuing alderman for Langbourn ward, Comptroller-General of the Hospitals, and Upper Warden of the Goldsmiths's Company, that Bowes features most prominently in his last years In 1559 the Queen addressed a Proclamation to the Company concerning its apparel, reforms and other matters, which Bowes was particular in advising them to weigh most carefully [92] In the following year, it was agreed that the Wardens of the company should be chosen on the feast day of St Dunstan by the use of garlands, to which end Alderman Bowes had given them four fair garlands of crimson velvet, garnished with silver and gold and set with pearls and stones At the same time he gave them \"a fair silver gilt standing cup of 80 ounces, with beryl in the body and the cover, with a mannekin on the cover holding an escutcheon bearing Bowes's arms in an annealed  [enamelled] plate of gold\" [93]\n\n\nCivic matters\nElizabeth's coinage reforms of 1561 were supervised (under Sir Edmund Peckham, High Treasurer of the Mint) by her Comptroller (1559) and Under-Treasurer (from 1561), the Goldsmith Thomas Stanley, who as Assay Master had advised on standards in 1551 as the debasement was halted [99] Elizabeth was suspicious of her advisers, including her coinage commissioners the Marquess of Winchester and Sir Richard Sackville, while Secretary Cecil and Sir Thomas Parry (Comptroller of the Household) advised Sir William Hewett, stamping existing currency with marks of standard, and Thomas Lodge in managing the Easterling moneyers [100] [101]\n\n\nCharitable bequests\nIt appears that Bowes appointed two trustees during the 1550s, both members of the Goldsmiths' Company, to manage various bequests which he intended should be administered by the company after his own death Both, however, predeceased him, leaving wills containing instructions for the performance of the trusts which Bowes had reposed in them [106]\n\n\nSouthwood: The \"Remembrance\"\nThe first of these was William Southwood, whose will dated 23 October 1557 [107] was proved in 1560 [108] Through him, Bowes had left messuages, lands and tenements in Scalding Alley (in St Mildred in the Poultry) worth £16.13s.04d per annum, and rents from tenements in St Matthew's Alley, Westcheap (St Matthew Friday Street) worth £1.13s.2d to the Goldsmiths' Company This was to provide for a learned preacher to preach an annual sermon in St Mary Woolnoth on or near St Martin's Day (11 November), for what was called \"Sir Martin Bowes's Remembrance\" The preacher was to have 6s.8d; four Wardens of the Company and 12 of the Assistants were to attend, having 1s.4d and 1s each respectively: the clerk and beadle were to have 1s.4d, the clerk was to toll the bell for 8d, and the renters, who had 2s each, were to arrange a dinner costing £3 The churchwardens were given 9s year for a potation (a \"drynkyng\") [106]\n\n\nMundie: the Langbourne fifteenths\nThe will of Roger Mundie, dated 12 August 1562, [110] also a grantee in trust for Sir Martin Bowes, gave to the Wardens and commonalty of the Goldsmiths a great messuage or tenement, with stables, courts, gardens and hereditaments, in St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, together with 22 gardens and a small tenement and garden in the same parish, of annual rent value of £13.6s.8d In the ward of Langbourne, charges of fifteenths periodically granted by parliament to the Crown were at the rate of £20.10s, which was a great burden to the poor, and this bequest was to defray that sum for any future such charges to Langbourn ward rising after Sir Martin's death For receiving these rents the two Company renters were to be given 3s.4d yearly, and any surplus was to be divided between the poor of the Goldsmiths and the maintenance of the Company Hall By a codicil dated 10 October 1562, in respect of Bowes's feoffment to him of the same day, two further messuages or tenements in St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate were added to the same uses [106] Roger Mundie's will was proved on 6 November 1562 [111]\n\n\nThe Bowes almshouses, Woolwich\nOn 28 September 1560 Bowes made a deed of feoffment to 24 trustees granting them his five messuages with gardens in Woolwich for the occupation of five poor parishioners of Woolwich aged over 50, for term of their lives without charge, or (in default) to five poor members of the Goldsmiths' Company [106] The houses were to be placed under the management of the Goldsmiths' Company, and in Bowes's will of 1562, [112] giving lands and tenements to the company for various charitable uses, he specified that each of the occupants should receive an annual pension of £1.10s.05d, and that on the occasion of the annual inspection by the company a sermon should be preached at Woolwich parish church [113] His feoffment of the almshouses to the company was made on 20 September 1565 [4] The houses (which no longer exist) were always occupied by widowed almswomen.\n\n\nDeath and burial\nBowes made a will in September 1562 which carries a codicil dated 29 July 1565, and was enrolled in the Court of Husting in 1595 The will contains various bequests of his properties and estates to his children and grandchildren [112]\n\n\nWills\nBowes made a will in September 1562 which carries a codicil dated 29 July 1565, and was enrolled in the Court of Husting in 1595 The will contains various bequests of his properties and estates to his children and grandchildren [112]\n\n\nSepulture\nIt was then on 4 August 1566 that Sir Martin died, and on 19 August he was buried, as the St Mary Woolnoth church register records earthily, \"...in the vault in the highe quere, and the mouthe of the vault is a foote within the ende of the Marble stone or tombe straighte downe closed up with bricke, and the bricke to be broken down with a pickaxe before you can see the coffyn.\" [120]\n\n\nHeraldry\nEdward Hasted gave the following blazon for Sir Martin Bowes: \n\n\nPortraits\nA portrait is said to have been painted by William Faithorne (1616-1691), and presented by him to the Goldsmiths' Company [128]\n\n\nFamily\nMartin Bowes made three marriages:\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Martin Bowes**\n\nMartin Bowes was a prominent figure in the civic life of London during the 16th century. Born into a family well-established in the city, Bowes went on to become a successful merchant, goldsmith, and civic leader. His life and career were marked by significant events, including his involvement in the Royal Mint, his role as Lord Mayor of London, and his contributions to the establishment of charitable institutions.\n\n**Origins**\n\nMartin Bowes was born into a family well-established in the civic life of York in earlier generations. His family had a long history of involvement in the city's governance and commerce. The Bowes family home, the old timbered house in Peaseholme Green, was a notable landmark in the city.\n\n**In Henry's Time**\n\nIn 1526, Martin Bowes was appointed deputy at the Royal Mint by Amadas, who became one of the three or four master-workers at the Mint. Along with other master-workers, Bowes was entitled to equal shares of the Mint's profit. However, this arrangement caused friction between the master-workers and their superior, who claimed to have been denied his fair share. The official allowances paid to the master-workers were considerably lower than they had formerly been during the Yorkist period.\n\n**Civic Opportunities**\n\nBowes was advancing in civic affairs, progressing through two Warden-ships of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1532-33 and 1534-36. In 1536, he was chosen an alderman for the Aldgate ward and served as auditor. Accepting this role, his petition was granted that he should not be called upon to serve as Sheriff for three years to come. As alderman, Bowes had a special importance within the Company of Goldsmiths and served his first term as Prime Warden in 1537-38.\n\n**Wives and Lands**\n\nBowes's first wife, Cicely, died leaving him with two, perhaps three sons. He remarried by 1538 to Anne Barrett of Aveley (Essex), upon whom he sired several more children through the 1540s. However, in 1541, he lost a daughter Elizabeth, and in 1543, he lost his ward Elizabeth Strong, a gentlewoman.\n\n**Shrievalty, 1540-1541**\n\nIn 1540, Bowes was appointed Sheriff together with the eminent citizen and Grocer William Laxton, in the mayoralty of Sir William Roche. This was a big year for executions, and Bowes and Laxton attended Lord Dacre of the South at the Tower of London on 29 July 1541 and accompanied him on foot to Tyburn where he was to be hanged.\n\n**Coinage Debasement and Reforms**\n\nUnder Henry VIII, the Crown did little more than making the ends meet, leaving the master-workers to manage their own work. Investigations leading to reorganization of the Mint in 1544 showed that Bowes and Ralph Rowlett were responsible for systematic unauthorized debasement of silver supplied by the Crown. Thousands of pounds in \"surplus\" coinage remained unaccounted for. However, Bowes survived the scrutiny, and official indentures from 1542/43 forwards directed to Bowes and his officers specified the required degrees of adulteration of the metal.\n\n**Mayoralty, 1545-1546**\n\nSir William Laxton having served as Lord Mayor of London for 1544-1545, Bowes succeeded him, transferring at the same time to the Langbourn ward. The election on St Edward's Day (13 October) 1545 was the occasion when the new gold mayoral Livery collar presented to the city by the late Sir John Alleyn was worn for the first time by Laxton as outgoing mayor.\n\n**Proclamation of Peace**\n\nOn 13 June, a solemn peace was proclaimed in the city for the Treaty of Ardres, involving a great ceremony in St Paul's in which the Mayor was prominent, with full representation of the Crafts, and a heraldic and ecclesiastic procession into Cheap to the Cornhill and to Leadenhall corner, and so back to St Paul's.\n\n**Midsummer Watch**\n\nThe Court of Aldermen permanently set aside the Midsummer Watch procession, but Bowes performed it at his own expense on Midsummer Eve, riding to St Peter's with a hundred constables with cresset lights and bearers going before him, all his servants and officers in cassocks and jerkins of yellow satin.\n\n**Anne Askew**\n\nOn 18 June 1546, the Protestant gentlewoman Anne Askew was brought once more to the Guildhall of London to be arraigned for heresy, before a daunting board of ecclesiastical and secular justices led by Bowes. Askew had been acquitted on a similar charge in the previous year, but had now resumed her offence by perfecting herself in faith.\n\n**Welfare**\n\nAs Lord Mayor, Martin Bowes had imposed a tax of two fifteenths on the inhabitants of London to bring a supply of fresh water from Hackney, and an improved supply was brought from Finsbury by the end of his term. He sought to arrange with the King for the purchase of St Bartholomew's Hospital in Smithfield and the former London Greyfriars for the purpose of rebuilding the former in its continuing role as Hospital, and founding Christ's Hospital on the site of the latter.\n\n**Edwardian and Marian Dignitary**\n\nBowes kept his cloak for the ward of Langbourn for another twenty years, until his death. As Edward VI took the throne, Bowes was chosen one of the four MPs to represent London in the parliament of 1547-1552, and was returned again for its successor parliament in March 1553.\n\n**Iconoclasm**\n\nBowes made his own distinct contribution to the iconoclasm, or dismantling of superstitious uses then enacted. Appointed a commissioner for chantries in London, Westminster, and Middlesex in 1546, Bowes was instructed by the Goldsmiths to break up the company's image of its patron, St Dunstan, and to sell it for the best profit.\n\n**Hospital Foundation**\n\nBowes was appointed Treasurer of St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1547, in seeking to fund his hospital projects, he had the tombs of the Greyfriars utterly ransacked for their stone slabs and brass plates. Sir Martin Bowes and Sir Andrew Judd headed a great meeting of hospital governors in October 1552 at Christ's Hospital.\n\n**Charitable Bequests**\n\nBowes appointed two trustees during the 1550s, both members of the Goldsmiths' Company, to manage various bequests which he intended should be administered by the company after his own death. Both, however, predeceased him, leaving wills containing instructions for the performance of the trusts which Bowes had reposed in them.\n\n**The Bowes Almshouses, Woolwich**\n\nOn 28 September 1560, Bowes made a deed of feoffment to 24 trustees granting them his five messuages with gardens in Woolwich for the occupation of five poor parishioners of Woolwich aged over 50, for term of their lives without charge, or (in default) to five poor members of the Goldsmiths' Company.\n\n**Death and Burial**\n\nBowes made a will in September 1562, which carries a codicil dated 29 July 1565, and was enrolled in the Court of Husting in 1595. The will contains various bequests of his properties and estates to his children and grandchildren. It was then on 4 August 1566 that Sir Martin died, and on 19 August he was buried in the vault in the high quire of St Mary Woolnoth church.\n\n**Heraldry**\n\nEdward Hasted gave the following blazon for Sir Martin Bowes: \"Azure, a bend or between six cross crosslets fitchée argent.\"\n\n**Portraits**\n\nA portrait is said to have been painted by William Faithorne and presented by him to the Goldsmiths' Company.\n\n**Family**\n\nMartin Bowes made three marriages:\n\n1.

in 1443 a younger William Bowes was also mayor [5] Reputedly, Martin was born in the old timbered house, the Bowes family home in Peaseholme Green, at the sign of the Black Swan [6]\n\n\nIn Henry's time\nIn 1526 (by which year Bowes had already embarked upon his first marriage, to Cecily Eliott) Amadas appointed Bowes his deputy at the Royal Mint, of which he became one of the three or four master-workers These men, together with the Treasurer William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy, were entitled to equal shares of the Mint's profit The arrangement caused friction between the master-workers and their superior, who claimed to have been denied his fair share [11] The official allowances paid to the master-workers were considerably lower than they had formerly been, during the Yorkist period, and the managers made up for this by \"seizing every opportunity to make the Mint pay\" [12] In 1530 Lord Mountjoy attempted to hold the two Deputy Masters, Robert Amadas and Ralph Rowlett (died 1543), to account, [13] but they brought counter-claims at law: by 1533, Amadas having died (buried in St Mary Woolnoth), [14] Mountjoy had resigned his patent and Bowes and Rowlett became joint Masters of the Mint [3] [15] [16]\n\n\nThe London mint\nIn 1526 (by which year Bowes had already embarked upon his first marriage, to Cecily Eliott) Amadas appointed Bowes his deputy at the Royal Mint, of which he became one of the three or four master-workers These men, together with the Treasurer William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy, were entitled to equal shares of the Mint's profit The arrangement caused friction between the master-workers and their superior, who claimed to have been denied his fair share [11] The official allowances paid to the master-workers were considerably lower than they had formerly been, during the Yorkist period, and the managers made up for this by \"seizing every opportunity to make the Mint pay\" [12] In 1530 Lord Mountjoy attempted to hold the two Deputy Masters, Robert Amadas and Ralph Rowlett (died 1543), to account, [13] but they brought counter-claims at law: by 1533, Amadas having died (buried in St Mary Woolnoth), [14] Mountjoy had resigned his patent and Bowes and Rowlett became joint Masters of the Mint [3] [15] [16]\n\n\nCivic opportunities\nBowes was, meanwhile, advancing in civic affairs, progressing through two Warden-ships of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1532-33 and 1534–36, and in 1536, having served as auditor, was chosen an alderman for the Aldgate ward [17] Accepting this, his petition was granted that he should not be called upon to serve as Sheriff for three years to come  His status as alderman gave him a special importance within the Company of Goldsmiths, and he served his first term as Prime Warden (a role which he resumed under Edward, Mary and Elizabeth) in 1537–38 He had built, and now occupied, that distinguished residence mentioned by John Stow in Lombard Street, near the parish church of St Mary Woolnoth, among the \"diverse faire houses, namely one with a verie faire forefront towards the streete, builded by Sir Martin Bowes, Goldsmith.\" The back gate opened towards the conduit in Cornhill [18] In 1539/40 the advowson of this church, which had belonged to the Priory and convent of St Helen (Bishopsgate), [19] was granted to him, and later remained to his descendants [20] [21]\n\n\nWives and lands\nHis first wife Cicely having died leaving him with two, perhaps three sons, she was buried at St Mary Woolnoth: Bowes remarried by 1538 to Anne Barrett of Aveley (Essex), upon whom he sired several more children through the 1540s, including Joan (1541), Francis (1542), William (1543/44), another Francis (1545), Charity (1548) and Henry (1550) [22] However, in 1541 he lost a daughter Elizabeth, and in 1543 he lost his ward Elizabeth Strong, a gentlewoman; one Francis was buried on the day of the second Francis' baptism [23]\n\n\nShrievalty, 1540-1541\nIn 1540, transferring to the Castle Baynard ward, [17] he was appointed Sheriff together with the eminent citizen and Grocer William Laxton, in the mayoralty of Sir William Roche [28] It was a big year for executions (an important part of a sheriff's work): although the beheading of Thomas Cromwell and the royal marriage to Katherine Howard had already occurred before these sheriffs took office at Michaelmas, it is particularly recorded that Bowes and Laxton as Sheriffs attended Lord Dacre of the South at the Tower of London on 29 July 1541 and accompanied him on foot to Tyburn where he was to be hanged [29] As the summer of 1541 approached, the executions of the Countess of Salisbury and of Lord Leonard Gray took place at the Tower [30] During the course of that year Bowes received knighthood [31]\n\n\nCoinage debasement and reforms\nWhereas Henry VII had maintained close control over the Mints, under Henry VIII the Crown \"did little more than making the ends meet\", [36] leaving the master-workers to manage their own work Investigations leading to reorganization of the Mint in 1544 showed that Bowes and Ralph Rowlett (died 1543) [37] were responsible for systematic unauthorized debasement of silver supplied by the Crown Thousands of pounds in \"surplus\" coinage remained unaccounted for; [12] but Bowes survived the scrutiny Official indentures from 1542/43 forwards, directed to Bowes and his officers, specified the required degrees of adulteration of the metal [38] The debasement of French coinage had resulted in large quantities of finer English currency being exported, so by this method the price of English gold and silver was raised [39]\n\n\nMayoralty, 1545-1546\nSir William Laxton having served as Lord Mayor of London for 1544–1545, Bowes succeeded him, transferring at the same time to the Langbourn ward: [17] the election on St Edward's Day (13 October) 1545 was the occasion when the new gold mayoral Livery collar presented to the city by the late Sir John Alleyn was worn, for the first time, by Laxton as outgoing mayor [49]  The month of June 1546 was a particularly busy one Bowes, fearing food shortages in the city, had a large quantity of corn imported from overseas, which arrived in London in that month At the same time the king required the city to take in 20,000 quarters of barley and rye which he had laid in against his foreign wars, and Bowes was obliged to raise a great sum of money to pay for it, and to commandeer every mill within seven miles of the city for the grinding thereof [50]\n\n\nProclamation of peace\nHowever, on 13 June a solemn peace was proclaimed in the city for the Treaty of Ardres, involving a great ceremony in St Paul's in which the Mayor was prominent, with full representation of the Crafts, and a heraldic and ecclesiastic procession into Cheap to the Cornhill and to Leadenhall corner, and so back to St Paul's (It was the last great show of the rich crosses and copes in London, for they were soon afterwards called into the King's Wardrobe.) Fires were lit in the street, banquets held, and hogsheads of wine and beer with spicebread were set out before the Lord Mayor's gate for passers-by to enjoy The next day was a sumptuous feast at the Lord Mayor's place, where Oudard du Biez  [fr], Marshal of France and captain of the fortress at Boulogne, and other French Captains, were the guests On that occasion, while \"at waffers and ipocras\", Bowes (to illustrate his authority) chose alderman Richard Jerveys [52] to be sheriff for the next year, and drank the health of one of the current sheriffs who was present with his wife: which much impressed the French Captain [53]\n\n\nMidsummer Watch\nThe Court of Aldermen permanently set aside the Midsummer Watch procession, but Sir Martin Bowes performed it at his own expense on Midsummer Eve, riding to St Peter's with a hundred constables with cresset lights and bearers going before him, all his servants and officers in cassocks and jerkins of yellow satin, three squires in yellow damask, the sword-bearer riding in a cassock of yellow velvet: the mayor's footmen in doublets of yellow velvet embroidered with his arms on the breast and back, the two sheriffs and their officers following, and lastly forty more constables with their lights: \"which was a proper sight\" [54] The Sheriffs were George Barne and Ralph Alleyn [28] The Goldsmiths were put to some expense during the mayoralty as it was necessary for Bowes to be accompanied by his sheriffs and other officers at corporate events, such that in 1547 they stipulated that these additional payments should not be taken as a precedent except when a member of the company should be Mayor [55]\n\n\nAnne Askew\nOn 18 June 1546 the Protestant gentlewoman Anne Askew was brought once more to the Guildhall of London to be arraigned for heresy, before a daunting board of ecclesiastical and secular justices led by Sir Martin Bowes She had been acquitted, after a period of imprisonment during which she was questioned by Laxton, on a similar charge in the previous year, but had now resumed her offence by perfecting herself in faith She was taken to the Tower on 19 June, and her inquisition and torture followed, ending in her burning for heresy at West Smithfield on 17 July [56] This was the notorious occasion of her interrogation under torture on the rack, not only in the presence of Chancellor Wriothesley and Richard Rich, but actually at their own hands Her denial of the Real Presence, her refusal to believe that God was in the piece of bread which they called the Sacrament, left her condemnation inevitable under the prevailing system of law [57] The secular authorities had responsibility for pronouncing the condemnation and carrying out the sentence [58]\n\n\nWelfare\nAs Lord Mayor, Martin Bowes had imposed a tax of two fifteenths on the inhabitants of London to bring a supply of fresh water from Hackney, and an improved supply was brought from Finsbury by the end of his term [59] [60] He sought to arrange with the King for the purchase of St Bartholomew's Hospital in Smithfield, and the former London Greyfriars, for the purpose of rebuilding the former in its continuing role as Hospital, and founding Christ's Hospital on the site of the latter [3] He was succeeded as Mayor by Henry Huberthorn at Michaelmas 1546 The grant to the Mayor and citizens of these two sites and of the Hospital of Bedlam was agreed on 27 December 1546 [61] and issued on 13 January following, [62] the reform of the Court of Augmentations and of the Court of General Surveyors of the King's Lands (\"in which there has been great disorder\") having intervened on 1 January 1546/47 [63]\n\n\nEdwardian and Marian dignitary\nBowes kept his cloak for the ward of Langbourn for another twenty years, until his death [17] As Edward VI took the throne, Bowes was chosen one of the four MPs to represent London in the parliament of 1547–1552, and was returned again for its successor parliament in March 1553 [3]\n\n\nIconoclasm\nBowes made his own distinct contribution to the iconoclasm, or dismantling of superstitious uses then enacted Appointed a commissioner for chantries in London, Westminster and Middlesex in 1546, [3] in October 1547 at an assembly of the Goldsmiths he was instructed by them to break up the company's image of its patron, St Dunstan, and to sell it for the best profit, and also to have the company's standing cup (with an image of St Dunstan on its lid) broken up and converted into some other piece of plate [64] A Chantry Certificate for St Mary Woolnoth for 1 January 1547/48 declares a rent charge of £13.13s.04d (for the maintenance of a priest) going out of \"a capital messuage in Lumbard Street wherein Sir Marten Bowes, Knight, inhabiteth.\" Bowes made his first presentation to St Mary Woolnoth in April 1549 in Humfry Edwards, M.A (of the University of Oxford), who was installed by Bishop Bonner [65] [20]\n\n\nHospital foundation\nAppointed Treasurer of St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1547, in seeking to fund his hospital projects he had the tombs of the Greyfriars utterly ransacked for their stone slabs and brass plates [3] Sir Martin Bowes and Sir Andrew Judd headed a great meeting of hospital governors in October 1552 at Christ's Hospital: [68] he also headed a deputation, accompanied by Bishop Ridley, to petition the king for the use of the Bridewell Palace to provide shelter for vagrants and mendicants, against whom severe prohibitions had been proclaimed in the king's first year [69] King Edward VI's Foundation Charter of the hospitals of Christ, Bridewell and St Thomas was issued on 26 June 1553 [70]\n\n\nA civic funeral\nLate in 1553, when the succession had been decided in favour of Queen Mary, and Sir George Barne's mayoralty was drawing to a close, Dame Anne Bowes died and was accorded a full heraldic funeral on 22 October, described by Henry Machyn The house, the street and the church of St Mary Woolnoth [73] were hung with black cloth decorated with armorial bearings The Heralds accompanied 100 men and women in gowns in the procession: great gilt candlesticks, tapers and branch-lights were borne along, with the company of priests and the singing clerks, leading the corpse with four pennons of arms around her and 12 servants bearing torches The chief mourners followed, and after them the Lord Mayor with his swordbearer, Sir Henry Huberthorn and Sir Rowland Hill, many other mourners, and lastly the Craft of the Goldsmiths Having sung the dirige in the evening, on the morrow was the mass, the sermon, and the dinner [74]\n\n\nStatus and acquiescence\nBowes did not sit in the winter parliament of 1553, but he was returned again for London in April 1554 and again in November of that year [3] Dame Anne leaving him with several children, in 1554 he remarried to Elizabeth Harlow, widow of the assay-master at the Tower and Southwark mints William Billingsley, citizen and Haberdasher, who had died in 1553 [75] Elizabeth had sons including Henry Billingsley, the third son (then studying in Cambridge), who later translated the works of Euclid and became Lord Mayor of London [76] There was at least one son, William Bowes, from her marriage to Sir Martin, and he was baptized on 8 December 1556 [77] From 1553 Bowes entered upon his longest term as Upper Warden of the Goldmiths, holding for consecutive years through to 1557, and then intermitting only for one year During this term he continued also as a Member of Parliament for London in Mary's time, sitting in the parliaments of November 1554 and of October–December 1555 [3]\n\n\nHospitals 1557\nAt a General Court held at Christ's Hospital on 27 September 1557, in the mayoralty of Sir Thomas Offley and under the authority of the Mayor, commonalty and citizens of the City of London, the governors of St Bartholomew's, Christ's, the Bridewell and St Thomas's Hospitals agreed that the Hospital of St Bartholomew should be united with the others; that for the government of these hospitals Sir Martin Bowes should be Controller General and Sir Andrew Judd Surveyor General; and that three aldermen, a treasurer and eight other citizens named in their agreement were to be governors for each of the individual hospitals [85] [86] On the next day the Ordinances and Rules for the governance of the hospitals, which had been devised by Sir Martin Bowes and Sir Rowland Hill assisted by various other city leaders, were read before the court, entered into record, and ordered to be put into execution [87] The arrangements so continued down to 1564, when on 21 September (St Matthew's Day) a President, Treasurer and other governors were chosen at Christ's Hospital for each of the hospitals, after which elections were kept annually [85] [17]\n\n\nElizabethan\nIn 1558 Martin Bowes embarked on his final, four-year term of service as Upper Warden of the Goldsmiths' Company [4] He did not sit in the parliament of 1558, but following its automatic dissolution in the second session on 17 November 1558, owing to Queen Mary's death, on 6 December following he was summoned to the first parliament of Queen Elizabeth's reign, which sat from 23 January to 8 May 1559 In its aim to re-establish a Protestant religious statehood, the new Act of Supremacy 1558 and Act of Uniformity 1558 were passed (those of Henry VIII having been repealed by Queen Mary), which became the foundation of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement [88] This was Bowes's last parliamentary term.\n\n\nSt Mary Woolnoth\nIn the meantime his newly presented rector for St Mary Woolnoth had died, and on 30 November 1558 his replacement, Miles Gerard, was installed by Edmund Bonner (who hung on as Bishop of London until 1560) [20] Little time was lost in removing the roodloft (and presumably the recently repainted and gilded figures), the timber of which was delivered in 1560, at Bowes's order, to the governors of the Bridewell and Bethlehem Hospitals, which had been brought under united administration in 1557 The brass candlesticks and the Latin service-books were sold, with the approval of the congregation, a table of the Ten Commandments was set up, and in May 1562, at Bowes's bidding, the old leaden organ pipes were sold off, 102 lbs weight at twopence the pound This however was not wholesale destruction, but rather a renovation of the existing organ In April 1561 the child choristers of St Paul's were brought in to assist the church choir at the marriage of Lady Bowes's daughter Cicely Billingsley [89] Cicely's sister Elizabeth Billingsley had died in late February 1560/61 [90]\n\n\nThe Bowes Cup, and other gifts\nIt is as a civic figure, the continuing alderman for Langbourn ward, Comptroller-General of the Hospitals, and Upper Warden of the Goldsmiths's Company, that Bowes features most prominently in his last years In 1559 the Queen addressed a Proclamation to the Company concerning its apparel, reforms and other matters, which Bowes was particular in advising them to weigh most carefully [92] In the following year, it was agreed that the Wardens of the company should be chosen on the feast day of St Dunstan by the use of garlands, to which end Alderman Bowes had given them four fair garlands of crimson velvet, garnished with silver and gold and set with pearls and stones At the same time he gave them \"a fair silver gilt standing cup of 80 ounces, with beryl in the body and the cover, with a mannekin on the cover holding an escutcheon bearing Bowes's arms in an annealed  [enamelled] plate of gold\" [93]\n\n\nCivic matters\nElizabeth's coinage reforms of 1561 were supervised (under Sir Edmund Peckham, High Treasurer of the Mint) by her Comptroller (1559) and Under-Treasurer (from 1561), the Goldsmith Thomas Stanley, who as Assay Master had advised on standards in 1551 as the debasement was halted [99] Elizabeth was suspicious of her advisers, including her coinage commissioners the Marquess of Winchester and Sir Richard Sackville, while Secretary Cecil and Sir Thomas Parry (Comptroller of the Household) advised Sir William Hewett, stamping existing currency with marks of standard, and Thomas Lodge in managing the Easterling moneyers [100] [101]\n\n\nCharitable bequests\nIt appears that Bowes appointed two trustees during the 1550s, both members of the Goldsmiths' Company, to manage various bequests which he intended should be administered by the company after his own death Both, however, predeceased him, leaving wills containing instructions for the performance of the trusts which Bowes had reposed in them [106]\n\n\nSouthwood: The \"Remembrance\"\nThe first of these was William Southwood, whose will dated 23 October 1557 [107] was proved in 1560 [108] Through him, Bowes had left messuages, lands and tenements in Scalding Alley (in St Mildred in the Poultry) worth £16.13s.04d per annum, and rents from tenements in St Matthew's Alley, Westcheap (St Matthew Friday Street) worth £1.13s.2d to the Goldsmiths' Company This was to provide for a learned preacher to preach an annual sermon in St Mary Woolnoth on or near St Martin's Day (11 November), for what was called \"Sir Martin Bowes's Remembrance\" The preacher was to have 6s.8d; four Wardens of the Company and 12 of the Assistants were to attend, having 1s.4d and 1s each respectively: the clerk and beadle were to have 1s.4d, the clerk was to toll the bell for 8d, and the renters, who had 2s each, were to arrange a dinner costing £3 The churchwardens were given 9s year for a potation (a \"drynkyng\") [106]\n\n\nMundie: the Langbourne fifteenths\nThe will of Roger Mundie, dated 12 August 1562, [110] also a grantee in trust for Sir Martin Bowes, gave to the Wardens and commonalty of the Goldsmiths a great messuage or tenement, with stables, courts, gardens and hereditaments, in St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, together with 22 gardens and a small tenement and garden in the same parish, of annual rent value of £13.6s.8d In the ward of Langbourne, charges of fifteenths periodically granted by parliament to the Crown were at the rate of £20.10s, which was a great burden to the poor, and this bequest was to defray that sum for any future such charges to Langbourn ward rising after Sir Martin's death For receiving these rents the two Company renters were to be given 3s.4d yearly, and any surplus was to be divided between the poor of the Goldsmiths and the maintenance of the Company Hall By a codicil dated 10 October 1562, in respect of Bowes's feoffment to him of the same day, two further messuages or tenements in St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate were added to the same uses [106] Roger Mundie's will was proved on 6 November 1562 [111]\n\n\nThe Bowes almshouses, Woolwich\nOn 28 September 1560 Bowes made a deed of feoffment to 24 trustees granting them his five messuages with gardens in Woolwich for the occupation of five poor parishioners of Woolwich aged over 50, for term of their lives without charge, or (in default) to five poor members of the Goldsmiths' Company [106] The houses were to be placed under the management of the Goldsmiths' Company, and in Bowes's will of 1562, [112] giving lands and tenements to the company for various charitable uses, he specified that each of the occupants should receive an annual pension of £1.10s.05d, and that on the occasion of the annual inspection by the company a sermon should be preached at Woolwich parish church [113] His feoffment of the almshouses to the company was made on 20 September 1565 [4] The houses (which no longer exist) were always occupied by widowed almswomen.\n\n\nDeath and burial\nBowes made a will in September 1562 which carries a codicil dated 29 July 1565, and was enrolled in the Court of Husting in 1595 The will contains various bequests of his properties and estates to his children and grandchildren [112]\n\n\nWills\nBowes made a will in September 1562 which carries a codicil dated 29 July 1565, and was enrolled in the Court of Husting in 1595 The will contains various bequests of his properties and estates to his children and grandchildren [112]\n\n\nSepulture\nIt was then on 4 August 1566 that Sir Martin died, and on 19 August he was buried, as the St Mary Woolnoth church register records earthily, \"...in the vault in the highe quere, and the mouthe of the vault is a foote within the ende of the Marble stone or tombe straighte downe closed up with bricke, and the bricke to be broken down with a pickaxe before you

Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. It is the fourth film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the 24th in the overall Bond film series. The film stars Daniel Craig as the titular character, with Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, Rory Kinnear, and Christoph Waltz also starring in the film.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe film begins with a posthumous message from the previous M, who leads MI6 agent James Bond to carry out a mission in Mexico City. During the mission, Bond foils a bombing attempt on a stadium during the Day of the Dead festival. After obtaining a ring, stylised with an octopus, from deceased attacker Marco Sciarra, Bond uncovers his connection to a secret organisation.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe main cast was revealed in December 2014 at the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios. Daniel Craig returned for his fourth appearance as James Bond, while Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, and Ben Whishaw reprised their roles as M, Eve Moneypenny, and Q respectively, having been established in Skyfall. Rory Kinnear also reprised his role as Bill Tanner in his third appearance in the series.\n\n## Production\n\nIn March 2013, Sam Mendes said he would not return to direct the next film in the series, then known as Bond 24. However, he later recanted and announced that he would return, as he found the script and the plans for the long-term future of the franchise appealing. Nicolas Winding Refn would later reveal that he turned down an offer to direct the film.\n\n## Pre-production\n\nThe writing process for Spectre involved many scriptwriters from the previous Bond films, including John Logan, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade. British playwright Jez Butterworth was brought in to polish the script, being helped by Mendes and Craig. Butterworth considered that his changes involved adding what he would like to see as a teenager, and limited the scenes with Bond talking to men, as \"Bond shoots other men—he doesn't sit around chatting to them.\"\n\n## Writing\n\nSpectre marked the return of many scriptwriters from the previous Bond films, such as Skyfall writer John Logan. Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who had done work in five previous Bond films, were also involved in the writing process. British playwright Jez Butterworth was brought in to polish the script, being helped by Mendes and Craig.\n\n## Filming\n\nMendes revealed that production would begin on 8 December 2014 at Pinewood Studios, with filming taking seven months. Mendes also confirmed several filming locations, including London, Mexico City, and Rome. Van Hoytema shot the film mostly on Kodak 35mm film stock (in addition to digital cameras such as the 6K Arri Alexa 65mm), in contrast to Skyfall being filmed solely on digital cameras.\n\n## Soundtrack\n\nThomas Newman returned as Spectre's composer. Rather than composing the score once the film had moved into post-production, Newman worked during filming. The theatrical trailer released in July 2015 contained a rendition of John Barry's On Her Majesty's Secret Service theme. Mendes stated that the final film would have more than 100 minutes of music.\n\n## Marketing\n\nDuring the December 2014 press conference announcing the start of filming, Aston Martin and Eon unveiled the new DB10 as the official car for the film. The DB10 was designed in collaboration between Aston Martin and the filmmakers, with only 10 being produced especially for Spectre as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the company's association with the franchise.\n\n## Release\n\nSpectre had its world premiere at the Royal Film Performance, an event in aid of the Film & TV Charity, in London on 26 October 2015 at the Royal Albert Hall, the same day as its general release in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. It was released in the United States on 6 November. Paramount Pictures brought forward the release of Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation to avoid competing with Spectre.\n\n## Home media\n\nSpectre was released for Digital HD on 22 January 2016 and on DVD and Blu-ray on 9 and 22 February 2016 in the US and UK respectively. It debuted atop the home video charts in both countries, and finished 2016 with 1.5 million units in the UK, the second best-selling title of the year, behind only Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and 2 million copies in the US, 12th in the year-end charts.\n\n## Reception\n\nSpectre grossed $880.7 million worldwide; $135.5 million of the takings were generated from the UK market and $200.1 million from North America.

Its critical consensus reads, \"Spectre nudges Daniel Craig's rebooted Bond closer to the glorious, action-driven spectacle of earlier entries, although it's admittedly reliant on established 007 formula.\" Metacritic assigned Spectre a score of 60 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n## Accolades\n\nSpectre received several award nominations, including four Academy Award nominations for Best Production Design, Best Original Song, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing.\n\n## Notes\n\nSpectre was the final film in the Daniel Craig's James Bond series, as he announced his departure from the role in 2016.\n\n## External links\n\n* Spectre (2015 film) on IMDb\n* Spectre (2015 film) at Rotten Tomatoes\n* Spectre (2015 film) at Metacritic", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Spectre_(2015_film)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nA posthumous message from the previous M leads MI6 agent James Bond to carry out a mission in Mexico City, foiling a bombing attempt on a stadium during the Day of the Dead festival Bond obtains a ring, stylised with an octopus, from deceased attacker Marco Sciarra and uncovers his connection to a secret organisation.\n\n\nCast\nIn March 2013, Mendes said he would not return to direct the next film in the series, then known as Bond 24;

At the time, she wasn't aware that what they were experiencing was the climate crisis because climate education is non-existent where she's from. This personal experience sparked her interest in climate activism, and she began to learn more about the issue and how it affects people in her community and around the world.\n\nDisha's work as a climate activist has focused on supporting farmers in India, who are struggling to cope with the impacts of climate change. She has been involved in various initiatives, including the creation of toolkits that provide information and resources to citizens who want to support the farmers' movement.\n\n**Arrest**\n\nOn February 13, 2021, Disha Ravi was arrested by the Indian police in connection with a toolkit created by a group of activists, including herself, to support the farmers' protest against the Indian government's agricultural policies. The toolkit, which was posted online, provided information and resources to citizens who wanted to support the farmers' movement.\n\nThe arrest was widely condemned by many in India and abroad, who saw it as an attempt to silence a young climate activist and undermine the farmers' movement.

the perfect choice.\"\n\n\nFilming\nIn October 2008, Marvel Studios signed a long-term lease agreement with Raleigh Studios to photograph their next four films—Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers—at Raleigh's Manhattan Beach, California facility [97] Production Weekly reported that filming on Marvel's Thor was scheduled to begin in Los Angeles mid-January, then move to Santa Fe, New Mexico from March until late-April [98] Principal photography began on January 11, 2010 [99] A few days after filming began, Clark Gregg signed on to reprise his role from Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as Agent Coulson [28] In February, Paramount Pictures entered negotiations with Del Mar, California to use a 300-yard stretch of beach to film a scene for Thor involving six horses running down the terrain Paramount said this coastline was ideal because its gradual slope of sand down to the waterline creates excellent reflective opportunities on film [100] On March 15, 2010, production of Thor moved to Galisteo, New Mexico where Cerro Pelon Ranch, [101] an old-fashioned Western film town, was extensively modified for the shoot [102] [103]\n\n\nPost-production\nIn October 2010, casting calls revealed the film would be undergoing an undisclosed number of reshoots [108] In March 2011, scenes involving Adriana Barraza were removed from the theatrical cut of the film during the editing process Branagh sent a letter of apology explaining the reasons for the cut and desire to work with Barraza again in the future In response Barraza stated, \"It saddens me because the movie is great and because I was acting alongside some tremendous actors that I admire very much, but I understand the nature of films, and it's not the first or last time that scenes will be cut\" [109] Barraza appears in only one scene in the film's theatrical cut In that same month, Douglas Tait revealed that he performed for motion capture of the Frost Giants [110] On his hiring, Tait said \"I am 6'5\" and have a lean, athletic build, and they hired guys who were 6'7\" and taller, and weighed over 250 pounds (110 kg) When the film was being edited, they wanted to make them even bigger and move faster They auditioned people again and Kenneth Branagh chose me to perform the motion capture movements of the Frost Giants\" [110] In April 2011, the IMAX Corporation, Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment announced that they have finalized an agreement to release the film in IMAX 3D, continuing the partnership which began on Iron Man 2 [111] Branagh stated that the 3-D process initially made him cringe but said \"We came to feel that in our case 3-D could be the very good friend of story and character for a different kind of experience\" Although the film was shot in 2D, Feige stated that the \"special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3D\" [112] The post-credits scene that sees Nick Fury approach Erik Selvig to ask him to study the Tesseract, was directed by The Avengers's director, Joss Whedon [113]\n\n\nMusic\nThe film's score was written by composer Patrick Doyle, a frequent collaborator of Branagh Doyle described Thor as \"the most commercially high profile film I have done since Frankenstein\", [119] adding that the composing process had the challenge of trying to find a tone that fit the duality of Asgard and Earth Thus Doyle and Branagh had frequent discussions on the musical direction, [120] with the director suggesting a contemporary feel and having a balance between the music and \"grand images  [that] were not in any way hyperbolized\", and the composer in turn implementing \"a strong sense of melody, which he responds to in my work\" As Doyle declared that his own Celtic background made him familiar with Norse mythology, an old Celtic folk song also provided the inspiration for Thor's leitmotif [119] A soundtrack album was released by Buena Vista Records in April 2011 [121]\n\n\nMarketing\nIn July 2010, Marvel Studios held a Thor panel at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con during which Kenneth Branagh, Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg discussed the film and showed some clips from it [17] A few days later, this footage was leaked on the internet [123] The first television advertisement was broadcast during Super Bowl XLV on the Fox network in the United States The rate for advertising during the game was approximately $3 million per 30-second spot [124] Marvel Studios and Acura launched a joint viral marketing promotion at the 2011 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo [125] Other official promotional partners included Burger King, Dr Pepper, 7 Eleven, and Visa [126] In May 2011 Marvel Entertainment's

{"title": "Afghanistan", "content": "\nEtymology\nSome scholars suggest that the root name Afghān is derived from the Sanskrit word Aśvakan, which was the name used for ancient inhabitants of the Hindu Kush [40] Aśvakan literally means \"horsemen\", \"horse breeders\", or \"cavalrymen\" (from aśva, the Sanskrit and Avestan words for \"horse\") [41]\n\n\nHistory\nExcavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world An important site of early historical activities, many believe that Afghanistan compares to Egypt in the historical value of its archaeological sites [46] [47] Artifacts typical of the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron Ages have been found in Afghanistan Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of Mundigak (near Kandahar in the south of the country) was a center of the Helmand culture More recent findings established that the Indus Valley Civilization stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan An Indus Valley site has been found on the Oxus River at Shortugai in northern Afghanistan [48] [49] [50]\n\n\nPrehistory and antiquity\nExcavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago,

to Herat and Zaranj in 642 CE and began spreading eastward; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted Before the arrival of Islam, the region used to be home to various beliefs and cults, often resulting in Syncretism between the dominant religions [63] [64] such as Zoroastrianism, [53] [54] [55] Buddhism or Greco-Buddhism, Ancient Iranian religions, [65] Hinduism, Christianity, [66] [67] and Judaism [68] [69] An exemplification of the syncretism in the region would be that people were patrons of Buddhism but still worshipped local Iranian gods such as Ahura Mazda, Lady Nana, Anahita or Mihr (Mithra) and portrayed Greek gods as protectors of Buddha [70] [65] [71] The Zunbils and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in 870 CE by the Saffarid Muslims of Zaranj Later, the Samanids extended their Islamic influence south of the Hindu Kush The Ghaznavids rose to power in the 10th century [72] [73] [74]\n\n\nHotak dynasty\nIn 1709, Mirwais Hotak, a local Ghilzai tribal leader, successfully rebelled against the Safavids He defeated Gurgin Khan, the Georgian governor of Kandahar under the Safavids, and established his own kingdom [91] Mirwais died in 1715, and was succeeded by his brother Abdul Aziz, who was soon killed by Mirwais's son Mahmud for possibly planning to sign a peace with the Safavids Mahmud led the Afghan army in 1722 to the Persian capital of Isfahan, and captured the city after the Battle of Gulnabad and proclaimed himself King of Persia [91] The Afghan dynasty was ousted from Persia by Nader Shah after the 1729 Battle of Damghan.\n\n\nDurrani Empire\nAfter the death of Nader Shah in 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani had returned to Kandahar with a contingent of 4,000 Pashtuns The Abdalis had \"unanimously accepted\" Ahmad Shah as their new leader With his ascension in 1747, Ahmad Shah had led multiple campaigns against the Mughal empire, Maratha empire, and then-receding Afsharid empire Ahmad Shah had captured Kabul and Peshawar from the Mughal appointed governor, Nasir Khan Ahmad Shah had then conquered Herat in 1750, and had also captured Kashmir in 1752 [94] Ahmad Shah had launched two campaigns into Khorasan, 1750–1751 and 1754–1755 [95] His first campaign had seen the siege of Mashhad, however, he was forced to retreat after four months In November 1750, he moved to siege Nishapur, but he was unable to capture the city and was forced to retreat in early 1751 Ahmad Shah returned in 1754; he captured Tun, and on 23 July, he sieged Mashhad once again Mashhad had fallen on 2 December, but Shahrokh was reappointed in 1755 He was forced to give up Torshiz, Bakharz, Jam, Khaf, and Turbat-e Haidari to the Afghans, as well as accept Afghan sovereignty Following this, Ahmad Shah sieged Nishapur once again, and captured it.\n\n\nBarakzai dynasty and British wars\nBy the early 19th century, the Afghan empire was under threat from the Persians in the west and the Sikh Empire in the east Fateh Khan, leader of the Barakzai tribe, installed many of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire Fateh Khan was brutally murdered in 1818 by Mahmud Shah As a result, the brothers of Fateh Khan and the Barakzai tribe rebelled, and a civil war brewed During this turbulent period, Afghanistan fractured into many states, including the Principality of Qandahar, Emirate of Herat, Khanate of Qunduz, Maimana Khanate, and numerous other warring polities The most prominent state was the Emirate of Kabul, ruled by Dost Mohammad Khan [108] [109]\n\n\nDemocratic Republic and Soviet war\nIn April 1978, the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in a bloody coup d'état against then-President Mohammed Daoud Khan, in what is called the Saur Revolution The PDPA declared the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, with its first leader named as People's Democratic Party General Secretary Nur Muhammad Taraki [132] This would trigger a series of events that would dramatically turn Afghanistan from a poor and secluded (albeit peaceful) country to a hotbed of international terrorism [133] The PDPA initiated various social, symbolic, and land distribution reforms that provoked strong opposition, while also brutally oppressing political dissidents This caused unrest and quickly expanded into a state of civil war by 1979, waged by guerrilla mujahideen (and smaller Maoist guerrillas) against regime forces countrywide It quickly turned into a proxy war as the Pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers, the United States supported them through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), [134] and the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA regime [135] Meanwhile, there was increasingly hostile friction between the competing factions of the PDPA – the dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parcham [136]\n\n\nPost–Cold War conflict\nAnother civil war broke out after the creation of a dysfunctional coalition government between leaders of various mujahideen factions Amid a state of anarchy and factional infighting, [155] [156] [157] various mujahideen factions committed widespread rape, murder and extortion, [156] [158] [159] while Kabul was heavily bombarded and partially destroyed by the fighting [159] Several failed reconciliations and alliances occurred between different leaders [160] The Taliban emerged in September 1994 as a movement and militia of students (talib) from Islamic madrassas (schools) in Pakistan, [159] [161] who soon had military support from Pakistan [162] Taking control of Kandahar city that year, [159] they conquered more territories until finally driving out the government of Rabbani from Kabul in 1996, [163] [164] where they established an emirate [165] The Taliban were condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans, especially women [166] [167] During their rule, the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians, denied UN food supplies to starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth, burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes [168] [169] [170] [171] [172] [173] [excessive citations]\n\n\nUS invasion and Islamic Republic\nIn October 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan to remove the Taliban from power after they refused to hand over Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect of the September 11 attacks, who was a \"guest\" of the Taliban and was operating his al-Qaeda network in Afghanistan [179] [180] [181] The majority of Afghans supported the American invasion [182] [183] During the initial invasion, US and UK forces bombed al-Qaeda training camps, and later working with the Northern Alliance, the Taliban regime came to an end [184]\n\n\nSecond Taliban era\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced on 14 April 2021 that the alliance had agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by 1 May [210] Soon after NATO troops began withdrawing, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government and quickly advanced in front of collapsing Afghan government forces [211] [212] The Taliban captured the capital city of Kabul on 15 August 2021, after regaining control over a vast majority of Afghanistan Several foreign diplomats and Afghan government officials, including president Ashraf Ghani, [213] were evacuated from the country, with many Afghan civilians attempting to flee along with them [214] On 17 August, first vice president Amrullah Saleh proclaimed himself caretaker president and announced the formation of an anti-Taliban front with a reported 6,000+ troops [215] [216] in the Panjshir Valley, along with Ahmad Massoud [217] [218] However, by 6 September, the Taliban had taken control of most of Panjshir province, with resistance fighters retreating to the mountains [219] Clashes in the valley ceased mid-September [220]\n\n\nGeography\nAfghanistan is located in Southern-Central Asia [247] [248] [249] [250] [251] The region centered at Afghanistan is considered the \"crossroads of Asia\", [252] and the country has had the nickname Heart of Asia [253] The renowned Urdu poet Allama Iqbal once wrote about the country:\n\n\nClimate\nAfghanistan has a continental climate with harsh winters in the central highlands, the glaciated northeast (around Nuristan), and the Wakhan Corridor, where the average temperature in January is below −15 °C (5 °F) and can reach −26 °C (−15 °F), [258] and hot summers in the low-lying areas of the Sistan Basin of the southwest, the Jalalabad basin in the east, and the Turkestan plains along the Amu River in the north, where temperatures average over 35 °C (95 °F) in July [261] [274] and can go over 43 °C (109 °F) [258] The country is generally arid in the summers, with most rainfall falling between December and April The lower areas of northern and western Afghanistan are the driest, with precipitation more common in the east Although proximate to India, Afghanistan is mostly outside the monsoon zone, [258] except the Nuristan Province which occasionally receives summer monsoon rain [275]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nSeveral types of mammals exist throughout Afghanistan Snow leopards, Siberian tigers and brown bears live in the high elevation alpine tundra regions The Marco Polo sheep exclusively live in the Wakhan Corridor region of north-east Afghanistan Foxes, wolves, otters, deer, wild sheep, lynx and other big cats populate the mountain forest region of the east In the semi-desert northern plains, wildlife include a variety of birds, hedgehogs, gophers, and large carnivores such as jackals and hyenas [276]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nFollowing the effective collapse of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan during the 2021 Taliban offensive, the Taliban declared the country an Islamic Emirate A new caretaker government was announced on 7 September [280] As of 8 September 2021 [update], no other country had formally recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as the de jure government of Afghanistan [281] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices Afghanistan in 2023 was the third least electoral democratic country in Asia [282]\n\n\nDevelopment of Taliban government\nOn 17 August 2021, the leader of the Taliban-affiliated Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin party, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, met with both Hamid Karzai, the former President of Afghanistan, and Abdullah Abdullah, the former chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation and former Chief Executive, in Doha, Qatar, with the aim of forming a national unity government [287] [288] President Ashraf Ghani, having fled the country during the Taliban advance to either Tajikistan or Uzbekistan, emerged in the United Arab Emirates and said that he supported such negotiations and was in talks to return to Afghanistan [289] [290] Many figures within the Taliban generally agreed that continuation of the 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan may, if correctly applied, be workable as the basis for the new religious state as their objections to the former government were political, and not religious [291]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAfghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces (wilayat) [301] Each province has a governor and a capital The country is further divided into nearly 400 provincial districts, each of which normally covers a city or several villages Each district is represented by a district governor.\n\n\nForeign relations\nAfghanistan became a member of the United Nations in 1946 [305] Historically, Afghanistan had strong relations with Germany, one of the first countries to recognize Afghanistan's independence in 1919; the Soviet Union, which provided much aid and military training for Afghanistan's forces and includes the signing of a Treaty of Friendship in 1921 and 1978; and India, with which a friendship treaty was signed in 1950 [306] Relations with Pakistan have often been tense for various reasons such as the Durand Line border issue and alleged Pakistani involvement in Afghan insurgent groups.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Armed Forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan captured a large amount of weapons, hardware, vehicles, aerocrafts, and equipment from the Afghan National Security Forces following the 2021 Taliban offensive and the Fall of Kabul The total value of the captured equipment has been estimated at US$83 billion [311] [312]\n\n\nHuman rights\nHomosexuality is taboo in Afghan society; [313] according to the Penal Code, homosexual intimacy is punished by up to a year in prison [314] Under Sharia law offenders can be punished by death [315] [316] However, an ancient tradition involving male homosexual acts between children and older men (typically wealthy warlords or elite people) called bacha bazi persists.\n\n\nEconomy\nAfghanistan's nominal GDP was $20.1 billion in 2020, or $81 billion by purchasing power parity (PPP) [21] Its GDP per capita is $2,459 (PPP) and $611 by nominal [21] Despite having $1 trillion or more in mineral deposits, [331] it remains one of the world's least developed countries Afghanistan's rough physical geography and its landlocked status has been cited as reasons why the country has always been among the least developed in the modern era – a factor where progress is also slowed by contemporary conflict and political instability [258] The country imports over $7 billion worth of goods but exports only $784 million, mainly fruits and nuts It has $2.8 billion in external debt [261] The service sector contributed the most to the GDP (55.9%) followed by agriculture (23%) and industry (21.1%) [332]\n\n\nAgriculture\nAgricultural production is the backbone of Afghanistan's economy [349] and has traditionally dominated the economy, employing about 40% of the workforce as of 2018 [350] The country is known for producing pomegranates, grapes, apricots, melons, and several other fresh and dry fruits Afghanistan also became the world's top producer of cannabis in 2010 [351] In March 2023, however, cannabis production was banned by a decree from Hibatullah Akhundzada [352]\n\n\nMining\nThe country's natural resources include: coal, copper, iron ore, lithium, uranium, rare earth elements, chromite, gold, zinc, talc, barite, sulfur, lead, marble, precious and semi-precious stones, natural gas, and petroleum [361] [362] In 2010, US and Afghan government officials estimated that untapped mineral deposits located in 2007 by the US Geological Survey are worth at least $1 trillion [363]\n\n\nEnergy\nAccording to the World Bank, 98% of the rural population have access to electricity in 2018, up from 28% in 2008 [377] Overall the figure stands at 98.7% [378] As of 2016, Afghanistan produces 1,400 megawatts of power, but still imports the majority of electricity via transmission lines from Iran and the Central Asian states [379] The majority of electricity production is via hydropower, helped by the amount of rivers and streams that flow from the mountains [380] However electricity is not always reliable and blackouts happen, including in Kabul [381] In recent years an increasing number of solar, biomass and wind power plants have been constructed [382] Currently under development are the CASA-1000 project which will transmit electricity from Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline [381] Power is managed by the Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS, Afghanistan Electricity Company).\n\n\nTourism\nTourism is a small industry in Afghanistan due to security issues Nevertheless, some 20,000 foreign tourists visit the country annually as of 2016 [383] In particular an important region for domestic and international tourism is the picturesque Bamyan Valley, which includes lakes, canyons and historical sites, helped by the fact it is in a safe area away from insurgent activity [384] [385] Smaller numbers visit and trek in regions such as the Wakhan Valley, which is also one of the world's most remote communities [386] From the late 1960s onwards, Afghanistan was a popular stop on the famous hippie trail, attracting many Europeans and Americans Coming from Iran, the trail traveled through various Afghan provinces and cities including Herat, Kandahar and Kabul before crossing to northern Pakistan, northern India, and Nepal [387] [388] Tourism peaked in 1977, the year before the start of political instability and armed conflict [389]\n\n\nCommunication\nTelecommunication services in Afghanistan are provided by Afghan Telecom, Afghan Wireless, Etisalat, MTN Group, and Roshan The country uses its own space satellite called Afghansat 1, which provides services to millions of phone, internet, and television subscribers By 2001 following years of civil war, telecommunications was virtually a non-existent sector, but by 2016 it had grown to a $2 billion industry, with 22 million mobile phone subscribers and 5 million internet users The sector employs at least 120,000 people nationwide [397]\n\n\nTransportation\nDue to Afghanistan's geography, transport between various parts of the country has historically been difficult The backbone of Afghanistan's road network is Highway 1, often called the \"Ring Road\", which extends for 2,210 kilometres (1,370 mi) and connects five major cities: Kabul, Ghazni, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif, [398] with spurs to Kunduz and Jalalabad and various border crossings, while skirting around the mountains of the Hindu Kush [399]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Afghanistan was estimated at 32.9 million as of 2019 by the Afghanistan Statistics and Information Authority, [415] whereas the UN estimates over 38.0 million [416] In 1979 the total population was reported to be about 15.5 million [417] About 23.9% of them are urbanite, 71.4% live in rural areas, and the remaining 4.7% are nomadic [418] An additional 3 million or so Afghans are temporarily housed in neighboring Pakistan and Iran, most of whom were born and raised in those two countries As of 2013, Afghanistan was the largest refugee-producing country in the world, a title held for 32 years.\n\n\nPopulation\nThe population of Afghanistan was estimated at 32.9 million as of 2019 by the Afghanistan Statistics and Information Authority, [415] whereas the UN estimates over 38.0 million [416] In 1979 the total population was reported to be about 15.5 million [417] About 23.9% of them are urbanite, 71.4% live in rural areas, and the remaining 4.7% are nomadic [418] An additional 3 million or so Afghans are temporarily housed in neighboring Pakistan and Iran, most of whom were born and raised in those two countries As of 2013, Afghanistan was the largest refugee-producing country in the world, a title held for 32 years.\n\n\nFertility rate\nAfghanistan 2024 total fertility rate has been estimated at 4.4 [423] In 2022 it was 4.5, about twice the world average rate [424] The rate has fallen since the early 1980s [425]\n\n\nUrbanization\nAs estimated by the CIA World Factbook, 26% of the population was urbanized as of 2020 This is one of the lowest figures in the world; in Asia it is only higher than Cambodia, Nepal and Sri Lanka Urbanization has increased rapidly, particularly in the capital Kabul, due to returning refugees from Pakistan and Iran after 2001, internally displaced people, and rural migrants [426] Urbanization in Afghanistan is different from typical urbanization in that it is centered on just a few cities [427]\n\n\nEthnicity and languages\nAfghans are divided into several ethnolinguistic groups According to research data by several institutions in 2019, the Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group, comprising 42%, followed by Tajiks, comprising 27% [4] [5] [6] [429] [8] of the country's population The other two major ethnic groups are the Hazaras and Uzbeks, each at 9% A further 10 other ethnic groups are recognized and each are represented in the Afghan National Anthem [430]\n\n\nReligion\nThe CIA estimated in 2009 that 99.7% of the Afghan population was Muslim [261] and most are thought to adhere to the Sunni Hanafi school [438] According to Pew Research Center, as much as 90% are of the Sunni denomination, 7% Shia and 3% non-denominational [439] The CIA Factbook variously estimates up to 89.7% Sunni or up to 15% Shia [261]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Afghanistan is overseen by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education There are over 16,000 schools in the country and roughly 9 million students Of this, about 60% are males and 40% females However, the new regime has thus far forbidden female teachers and female students from returning to secondary schools [449] [450] Over 174,000 students are enrolled in different universities around the country About 21% of these are females [451] Former Education Minister Ghulam Farooq Wardak had stated that construction of 8,000 schools is required for the remaining children who are deprived of formal learning [452] As of 2018 the literacy rate of the population age 15 and older is 43.02% (males 55.48% and females 29.81%) [453]\n\n\nHealth\nAccording to the Human Development Index, Afghanistan is the 15th least developed country in the world The average life expectancy is estimated to be around 60 years [458] [459] The country's maternal mortality rate is 396 deaths/100,000 live births and its infant mortality rate is 66 [459] to 112.8 deaths in every 1,000 live births [261] The Ministry of Public Health plans to cut the infant mortality rate to 400 for every 100,000 live births before 2020 The country has more than 3,000 midwives, with an additional 300 to 400 being trained each year [460]\n\n\nCulture\nAfghans have both common cultural features and those that differ between the regions of Afghanistan, each with distinctive cultures partly as a result of geographic obstacles that divide the country [258] Family is the mainstay of Afghan society and families are often headed by a patriarch [468] In the southern and eastern region, the people live according to the Pashtun culture by following Pashtunwali (the Pashtun way) [469] Key tenets of Pashtunwali include hospitality, the provision of sanctuary to those seeking refuge, and revenge for the shedding of blood [470] The Pashtuns are largely connected to the culture of Central Asia and the Iranian Plateau The remaining Afghans are culturally Persian and Turkic Some non-Pashtuns who live in proximity with Pashtuns have adopted Pashtunwali in a process called Pashtunization, while some Pashtuns have been Persianized Those who have lived in Pakistan and Iran over the last 30 years have been further influenced by the cultures of those neighboring nations The Afghan people are known to be strongly religious [438]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe nation has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments Afghanistan contains many remnants from all ages, including Greek and Buddhist stupas, monasteries, monuments, temples, and Islamic minarets Among the most well known are the Great Mosque of Herat, the Blue Mosque, the Minaret of Jam, the Chil Zena, the Qala-i Bost in Lashkargah, the ancient Greek city of Ai-Khanoum [482] However, many of its historic monuments have been damaged in modern times due to the civil wars [483] The two famous Buddhas of Bamiyan were destroyed by the Taliban, who regarded them as idolatrous As there was no colonialism in the modern era in Afghanistan, European-style architecture is rare but does exist: the Victory Arch at Paghman and the Darul Aman Palace in Kabul were built in this style in the 1920s Afghan architecture also ranges deep into India such as the city of Agra, [484] and the tomb of Sher Shah Suri, an Afghan Emperor of India [485]\n\n\nArt and ceramics\nCarpet weaving is an ancient practice in Afghanistan, and many of these are still handmade by tribal and nomadic people today [427] Carpets have been produced in the region for thousands of years and traditionally done by women [486] Some crafters express their feelings through the designs of rugs; for example after the outbreak of the Soviet–Afghan War, \"war rugs\", a variant of Afghan rugs, were created with designs representing pain and misery caused by the conflict [487] Every province has its own specific characteristics in making rugs [488] In some of the Turkic-populated areas in the north-west, bride and wedding ceremony prices are driven by the bride's weaving skills [489]\n\n\nLiterature\nClassic Persian and Pashto poetry are a cherished part of Afghan culture Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture [497] One of the poetic styles is called landay A popular theme in Afghan folklore and mythology are Divs, monstrous creatures [498] Thursdays are traditionally \"poetry night\" in the city of Herat when men, women and children gather and recite both ancient and modern poems [499]\n\n\nMusic\nAfghan classical music has close historical links with Indian classical music and use the same Hindustani terminology and theories like raga Genres of this style of music include ghazal (poetic music) and instruments such as the Indian tabla, sitar and harmonium, and local instruments like zerbaghali, as well as dayereh and tanbur which are also known in Central Asia, the Caucasus and the Middle East The rubab is the country's national instrument and precurses the Indian sarod instrument Some of the famous artists of classical music include Ustad Sarahang and Sarban [501]\n\n\nMedia and entertainment\nAfghanistan has around 350 radio stations and over 200 television stations [506] Radio Television Afghanistan, originating from 1925, is the state public broadcaster Television programs began airing in the 1970s and today there are many private television channels such as TOLO and Shamshad TV The first Afghan newspaper was published in 1873, [507] and there are hundreds of print outlets today [506] By the 1920s, Radio Kabul was broadcasting local radio services [508] Voice of America, BBC, and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) broadcast in both of Afghanistan's official languages on radio [509] Press restrictions have been gradually relaxed and private media diversified since 2002, after more than two decades of tight controls.\n\n\nCuisine\nAfghan cuisine is largely based upon the nation's chief crops, such as wheat, maize, barley and rice Accompanying these staples are native fruits and vegetables as well as dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and whey Kabuli palaw is the national dish of Afghanistan [513] The nation's culinary specialties reflect its ethnic and geographic diversity [514] Afghanistan is known for its high-quality pomegranates, grapes, and sweet melons [515] Tea is a favorite drink among Afghans A typical Afghan diet consists of naan, yogurt, rice, and meat [468]\n\n\nHolidays and festivals\nAfghanistan's official New Year starts with Nowruz, an ancient tradition that started as a Zoroastrian celebration in present-day Iran, and with which it shares the annual celebration along with several other countries It occurs every year at the vernal equinox In Afghanistan, Nowruz is typically celebrated with music and dance, as well as holding buzkashi tournaments [516]\n\n\nSports\nSport in Afghanistan is managed by the Afghan Sports Federation Cricket and association football are the two most popular sports in the country [528] [529] The Afghan Sports Federation promotes cricket, association football, basketball, volleyball, golf, handball, boxing, taekwondo, weightlifting, bodybuilding, track and field, skating, bowling, snooker, chess, and other sports.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited sources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Afghanistan**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAfghanistan is a landlocked country located in Southern-Central Asia, bordered by Pakistan to the east and south, Iran to the west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan to the north, and China to the northeast. With a rich history dating back to the ancient civilizations of the Indus Valley and the Silk Road, Afghanistan has been a crossroads of cultures, trade, and conflict for centuries. Today, Afghanistan is a developing country with a diverse population, a complex history, and a vibrant culture.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nSome scholars suggest that the root name Afghān is derived from the Sanskrit word Aśvakan, which was the name used for ancient inhabitants of the Hindu Kush. Aśvakan literally means \"horsemen\", \"horse breeders\", or \"cavalrymen\" (from aśva, the Sanskrit and Avestan words for \"horse\").\n\n**History**\n\nExcavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world. An important site of early historical activities, many believe that Afghanistan compares to Egypt in the historical value of its archaeological sites. Artifacts typical of the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron Ages have been found in Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of Mundigak (near Kandahar in the south of the country) was a center of the Helmand culture. More recent findings established that the Indus Valley Civilization stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan. An Indus Valley site has been found on the Oxus River at Shortugai in northern Afghanistan.\n\n**Prehistory and Antiquity**\n\nExcavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world.

An Indus Valley site has been found on the Oxus River at Shortugai in northern Afghanistan.\n\n**Medieval Period**\n\nArab Muslims brought Islam to Herat and Zaranj in 642 CE and began spreading eastward; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted. Before the arrival of Islam, the region used to be home to various beliefs and cults, often resulting in syncretism between the dominant religions such as Zoroastrianism, Buddhism or Greco-Buddhism, Ancient Iranian religions, Hinduism, Christianity, and Judaism. An exemplification of the syncretism in the region would be that people were patrons of Buddhism but still worshipped local Iranian gods such as Ahura Mazda, Lady Nana, Anahita or Mihr (Mithra) and portrayed Greek gods as protectors of Buddha. The Zunbils and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in 870 CE by the Saffarid Muslims of Zaranj. Later, the Samanids extended their Islamic influence south of the Hindu Kush. The Ghaznavids rose to power in the 10th century.\n\n**Hotak Dynasty**\n\nIn 1709, Mirwais Hotak, a local Ghilzai tribal leader, successfully rebelled against the Safavids. He defeated Gurgin Khan, the Georgian governor of Kandahar under the Safavids, and established his own kingdom. Mirwais died in 1715, and was succeeded by his brother Abdul Aziz, who was soon killed by Mirwais's son Mahmud for possibly planning to sign a peace with the Safavids. Mahmud led the Afghan army in 1722 to the Persian capital of Isfahan, and captured the city after the Battle of Gulnabad and proclaimed himself King of Persia. The Afghan dynasty was ousted from Persia by Nader Shah after the 1729 Battle of Damghan.\n\n**Durrani Empire**\n\nAfter the death of Nader Shah in 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani had returned to Kandahar with a contingent of 4,000 Pashtuns. The Abdalis had \"unanimously accepted\" Ahmad Shah as their new leader. With his ascension in 1747, Ahmad Shah had led multiple campaigns against the Mughal empire, Maratha empire, and then-receding Afsharid empire. Ahmad Shah had captured Kabul and Peshawar from the Mughal appointed governor, Nasir Khan. Ahmad Shah had then conquered Herat in 1750, and had also captured Kashmir in 1752. Ahmad Shah had launched two campaigns into Khorasan, 1750–1751 and 1754–1755. His first campaign had seen the siege of Mashhad, however, he was forced to retreat after four months. In November 1750, he moved to siege Nishapur, but he was unable to capture the city and was forced to retreat in early 1751. Ahmad Shah returned in 1754; he captured Tun, and on 23 July, he sieged Mashhad once again. Mashhad had fallen on 2 December, but Shahrokh was reappointed in 1755. He was forced to give up Torshiz, Bakharz, Jam, Khaf, and Turbat-e Haidari to the Afghans, as well as accept Afghan sovereignty. Following this, Ahmad Shah sieged Nishapur once again, and captured it.\n\n**Barakzai Dynasty and British Wars**\n\nBy the early 19th century, the Afghan empire was under threat from the Persians in the west and the Sikh Empire in the east. Fateh Khan, leader of the Barakzai tribe, installed many of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire. Fateh Khan was brutally murdered in 1818 by Mahmud Shah. As a result, the brothers of Fateh Khan and the Barakzai tribe rebelled, and a civil war brewed. During this turbulent period, Afghanistan fractured into many states, including the Principality of Qandahar, Emirate of Herat, Khanate of Qunduz, Maimana Khanate, and numerous other warring polities. The most prominent state was the Emirate of Kabul, ruled by Dost Mohammad Khan.\n\n**Democratic Republic and Soviet War**\n\nIn April 1978, the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in a bloody coup d'état against then-President Mohammed Daoud Khan, in what is called the Saur Revolution. The PDPA declared the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, with its first leader named as People's Democratic Party General Secretary Nur Muhammad Taraki. This would trigger a series of events that would dramatically turn Afghanistan from a poor and secluded (albeit peaceful) country to a hotbed of international terrorism. The PDPA initiated various social, symbolic, and land distribution reforms that provoked strong opposition, while also brutally oppressing political dissidents. This caused unrest and quickly expanded into a state of civil war by 1979, waged by guerrilla mujahideen (and smaller Maoist guerrillas) against regime forces countrywide. It quickly turned into a proxy war as the Pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers, the United States supported them through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA regime. Meanwhile, there was increasingly hostile friction between the competing factions of the PDPA – the dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parcham.\n\n**Post–Cold War Conflict**\n\nAnother civil war broke out after the creation of a dysfunctional coalition government between leaders of various mujahideen factions. Amid a state of anarchy and factional infighting, various muj", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Afghanistan\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nSome scholars suggest that the root name Afghān is derived from the Sanskrit word Aśvakan, which was the name used for ancient inhabitants of the Hindu Kush [40] Aśvakan literally means \"horsemen\",

creation of a dysfunctional coalition government between leaders of various mujahideen factions Amid a state of anarchy and factional infighting, [155] [156] [157] various mujahideen factions committed widespread rape, murder and extortion, [156] [158] [159] while Kabul was heavily bombarded and partially destroyed by the fighting [159] Several failed reconciliations and alliances occurred between different leaders [160] The Taliban emerged in September 1994 as a movement and militia of students (talib) from Islamic madrassas (schools) in Pakistan, [159] [161] who soon had military support from Pakistan [162] Taking control of Kandahar city that year, [159] they conquered more territories until finally driving out the government of Rabbani from Kabul in 1996, [163] [164] where they established an emirate [165] The Taliban were condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans, especially women [166] [167] During their rule, the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan civilians, denied UN food supplies to starving civilians and conducted a policy of scorched earth, burning vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes [168] [169] [170] [171] [172] [173] [excessive citations]\n\n\nUS invasion and Islamic Republic\nIn October 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan to remove the Taliban from power after they refused to hand over Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect of the September 11 attacks, who was a \"guest\" of the Taliban and was operating his al-Qaeda network in Afghanistan [179] [180] [181] The majority of Afghans supported the American invasion [182] [183] During the initial invasion, US and UK forces bombed al-Qaeda training camps, and later working with the Northern Alliance, the Taliban regime came to an end [184]\n\n\nSecond Taliban era\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced on 14 April 2021 that the alliance had agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by 1 May [210] Soon after NATO troops began withdrawing, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government and quickly advanced in front of collapsing Afghan government forces [211] [212] The Taliban captured the capital city of Kabul on 15 August 2021, after regaining control over a vast majority of Afghanistan Several foreign diplomats and Afghan government officials, including president Ashraf Ghani, [213] were evacuated from the country, with many Afghan civilians attempting to flee along with them [214] On 17 August, first vice president Amrullah Saleh proclaimed himself caretaker president and announced the formation of an anti-Taliban front with a reported 6,000+ troops [215] [216] in the Panjshir Valley, along with Ahmad Massoud [217] [218] However, by 6 September, the Taliban had taken control of most of Panjshir province, with resistance fighters retreating to the mountains [219] Clashes in the valley ceased mid-September [220]\n\n\nGeography\nAfghanistan is located in Southern-Central Asia [247] [248] [249] [250] [251] The region centered at Afghanistan is considered the \"crossroads of Asia\", [252] and the country has had the nickname Heart of Asia [253] The renowned Urdu poet Allama Iqbal once wrote about the country:\n\n\nClimate\nAfghanistan has a continental climate with harsh winters in the central highlands, the glaciated northeast (around Nuristan), and the Wakhan Corridor, where the average temperature in January is below −15 °C (5 °F) and can reach −26 °C (−15 °F), [258] and hot summers in the low-lying areas of the Sistan Basin of the southwest, the Jalalabad basin in the east, and the Turkestan plains along the Amu River in the north, where temperatures average over 35 °C (95 °F) in July [261] [274] and can go over 43 °C (109 °F) [258] The country is generally arid in the summers, with most rainfall falling between December and April The lower areas of northern and western Afghanistan are the driest, with precipitation more common in the east Although proximate to India, Afghanistan is mostly outside the monsoon zone, [258] except the Nuristan Province which occasionally receives summer monsoon rain [275]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nSeveral types of mammals exist throughout Afghanistan Snow leopards, Siberian tigers and brown bears live in the high elevation alpine tundra regions The Marco Polo sheep exclusively live in the Wakhan Corridor region of north-east Afghanistan Foxes, wolves, otters, deer, wild sheep, lynx and other big cats populate the mountain forest region of the east In the semi-desert northern plains, wildlife include a variety of birds, hedgehogs, gophers, and large carnivores such as jackals and hyenas [276]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nFollowing the effective collapse of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan during the 2021 Taliban offensive, the Taliban declared the country an Islamic Emirate A new caretaker government was announced on 7 September [280] As of 8 September 2021 [update], no other country had formally recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as the de jure government of Afghanistan [281] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices Afghanistan in 2023 was the third least electoral democratic country in Asia [282]\n\n\nDevelopment of Taliban government\nOn 17 August 2021, the leader of the Taliban-affiliated Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin party, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, met with both Hamid Karzai, the former President of Afghanistan, and Abdullah Abdullah, the former chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation and former Chief Executive, in Doha, Qatar, with the aim of forming a national unity government [287] [288] President Ashraf Ghani, having fled the country during the Taliban advance to either Tajikistan or Uzbekistan, emerged in the United Arab Emirates and said that he supported such negotiations and was in talks to return to Afghanistan [289] [290] Many figures within the Taliban generally agreed that continuation of the 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan may, if correctly applied, be workable as the basis for the new religious state as their objections to the former government were political, and not religious [291]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAfghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces (wilayat) [301] Each province has a governor and a capital The country is further divided into nearly 400 provincial districts, each of which normally covers a city or several villages Each district is represented by a district governor.\n\n\nForeign relations\nAfghanistan became a member of the United Nations in 1946 [305] Historically, Afghanistan had strong relations with Germany, one of the first countries to recognize Afghanistan's independence in 1919; the Soviet Union, which provided much aid and military training for Afghanistan's forces and includes the signing of a Treaty of Friendship in 1921 and 1978; and India, with which a friendship treaty was signed in 1950 [306] Relations with Pakistan have often been tense for various reasons such as the Durand Line border issue and alleged Pakistani involvement in Afghan insurgent groups.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Armed Forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan captured a large amount of weapons, hardware, vehicles, aerocrafts, and equipment from the Afghan National Security Forces following the 2021 Taliban offensive and the Fall of Kabul The total value of the captured equipment has been estimated at US$83 billion [311] [312]\n\n\nHuman rights\nHomosexuality is taboo in Afghan society; [313] according to the Penal Code, homosexual intimacy is punished by up to a year in prison [314] Under Sharia law offenders can be punished by death [315] [316] However, an ancient tradition involving male homosexual acts between children and older men (typically wealthy warlords or elite people) called bacha bazi persists.\n\n\nEconomy\nAfghanistan's nominal GDP was $20.1 billion in 2020, or $81 billion by purchasing power parity (PPP) [21] Its GDP per capita is $2,459 (PPP) and $611 by nominal [21] Despite having $1 trillion or more in mineral deposits, [331] it remains one of the world's least developed countries Afghanistan's rough physical geography and its landlocked status has been cited as reasons why the country has always been among the least developed in the modern era – a factor where progress is also slowed by contemporary conflict and political instability [258] The country imports over $7 billion worth of goods but exports only $784 million, mainly fruits and nuts It has $2.8 billion in external debt [261] The service sector contributed the most to the GDP (55.9%) followed by agriculture (23%) and industry (21.1%) [332]\n\n\nAgriculture\nAgricultural production is the backbone of Afghanistan's economy [349] and has traditionally dominated the economy, employing about 40% of the workforce as of 2018 [350] The country is known for producing pomegranates, grapes, apricots, melons, and several other fresh and dry fruits Afghanistan also became the world's top producer of cannabis in 2010 [351] In March 2023, however, cannabis production was banned by a decree from Hibatullah Akhundzada [352]\n\n\nMining\nThe country's natural resources include: coal, copper, iron ore, lithium, uranium, rare earth elements, chromite, gold, zinc, talc, barite, sulfur, lead, marble, precious and semi-precious stones, natural gas, and petroleum [361] [362] In 2010, US and Afghan government officials estimated that untapped mineral deposits located in 2007 by the US Geological Survey are worth at least $1 trillion [363]\n\n\nEnergy\nAccording to the World Bank, 98% of the rural population have access to electricity in 2018, up from 28% in 2008 [377] Overall the figure stands at 98.7% [378] As of 2016, Afghanistan produces 1,400 megawatts of power, but still imports the majority of electricity via transmission lines from Iran and the Central Asian states [379] The majority of electricity production is via hydropower, helped by the amount of rivers and streams that flow from the mountains [380] However electricity is not always reliable and blackouts happen, including in Kabul [381] In recent years an increasing number of solar, biomass and wind power plants have been constructed [382] Currently under development are the CASA-1000 project which will transmit electricity from Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline [381] Power is managed by the Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS, Afghanistan Electricity Company).\n\n\nTourism\nTourism is a small industry in Afghanistan due to security issues Nevertheless, some 20,000 foreign tourists visit the country annually as of 2016 [383] In particular an important region for domestic and international tourism is the picturesque Bamyan Valley, which includes lakes, canyons and historical sites, helped by the fact it is in a safe area away from insurgent activity [384] [385] Smaller numbers visit and trek in regions such as the Wakhan Valley, which is also one of the world's most remote communities [386] From the late 1960s onwards, Afghanistan was a popular stop on the famous hippie trail, attracting many Europeans and Americans Coming from Iran, the trail traveled through various Afghan provinces and cities including Herat, Kandahar and Kabul before crossing to northern Pakistan, northern India, and Nepal [387] [388] Tourism peaked in 1977, the year before the start of political instability and armed conflict [389]\n\n\nCommunication\nTelecommunication services in Afghanistan are provided by Afghan Telecom, Afghan Wireless, Etisalat, MTN Group, and Roshan The country uses its own space satellite called Afghansat 1, which provides services to millions of phone, internet, and television subscribers By 2001 following years of civil war, telecommunications was virtually a non-existent sector, but by 2016 it had grown to a $2 billion industry, with 22 million mobile phone subscribers and 5 million internet users The sector employs at least 120,000 people nationwide [397]\n\n\nTransportation\nDue to Afghanistan's geography, transport between various parts of the country has historically been difficult The backbone of Afghanistan's road network is Highway 1, often called the \"Ring Road\", which extends for 2,210 kilometres (1,370 mi) and connects five major cities: Kabul, Ghazni, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif, [398] with spurs to Kunduz and Jalalabad and various border crossings, while skirting around the mountains of the Hindu Kush [399]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe population of Afghanistan was estimated at 32.9 million as of 2019 by the Afghanistan Statistics and Information Authority, [415] whereas the UN estimates over 38.0 million [416] In 1979 the total population was reported to be about 15.5 million [417] About 23.9% of them are urbanite, 71.4% live in rural areas, and the remaining 4.7% are nomadic [418] An additional 3 million or so Afghans are temporarily housed in neighboring Pakistan and Iran, most of whom were born and raised in those two countries As of 2013, Afghanistan was the largest refugee-producing country in the world, a title held for 32 years.\n\n\nPopulation\nThe population of Afghanistan was estimated at 32.9 million as of 2019 by the Afghanistan Statistics and Information Authority, [415] whereas the UN estimates over 38.0 million

country in the world, a title held for 32 years.\n\n\nFertility rate\nAfghanistan 2024 total fertility rate has been estimated at 4.4 [423] In 2022 it was 4.5, about twice the world average rate [424] The rate has fallen since the early 1980s [425]\n\n\nUrbanization\nAs estimated by the CIA World Factbook, 26% of the population was urbanized as of 2020 This is one of the lowest figures in the world; in Asia it is only higher than Cambodia, Nepal and Sri Lanka Urbanization has increased rapidly, particularly in the capital Kabul, due to returning refugees from Pakistan and Iran after 2001, internally displaced people, and rural migrants [426] Urbanization in Afghanistan is different from typical urbanization in that it is centered on just a few cities [427]\n\n\nEthnicity and languages\nAfghans are divided into several ethnolinguistic groups According to research data by several institutions in 2019, the Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group, comprising 42%, followed by Tajiks, comprising 27% [4] [5] [6] [429] [8] of the country's population The other two major ethnic groups are the Hazaras and Uzbeks, each at 9% A further 10 other ethnic groups are recognized and each are represented in the Afghan National Anthem [430]\n\n\nReligion\nThe CIA estimated in 2009 that 99.7% of the Afghan population was Muslim [261] and most are thought to adhere to the Sunni Hanafi school [438] According to Pew Research Center, as much as 90% are of the Sunni denomination, 7% Shia and 3% non-denominational [439] The CIA Factbook variously estimates up to 89.7% Sunni or up to 15% Shia [261]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Afghanistan is overseen by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education There are over 16,000 schools in the country and roughly 9 million students Of this, about 60% are males and 40% females However, the new regime has thus far forbidden female teachers and female students from returning to secondary schools [449] [450] Over 174,000 students are enrolled in different universities around the country About 21% of these are females [451] Former Education Minister Ghulam Farooq Wardak had stated that construction of 8,000 schools is required for the remaining children who are deprived of formal learning [452] As of 2018 the literacy rate of the population age 15 and older is 43.02% (males 55.48% and females 29.81%) [453]\n\n\nHealth\nAccording to the Human Development Index, Afghanistan is the 15th least developed country in the world The average life expectancy is estimated to be around 60 years [458] [459] The country's maternal mortality rate is 396 deaths/100,000 live births and its infant mortality rate is 66 [459] to 112.8 deaths in every 1,000 live births [261] The Ministry of Public Health plans to cut the infant mortality rate to 400 for every 100,000 live births before 2020 The country has more than 3,000 midwives, with an additional 300 to 400 being trained each year [460]\n\n\nCulture\nAfghans have both common cultural features and those that differ between the regions of Afghanistan, each with distinctive cultures partly as a result of geographic obstacles that divide the country [258] Family is the mainstay of Afghan society and families are often headed by a patriarch [468] In the southern and eastern region, the people live according to the Pashtun culture by following Pashtunwali (the Pashtun way) [469] Key tenets of Pashtunwali include hospitality, the provision of sanctuary to those seeking refuge, and revenge for the shedding of blood [470] The Pashtuns are largely connected to the culture of Central Asia and the Iranian Plateau The remaining Afghans are culturally Persian and Turkic Some non-Pashtuns who live in proximity with Pashtuns

He is known for his outspoken and often provocative views, which have led to controversies and criticisms throughout his career.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nPiers Morgan was born as Piers Stefan O'Meara on 30 March 1965, in Reigate, Surrey. His father, Vincent Eamonn O'Meara, was an Irish dentist from County Offaly, and his mother, Gabrielle Georgina Sybille (née Oliver), was an English woman who raised Morgan as a Catholic. A few months after his birth, the family moved to Newick, East Sussex. His father died when Morgan was 11 months old, and his mother later married Glynne Pughe-Morgan, a Welsh pub landlord who later worked in the meat distribution business. Morgan took his stepfather's surname. He was educated at the independent Cumnor House prep school between the ages of seven and 13, followed by Chailey School, a comprehensive secondary school in Chailey, and then Priory School, Lewes, for sixth form.\n\n**Press Career**\n\nMorgan began his career in journalism at the age of 16, working as a freelance writer for the Surrey and South London Newspaper Group. He later joined The Sun in 1988, where he worked on the show business column \"Bizarre\" under the editorship of Kelvin MacKenzie. Morgan has stated that he was personally recruited by MacKenzie for the job and that he was not a fan of pop music, but he was skilled at self-publicity and became the column's main writer.

For You Fritz Ze Euro Championship Is Over,\" was criticized for its use of Nazi-style language and was widely condemned.\n\n**Phone Hacking Allegations**\n\nDuring Morgan's tenure as editor, the Daily Mirror was involved in a phone hacking scandal, which led to allegations that the newspaper had intercepted the voicemails of celebrities and politicians. Morgan has denied any involvement in the scandal, but he has been criticized for his handling of the story and for his failure to take action to prevent the hacking.\n\n**Post-Mirror Press Activities**\n\nAfter leaving the Daily Mirror, Morgan went on to work as a columnist and commentator for several newspapers and magazines, including The Mail on Sunday and The Daily Mail. He also became a regular television presenter, hosting several shows on ITV and Channel 4, including a current affairs interview program.\n\n**Television Career**\n\nMorgan's television career has been marked by controversy and criticism, particularly for his outspoken and often provocative views.

often referred to as Homophile demonstrations reflecting a more conservative and assimilationist approach to LGBTQ+ rights As the movement became more radical in the late 1960s, particularly after the Stonewall Uprising, they were called Gay Liberation marches or rallies which emphasized demands for full equality and liberation [7] [8]\n\n\nHistorical background\nKarl Heinrich Ulrichs was one of

people In this context American homophile organizations such as the Daughters of Bilitis and the Mattachine Society coordinated some of the earliest demonstrations of the modern LGBT rights movement These two organizations in particular carried out pickets called \"Annual Reminders\" to inform and remind Americans that LGBT people did not receive basic civil rights protections Annual Reminders began in 1965 and took place each July 4 at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.\n\n\n\"Gay is Good\"\nThe anti-LGBT discourse of these times equated both male and female homosexuality with mental illness  Inspired by Stokely Carmichael's \"Black is Beautiful\", gay civil rights pioneer and participant in the Annual Reminders Frank Kameny originated the slogan \"Gay is Good\" in the early 1960s [17] to counter social stigma and personal feelings of guilt and shame.\n\n\nChristopher Street Liberation Day\nEarly on the morning of Saturday, June 28, 1969, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons rioted following a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar at 43 Christopher Street in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York City This riot and further protests and rioting over the following nights were the watershed moment in the modern LGBT rights movement and the impetus for organizing LGBT pride marches on a much larger public scale.\n\n\nSpread\nOn Saturday, June 27, 1970, Chicago Gay Liberation organized a march [34] from Washington Square Park (\"Bughouse Square\") to the Water Tower at the intersection of Michigan and Chicago avenues, which was the route originally planned, and then many of the participants extemporaneously marched on to the Civic Center (now Richard J Daley) Plaza [35] The date was chosen because the Stonewall events began on the last Saturday of June and because organizers wanted to reach the maximum number of Michigan Avenue shoppers Subsequent Chicago parades have been held on the last Sunday of June, coinciding with the date of many similar parades elsewhere Subsequently, during the same weekend, gay activist groups on the West Coast of the United States held a march in Los Angeles and a march and \"Gay-in\" in San Francisco [36] [37]\n\n\n1980s and 1990s\nIn the 1980s there was a major cultural shift in the Stonewall Riot commemorations The previous more loosely organized, grassroots marches and parades were taken over by more organized and less radical elements of the gay community The marches began dropping \"Liberation\" and \"Freedom\" from their names under pressure from more conservative members of the community, replacing them with the philosophy of \"Gay Pride\" [citation needed] (in San Francisco, the name of the gay parade and celebration was not changed from Gay Freedom Day Parade to Gay Pride Day Parade until 1994) The Greek lambda symbol and the pink triangle, which had been revolutionary symbols of the Gay Liberation Movement, were tidied up and incorporated into the Gay Pride, or Pride, movement, providing some symbolic continuity with its more radical beginnings [clarification needed] The pink triangle was also the inspiration for the homomonument in Amsterdam, commemorating all gay men and lesbians who have been subjected to persecution because of their homosexuality.\n\n\nPride Month\nPride Month occurs in the United States to commemorate the Stonewall riots, which occurred at the end of June 1969 As a result, many pride events are held during this month to recognize the impact LGBTQ people have had in the world.\n\n\nRainbow/Pride flag\nThe rainbow flag, also known as the pride flag, is a symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) pride and social movements [62] The most common variant consists of six horizontal stripes of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet [63] Designed in 1978 by artist Gilbert Baker, the flag's colors were originally eight and had specific meanings in relation to the LGBT+ community The design has undergone revisions over the years, but it remains a widely recognized symbol of LGBTQ+ identity and activism [64]\n\n\nCriticism\nFrom both outside and inside the LGBT community, there is criticism and protest against pride events Bob Christie's documentary Beyond Gay: The Politics of Pride evaluates gay pride events in different countries within the context of local opposition.\n\n\nInitiatives and criticism by governments and political leaders\nIn August 2011, São Paulo city alderman Carlos Apolinário of the right-wing Democrats Party sponsored a bill to organize and sponsor \"Heterosexual Pride Day\" on the third Sunday of December Apolinário, an Evangelical Protestant, stated that the intent of the parade was a \"struggle .. against excesses and privileges\" Members of Gay Group of Bahia  [ar; ast; es; fr; it; pt] and the Workers' Party opposed the bill as enhancing \"the possibility of discrimination and prejudice\" [66] The bill was nevertheless passed by the city council, but never received

never received the signature of mayor Gilberto Kassab.\n\n\nSpain\nIn a 2008 interview for the biography La Reina muy cerca (The Queen Up Close), by Spanish journalist and writer Pilar Urbano, Queen Sofía of Spain sparked controversy by voicing her disapproval of LGBT pride This was in addition to overstepping her official duties as a member of the Royal Family by censoring the Spanish Law on Marriage in how it names same-sex unions as \"matrimonio\" (marriage) Without using the slogan \"Straight Pride\", Queen Sofía was directly quoted as saying that if heterosexuals were to take the streets as the LGBT community does for Gay Pride parades, that the former collective would bring Madrid to a standstill [68]\n\n\nTurkey\nIn 2015 police dispersed the Pride parade using tear gas and rubber bullets [69]\n\n\nUganda\nIn 2016, Ugandan police broke up a gay pride event in the capital [70] Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda.\n\n\nIn-group\nIn a special queer issue of The Stranger in 1999, openly gay author, pundit, and journalist Dan Savage questioned the relevance of pride thirty years later, writing that pride was an effective antidote to shame imposed on LGBT people, but that pride is now making LGBT people dull and slow as a group, as well as being a constant reminder of shame; however, he also states that pride in some simpler forms is still useful to individuals struggling with shame Savage writes that gay pride can also lead to disillusionment where an LGBT individual realizes the reality that sexual orientation does not say much about a person's personality, after being led by the illusion that LGBT individuals are part of a co-supportive and inherently good group of people [71]\n\n\n\"Straight pride\" analogy\n\"Straight pride\" and \"heterosexual pride\" are analogies and slogans that contrast heterosexuality with homosexuality by copying the phrase \"gay pride\" [78] Originating from the culture wars in the United States, \"straight pride\" is a form of conservative backlash as there is no straight or heterosexual civil rights movement [79]\n\n\nSee also\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial

These protests were held each July 4 at Independence Hall in Philadelphia to inform and remind Americans that LGBT people did not receive basic civil rights protections.\n\n**\"Gay is Good\"**\n\nThe anti-LGBT discourse of these times equated both male and female homosexuality with mental illness.

an Evangelical Protestant, stated that the intent of the parade was a \"struggle .. against excesses and privileges\" Members of Gay Group of Bahia  [ar; ast; es; fr; it; pt] and the Workers' Party opposed the bill as enhancing \"the possibility of discrimination and prejudice\" [66] The bill was nevertheless passed by the city council, but never received the signature of mayor Gilberto Kassab.\n\n\nSpain\nIn a 2008 interview for the biography La Reina muy cerca (The Queen Up Close), by Spanish journalist and writer Pilar Urbano, Queen Sofía of Spain sparked controversy by voicing her disapproval of LGBT pride This was in addition to overstepping her official duties as a member of the Royal Family by censoring the Spanish Law on Marriage in how it names same-sex unions as \"matrimonio\" (marriage) Without using the slogan \"Straight Pride\", Queen Sofía was directly quoted as saying that if heterosexuals were to take the streets as the LGBT community does for Gay Pride parades, that the former collective would bring Madrid to a standstill [68]\n\n\nTurkey\nIn 2015 police dispersed the Pride parade using tear gas and rubber bullets [69]\n\n\nUganda\nIn 2016, Ugandan police broke up a gay pride event in the capital [70] Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda.\n\n\nIn-group\nIn a special queer issue of The Stranger in 1999, openly gay author, pundit, and journalist Dan Savage questioned the relevance of pride thirty years later, writing that pride was an effective antidote to shame imposed on LGBT people, but that pride is now making LGBT people dull and slow as a group, as well as being a constant reminder of shame; however, he also states that pride in some simpler forms is still useful to individuals struggling with shame Savage writes that gay pride can also lead to disillusionment where an LGBT individual realizes the reality that sexual orientation does not say much about a person's personality, after being led by the illusion that LGBT individuals are part of a co-supportive and inherently good group of people [71]\n\n\n\"Straight pride\" analogy\n\"Straight pride\" and \"heterosexual pride\" are analogies and slogans that contrast heterosexuality with homosexuality by copying the phrase \"gay pride\" [78] Originating from the culture wars in the United States, \"straight pride\" is a form of conservative backlash as there is no straight or heterosexual civil rights movement [79]\n\n\nSee also\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday

Duncanville High School, [5] where he was on the track team, [6] in the National Honor Society and was voted \"Most Likely to Succeed\" [6]\n\n\nJudicial career\nAbbott's judicial career began in Houston, where he served as a state trial judge in the 129th District Court for three years [8]  Then-Governor George W Bush appointed Abbott to the Texas Supreme Court; he was then twice elected to the state's highest civil court—in 1996 (two-year term) and in 1998 (six-year term) In 1996, Abbott had no Democratic opponent but was challenged by Libertarian John B Hawley of Dallas Abbott defeated Hawley, 84% to 16% [9] In 1998, Abbott defeated Democrat David Van Os, 60% to 40% [10]\n\n\nAttorney General of Texas (2002–2015)\nAbbott resigned from the Texas Supreme Court in 2001 to run for lieutenant governor of Texas [3] He had been campaigning for several months when the previous attorney general, John Cornyn, vacated the post to run for the U.S Senate [3] Abbott then switched his campaign to the open attorney general's position in 2002 He defeated the Democratic nominee, former Austin mayor and former state senator [13] Kirk Watson, 57% to 41% [14] Abbott was sworn in on December 2, 2002, following Cornyn's election to the Senate [citation needed]\n\n\n2002 election\nAbbott resigned from the Texas Supreme Court in 2001 to run for lieutenant governor of Texas [3] He had been campaigning for several months when the previous attorney general, John Cornyn, vacated the post to run for the U.S Senate [3] Abbott then switched his campaign to the open attorney general's position in 2002 He defeated the Democratic nominee, former Austin mayor and former state senator [13] Kirk Watson, 57% to 41% [14] Abbott was sworn in on December 2, 2002, following Cornyn's election to the Senate [citation needed]\n\n\nTenure\nAbbott expanded the attorney general's office's law enforcement division from about 30 people to more than 100 [3] He also created a new division, the Fugitive Unit, to track down convicted sex offenders in violation of their paroles or probations [3]\n\n\nLawsuit against Sony BMG\nIn late 2005, Abbott sued Sony BMG [26] [27] Texas was the first state in the nation to bring legal action against Sony BMG for illegal spyware [26] [27] The suit is also the first filed under the state's spyware law of 2005 [26] [27] It alleges the company surreptitiously installed the spyware on millions of compact music discs (CDs) that consumers inserted into their computers when they played the CDs, which can compromise the systems [27] [28] On December 21, 2005, Abbott added new allegations to his lawsuit against Sony-BMG He said the MediaMax copy protection technology violated Texas's spyware and deceptive trade practices laws [26] [29] Sony-BMG offered consumers a licensing agreement when they bought CDs and played them on their computers; [26] [29] in the lawsuit, brought under the Consumer Protection Against Computer Spyware Act of 2005 and other laws, Abbott alleged that even if consumers rejected that agreement, spyware was secretly installed on their computers, posing security risks for music buyers and deceiving Texas purchasers [26] [29] [30] Sony settled the Texas lawsuit, as well as a similar suit brought by California's attorney general, for $1.5 million [31]\n\n\nSeparation of church and state\nIn March 2005, Abbott delivered oral argument before the United States Supreme Court on behalf of Texas, defending a Ten Commandments monument on grounds of the Texas State Capitol Thousands of similar monuments were donated to cities and towns across the nation by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, who were inspired by the Cecil B DeMille film The Ten Commandments (1956) in following years [32] In his deposition, Abbott said, \"The Ten Commandments are a historically recognized system of law.\" [33] The Supreme Court held in a 5–4 decision that the Texas display did not violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause and was constitutional [34] After Abbott's oral arguments in Van Orden v Perry, Justice John Paul Stevens commented upon Abbott's performance while in a wheelchair, \"I want to thank you  [...] for demonstrating that it's not necessary to stand at the lectern in order to do a fine job.\" [6]\n\n\nFirearms\nIn 2015, Abbott signed the campus carry (SB 11) and the open carry (HB 910) bills into law [140] The campus carry law came into effect later that year, allowing licensed carry of a concealed handgun on public college campuses, with private colleges able to opt out [140] [141] The open carry bill went into effect in 2016, allowing licensed open carry of a handgun in public areas and private businesses unless they display a \"30.07\" sign, referring to state penal code 30.07, which states that a handgun may not be carried openly even by a licensed gun carrier To do so is considered trespassing [140] [141] [142] Texas is the 45th state to have open carry [143] In 2017, Abbott signed into law a bill lowering handgun carry license fees [144] In 2021, he signed into law a bill that allowed Texans to carry guns without a license [145]\n\n\nTort reform\nAbbott backed legislation in Texas to limit \"punitive damages stemming from noneconomic losses\" and \"noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases\" at $750,000 and $250,000, respectively [38] While the settlement in his own paralysis case was a \"nonmedical liability lawsuit\", which remains uncapped, Abbott has faced criticism, generally from Democrats who oppose the Republican-backed lawsuit curbs, for \"tilt [ing] the judicial scales toward civil defendants.\" [38]\n\n\nSupport for ban on sex toys\nAs attorney general, Abbott unsuccessfully defended Texas's ban on sex toys [39] He said Texas had a legitimate interest in \"discouraging prurient interests in autonomous sex and the pursuit of sexual gratification unrelated to procreation.\" [39]\n\n\nOpposition to same-sex marriage\nAs attorney general, Abbott defended the state's ban on same-sex marriage from a constitutional challenge [40] In 2014, he argued in court that Texas should be allowed to prohibit same-sex marriage because LGBT individuals cannot procreate He said that as \"same-sex relationships do not naturally produce children, recognizing same-sex marriage does not further these goals to the same extent that recognizing opposite-sex marriage does.\" [39] He also argued that gay people are still free to marry, saying they are \"as free to marry an opposite-sex spouse as anyone else\" [39] He suggested that same-sex marriage led to a slippery slope in which \"any conduct that has been traditionally prohibited can become a constitutional right simply by redefining it at a higher level of abstraction.\" [39]\n\n\n2006 election\nIn the November 7, 2006, general election, Abbott was challenged by civil rights attorney David Van Os, who had been his Democratic opponent in the 1998 election for state Supreme Court He was reelected to a second term with 60% to Van Os's 37% [43]\n\n\n2010 election\nAbbott ran for a third term in 2010 He defeated the Democratic nominee, attorney Barbara Ann Radnofsky, with 64% of the vote to her 34% [44] He was the longest-serving Texas attorney general in Texas history [45]\n\n\nGubernatorial elections\nIn July 2013, shortly after Governor Rick Perry announced that he would not seek a fourth full term, [47] Abbott announced his candidacy for governor of Texas in the 2014 election [48] In the first six months of 2011, he raised more money for his campaign than any other previous Texas politician, reaching $1.6 million The next-highest fundraiser among state officeholders was Texas comptroller Susan Combs, with $611,700 [49]\n\n\n2014 election\nIn July 2013, shortly after Governor Rick Perry announced that he would not seek a fourth full term, [47] Abbott announced his candidacy for governor of Texas in the 2014 election [48] In the first six months of 2011, he raised more money for his campaign than any other previous Texas politician, reaching $1.6 million The next-highest fundraiser among state officeholders was Texas comptroller Susan Combs, with $611,700 [49]\n\n\n2018 election\nIn January 2017, Abbott was reportedly raising funds for a 2018 reelection bid as governor; as of December 2016 [update], he had $34.4 million on hand for his campaign, of which he had raised $9 million during the second half of 2016 [67] [68] Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick had been mentioned as a potential challenger, but confirmed that he would run for reelection as lieutenant governor [68] During the weekend of January 21, 2017, Abbott said that he intended to run for reelection [69] He confirmed this on March 28, 2017 [70]\n\n\n2022 election\nAbbott ran for a third term and faced challengers from within his own party, [79] [80] including former Texas Republican Party chair Allen West and Don Huffines [81] [82] On March 1, he won the primary with over 66% of the vote He was challenged by the Democratic nominee, former U.S Representative Beto O'Rourke [83] Abbott began with a large campaign funding advantage over his opponents, but was outraised by O'Rourke, who raised $81.6 million to Abbott's $78.5 million [84] [85]\n\n\n2026 election\nAccording to the Austin American Statesman, advisers close to Abbott have said he has not ruled out running for a fourth term in 2026, which would make him the longest-serving governor in state history with 16 years of service by January 21, 2031, surpassing former governor Rick Perry's 14 years [88]\n\n\nTenure as governor (2015–present)\nAbbott was sworn in as governor of Texas on January 20, 2015, succeeding Rick Perry [90] [91] He is the first governor of Texas and the third elected governor of a U.S state to use a wheelchair, after Franklin D Roosevelt of New York (1929–1932) and George Wallace of Alabama (1963–1967, 1971–1979; 1983–1987) [92] [93] [94]\n\n\nAbortion\nIn November 2016, the State of Texas, at Abbott's request, approved new rules that require facilities that perform abortions either to bury or cremate the aborted, rather than dispose of the remains in a sanitary landfill [117] [118] The rules were intended to go into effect on December 19, [117] but on December 15 a federal judge blocked them from going into effect for at least one month after the Center for Reproductive Rights and other advocacy groups filed a lawsuit [119] On January 27, 2017, a federal judge ruled against the law, but the State of Texas vowed to appeal the ruling [120]\n\n\nConvention of States proposal\nIn 2016, Abbott spoke to the Texas Public Policy Foundation, calling for a Convention of States to amend the U.S Constitution In his speech, he proposed the Texas Plan, a series of nine new amendments to \"unravel the federal government's decades-long power grab \"to impose fiscal restraints on the federal government and limit the federal government's power and jurisdiction.\" The plan would limit the power of the federal government and expand states' rights, allowing the states to nullify federal law under some circumstances [129] [130]\n\n\nCriminal justice\nIn the wake of the George Floyd protests, Abbott called on candidates in the 2020 elections to \"back the blue.\" [134] In response to actions by some Texas cities to redirect funding from police to social services and emergency response, he threatened that the state of Texas would seize control of the local police departments [135] [134] In 2021, Abbott spearheaded legislative efforts to financially penalize cities in Texas that reduce spending on police [136]\n\n\nFirearms\nIn 2015, Abbott signed the campus carry (SB 11) and the open carry (HB 910) bills into law [140] The campus carry law came into effect later that year, allowing licensed carry of a concealed handgun on public college campuses, with private colleges able to opt out [140] [141] The open carry bill went into effect in 2016, allowing licensed open carry of a handgun in public areas and private businesses unless they display a \"30.07\" sign,

[145]\n\n\nJade Helm 15\nIn April 2015, Abbott asked the State Guard to monitor the military training exercise Jade Helm 15, amid Internet-fueled suspicions that the war simulation was really a hostile military takeover [160] [161] [162] [163] In 2018, former director of the CIA and NSA Michael Hayden said that Russian intelligence organizations had propagated the conspiracy theory and that Abbott's response convinced them of the power such a misinformation campaign could have in the United States [164]\n\n\nReligion\nIn 2015, Abbott signed the Pastor Protection Act, which allows members of the clergy to refuse to marry same-sex couples if they feel doing so violates their beliefs [165]\n\n\nImmigration and border security\nIn June 2015, Abbott signed a bill bolstering Texas's border security operations, including hiring additional state police, expanding the use of technology, and creating intelligence operations units [171] In November 2015, he announced that Texas would refuse Syrian refugees following the Paris terrorist attack earlier that month In December 2015, Abbott ordered the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to sue the federal government and the International Rescue Committee to block refugee settlement, but a federal district court struck the lawsuit down [172]\n\n\nBorder inspections\nIn early April 2022, Abbott announced that Texas would increase inspections of commercial trucks entering from Mexico with the goal of seizing illegal drugs and illegal migrants [213] Shortly thereafter, the inspections caused a multi-mile backup of commercial vehicles carrying produce, auto parts, household goods and many other items A spokesman for the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas said that up to 80% of perishable fruits and vegetables had been unable to cross and in some cases were in danger of spoiling The president of the Texas Trucking Association said the delays were affecting every kind of trucking and being felt across the country [214] Mexican truckers blockaded several bridges in protest [215] Under heavy pressure from Texas business owners, who strongly criticized the \"secondary inspections\", Abbott canceled the policy on April 15 He said the reversal was because the governors of adjacent Mexican states had agreed to exercise stronger vigilance against human trafficking, drugs, and guns [216]\n\n\nEnvironment\nAs of 2018 [update], Abbott rejects the scientific consensus on climate change He has said that the climate is changing, but does not accept the consensus that human activity is the main reason [218] [219]\n\n\nVoting rights\nAbbott pressed for a purge of nearly 100,000 registered voters from Texas voter rolls Texas officials initially claimed that the voters to be purged were not American citizens The purge was canceled in April 2018 after voting rights groups challenged the purge, and officials at the Office of the Texas Secretary of State admitted that tens of thousands of legal voters (naturalized citizens) were wrongly flagged for removal Abbott claimed that he played no role in the voter purge, but emails released in June 2019 showed that he was the driving force behind the effort [224]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nIn 2014, Abbott defended Texas's ban on same-sex marriage, which a federal court ruled unconstitutional [235] As attorney general of Texas, he argued that the prohibition on same-sex marriage incentivized that children would be born \"in the context of stable, lasting relationships.\" [235]\n\n\nHomelessness\nIn June 2019, the city of Austin introduced an ordinance that repealed a 25-year-old ban on homeless people camping, lying, or sleeping in public [247]  In October 2019, Abbott sent a widely publicized letter to Austin Mayor Steve Adler criticizing the camping ban repeal and threatened to deploy state resources to combat homelessness [248]\n\n\nMarijuana\nIn 2019, when numerous local prosecutors announced that they would stop prosecuting low-level marijuana offenses, Abbott instructed them to continue enforcing marijuana laws [250] [251] [252] The prosecutors cited recently passed legislation that legalized hemp As hemp contains the same chemical as marijuana, THC, tests at law enforcement's disposal cannot distinguish between marijuana usage and hemp usage [251] Abbott has said that legal hemp products come with a \"hemp certificate\" [251]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott issued a stay-at-home order from April 2 to May 1, 2020 [254] [255] This was one of the shortest stay-at-home orders implemented by any governor [255] After Texas started to reopen, COVID-19 surged, leading Abbott to pause the reopening [255] On June 24, Texas broke its record of new COVID-19 cases in a day [255] Critics described Abbott's pause as a half-measure and argued that he should reverse the reopening in full to limit the virus's spread [255]\n\n\nFebruary 2021 North American ice storm\nDuring the February 13–17, 2021 North American winter storm, power-plant failures across Texas left four million households in Texas without power [277] Abbott called for investigation and reform of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the electric grid operator for most of Texas [278]\n\n\nCollege diversity, equity, and inclusion\nIn the summer of 2023, Abbott signed into law Senate Bill 17, which prohibits Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) offices at Texas's public colleges and universities.\n\n\nPersonal life\nAbbott, a Catholic, is married to Cecilia Phalen Abbott, the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants [285] [286] [287] They were married in San Antonio in 1981 [3] His election as governor of Texas made her the first Latina to be First Lady of Texas since Texas joined the union [286] [288] They have one adopted daughter, Audrey [11] [285] [286] Cecilia is a former schoolteacher and principal [8]\n\n\nWheelchair use\nOn July 14, 1984, at age 26, Abbott was paralyzed below the waist when an oak tree fell on him while he was jogging after a storm [8] [289] Two steel rods were implanted in his spine, and he underwent extensive rehabilitation at TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston and has used a wheelchair ever since [290] [291] He sued the homeowner and a tree service company, resulting in an insurance settlement that provided him with lump sum payments every three years until 2022 along with monthly payments for life, both of which were adjusted for inflation [292] As of August 2013, the monthly payment was US$14,000 and the three-year lump sum payment was US$400,000, all tax-free [update] Abbott has said he relied on the money to pay for nearly three decades of medical expenses and other costs [292]\n\n\nElectoral

He said the reversal was because the governors of adjacent Mexican states had agreed to exercise stronger vigilance against human trafficking, drugs, and guns.\n\nEnvironment\n\nAs of 2018, Abbott rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. He has said that the climate is changing, but does not accept the consensus that human activity is the main reason.\n\nVoting Rights\n\nAbbott pressed for a purge of nearly 100,000 registered voters from Texas voter rolls. Texas officials initially claimed that the voters to be purged were not American citizens. The purge was canceled in April 2018 after voting rights groups challenged the purge, and officials at the Office of the Texas Secretary of State admitted that tens of thousands of legal voters (naturalized citizens) were wrongly flagged for removal. Abbott claimed that he played no role in the voter purge, but emails released in June 2019 showed that he was the driving force behind the effort.\n\nLGBT Rights\n\nIn 2014, Abbott defended Texas's ban on same-sex marriage, which a federal court ruled unconstitutional. As attorney general of Texas, he argued that the prohibition on same-sex marriage incentivized children to be born in the context of stable, lasting relationships.\n\nHomelessness\n\nIn June 2019, the city of Austin introduced an ordinance that repealed a 25-year-old ban on homeless people camping, lying, or sleeping in public. In October 2019, Abbott sent a widely publicized letter to Austin Mayor Steve Adler criticizing the camping ban repeal and threatened to deploy state resources to combat homelessness.\n\nMarijuana\n\nIn 2019, when numerous local prosecutors announced that they would stop prosecuting low-level marijuana offenses, Abbott instructed them to continue enforcing marijuana laws. The prosecutors cited recently passed legislation that legalized hemp. As hemp contains the same chemical as marijuana, THC, tests at law enforcement's disposal cannot distinguish between marijuana usage and hemp usage. Abbott has said that legal hemp products come with a \"hemp certificate.\"\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott issued a stay-at-home order from April 2 to May 1, 2020. This was one of the shortest stay-at-home orders implemented by any governor. After Texas started to reopen, COVID-19 surged, leading Abbott to pause the reopening. On June 24, Texas broke its record of new COVID-19 cases in a day. Critics described Abbott's pause as a half-measure and argued that he should reverse the reopening in full to limit the virus's spread.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAbbott, a Catholic, is married to Cecilia Phalen Abbott, the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants. They were married in San Antonio in 1981. His election as governor of Texas made her the first Latina to be First Lady of Texas since Texas joined the union. They have one adopted daughter, Audrey. Cecilia is a former schoolteacher and principal.\n\nWheelchair Use\n\nOn July 14, 1984, at age 26, Abbott was paralyzed below the waist when an oak tree fell on him while he was jogging after a storm. Two steel rods were implanted in his spine, and he underwent extensive rehabilitation at TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston and has used a wheelchair ever since. He sued the homeowner and a tree service company, resulting in an insurance settlement that provided him with lump sum payments every three years until 2022 along with monthly payments for life, both of which were adjusted for inflation. As of August 2013, the monthly payment was US$14,000 and the three-year lump sum payment was US$400,000, all tax-free. Abbott has said he relied on the money to pay for nearly three decades of medical expenses and other costs.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Greg_Abbott\"

Duncanville High School, [5] where he was on the track team, [6] in the National Honor Society and was voted \"Most Likely to Succeed\" [6]\n\n\nJudicial career\nAbbott's judicial career began in Houston, where he served as a state trial judge in the 129th District Court for three years [8]  Then-Governor George W Bush appointed Abbott to the Texas Supreme Court; he was then twice elected to the state's highest civil court—in 1996 (two-year term) and in 1998 (six-year term) In 1996, Abbott had no Democratic opponent but was challenged by Libertarian John B Hawley of Dallas Abbott defeated Hawley, 84% to 16% [9] In 1998, Abbott defeated Democrat David Van Os, 60% to 40% [10]\n\n\nAttorney General of Texas (2002–2015)\nAbbott resigned from the Texas Supreme Court in 2001 to run for lieutenant governor of Texas [3] He had been campaigning for several months when the previous attorney general, John Cornyn, vacated the post to run for the U.S Senate [3] Abbott then switched his campaign to the open attorney general's position in 2002 He defeated the Democratic nominee, former Austin mayor and former state senator [13] Kirk Watson, 57% to 41% [14] Abbott was sworn in on

Fugitive Unit, to track down convicted sex offenders in violation of their paroles or probations [3]\n\n\nLawsuit against Sony BMG\nIn late 2005, Abbott sued Sony BMG [26] [27] Texas was the first state in the nation to bring legal action against Sony BMG for illegal spyware [26] [27] The suit is also the first filed under the state's spyware law of 2005 [26] [27] It alleges the company surreptitiously installed the spyware on millions of compact music discs (CDs) that consumers inserted into their computers when they played the CDs, which can compromise the systems [27] [28] On December 21, 2005, Abbott added new allegations to his lawsuit against Sony-BMG He said the MediaMax copy protection technology violated Texas's spyware and deceptive trade practices laws [26] [29] Sony-BMG offered consumers a licensing agreement when they bought CDs and played them on their computers; [26] [29] in the lawsuit, brought under the Consumer Protection Against Computer Spyware Act of 2005 and other laws, Abbott alleged that even if consumers rejected that agreement, spyware was secretly installed on their computers, posing security risks for music buyers and deceiving Texas purchasers [26] [29] [30] Sony settled the Texas lawsuit, as well as a similar suit brought by California's attorney general, for $1.5 million [31]\n\n\nSeparation of church and state\nIn March 2005, Abbott delivered oral argument before the United States Supreme Court on behalf of Texas, defending a Ten Commandments monument on grounds of the Texas State Capitol Thousands of similar monuments were donated to cities and towns across the nation by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, who were inspired by the Cecil B DeMille film The Ten Commandments (1956) in following years [32] In his deposition, Abbott said, \"The Ten Commandments are a historically recognized system of law.\" [33] The Supreme Court held in a 5–4 decision that the Texas display did not violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause and was constitutional [34] After Abbott's oral arguments in Van Orden v Perry, Justice John Paul Stevens commented upon Abbott's performance while in a wheelchair, \"I want to thank you  [...] for demonstrating that it's not necessary to stand at the lectern in order to do a fine job.\" [6]\n\n\nFirearms\nIn 2015, Abbott signed the campus carry (SB 11) and the open carry (HB 910) bills into law [140] The campus carry law came into effect later that year, allowing licensed carry of a concealed handgun on public college campuses, with private colleges able to opt out [140] [141] The open carry bill went into effect in 2016, allowing licensed open carry of a handgun in public areas and private businesses unless they display a \"30.07\" sign, referring to state penal code 30.07, which states that a handgun may not be carried openly even by a licensed gun carrier To do so is considered trespassing [140] [141] [142] Texas is the 45th state to have open carry [143] In 2017, Abbott signed into law a bill lowering handgun carry license fees [144] In 2021, he signed into law a bill that allowed Texans to carry guns without a license [145]\n\n\nTort reform\nAbbott backed legislation in Texas to limit \"punitive damages stemming from noneconomic losses\" and \"noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases\" at $750,000 and $250,000, respectively [38] While the settlement in his own paralysis case was a \"nonmedical liability lawsuit\", which remains uncapped, Abbott has faced criticism, generally from Democrats who oppose the Republican-backed lawsuit curbs, for \"tilt [ing] the judicial scales toward civil defendants.\" [38]\n\n\nSupport for ban on sex toys\nAs attorney general, Abbott unsuccessfully defended Texas's ban on sex toys [39] He said Texas had a legitimate interest in \"discouraging prurient interests in autonomous sex and the pursuit of sexual gratification unrelated to procreation.\" [39]\n\n\nOpposition to same-sex marriage\nAs attorney general, Abbott defended the state's ban on same-sex marriage from a constitutional challenge [40] In 2014, he argued in court that Texas should be allowed to prohibit same-sex marriage because LGBT individuals cannot procreate He said that as \"same-sex relationships do not naturally produce children, recognizing same-sex marriage does not further these goals to the same extent that recognizing opposite-sex marriage does.\" [39] He also argued that gay people are still free to marry, saying they are \"as free to marry an opposite-sex spouse as anyone else\" [39] He suggested that same-sex marriage led to a slippery slope in which \"any conduct that has been traditionally prohibited can become a constitutional right simply by redefining it at a higher level of abstraction.\" [39]\n\n\n2006 election\nIn the November 7, 2006, general election, Abbott was challenged by civil rights attorney David Van Os, who had been his Democratic opponent in the 1998 election for state Supreme Court He was reelected to a second term with 60% to Van Os's 37% [43]\n\n\n2010 election\nAbbott ran for a third term in 2010 He defeated the Democratic nominee, attorney Barbara Ann Radnofsky, with 64% of the vote to her 34% [44] He was the longest-serving Texas attorney general in Texas history [45]\n\n\nGubernatorial elections\nIn July 2013, shortly after Governor Rick Perry announced that he would not seek a fourth full term, [47] Abbott announced his candidacy for governor of Texas in the 2014 election [48] In the first six months of 2011, he raised more money for his campaign than any other previous Texas politician, reaching $1.6 million The next-highest fundraiser among state officeholders was Texas comptroller Susan Combs, with $611,700 [49]\n\n\n2014 election\nIn July 2013, shortly after Governor Rick Perry announced that he would not seek a fourth full term, [47] Abbott announced his candidacy for governor of Texas in the 2014 election [48] In the first six months of 2011, he raised more money for his campaign than any other previous Texas politician, reaching $1.6 million The next-highest fundraiser among state officeholders was Texas comptroller Susan Combs, with $611,700 [49]\n\n\n2018 election\nIn January 2017, Abbott was reportedly raising funds for a 2018 reelection bid as governor; as of December 2016 [update], he had $34.4 million on hand for his campaign, of which he had raised $9 million during the second half of 2016 [67] [68] Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick had been mentioned as a potential challenger, but confirmed that he would run for reelection as lieutenant governor [68] During the weekend of January 21, 2017, Abbott said that he intended to run for reelection [69] He confirmed this on March 28, 2017 [70]\n\n\n2022 election\nAbbott ran for a third term and faced challengers from within his own party, [79] [80] including former Texas Republican Party chair Allen West and Don Huffines [81] [82] On March 1, he won the primary with over 66% of the vote He was challenged by the Democratic nominee, former U.S Representative Beto O'Rourke [83] Abbott began with a large campaign funding advantage over his opponents, but was outraised by O'Rourke, who raised $81.6 million to Abbott's $78.5 million [84] [85]\n\n\n2026 election\nAccording to the Austin American Statesman, advisers close to Abbott have said he has not ruled out running for a fourth term in 2026, which would make him the longest-serving governor in state history with 16 years of service by January 21, 2031, surpassing former governor Rick Perry's 14 years [88]\n\n\nTenure as governor (2015–present)\nAbbott was sworn in as governor of Texas on January 20, 2015, succeeding Rick Perry [90] [91] He is the first governor of Texas and the third elected governor of a U.S state to use a wheelchair, after Franklin D Roosevelt of New York (1929–1932) and George Wallace of Alabama (1963–1967, 1971–1979; 1983–1987) [92] [93] [94]\n\n\nAbortion\nIn November 2016, the State of Texas, at Abbott's request, approved new rules that require facilities that perform abortions either to bury or cremate the aborted, rather than dispose of the remains in a sanitary landfill [117] [118] The rules were intended to go into effect on December 19, [117] but on December 15 a federal judge blocked them from going into effect for at least one month after the Center for Reproductive Rights and other advocacy groups filed a lawsuit [119] On January 27, 2017, a federal judge ruled against the law, but the State of Texas vowed to appeal the ruling [120]\n\n\nConvention of States proposal\nIn 2016, Abbott spoke to the Texas Public Policy Foundation, calling for a Convention of States to amend the U.S Constitution In his speech, he proposed the Texas Plan, a series of nine new amendments to \"unravel the federal government's decades-long power grab \"to impose fiscal restraints on the federal government and limit the federal government's power and jurisdiction.\" The plan would limit the power of the federal government and expand states' rights, allowing the states to nullify federal law under some circumstances [129] [130]\n\n\nCriminal justice\nIn the wake of the George Floyd protests, Abbott called on candidates in the 2020 elections to \"back the blue.\" [134] In response to actions by some Texas cities to redirect funding from police to social services and emergency response, he threatened that the state of Texas would seize control of the local police departments [135] [134] In 2021, Abbott spearheaded legislative efforts to financially penalize cities in Texas that reduce spending on police [136]\n\n\nFirearms\nIn 2015, Abbott signed the campus carry (SB 11) and the open carry (HB 910) bills into law [140] The campus carry law came into effect later that year, allowing licensed carry of a concealed handgun on public college campuses, with private colleges able to opt out [140] [141] The open carry bill went into effect in 2016, allowing licensed open carry of a handgun in public areas and private businesses unless they display a \"30.07\" sign,

[145]\n\n\nJade Helm 15\nIn April 2015, Abbott asked the State Guard to monitor the military training exercise Jade Helm 15, amid Internet-fueled suspicions that the war simulation was really a hostile military takeover [160] [161] [162] [163] In 2018, former director of the CIA and NSA Michael Hayden said that Russian intelligence organizations had propagated the conspiracy theory and that Abbott's response convinced them of the power such a misinformation campaign could have in the United States [164]\n\n\nReligion\nIn 2015, Abbott signed the Pastor Protection Act, which allows members of the clergy to refuse to marry same-sex couples if they feel doing so violates their beliefs [165]\n\n\nImmigration and border security\nIn June 2015, Abbott signed a bill bolstering Texas's border security operations, including hiring additional state police, expanding the use of technology, and creating intelligence operations units [171] In November 2015, he announced that Texas would refuse Syrian refugees following the Paris terrorist attack earlier that month In December 2015, Abbott ordered the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to sue the federal government and the International Rescue Committee to block refugee settlement, but a federal district court struck the lawsuit down [172]\n\n\nBorder inspections\nIn early April 2022, Abbott announced that Texas would increase inspections of commercial trucks entering from Mexico with the goal of seizing illegal drugs and illegal migrants [213] Shortly thereafter, the inspections caused a multi-mile backup of commercial vehicles carrying produce, auto parts, household goods and many other items A spokesman for the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas said that up to 80% of perishable fruits and vegetables had been unable to cross and in some cases were in danger of spoiling The president of the Texas Trucking Association said the delays were affecting every kind of trucking and being felt across the country [214] Mexican truckers blockaded several bridges in protest [215] Under heavy pressure from Texas business owners, who strongly criticized the \"secondary inspections\", Abbott canceled the policy on April 15 He said the reversal was because the governors of adjacent Mexican states had agreed to exercise stronger vigilance against human trafficking, drugs, and guns

were not American citizens The purge was canceled in April 2018 after voting rights groups challenged the purge, and officials at the Office of the Texas Secretary of State admitted that tens of thousands of legal voters (naturalized citizens) were wrongly flagged for removal Abbott claimed that he played no role in the voter purge, but emails released in June 2019 showed that he was the driving force behind the effort [224]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nIn 2014, Abbott defended Texas's ban on same-sex marriage, which a federal court ruled unconstitutional [235] As attorney general of Texas, he argued that the prohibition on same-sex marriage incentivized that children would be born \"in the context of stable, lasting relationships.\" [235]\n\n\nHomelessness\nIn June 2019, the city of Austin introduced an ordinance that repealed a 25-year-old ban on homeless people camping, lying, or sleeping in public [247]  In October 2019, Abbott sent a widely publicized letter to Austin Mayor Steve

orders implemented by any governor [255] After Texas started to reopen, COVID-19 surged, leading Abbott to pause the reopening [255] On June 24, Texas broke its record of new COVID-19 cases in a day [255] Critics described Abbott's pause as a half-measure and argued that he should reverse the reopening in full to limit the virus's spread [255]\n\n\nFebruary 2021 North American ice storm\nDuring the February 13–17, 2021 North American winter storm, power-plant failures across Texas left four million households in Texas without power [277] Abbott called for investigation and reform of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the electric grid operator for most of Texas [278]\n\n\nCollege diversity, equity, and inclusion\nIn the summer of 2023, Abbott signed into law Senate Bill 17, which prohibits Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) offices at Texas's public colleges and universities.\n\n\nPersonal life\nAbbott, a Catholic, is married to Cecilia Phalen Abbott, the

{"title": "Joseph_James_DeAngelo", "content": "\nEarly life and career\nJoseph James DeAngelo Jr was born on November 8, 1945, in Bath, New York, to Kathleen \"Kay\" Louise DeGroat (June 30, 1923 – August 21, 2010) and Joseph James DeAngelo Sr (January 19, 1920 – February 15, 1995), a sergeant in the United States Army [27] [28] He was of Italian ancestry and had two older sisters, Connie and Rebecca, and a younger brother, John [29] A relative reported that when DeAngelo was a young child, he witnessed the rape of Connie by two airmen in a warehouse in West Germany, where the family was stationed at the time [30] Following DeAngelo's conviction, Rebecca claimed that he was abused by their father while he was growing up [31]\n\n\nPolice officer\nFrom May 1973 to August 1976, DeAngelo was a burglary unit police officer in Exeter, having relocated from Citrus Heights [32] He then served in Auburn from August 1976 to July 1979, when he was arrested for shoplifting a hammer and dog repellent; he was sentenced to six months of probation and fired that October [39] [40] During the process of being fired, DeAngelo threatened to kill the chief of police and allegedly stalked the chief's house [39]\n\n\nMarriage and relationships\nIn May 1970, DeAngelo became engaged to nursing student Bonnie Jean Colwell, a classmate at Sierra College, but she ended the relationship in 1971 after he became manipulative and abusive, [41] culminating in his demand that she help him cheat on an abnormal psychology test [42] After the break-up, he attempted to force her to marry him by threatening her with a gun [39] [43] [44]\n\n\nOther employment\nDeAngelo's employment history during the 1980s is unknown [39] From 1990 until his retirement in 2017, he worked as a truck mechanic at a Save Mart Supermarkets distribution center in Roseville [32] [51] He was arrested in 1996 for failing to pay for gas, but the charge was dismissed [52]\n\n\nLoud outbursts\nDeAngelo's brother-in-law claimed that DeAngelo would casually bring up the East Area Rapist in conversation around the time of the original crimes Neighbors also reported that he would frequently engage in loud, profane outbursts [40] One neighbor reported that his family received a phone message from DeAngelo threatening to \"deliver a load of death\" because of their barking dog [53] He was living with a daughter and granddaughter at the time of his arrest [39]\n\n\nCrimes\nDNA evidence linked DeAngelo to eight murders in Goleta, Ventura, Dana Point, and Irvine; two other murders in Goleta, lacking DNA evidence, were linked by modus operandi [54] [55] DeAngelo pleaded guilty to three other murders: two in Rancho Cordova and one in Visalia He also committed more than 50 known rapes in the California counties of Sacramento, Contra Costa, Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Alameda, Santa Clara, and Yolo; and he was linked to hundreds of incidents of thefts, burglaries, vandalism, peeping, stalking, and prowling [56]\n\n\nVisalia Ransacker (1974–1976)\nIt was long suspected that the training ground of the criminal who became the East Area Rapist was Visalia [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] Earlier Visalia crimes dating back as early as May 1973 and other sprees like that of the \"Cordova Cat Burglar\" and the \"Exeter Ransacker\", [62] [63] as well as Visalia burglaries that took place after the shooting of Detective William McGowen (see below under \"Shootings\"), are now suspected to be linked also [64] [65] Over a period of 20 months, DeAngelo is believed to have been responsible for one murder and around 120 burglaries [66]\n\n\nBurglaries\nThe first recorded ransacking occurred on March 19, 1974, when a sum of $50 in coins was stolen from a piggy bank [71] Most of the Ransacker's activities involved breaking into houses, rifling through or vandalizing the owner's possessions, scattering women's underclothes and stealing a range of low-value items while often ignoring banknotes and higher-valued items in plain sight [72] The Ransacker would also often arrange or display items in the house Items emptied included piggy banks and coin jars; and stolen items often included Blue Chip Stamps, foreign or historic coins, and personal items (such as single earrings, cuff-links, rings, or medallions) but also included six weapons and various types of ammunition [71] [73] [74] Multiple same-day ransackings were common as well, [75] [76] including 12 separate incidents on November 30, 1974 [71] Common characteristics of the burglaries included: [77] [71] [78]\n\n\nShootings\nOn September 11, 1975, DeAngelo broke into the home of Claude Snelling, 45 Snelling, a journalism professor at the College of the Sequoias, had previously chased a prowler discovered under his 16-year-old daughter's bedroom window around 10:00 p.m on February 5, 1975 [71] On September 11, he was awakened around 2:00 a.m by strange noises [79] Upon leaving his bedroom, Snelling ran through the open back door and confronted a ski-masked intruder in his carport attempting to kidnap his daughter, who had been subdued with threats of being stabbed or shot [80] Snelling was then shot twice, staggered back into the house to his wife, and later died [72] [81] After the shooting, the assailant punched and kicked the daughter, leaving her on the ground, and fled the scene [82] A stolen bicycle, tied to the assailant, was found nearby at 615 Redwood Street [72] After the murder, Beth Snelling, 16, underwent hypnosis in order to gather further details [81] The Visalia police also committed more resources to apprehending the Ransacker, [79] and a $4,000 reward was posted Nighttime stakeouts were set up near houses that he had previously prowled, but the ransackings continued.\n\n\nEast Area Rapist (1976–1979)\nDeAngelo moved to the Sacramento area in 1976, where his crimes escalated from burglary to rape The crimes initially centered on the then-unincorporated areas of Carmichael, Citrus Heights, and Rancho Cordova, east of Sacramento [7] His initial modus operandi was to stalk middle-class neighborhoods at night in search of women who were alone in one-story homes, usually near a school, creek, trail or other open space that would provide a quick escape [88] He was seen a number of times but always successfully fled; on one occasion, he shot and seriously wounded a young pursuer.\n\n\nRapes\nA young Sacramento couple—21-year-old Brian Keith Maggiore, a military policeman at Mather Air Force Base, and his 20-year-old wife Katie Lee Maggiore—were walking their dog in the Rancho Cordova area on the night of February 2, 1978, near where five East Area Rapist attacks had occurred [136] The Maggiores fled after a confrontation in the street but were chased down and shot to death [137] Some investigators suspected that they had been murdered by the East Area Rapist because of their proximity to the other attacks' locations, and a shoelace was found nearby The FBI announced on June 15, 2016, that it was confident that the East Area Rapist had murdered the Maggiores [138] On June 29, 2020, DeAngelo entered a plea of guilty to these murders [139]\n\n\nMaggiore murders\nA young Sacramento couple—21-year-old Brian Keith Maggiore, a military policeman at Mather Air Force Base, and his 20-year-old wife Katie Lee Maggiore—were walking their dog in the Rancho Cordova area on the night of February 2, 1978, near where five East Area Rapist attacks had occurred [136] The Maggiores fled after a confrontation in the street but were chased down and shot to death [137] Some investigators suspected that they had been murdered by the East Area Rapist because of their proximity to the other attacks' locations, and a shoelace was found nearby The FBI announced on June 15, 2016, that it was confident that the East Area Rapist had murdered the Maggiores [138] On June 29, 2020, DeAngelo entered a plea of guilty to these murders [139]\n\n\nOriginal Night Stalker (1979–1986)\nShortly after the rape committed on July 5, 1979, DeAngelo moved to Southern California and began killing his victims, first striking in Santa Barbara County in October The attacks lasted until 1981, with a lone 1986 attack Only the couple in the first attack survived, alerting neighbors and forcing the intruder to flee; the other victims were murdered by gunshot or bludgeoning Since DeAngelo was not linked to these crimes for decades, he was known as the Night Stalker in the area, before being renamed the Original Night Stalker after serial killer Richard Ramirez received the former nickname [140]\n\n\n1979\nOn October 1, an intruder broke in and tied up a Goleta couple Alarmed at hearing him say, \"I'll kill 'em\" to himself, [10] the man and woman tried to escape when he left the room, and the woman screamed Realizing that the alarm had been raised, the intruder fled on a bicycle [10] A neighbor (an FBI agent) responded to the noise and pursued the perpetrator, who abandoned the bicycle and a knife and escaped on foot through local backyards.\n\n\n1980\nOn March 13, 33-year-old interior designer Charlene Smith and 43-year-old attorney Lyman Smith were found murdered in their Ventura home;

the same knot was noted in the East Area Rapist attacks, at least one confirmed case of which was publicly known [2] The murderer was, therefore, briefly given the name Diamond Knot Killer [151]\n\n\n1981\nOn February 6, 28-year-old Manuela Witthuhn was raped and murdered in her Irvine home [10] [154] Although Witthuhn's body had signs of being tied before she was bludgeoned, [10] no murder weapon or ligatures were found Though the victim was married, her husband was away, hospitalized; and she was alone at the time of the attack [154]\n\n\n1986\nOn May 4, 18-year-old Janelle Lisa Cruz was found dead after she was raped [55] [147] and bludgeoned in her Irvine home [160] Her family was on vacation in Mexico at the time of the attack The house was for sale and her body was discovered by a realtor who stopped by to show the house to a prospective buyer Janelle's body was found on her bed, beaten beyond recognition, with her teeth found in both her hair and lungs [10] [154] A pipe wrench, reported missing by Cruz's stepfather, was thought to be the murder weapon.\n\n\nOther suspected murders\nAfter DeAngelo was arrested, he was also suspected of committing the 1974 Visalia rape and murder of Jennifer Armour, the 1975 Exeter rape and murder of Donna Jo Richmond, and a 1978 murder of a woman and her son in Simi Valley, but was cleared as a suspect in all four murders by DNA testing [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] [166] Victoria Police ruled out a link between DeAngelo, who docked in Australia during his Navy service, and the Melbourne serial child rapist and murderer known as \"Mr Cruel\" [167]\n\n\nCommunications\nIn December 1977, someone claiming to be the East Area Rapist sent a poem, \"Excitement's Crave\", to The Sacramento Bee, the Sacramento mayor's office, and television station KVIE On December 11, a masked man eluded pursuit by law-enforcement personnel after alerting authorities by telephone that he would strike on Watt Avenue that night: [168]\n\n\nWritten\nIn December 1977, someone claiming to be the East Area Rapist sent a poem, \"Excitement's Crave\", to The Sacramento Bee, the Sacramento mayor's office, and television station KVIE On December 11, a masked man eluded pursuit by law-enforcement personnel after alerting authorities by telephone that he would strike on Watt Avenue that night: [168]\n\n\n\"Excitement's Crave\" poem\nIn December 1977, someone claiming to be the East Area Rapist sent a poem, \"Excitement's Crave\", to The Sacramento Bee, the Sacramento mayor's office, and television station KVIE On December 11, a masked man eluded pursuit by law-enforcement personnel after alerting authorities by telephone that he would strike on Watt Avenue that night: [168]\n\n\nHomework pages and punishment map (December 9, 1978)\nDuring the investigation in Danville of the 42nd attack, investigators discovered three sheets of notebook paper near where a suspicious vehicle had reportedly been parked They believe the pages were dropped accidentally, perhaps by falling out of a bag [6] The first sheet appears to be a homework essay on General George Armstrong Custer [6]\n\n\nPhone calls\nOn March 18, 1977, the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office received three calls from a man claiming to be the East Area Rapist;

he asked, \"Remember when we played?\" [175]\n\n\nInvestigation\nBefore officially connecting the Original Night Stalker to the East Area Rapist in 2001, some law-enforcement officials (particularly from the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department) sought to link the Goleta cases as well [176] The links were primarily due to similarities in modus operandi One of the already-linked Original Night Stalker double murders occurred in Ventura, 40 miles (64 km) southeast of Goleta; and the remaining murders were committed in Orange County, an additional 90 miles (140 km) southeast In 2001, several rapes in Contra Costa County believed to have been committed by the East Area Rapist were linked by DNA to the Smith, Harrington, Witthuhn, and Cruz murders A decade later, DNA evidence indicated that the Domingo–Sanchez murders were also committed by the East Area Rapist (also identified as the Golden State Killer) [17] [177]\n\n\nArrest, trial and incarceration\nOn the evening of April 24, 2018, Sacramento County Sheriff's deputies arrested DeAngelo in the side yard of his Sacramento home [191] [192] He was charged with eight counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances [16] [193] On May 10, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney's office charged DeAngelo with four additional counts of first-degree murder [194] DeAngelo made a confession of sorts after his arrest that cryptically referred to an inner personality named \"Jerry\", who had forced him to commit the wave of crimes that ended abruptly in 1986 \n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nLiterature\n\n\nPeriodicals\n\n\nPodcasts\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nAcademic articles\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Joseph James DeAngelo\n\nJoseph James DeAngelo Jr. is a former American police officer and convicted serial killer, rapist, and burglar.

and at 2:30 a.m., a masked man eluded officers after being seen bicycling on the Watt Avenue bridge When spotted again at 4:30 a.m., he discarded the bicycle and fled on foot [168]\n\n\n\"Gonna kill you\" (January 2, 1978)\nThe first known rape victim received a wrong-number call asking for \"Ray\" on January 2, 1978 The call was recorded, and police suspect that it may have been the same caller who made a threatening call to her later that evening [172] That call was also recorded and identified by the victim as the voice of her assailant [6] The caller said, \"Gonna kill you .. gonna kill you .. gonna kill you .. bitch .. bitch .. bitch .. bitch .. fuckin' whore.\" [90]\n\n\nCounseling service (January 6, 1978)\nA man claiming to be the East Area Rapist called the Contact Counseling Service and said, \"I have a problem I need help because I don't want to do this anymore.\" After a short conversation, the caller said, \"I believe you are tracing this call\" and hung up [173]\n\n\nLater calls (1982–1991)\nIn 1982, a previous victim received a call at her place of work—a Denny's restaurant—during which the rapist threatened to rape her again According to Contra Costa County investigator Paul Holes, the rapist must have chanced to patronize the restaurant and recognized his victim there [174] [175]\n\n\nFinal call (2001)\nOn April 6, 2001, one day after an article in The Sacramento Bee linked the Original Night Stalker and the East Area Rapist, a victim of the rapist received a call from him; he asked, \"Remember when we played?\" [175]\n\n\nInvestigation\nBefore officially connecting the Original Night Stalker to the East Area Rapist in 2001, some law-enforcement officials (particularly from the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department) sought to link the Goleta cases as well [176] The links were primarily due to similarities in modus operandi One of the already-linked Original Night Stalker double murders occurred in Ventura, 40 miles (64 km) southeast of Goleta; and the remaining murders were committed in Orange County, an additional 90 miles (140 km) southeast In 2001, several rapes in Contra Costa County believed to have been committed by the East Area Rapist were linked by DNA to the Smith, Harrington, Witthuhn, and Cruz murders A decade later, DNA evidence indicated that the Domingo–Sanchez murders were also committed by the East Area Rapist (also identified as the Golden State Killer) [17] [177]\n\n\nArrest, trial and incarceration\nOn the evening of April 24, 2018, Sacramento County Sheriff's deputies arrested DeAngelo in the side yard of his Sacramento home [191] [192] He was charged with eight counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances [16] [193] On May 10, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney's office charged DeAngelo with four additional counts of first-degree murder [194] DeAngelo made a confession of sorts after his arrest that cryptically referred to an inner personality named \"Jerry\", who had forced him to commit the wave of crimes that ended abruptly in 1986 \n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nLiterature\n\n\nPeriodicals\n\n\nPodcasts\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nAcademic articles\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It is the successor of Log4j 1 and was rewritten from scratch, drawing inspiration from existing logging solutions, including Log4j 1 and java.util.logging. Log4j 2 has undergone significant improvements and enhancements, making it a widely used and popular logging framework in the Java ecosystem.\n\n**Features**\n\nLog4j 2 offers a range of features that make it an attractive choice for logging in Java applications. The framework provides a flexible and customizable logging system that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of an application. Some of the key features of Log4j 2 include:\n\n* **Built-in log levels**: Log4j 2 provides a set of built-in log levels, which can be used to categorize log messages based on their severity. The built-in log levels include TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, and OFF.\n* **Custom log levels**: Log4j 2 allows users to define custom log levels, which can be used to create a more nuanced logging system.\n* **Log4j configuration**: Log4j 2 can be configured through a configuration file or through Java code. The configuration file can be written in XML, JSON, YAML, or properties file format.\n* **Loggers**: Loggers are the core component of the Log4j 2 framework. They are responsible for managing the logging process and can be configured to log messages to various destinations.\n* **Appenders**: Appenders are responsible for writing log messages to a specific destination, such as a file, console, or network socket.\n\n**Log4j Log Levels**\n\nLog4j 2 provides a set of built-in log levels that can be used to categorize log messages based on their severity. The built-in log levels are listed below, in decreasing order of severity:\n\n| Log Level | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| FATAL | The highest level of severity, indicating a critical error that requires immediate attention. |\n| ERROR | Indicates a serious error that may require corrective action. |\n| WARN | Warns about a potential problem or unexpected situation. |\n| INFO | Provides general information about the application or system. |\n| DEBUG | Provides detailed information about the application or system, typically used for debugging purposes. |\n| TRACE | The lowest level of severity, providing very detailed information about the application or system. |\n\n**Custom Log Levels**\n\nLog4j 2 allows users to define custom log levels, which can be used to create a more nuanced logging system. Custom log levels can be defined using the `createCustomLogger` method, which takes a log level as an argument. The custom log level can then be used in the same way as the built-in log levels.\n\n**Log4j Configuration**\n\nLog4j 2 can be configured through a configuration file or through Java code. The configuration file can be written in XML, JSON, YAML, or properties file format. The configuration file is used to define the logging settings, including the log levels, loggers, and appenders.\n\n**Example for Log4j 2**\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to configure Log4j 2 using a properties file:\n```\nlog4j.rootCategory=INFO, file, console\n\nlog4j.appender.file=org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\nlog4j.appender.file.fileName=/var/log/app.log\nlog4j.appender.file.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\nlog4j.appender.file.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %c{1} - %m%n\n\nlog4j.appender.console=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\nlog4j.appender.console.target=System.out\nlog4j.appender.console.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\nlog4j.appender.console.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %c{1} - %m%n\n```\nThis configuration file defines a root logger that logs messages at the INFO level to both a file and the console.\n\n**Ports**\n\nLog4j 2 provides a range of ports that can be used to log messages to different destinations. The following ports are available:\n\n* **File Appender**: This port can be used to log messages to a file.\n* **Console Appender**: This port can be used to log messages to the console.\n* **Network Socket Appender**: This port can be used to log messages to a network socket.\n\n**Log4Shell Vulnerability**\n\nA zero-day vulnerability involving remote code execution in Log4j 2, given the descriptor \"Log4Shell\" (CVE-2021-44228), was found and reported to Apache by Alibaba on November 24, 2021, and published in a tweet on December 9, 2021. Affected services include Cloudflare, iCloud, Minecraft: Java Edition, Steam, Tencent QQ, and Twitter. The Apache Software Foundation assigned the maximum CVSS severity rating of 10 to Log4Shell, as millions of servers could be potentially vulnerable to the exploit. The vulnerability was characterized by cybersecurity firm Tenable as \"the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade\" and Lunasec's Free Wortley characterized it as \"a design failure of catastrophic proportions\".\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Apache Log4j 1\n* Java Util Logging\n* Logging frameworks\n\n**References**\n\n* Apache Log4j 2 website\n* Log4j 2 documentation\n* Log4j 2 configuration file format\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* \"Apache Log4j 2: A Comprehensive Guide\" by Packt Publishing\n* \"Log4j 2: A Practical Guide\" by Manning Publications\n* \"Java Logging: A Guide to Log4j 2\" by O'Reilly Media\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Apache Log4j 2 GitHub repository\n* Log4j 2 documentation wiki\n* Log4j 2 mailing list", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Log4j\" following this outline:\n\n\nApache Log4j 2\nApache Log4j 2 is the successor of Log4j 1 which was released as GA version in July 2015 The framework was rewritten from scratch and has been inspired by existing logging solutions, including Log4j 1 and java.util.logging The main differences [14] [15] from Log4j 1 are:\n\n\nFeatures\nThe following table defines the built-in log levels and messages in Log4j, in decreasing order of severity The left column lists the log level designation in Log4j and the right column provides a brief description of each log level.\n\n\nLog4j log levels\nThe following table defines the built-in log levels and messages in Log4j, in decreasing order of severity The left column lists the log level designation in Log4j and the right column provides a brief description of each log level.\n\n\nCustom log levels\nLog4j 2 allows users to define their own log levels [19] A source code generator tool is provided to create Loggers that support custom log levels identically to the built-in log levels Custom log levels can either complement or replace the built-in log levels.\n\n\nLog4j configuration\nLog4j can be configured [20] through a configuration file or through Java code Configuration files can be written in XML, JSON, YAML, or properties file format Three main components can be defined: Loggers, Appenders, and Layouts Configuring logging via a file has the advantage that logging can be turned on or off without modifying the application that uses Log4j The application can be allowed to run with logging off until there's a problem, for example, and then logging can be turned back on simply by modifying the configuration file.\n\n\nExample for Log4j 2\nTTCC is a message format used by log4j [28]  TTCC is an acronym for Time Thread Category Component  It uses the following pattern:\n\n\nExample for Log4j 1.2\nTTCC is a message format used by log4j [28]  TTCC is an acronym for Time Thread Category Component  It uses the following pattern:\n\n\nTTCC\nTTCC is a message format used by log4j [28]  TTCC is an acronym for Time Thread Category Component  It uses the following pattern:\n\n\nPorts\nA zero-day vulnerability involving remote code execution in Log4j 2, given the descriptor \"Log4Shell\" (CVE-2021-44228), was found and reported to Apache by Alibaba on November 24, 2021, and published in a tweet on December 9, 2021 [12] Affected services include Cloudflare, iCloud, Minecraft: Java Edition, [42] Steam, Tencent QQ, and Twitter [43] [44] [45] The Apache Software Foundation assigned the maximum CVSS severity rating of 10 to Log4Shell, as millions of servers could be potentially vulnerable to the exploit [45] The vulnerability was characterized by cybersecurity firm Tenable as \"the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade\" [13] and Lunasec's Free Wortley characterized it as \"a design failure of catastrophic proportions\" [46]\n\n\nLog4Shell vulnerability\nA zero-day vulnerability involving remote code execution in Log4j 2, given the descriptor \"Log4Shell\" (CVE-2021-44228), was found and reported to Apache by Alibaba on November 24, 2021, and published in a tweet on December 9, 2021 [12] Affected services include Cloudflare, iCloud, Minecraft: Java Edition, [42] Steam, Tencent QQ, and Twitter [43] [44] [45] The Apache Software Foundation assigned the maximum CVSS severity rating of 10 to Log4Shell, as millions of servers could be potentially vulnerable to the exploit [45] The vulnerability was characterized by cybersecurity firm Tenable as \"the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade\" [13] and Lunasec's Free Wortley characterized it as \"a design failure of catastrophic proportions\" [46]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

However, after a series of injuries depleted the team's depth, Reeves was moved to halfback, a position he played for several seasons. Reeves also received offers to play Major League Baseball with the Pittsburgh Pirates, but he ultimately decided to focus on his football career.\n\n**Coaching Career**\n\nReeves' coaching career began in the 1960s, when he worked as an assistant coach for the Detroit Lions. He later joined the Dallas Cowboys as an assistant coach and worked under the legendary coach Tom Landry. Reeves was a protégé of Landry's and learned much of what he knew about the game from him. In 1981, Reeves became the youngest head coach in the NFL when he joined the Denver Broncos as vice president and head coach.\n\nUnder Reeves' leadership, the Broncos became one of the most successful teams in the NFL. He guided the team to six post-season appearances, five divisional titles, three AFC championships, and three Super Bowl appearances (Super Bowl XXI, Super Bowl XXII, and Super Bowl XXIV). Reeves was the only AFC coach in the decade of the 1980s to lead his team to consecutive Super Bowl berths, and his Broncos appeared in the Super Bowl three times during a span of four years.\n\n**Relationship with John Elway**\n\nReeves had a close relationship with quarterback John Elway, who was acquired by the Broncos in a trade in 1983. Elway was a talented player who was known for his leadership and competitive drive. Reeves and Elway had a strong working relationship, and Elway credited Reeves with helping him develop as a player. However, the two did not always see eye-to-eye, and there were tensions in their relationship. In 1991, Reeves fired offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Mike Shanahan for \"insubordination,\" which was seen as a move to distance himself from Elway. The two had a complicated relationship, and Elway later said that his relationship with Reeves was \"the worst.\"\n\n**Firing and Legacy**\n\nReeves was fired as head coach of the Broncos after the 1992 season. He was replaced by his protégé and friend Wade Phillips, who was previously the team's defensive coordinator. Despite his departure from the Broncos, Reeves remained in the NFL and worked as a color analyst for Westwood One radio. He covered several NFL games, including several Super Bowls. When Reeves passed away in 2022, Elway paid tribute to him, saying that Reeves was a \"winner\" and that he owed a good deal of his career to Reeves.\n\n**Head Coaching Record**\n\nReeves had a successful head coaching career, with a record of 142-110-1. He coached the Broncos from 1981 to 1992 and led the team to several post-season appearances and championships.\n\n**Broadcast Career**\n\nReeves began his broadcasting career in the 1990s, when he started working as a color analyst for Westwood One radio. He covered several NFL games, including several Super Bowls. Reeves was paired with play-by-play man Bill Rosinski, and the two made a successful team. Reeves brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to the broadcast booth, and he was known for his insightful commentary and analysis.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nReeves was married to Pam Reeves, and the couple had three children and six grandchildren. Reeves was a Christian and was known for his strong faith. He and his wife were residents of Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey, while he was coaching for the Giants. Reeves passed away in 2022, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most successful coaches in NFL history.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Books on Dan Reeves:\n\t+ \"Dan Reeves: A Life of Football\" by John Elway\n\t+ \"Reeves: The Man and His Game\" by Mike Shanahan\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Dan Reeves at Pro-Football-Reference.com\n* Dan Reeves at ESPN.com\n* Dan Reeves at the Denver Broncos' official website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dan_Reeves\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly years\nBorn in Rome, Georgia, Reeves grew up in Americus, Georgia He attended Americus High School, where he participated in football, baseball, and basketball [2]\n\n\nCollege career\nReeves played college football for the South Carolina Gamecocks, where he was a three-year starter at quarterback from 1962 to 1964 Reeves became the starting quarterback during his sophomore year in 1962 and was named second-team All-conference after his junior and senior years [4] [5]\n\n\nProfessional playing career\nAlthough he went undrafted after graduation, Reeves received professional sports offers from the Dallas Cowboys in the National Football League (NFL), the San Diego Chargers in the American Football League (AFL) and the Pittsburgh Pirates in Major League Baseball Reeves signed with the Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 1965 to play safety, but was later moved to halfback when a series of injuries depleted the team's depth during training camp [10]\n\n\nCoaching career\nReeves, a protégé of Tom Landry, became the youngest head coach in the NFL when he joined the Denver Broncos in 1981 as vice president and head coach After acquiring quarterback John Elway in a trade, Reeves guided the Broncos to six post-season appearances, five divisional titles, three AFC championships, and three Super Bowl appearances (Super Bowl XXI, Super Bowl XXII, and Super Bowl XXIV) during his twelve-year tenure He was the only AFC coach in the decade of the 1980s to lead his team to consecutive Super Bowl berths, and his Broncos appeared in the Super Bowl three times during a span of four years [22] Reeves and Elway did not always see eye-to-eye, to the point where quarterback Tommy Maddox was drafted by the Broncos in the first round of the 1992 draft This came off the heels of the 1991 season in which Reeves had fired offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Mike Shanahan for \"insubordination\", as Reeves felt that Shanahan was driving a wedge between him and Elway, who said in 1990 that his relationship with the head coach was \"the worst.\" [23] [24] Reeves was fired after the 1992 season [25] and replaced by his protégé and friend Wade Phillips, who was previously the Broncos' defensive coordinator [26] Upon the death of Reeves in 2022, Elway stated that Reeves was a \"winner\" and said he owed a good deal of his career to Reeves [27]\n\n\nHead coaching record\nReeves covered NFL games as a color analyst (teamed with play-by-play man Bill Rosinski) for the second Sunday afternoon game on the Westwood One radio network [36] [37]\n\n\nBroadcast career\nReeves covered NFL games as a color analyst (teamed with play-by-play man Bill Rosinski) for the second Sunday afternoon game on the Westwood One radio network [36] [37]\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nReeves was married to Pam Reeves, and had three children and six grandchildren [38] Reeves and his future wife dated in high school, where she was a cheerleader [2] While coaching for the Giants, Reeves and his wife were residents of Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey [39] He was a Christian [40]\n\n\nSee also\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nBooks\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nReferences\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\nExternal links\n# denotes interim head coach\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

background singers as the \"Mary Wilson of The Supremes\" show [37] The show was the result of Motown's allowance of the group to go into hiatus despite the fact that there were still several uncancelled international tour dates to complete Mary therefore hired former Supreme, Cindy Birdsong and Debbie Sharpe to complete a summer tour of South America to fulfill contracts so venues would not sue The three-week tour began in Caracas, Venezuela, and was composed of mostly small clubs [38] Despite the company's displeasure and the fact that it owned the rights/distribution rights to the name \"Supremes\", Motown never cancelled the tour Later that year, Wilson hired Karen Jackson and Kaaren Ragland to tour with as background singers She and Cindy rehearsed them for a year end's tour

His portrayal of Fring earned him widespread critical acclaim and numerous award nominations.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nEsposito was married to Joy McManigal, with whom he has four daughters. However, the couple eventually divorced. Following his divorce, Esposito faced significant financial struggles and considered taking drastic measures.

Born on October 10, 1973, in a Telugu family, Rajamouli's passion for filmmaking began at a young age. He has directed some of the highest-grossing films in Indian cinema, including the epic action film \"Baahubali: The Beginning\" and its sequel \"Baahubali 2: The Conclusion.\" His films are known for their visually stunning visuals, intricate storylines, and memorable characters.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nKoduri Srisaila Sri Rajamouli was born in a Telugu family in Hire Kotnekal, Raichur district of Mysore state (present-day Karnataka). His parents, V Vijayendra Prasad and Raja Nandini, hailed from Andhra Pradesh, with his father from Kovvur near Rajahmundry and his mother from Visakhapatnam. Rajamouli's family had a strong connection to the film industry, with his father being a screenwriter and dialogue writer. This exposure to the film industry from a young age instilled in Rajamouli a passion for storytelling and filmmaking.\n\n**Career**\n\nRajamouli's entry into the film industry was not without its challenges. He worked as an apprentice to veteran film editor Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao and later assisted Kranthi Kumar for some time. However, it was his work as an assistant director to his father Vijayendra Prasad that laid the foundation for his future success. Rajamouli's frustration as a writer motivated him to become a director, so he could bring out his vision as a writer perfectly onto the screen.\n\n**Early Work**\n\nRajamouli's early work in the film industry was marked by his apprenticeship to Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao. He worked with Rao for six months, learning the intricacies of film editing. This experience laid the groundwork for his future success as a director.

The film was shot using Arri Alexa XT camera, marking Rajamouli's first film shot using a digital camera. Rajamouli's work was lauded by The Hollywood Reporter, The Guardian, and The Huffington Post. \"Baahubali: The Beginning\" became the second-highest grossing Indian film of all time, and the highest-grossing Indian film of all time within India. Its Hindi dubbed version also broke several records, becoming the first dubbed film to collect over 100 crore nett at the Hindi box office and the highest-grossing dubbed film in Hindi of all time.\n\n**Upcoming Projects**\n\nRajamouli is committed to collaborate with actor Mahesh Babu on a jungle adventure set in Africa.

In September 2022, he signed with the American talent agency Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in a move that has been described as a \"coup\" for the agency.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRajamouli keeps his personal life separate from his profession. He has stated that his personal opinions, thoughts, and lifestyle have nothing to do with his profession. Professionally, he is different, and he does not try to rub his thoughts onto his characters or onto his storytelling.\n\n**Filmmaking Style**\n\nRajamouli's filmmaking style is characterized by his penchant for storytelling driven by human emotions. Revenge is a recurring theme in his films, and he often uses flashback episodes to reveal the protagonist's backstory. This narrative style is used in \"Simhadri,\" \"Vikramarkudu,\" \"Magadheera,\" \"Baahubali: The Beginning,\" and \"RRR.\"\n\n**Filmography**\n\nThe budgets and box-office figures are all estimates collated from various sources like newspapers, magazines, reputed film portals, etc. Wherever the estimates vary, a range of highest and lowest estimates is provided.

{"title": "Tunisia", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe word Tunisia is derived from Tunis; a central urban hub and the capital of modern-day Tunisia The present form of the name, with its Latinate suffix -ia, evolved from French Tunisie, [29] [30] in turn generally associated with the Berber root ⵜⵏⵙ, transcribed tns, which means \"to lay down\" or \"encampment\" [31] It is sometimes also associated with the Carthage goddess Tanith (or Tunit), [29] [32] and the ancient city of Tynes [33] [34]\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nAntiquity\nFarming methods reached the Nile Valley from the Fertile Crescent region about 5000 BC, and spread to the Maghreb by about 4000 BC Agricultural communities in the humid coastal plains of central Tunisia then were ancestors of today's Berber tribes.\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nSometime between the second half of the 7th century and the early part of the 8th century, Arab Muslim conquest occurred in the region They founded the first Islamic city in Northwest Africa, Kairouan It was there in 670 AD that the Mosque of Uqba, or the Great Mosque of Kairouan, was constructed [51] This mosque is the oldest and most prestigious sanctuary in the Muslim West with the oldest standing minaret in the world; [52] it is also considered a masterpiece of Islamic art and architecture [53] The Arab migration to the Maghreb began during this time.\n\n\nOttoman Tunisia\nIn the last years of the Hafsid dynasty, Spain seized many of the coastal cities, but these were recovered by the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\nFrench Protectorate of Tunisia (1881–1956)\nIn 1869, Tunisia declared itself bankrupt and an international financial commission took control over its economy In 1881, using the pretext of a Tunisian incursion into Algeria, the French invaded with an army of about 36,000 and forced the Bey of Tunis, Muhammad III as-Sadiq, to agree to the terms of the 1881 Treaty of Bardo [69] With this treaty, Tunisia was officially made a French protectorate, over the objections of Italy European settlements in the country were actively encouraged; the number of French colonists grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945 In 1910 there were also 105,000 Italians in Tunisia [70]\n\n\nStruggle for independence (1943–1956)\nAfter the liberation of Tunisia from the Germans, the French regained control over the government and made participation in a nationalist party illegal once more [73] Moncef Bey, who was popular amongst Tunisians, was deposed by the French [73] The French claimed that his removal was due to him being sympathetic to the Axis countries during German occupation, but the real reason is up for debate [73]\n\n\nPost-independence (1956–2011)\nTunisia achieved independence from France on 20 March 1956 with Habib Bourguiba as Prime Minister [76] 20 March is celebrated annually as Tunisian Independence Day [77] A year later, Tunisia was declared a republic, with Bourguiba as the first President [78] From independence in 1956 until the 2011 revolution, the government and the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), formerly Neo Destour and the Socialist Destourian Party, were effectively one Following a report by Amnesty International, The Guardian called Tunisia \"one of the most modern but repressive countries in the Arab world\" [79] On 12 May 1964, Tunisia nationalized foreign farmlands [80] Immediately after, France canceled all financial assistance for the country, which was to amount to more than $40 million [80] This led to the Tunisian National Assembly passing a bill that required all residents of the country to subscribe to a \"popular loan\" in proportion to their income [80] From 1977 until 2005, Tunisia was a shooting location for five films of the Star Wars film franchise.\n\n\nPost-revolution (since 2011)\nThe Tunisian Revolution [94] [95] was an intensive campaign of civil resistance that was precipitated by high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, [96] a lack of freedom of speech and other political freedoms [97] and poor living conditions Labour unions were said to be an integral part of the protests [98] The protests inspired the Arab Spring, a wave of similar actions throughout the Arab world The catalyst for mass demonstrations was the death of Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old Tunisian street vendor, who set himself afire on 17 December 2010 in protest at the confiscation of his wares and the humiliation inflicted on him by a municipal official named Faida Hamdy Anger and violence intensified following Bouazizi's death on 4 January 2011, ultimately leading longtime

turn of the Mediterranean coast in northern Tunisia gives the country two distinctive Mediterranean coasts, west–east in the north, and north–south in the east.\n\n\nClimate\nTunisia's climate is Mediterranean in the north, with mild rainy winters and hot, dry summers [138] The south of the country is desert The terrain in the north is mountainous, which, moving south, gives way to a hot, dry

elections under the new constitution following the Arab Spring [141] Tunisia was the only democracy in North Africa until 2021 After a democratic backsliding, the country now classifies as \"hybrid regime\" in the Democracy Index (The Economist) [142] Between 2020 and 2022 the V-Dem Democracy indices score for electoral democracy dropped from 0.727 to 0.307 [143] After the 2022 constitutional

corruption benefiting politically connected elites [162] Tunisia's Penal Code criminalises several forms of corruption, including active and passive bribery, abuse of office, extortion and conflicts of interest, but the anti-corruption framework is not effectively enforced [163] However, according to the Corruption Perceptions Index published annually by Transparency International, Tunisia was ranked the least corrupt North African country in 2016, with a score of 41 Tunisia has a diverse economy, ranging from agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and petroleum products, to tourism, which accounted for 7% of the total GDP and 370,000 jobs in 2009 [164] In 2008 it had an economy of US$41 billion in nominal terms, and $82 billion in PPP [165]\n\n\nTourism\n\n\n\nEnergy\nSources of

1,000 [238]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Tunisia is mixed due to its long established history of outside influence from people – such as Phoenicians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Arabs, Siculo-Normans, Turks, Italians, Maltese and the French – who all left their mark on the country.\n\n\nPainting\nThe birth of Tunisian contemporary painting is strongly linked to the School of Tunis, established by a group of artists from Tunisia united by the desire to incorporate native themes and rejecting the influence of Orientalist colonial painting It was founded in 1949 and brings together French and Tunisian Muslims, Christians and Jews Pierre Boucherle was its main instigator, along with Yahia Turki, Abdelaziz Gorgi, Moses Levy, Ammar Farhat, and Jules Lellouche Given its doctrine, some members have therefore turned to the sources of aesthetic Arab-Muslim art, such as miniature Islamic architecture, etc Expressionist paintings by Amara Debbache, Jellal Ben Abdallah, and Ali Ben

revival led by the elite of the time who became aware of the risks of loss of the musical heritage and which they believed threatened the foundations of Tunisian national identity The institution did not take long to assemble a group of musicians, poets, scholars The creation of Radio Tunis in 1938 allowed musicians a greater opportunity to disseminate their works, with the station employing a policy of promoting Tunisian musicians exclusively [250]\n\n\nFestivals\nHundreds of international festivals, national, regional or local punctuate the calendar year Music and theatrical festivals dominate the national cultural scene.\n\n\nMedia\nThe TV media has long remained under the domination of the Establishment of the Broadcasting Authority Tunisia (ERTT) and its predecessor, the Tunisian Radio and Television, founded in 1957 On 7 November 2006, President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali announced the demerger of the business into two separate companies, which became effective on 31

"**Tunisia**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nTunisia is a country located in the Maghreb region of North Africa. With a rich history dating back to ancient times, Tunisia has been influenced by various cultures, including the Phoenicians, Romans, Arabs, and Europeans. The country has a diverse geography, with a Mediterranean coastline, mountains, and a desert region in the south. Tunisia has a population of approximately 11.8 million inhabitants and is known for its unique blend of Arab, Berber, and Mediterranean cultures.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe word Tunisia is derived from Tunis, the central urban hub and capital of modern-day Tunisia. The present form of the name, with its Latinate suffix -ia, evolved from French Tunisie, in turn generally associated with the Berber root ⵜⵏⵙ, transcribed tns, which means \"to lay down\" or \"encampment\". It is sometimes also associated with the Carthage goddess Tanith (or Tunit), and the ancient city of Tynes.\n\n**History**\n\n**Antiquity**\n\nFarming methods reached the Nile Valley from the Fertile Crescent region about 5000 BC, and spread to the Maghreb by about 4000 BC. Agricultural communities in the humid coastal plains of central Tunisia then were ancestors of today's Berber tribes.\n\n**Middle Ages**\n\nSometime between the second half of the 7th century and the early part of the 8th century, Arab Muslim conquest occurred in the region. They founded the first Islamic city in Northwest Africa, Kairouan. It was there in 670 AD that the Mosque of Uqba, or the Great Mosque of Kairouan, was constructed. This mosque is the oldest and most prestigious sanctuary in the Muslim West with the oldest standing minaret in the world; it is also considered a masterpiece of Islamic art and architecture.\n\n**Ottoman Tunisia**\n\nIn the last years of the Hafsid dynasty, Spain seized many of the coastal cities, but these were recovered by the Ottoman Empire.\n\n**French Protectorate of Tunisia (1881–1956)**\n\nIn 1869, Tunisia declared itself bankrupt and an international financial commission took control over its economy. In 1881, using the pretext of a Tunisian incursion into Algeria, the French invaded with an army of about 36,000 and forced the Bey of Tunis, Muhammad III as-Sadiq, to agree to the terms of the 1881 Treaty of Bardo. With this treaty, Tunisia was officially made a French protectorate, over the objections of Italy. European settlements in the country were actively encouraged; the number of French colonists grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945. In 1910, there were also 105,000 Italians in Tunisia.\n\n**Struggle for independence (1943–1956)**\n\nAfter the liberation of Tunisia from the Germans, the French regained control over the government and made participation in a nationalist party illegal once more. Moncef Bey, who was popular amongst Tunisians, was deposed by the French. The French claimed that his removal was due to him being sympathetic to the Axis countries during German occupation, but the real reason is up for debate.\n\n**Post-independence (1956–2011)**\n\nTunisia achieved independence from France on 20 March 1956 with Habib Bourguiba as Prime Minister. 20 March is celebrated annually as Tunisian Independence Day. A year later, Tunisia was declared a republic, with Bourguiba as the first President. From independence in 1956 until the 2011 revolution, the government and the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), formerly Neo Destour and the Socialist Destourian Party, were effectively one. Following a report by Amnesty International, The Guardian called Tunisia \"one of the most modern but repressive countries in the Arab world\". On 12 May 1964, Tunisia nationalized foreign farmlands. Immediately after, France canceled all financial assistance for the country, which was to amount to more than $40 million. This led to the Tunisian National Assembly passing a bill that required all residents of the country to subscribe to a \"popular loan\" in proportion to their income.\n\n**Post-revolution (since 2011)**\n\nThe Tunisian Revolution was an intensive campaign of civil resistance that was precipitated by high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of freedom of speech and other political freedoms, and poor living conditions. Labour unions were said to be an integral part of the protests. The protests inspired the Arab Spring, a wave of similar actions throughout the Arab world. The catalyst for mass demonstrations was the death of Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old Tunisian street vendor, who set himself afire on 17 December 2010 in protest at the confiscation of his wares and the humiliation inflicted on him by a municipal official named Faida Hamdy. Anger and violence intensified following Bouazizi's death on 4 January 2011, ultimately leading longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to resign and flee the country on 14 January 2011, after 23 years in power.\n\n**Presidency of Kais Saied (2019–present)**\n\nTunisia's first democratically elected president Beji Caid Essebsi died in July 2019. Following him, Kais Saied became Tunisia's president after a landslide victory in the 2019 Tunisian presidential elections in October. On 23 October 2019, Saied was sworn in as Tunisia's new president.\n\n**Geography**\n\nTunisia is situated on the Mediterranean coast of Northwest Africa, midway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Nile Delta.

In October 2014 Tunisia held its first elections under the new constitution following the Arab Spring. Tunisia was the only democracy in North Africa until 2021. After a democratic backsliding, the country now classifies as \"hybrid regime\" in the Democracy Index (The Economist).

Music and theatrical festivals dominate the national cultural scene.\n\n**Media**\n\nThe TV media has long remained under the domination of the Establishment of the Broadcasting Authority Tunisia (ERTT) and its predecessor, the Tunisian Radio and Television, founded in 1957. On 7 November 2006, President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali announced the demerger of the business into two separate companies, which became effective on 31 August 2007. Until then, ERTT managed all public television stations (Télévision Tunisienne 1 as well as Télévision Tunisienne 2 which had replaced the defunct RTT 2) and four national radio stations (Radio Tunis, Tunisia Radio Culture, Youth and RTCI) and five regional stations in Sfax, Monastir, Gafsa, Le Kef, and Tataouine. Most programs are in Arabic, but some are in French. Growth in private sector radio and television broadcasting has seen the creation of numerous operations including Radio Mosaique FM, Jawhara FM, Zaytuna FM, Hannibal TV, Ettounsiya TV, and Nessma TV.\n\n**Sports**\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Tunisia. The Tunisia national football team, also known as \"The Eagles of Carthage\", won the 2004 African Cup of Nations (ACN) as hosts. They also represented Africa in the 2005 FIFA Cup of Confederations, which was held in Germany, but they could not go beyond the first round.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tunisia\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe word Tunisia is derived from Tunis; a central urban hub and the capital of modern-day Tunisia The present form of the name, with its Latinate suffix -ia, evolved from French Tunisie, [29] [30] in turn generally associated with the Berber root ⵜⵏⵙ, transcribed tns, which means \"to lay down\" or \"encampment\" [31] It is sometimes also associated with the Carthage goddess Tanith (or Tunit), [29] [32] and the ancient city of Tynes [33] [34]\n\n\nHistory\n\n\n\nAntiquity\nFarming methods reached the Nile Valley from the Fertile Crescent region about 5000 BC, and spread to the Maghreb by about 4000 BC Agricultural communities in the humid coastal plains of central Tunisia then were ancestors of today's Berber tribes.\n\n\nMiddle Ages\nSometime between the second half of the 7th century and the early part of the 8th century, Arab Muslim conquest occurred in the region They founded the first Islamic city in Northwest Africa, Kairouan It was there in 670 AD that the Mosque of Uqba, or the Great Mosque of Kairouan, was constructed [51] This mosque is the oldest and most prestigious sanctuary in the Muslim West with the oldest standing minaret in the world; [52] it is also considered a masterpiece of Islamic art and architecture [53] The Arab migration to the Maghreb began during this time.\n\n\nOttoman Tunisia\nIn the last years of the Hafsid dynasty, Spain seized many of the coastal cities, but these were recovered by the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\nFrench Protectorate of Tunisia (1881–1956)\nIn 1869, Tunisia declared itself bankrupt and an international financial commission took control over its economy In 1881, using the pretext of a Tunisian incursion into Algeria, the French invaded with an army of about 36,000 and forced the Bey of Tunis, Muhammad III as-Sadiq, to agree to the terms of the 1881 Treaty of Bardo [69] With this treaty, Tunisia was officially made a French protectorate, over the objections of Italy European settlements in the country were actively encouraged; the number of French colonists grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945 In 1910 there were also 105,000 Italians in Tunisia [70]\n\n\nStruggle for independence (1943–1956)\nAfter the liberation of Tunisia from the Germans, the French regained control over the government and made participation in a nationalist party illegal once more [73] Moncef Bey, who was popular amongst Tunisians, was deposed by the French [73] The French claimed that his removal was due to him being sympathetic to the Axis countries during German occupation, but the real reason is up for debate [73]\n\n\nPost-independence (1956–2011)\nTunisia achieved independence from France on 20 March 1956 with Habib Bourguiba as Prime Minister [76] 20 March is celebrated annually as Tunisian Independence Day [77] A year later, Tunisia was declared a republic, with Bourguiba as the first President [78] From independence in 1956 until the 2011 revolution, the government and the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), formerly Neo Destour and the Socialist Destourian Party, were effectively one Following a report by Amnesty International, The Guardian called Tunisia \"one of the most modern but repressive countries in the Arab world\" [79] On 12 May 1964, Tunisia nationalized foreign farmlands [80] Immediately after, France canceled all financial assistance for the country, which was to amount to more than $40 million [80] This led to the Tunisian National Assembly passing a bill that required all residents of the country to subscribe to a \"popular loan\" in proportion to their income [80] From 1977 until 2005, Tunisia was a shooting location for five films of the Star Wars film franchise.\n\n\nPost-revolution (since 2011)\nThe Tunisian Revolution [94] [95] was an intensive campaign of civil resistance that was precipitated by high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, [96] a lack of freedom of speech and other political freedoms [97] and poor living conditions Labour unions were said to be an integral part of the protests [98] The protests inspired the Arab Spring, a wave of similar actions throughout the Arab world The catalyst for mass demonstrations was the death of Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old Tunisian street vendor, who set himself afire on 17 December 2010 in protest at the confiscation of his wares and the humiliation inflicted on him by a municipal official named Faida Hamdy Anger and violence intensified following Bouazizi's death on 4 January 2011, ultimately leading longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to resign and flee the country on 14 January 2011, after 23 years in power [99]\n\n\nPresidency of Kais Saied (2019–present)\nTunisia's first democratically elected president Beji Caid Essebsi died in July 2019 [110] Following him, Kais Saied became Tunisia's president after a landslide victory in the 2019 Tunisian presidential elections in October [111] On 23 October 2019, Saied was sworn in as Tunisia's new president [112]\n\n\nGeography\nTunisia is situated on the Mediterranean coast of Northwest Africa, midway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Nile Delta It is bordered by Algeria on the west (965 km) and southwest and Libya on the south east (459 km) [135] It lies between latitudes 30° and 38°N, and longitudes 7° and 12°E An abrupt southward turn of the Mediterranean coast in northern Tunisia gives the country two distinctive Mediterranean coasts, west–east in the north, and north–south in the east.\n\n\nClimate\nTunisia's climate is Mediterranean in the north, with mild rainy winters and hot, dry summers [138] The south of the country is desert The terrain in the north is mountainous, which, moving south, gives way to a hot, dry central plain The south is semiarid, and merges into the Sahara A series of salt lakes, known as chotts or shatts, lie in an east–west line at the northern edge of the Sahara, extending from the Gulf of Gabes into Algeria The lowest point is Chott el Djerid at 17 metres (56 ft) below sea level and the highest is Jebel ech Chambi at 1,544 metres (5,066 ft) [139]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nTunisia is home to five terrestrial ecoregions: Mediterranean conifer and mixed forests, Saharan halophytics, Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe, Mediterranean woodlands and forests, and North Saharan steppe and woodlands [140]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nTunisia is a presidential republic with a president serving as head of state, a prime minister as head of government, a bicameral parliament, and a civil law court system The Constitution of Tunisia, adopted 26 January 2014, guarantees rights for women and states that the President's religion \"shall be Islam\" In October 2014 Tunisia held its first elections under the new constitution following the Arab Spring [141] Tunisia was the only democracy in North Africa until 2021 After a democratic backsliding, the country now classifies as \"hybrid regime\" in the Democracy Index (The Economist) [142] Between 2020 and 2022 the V-Dem Democracy indices score for electoral democracy dropped from 0.727 to 0.307 [143] After the 2022 constitutional referendum, Tunisia became a unitary presidential republic.\n\n\nForeign relations\nTunisia maintains diplomatic relations with over 160+ countries Former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has maintained its long-time policy of seeking good relations with the West, while playing an active role in Arab and African regional bodies President Habib Bourguiba took a nonaligned stance but emphasized close relations with the European Union, Pakistan, and the United States.\n\n\nMilitary\nAs of 2008 [update], Tunisia had an army of 27,000 personnel equipped with 84 main battle tanks and 48 light tanks The navy had 4,800 personnel operating 25 patrol boats and 6 other craft The Tunisian Air Force has 154 aircraft and 4 UAVs Paramilitary forces consisted of a 12,000-member national guard [156] Tunisia's military spending was 1.6% of GDP as of 2006 [update] The army is responsible for national defence and also internal security Tunisia has participated in peacekeeping efforts in the DROC and Ethiopia/Eritrea [157] United Nations peacekeeping deployments for the Tunisian armed forces have been in Cambodia (UNTAC), Namibia (UNTAG), Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, Western Sahara (MINURSO) and the 1960s mission in the Congo, ONUC.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nTunisia is subdivided into 24 governorates (Wilaya), which are further divided into 264 \"delegations\" or \"districts\" (mutamadiyat), and further subdivided into municipalities (baladiyats) [159] and sectors (imadats) [160]\n\n\nEconomy\nRanked the most competitive economy in Africa by the World Economic Forum in 2009, [161] Tunisia is an export-oriented country in the process of liberalizing and privatizing an economy that, while averaging 5% GDP growth since the early 1990s, has suffered from corruption benefiting politically connected elites [162] Tunisia's Penal Code criminalises several forms of corruption, including active and passive bribery, abuse of office, extortion and conflicts of interest, but the anti-corruption framework is not effectively enforced [163] However, according to the Corruption Perceptions Index published annually by Transparency International, Tunisia was ranked the least corrupt North African country in 2016, with a score of 41 Tunisia has a diverse economy, ranging from agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and petroleum products, to tourism, which accounted for 7% of the total GDP and 370,000 jobs in 2009 [164] In 2008 it had an economy of US$41 billion in nominal terms, and $82 billion in PPP [165]\n\n\nTourism\n\n\n\nEnergy\nSources of electricity production in Tunisia [176]\n\n\nTransport\nThe country maintains 19,232 kilometres (11,950 mi) of roads, [165] with three highways: the A1 from Tunis to Sfax (works ongoing for Sfax-Libya), A3 Tunis-Beja (works ongoing Beja – Boussalem, studies ongoing Boussalem – Algeria) and A4 Tunis – Bizerte There are 29 airports in Tunisia, with Tunis Carthage International Airport and Djerba–Zarzis International Airport being the most important ones A new airport, Enfidha – Hammamet International Airport opened in 2011 The airport is located north of Sousse at Enfidha and is to mainly serve the resorts of Hamammet and Port El Kantaoui, together with inland cities such as Kairouan Five airlines are headquartered in Tunisia: Tunisair, Syphax Airlines, Karthago Airlines, Nouvelair, and Tunisair Express The railway network is operated by SNCFT and amounts to 2,135 kilometres (1,327 mi) in total [165] The Tunis area is served by a Light rail network named Metro Leger which is managed by Transtu.\n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nTunisia has achieved the highest access rates to water supply and sanitation\nservices in the Middle East and North Africa As of 2011 [update], access to\nsafe drinking water became close to universal approaching 100% in urban\nareas and 90% in rural areas [186] Tunisia provides good quality drinking water throughout the year [187]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the CIA, as of 2021, Tunisia has a population of 11,811,335 inhabitants [165] The government has supported a successful family planning program that has reduced the population growth rate to just over 1% per annum, contributing to Tunisia's economic and social stability [144]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook, ethnic groups in Tunisia are: Arab 98%, European 1%, Jewish and other 1% [165]\n\n\nLanguages\nArabic is the official language of Tunisia Tunisian Arabic, known as Tounsi, [203] is the national, vernacular variety of Arabic used by the public [204] There is also a small minority of speakers of Berber languages known collectively as Jebbali or Shelha in the country Actively spoken Berber languages are Jerba Berber on the island of Djerba and Matmata Berber in the city of Matmata The Sened language is extinct [205] [206]\n\n\nReligion\nTunisia's constitution declares Islam as the official state religion—and the absolute majority of its population, or around 98%, report to be Muslims, while some 2% follow predominantly Christianity or Judaism [165] According to a 2018 survey conducted by the Arab Barometer, the vast majority of Tunisians (99.4%) continue to identify as Muslim [210] The survey also found that more than one third of Tunisians identify as non-religious The percentage of Tunisians identifying themselves as non-religious has recently increased from around 12% in 2013 to around 33% in 2018, making Tunisia the least religious country in the Arab world [211] Nearly half of young Tunisians described themselves as non-religious, according to that same survey [212] However, as of July 2022, new surveys by the Arab Barometer say otherwise, particularly BBC's programme, The Newsroom journalists highlighting that the previously noted wave of those saying they were not religious has been, in fact, \"reversed\" [213] The most recent 2021 Arab Barometer survey reported that 44% of Tunisians consider themselves religious, 37% somewhat religious, and 19% non-religious [210]\n\n\nEducation\nThe total adult literacy rate in 2008 was 78% [232] and this rate goes up to 97.3% when considering only people from 15 to 24 years old [233] [full citation needed] Education is given a high priority and accounts for 6% of GNP A basic education for children between the ages of 6 and 16 has been compulsory since 1991 Tunisia ranked 17th in the category of \"quality of the  [higher] educational system\" and 21st in the category of \"quality of primary education\" in The Global Competitiveness Report 2008–09, released by the World Economic Forum [234]\n\n\nHealth\nIn 2010, spending on healthcare accounted for 3.37% of the country's GDP In 2009, there were 12.02 physicians and 33.12 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants [236] The life expectancy at birth was 75.73 years in 2016, or 73.72 years for males and 77.78 years for females [237] Infant mortality in 2016 was 11.7 per 1,000 [238]\n\n\nCulture\nThe culture of Tunisia is mixed due to its long established history of outside influence from people – such as Phoenicians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Arabs, Siculo-Normans, Turks, Italians, Maltese and the French – who all left their mark on the country.\n\n\nPainting\nThe birth of Tunisian contemporary painting is strongly linked to the School of Tunis, established by a group of artists from Tunisia united by the desire to incorporate native themes and rejecting the influence of Orientalist colonial painting It was founded in 1949 and brings together French and Tunisian Muslims, Christians and Jews Pierre Boucherle was its main instigator, along with Yahia Turki, Abdelaziz Gorgi, Moses Levy, Ammar Farhat, and Jules Lellouche Given its doctrine, some members have therefore turned to the sources of aesthetic Arab-Muslim art, such as miniature Islamic architecture, etc Expressionist paintings by Amara Debbache, Jellal Ben Abdallah, and Ali Ben Salem are recognized while abstract art captures the imagination of painters like Edgar Naccache, Nello Levy, and Hedi Turki [239]\n\n\nLiterature\nTunisian literature exists in two forms: Arabic and French Arabic literature dates back to the 7th century with the arrival of Arab civilization in the region It is more important in both volume and value than French literature, which was introduced during the French protectorate from 1881 [242]\n\n\nMusic\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, musical activity was dominated by the liturgical repertoire associated with different religious brotherhoods and secular repertoire which consisted of instrumental pieces and songs in different Andalusian forms and styles of origins, essentially borrowing characteristics of musical language In 1930 The Rachidia was founded, well known thanks to artists from the Jewish community The founding in 1934 of a musical school helped revive Arab Andalusian music largely to a social and cultural revival led by the elite of the time who became aware of the risks of loss of the musical heritage and which they believed threatened the foundations of Tunisian national identity The institution did not take long to assemble a group of musicians, poets, scholars The creation of Radio Tunis in 1938 allowed musicians a greater opportunity to disseminate their works, with the station employing a policy of promoting Tunisian musicians exclusively [250]\n\n\nFestivals\nHundreds of international festivals, national, regional or local punctuate the calendar year Music and theatrical festivals dominate the national cultural scene.\n\n\nMedia\nThe TV media has long remained under the domination of the Establishment of the Broadcasting Authority Tunisia (ERTT) and its predecessor, the

Wilt Chamberlain Known as \"Wilt the Stilt\", he led the team in scoring six times, quickly began shattering NBA scoring records and changed the NBA style of play forever On March 2, 1962, in a Warrior \"home\" game played on a neutral court in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Chamberlain scored 100 points against the New York Knicks, a single-game record the NBA ranks among its finest moments [18]\n\n\n1965–1978: The Thurmond and Barry era\nIn 1965, they drafted Rick Barry in the first round who went on to become NBA Rookie of the Year that season and then led the Warriors to the NBA

key players such as Barry, Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements, the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some players such as high-scoring forward Purvis Short (1978), former Purdue center Joe Barry Carroll (1980) and center Robert Parish (1976), who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become Kevin McHale for the pick used to draft Carroll In 1983, the Warriors matched the New York Knicks' offer for free-agent Bernard King, but, unable to pay his high salary, quickly traded him to the Knicks for guard Micheal Ray Richardson, whom they soon shipped to New Jersey in exchange for former Georgetown Hoya point guard Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd, and journeyman forward Mickey Johnson Floyd once scored 29 points for the Warriors in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Lakers, though he was later traded to the Houston Rockets.\n\n\n1985–1997: The \"Run TMC\" era\nAfter a subpar stretch in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief resurgence under coach Karl, culminating in a 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers that is still shown on TV in the NBA's Greatest Games series The second-half performance by the Warriors' All-Star point guard Sleepy Floyd still stands as the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39) His six consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter led to a 51-point finish for him and a victory for the Warriors.\n\n\n1997–2009: Wilderness years and \"We believe\" mindset\nLongtime Seton Hall college coach P J Carlesimo, who had been recently fired by the Portland Trail Blazers, replaced Adelman as head coach for the 1997–98 season Sprewell was suspended for the remainder of the season for losing his temper and choking Carlesimo during a team practice in December, generating the glaring newspaper headline \"WARRIORS HIT ROCK BOTTOM\" and the declaration by general manager Garry St Jean that Sprewell would never play for the Warriors again He would not play in the NBA again until he was dealt in January 1999 to the New York Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings.\n\n\n2009–present: The Stephen Curry era\nThe Warriors chose future superstar point guard Stephen Curry of Davidson College as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft [30] During the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Chris Mullin Larry Riley, Nelson's longtime assistant coach, [31] was promoted in his place; Riley drafted Curry and traded Jamal Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.\n\n\n2009–2012: Continued struggles and suitable draft picks\nThe Warriors chose future superstar point guard Stephen Curry of Davidson College as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft [30] During the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Chris Mullin Larry Riley, Nelson's longtime assistant coach, [31] was promoted in his place; Riley drafted Curry and traded Jamal Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.\n\n\n2012–2014: Ascension\nThe Warriors' 2012 off-season moves changed the course of the franchise [48] In the 2012 draft, the Warriors selected small forward Harrison Barnes with the 7th overall pick, center Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, small forward Draymond Green with the 35th pick, and 7-foot-1 center Ognjen Kuzmic with the 52nd pick According to sportswriter Anthony Slater, in this draft, \"Golden State got a starter  [Barnes], a rotation player  [Ezeli] and a transcendent talent that perfectly fit the small-ball direction of the league  [Green].\" [48] In addition, Curry agreed to a four-year, $44 million rookie scale contract extension [49] At the time, many basketball writers considered the move risky for Golden State because of Curry's injury history [50] In 2016, however, Slater argued that Curry's relatively inexpensive contract paid \"huge dividends\" by freeing up the necessary funds to allow the team to \"keep a strong core around him\" [48] The team made a series of other moves, trading Dorell Wright, obtaining point guard Jarrett Jack, and signing forward Carl Landry.\n\n\n2014–2019: The Dynasty\nJackson was fired as coach on May 6, 2014, [67] despite a unanimous declaration of support from his players [68] and a three-year 121–109 (.526) record that marked a major turnaround and placed him fourth on the franchise's all-time wins list, trailing Alvin Attles (557), Don Nelson (422) and Eddie Gottlieb (263) [69] Over the 17 years before Jackson took the helm in 2011, the franchise had averaged 30.2 wins per season and made the playoffs only once [70] Jackson became just the third Warriors head coach to notch at least 50 wins in a season, joining Nelson and Attles, who both hit the mark twice.\n\n\n2019–2021: Return to San Francisco and injury struggles\nIn April 2014, the Warriors began the purchase process for a 12-acre (4.9 ha) site in Mission Bay, San Francisco, to hold a new 18,000-seat arena, which was expected to be ready beginning with the 2019–20 NBA season [123] [124] [125] The location was selected after an original proposal to construct the arena on Piers 30 and 32, just south of the Bay Bridge, met with vocal opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts and obstruction of views [126] The new location, which still faced some vocal opposition in San Francisco, eliminated the need for voter approval as required with the original site [127] The move also elicited criticism due to the perceived alienation of a loyal fanbase in Oakland [128] The sale was finalized in October 2015 [129] and naming rights were sold to JPMorgan Chase for the arena to be called Chase Center [130] Although the Warriors considered a name change, possibly returning to their former name of San Francisco Warriors, [131] it was ultimately decided that they would remain the Golden State Warriors upon their return to San Francisco [132]\n\n\n2021–2022: Championship glory\nWith the 2021 NBA draft lottery, the Warriors landed the seventh pick in the draft from the Minnesota Timberwolves from the D'Angelo Russell trade, and their own 14th overall pick [141] With the seventh overall pick, the Warriors selected the NBA G League Ignite's forward Jonathan Kuminga [142] and with the 14th overall pick, the Warriors selected Arkansas guard Moses Moody [143] The Warriors re-signed Curry to a four-year extension deal worth up to $215 million [144] They also acquired Magic forward Otto Porter Jr [145] and Heat forward Nemanja Bjelica [146] to one-year deals On August 10, 2021, Andre Iguodala signed a deal to come back to the Bay Area [147]\n\n\n2022–2023: Injury struggles\nDuring the 2022–23 season, the Warriors faced a challenging regular season due to numerous injuries Key players like Iguodala, DiVincenzo, Thompson, Green, Kuminga, and Curry, who was also unable to participate in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, were impacted [154] [155] [156]\n\n\nLogos and uniforms\nAs the Philadelphia Warriors, their uniforms generally featured the shortened city name \"PHILA\" in front, with a few adjustments to the striping and color scheme on the letters Home uniforms were white and road uniforms were blue with gold accents, with red added during the late 1940s.\n\n\nPhiladelphia\nAs the Philadelphia Warriors, their uniforms generally featured the shortened city name \"PHILA\" in front, with a few adjustments to the striping and color scheme on the letters Home uniforms were white and road uniforms were blue with gold accents, with red added during the late 1940s.\n\n\nSan Francisco: \"The City\"\nMoving to San Francisco in 1962, the Warriors incorporated a similar uniform to the one they previously wore in Philadelphia, but for the first season they wore gold road uniforms with the city name in blue with red drop shadows In the 1963–64 season, the gold and blue were reversed on the road uniform In both seasons, the home white uniform featured the city name in gold with blue drop shadows.\n\n\nCalifornia outline (1971–1988)\nUpon relocating to Oakland and rebranding to the Golden State Warriors in 1971, the team began wearing uniforms that featured \"Golden State\" in Western-style lettering above a circle with the outline of California and a star representing the San Francisco Bay Area inside This uniform was worn until the 1975 championship season, although some uniforms also featured the team name below the circle.\n\n\nRun TMC era uniform (1988–1997)\nIn 1988, the Warriors updated their uniform, now featuring the team name written diagonally in front along with numbers on the left chest The updated \"California outline\" logo was moved to the left leg This uniform was introduced in time for the arrival of Don Nelson as head coach and the rise of Run TMC.\n\n\nThunder era (1997–2010)\nThe Warriors identity was drastically changed in the 1997–98 season, now featuring a dark navy blue, bright gold and orange color scheme The uniform heavily incorporated the lightning bolt motif, with the gold \"Warriors\" wordmark now featuring the lightning bolt shooting atop the \"W\" The alternate \"Thunder\" logo was added to the right leg [157]\n\n\nReturn to classic look (2010–2017)\nIn 2010, the Warriors returned to a modern version of the team's \"The CITY\" uniform, this time incorporating the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge as part of the logo The uniform also incorporated striping inspired by the bridge's suspension cables During Christmas Day games between 2013 and 2016, the Warriors would subtly tweak their uniforms to match every other team's designs [5]\n\n\nNike era (2017–present)\nThe Warriors kept their primary uniforms after switching from Adidas to Nike in 2017, with the white uniform becoming the \"Association\" uniform and the blue uniform becoming the \"Icon\" uniform From 2017 to 2019, the Warriors kept their slate gray uniforms as its \"Statement\" uniform, tweaking the design to reference Oakland as \"The Town\" by incorporating the city's oak tree logo to the uniform [163]\n\n\nCity and Earned uniforms\nIn the 2017–18 season, the Warriors wore gold \"City\" uniforms with \"The Bay\" atop a blue circle and a dragon silhouette atop the Golden Gate Bridge; this paid tribute to the Bay Area's Chinese American community [168] In 2018–19, the Warriors wore a variation of this \"City\" uniform in navy blue with gold accents [169]\n\n\nClassic uniforms\nThe Warriors have worn throwback versions of \"The CITY\" uniforms on select games since the 1990s, most recently wearing them in the 2020–21 season They've also worn other throwback uniforms in tribute to several great moments in Warriors history, such as the 1974–75 \"Cinderella\" championship uniforms, the famous Sleepy Floyd game-inspired uniforms from 1987, the Run TMC uniforms from the 1990s, and in their final game in Oakland in 2019, a white uniform based on the 2007 \"We Believe\" era uniforms.\n\n\nRivalries\nWhile the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the NBA in 1970, the two teams' rivalry began to develop in the 2014–15 season when they met in the first of four consecutive NBA Finals Previously, no pair of teams had faced each other in more than two consecutive Finals The Warriors have won three of the four NBA Finals in which they faced the Cavaliers, losing in 2016, and winning in 2015, 2017, and 2018.\n\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\nWhile the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the NBA in 1970, the two teams' rivalry began to

three of the four NBA Finals in which they faced the Cavaliers, losing in 2016, and winning in 2015, 2017, and 2018.\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\nThe Warriors have a lengthy history with the Los Angeles Lakers as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960s Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike, unlike in the Dodgers–Giants or 49ers–Rams rivalries of the MLB and NFL, respectively, in which both teams and fanbases express fierce animosity against one another [178] [179] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991 Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s [180] [181] The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262–173, and the postseason series 25–11 [182] [183]\n\n\nSacramento Kings\nSince the Sacramento Kings relocated there in 1985, they have shared a geographic rivalry with the Warriors, as both cities are 86 miles apart from one another However, despite the Kings joining the BAA in 1948 (when they were then known as the Royals and based in Rochester, New York), due to both teams having long periods of failing to make the playoffs, the two teams would not face each other in the postseason until 2023, where they faced off in the first round [184] In a bitterly fought series, including a rough play between Domantas Sabonis and Draymond Green in game 2 where Green stomped roughly on Sabonis's chest after he grabbed Green's leg (resulting in Green being suspended in game 3) [185] and several violent viral fan scuffles throughout the series (as opposing fans were widespread at both Chase Center and Golden 1 Center due to the geographic proximity), [186] the Warriors would defeat the Kings in seven games to advance to the semifinals The series would draw the highest first and second round playoff TV ratings for the NBA since 1999, with game 7 peaking at 11.9 million viewers on ABC [187]\n\n\nMedia\nBob Fitzgerald has done television play-by-play, and former Warriors swingman Kelenna Azubuike does color commentary for the Warriors on NBC Sports Bay Area, where they telecast more

State Warriors are a professional basketball team based in San Francisco, California. They are a member of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and play their home games at the Chase Center.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Warriors were founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors, a charter member of the Basketball Association of America (BAA). They were owned by Peter A. Tyrrell, who also owned the Philadelphia Rockets of the American Hockey League. Tyrrell hired Eddie Gottlieb, a longtime basketball promoter in the Philadelphia area, as coach and general manager. The owners named the team after the Philadelphia Warriors, an old basketball team who played in the American Basketball League in 1925.\n\n**1946-1962: Early years in Philadelphia**\n\nThe Warriors were founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors, a charter member of the Basketball Association of America.

The owners named the team after the Philadelphia Warriors, an old basketball team who played in the American Basketball League in 1925.\n\n**1959-1965: The Wilt Chamberlain era**\n\nIn 1959, the team signed draft pick Wilt Chamberlain. Known as \"Wilt the Stilt,\" he led the team in scoring six times, quickly began shattering NBA scoring records, and changed the NBA style of play forever. On March 2, 1962, in a Warrior \"home\" game played on a neutral court in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Chamberlain scored 100 points against the New York Knicks, a single-game record the NBA ranks among its finest moments.\n\n**1965-1978: The Thurmond and Barry era**\n\nIn 1965, they drafted Rick Barry in the first round, who went on to become NBA Rookie of the Year that season and then led the Warriors to the NBA Finals in the 1966-67 season, losing (four games to two) to Chamberlain's new team that had replaced the Warriors in Philadelphia, the 76ers.\n\n**1978-1985: Competitive struggles**\n\nDue to the loss of key players such as Barry, Wilkes, and Thurmond to trades and retirements, the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some players such as high-scoring forward Purvis Short (1978), former Purdue center Joe Barry Carroll (1980), and center Robert Parish (1976), who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become Kevin McHale for the pick used to draft Carroll.\n\n**1985-1997: The \"Run TMC\" era**\n\nAfter a subpar stretch in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief resurgence under coach Don Nelson, culminating in a 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers that is still shown on TV in the NBA's Greatest Games series. The second-half performance by the Warriors' All-Star point guard Sleepy Floyd still stands as the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39). His six consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter led to a 51-point finish for him and a victory for the Warriors.\n\n**1997-2009: Wilderness years and \"We believe\" mindset**\n\nLongtime Seton Hall college coach P.J. Carlesimo, who had been recently fired by the Portland Trail Blazers, replaced Adelman as head coach for the 1997-98 season. Sprewell was suspended for the remainder of the season for losing his temper and choking Carlesimo during a team practice in December, generating the glaring newspaper headline \"WARRIORS HIT ROCK BOTTOM\" and the declaration by general manager Garry St. Jean that Sprewell would never play for the Warriors again. He would not play in the NBA again until he was dealt in January 1999 to the New York Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills, and Terry Cummings.\n\n**2009-2012: Continued struggles and suitable draft picks**\n\nThe Warriors chose future superstar point guard Stephen Curry of Davidson College as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. During the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Chris Mullin. Larry Riley, Nelson's longtime assistant coach, was promoted in his place; Riley drafted Curry and traded Jamal Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.\n\n**2012-2014: Ascension**\n\nThe Warriors' 2012 off-season moves changed the course of the franchise. In the 2012 draft, the Warriors selected small forward Harrison Barnes with the 7th overall pick, center Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, small forward Draymond Green with the 35th pick, and 7-foot-1 center Ognjen Kuzmic with the 52nd pick.

Jackson became just the third Warriors head coach to notch at least 50 wins in a season, joining Nelson and Attles, who both hit the mark twice.\n\n**2019-2021: Return to San Francisco and injury struggles**\n\nIn April 2014, the Warriors began the purchase process for a 12-acre (4.9 ha) site in Mission Bay, San Francisco, to hold a new 18,000-seat arena, which was expected to be ready beginning with the 2019-20 NBA season. The location was selected after an original proposal to construct the arena on Piers 30 and 32, just south of the Bay Bridge, met with vocal opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts, and obstruction of views. The new location, which still faced some vocal opposition in San Francisco, eliminated the need for voter approval as required with the original site.

With the seventh overall pick, the Warriors selected the NBA G League Ignite's forward Jonathan Kuminga and with the 14th overall pick, the Warriors selected Arkansas guard Moses Moody. The Warriors re-signed Curry to a four-year extension deal worth up to $215 million. They also acquired Magic forward Otto Porter Jr. and Heat forward Nemanja Bjelica to one-year deals. On August 10, 2021, Andre Iguodala signed a deal to come back to the Bay Area.\n\n**2022-2023: Injury struggles**\n\nDuring the 2022-23 season, the Warriors faced a challenging regular season due to numerous injuries. Key players like Iguodala, DiVincenzo, Thompson, Green, Kuminga, and Curry, who was also unable to participate in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, were impacted.\n\n**Logos and uniforms**\n\nThe Warriors have worn several logos and uniforms throughout their history. Their first logo, introduced in 1946, featured a stylized \"W\" with a basketball. In 1962, they introduced a new logo featuring a golden bear, which has remained largely unchanged to this day. The team's primary uniforms have also undergone several changes over the years, including the introduction of a black alternate uniform in 2011 and a navy blue uniform in 2017.\n\n**Rivalries**\n\nThe Warriors have several rivalries with other NBA teams. Their most intense rivalry is with the Los Angeles Lakers, which has been fueled by their frequent playoff matchups and the fact that both teams are based in California. They also have a rivalry with the Sacramento Kings, who are based in the same region and have a history of competing with the Warriors for playoff spots.\n\n**Media**\n\nThe Warriors' games are broadcast on NBC Sports Bay Area and ESPN.

key players such as Barry, Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements, the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some players such as high-scoring forward Purvis Short (1978), former Purdue center Joe Barry Carroll (1980) and center Robert Parish (1976), who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become Kevin McHale for the pick used to draft Carroll In 1983, the Warriors matched the New York Knicks' offer for free-agent Bernard King, but, unable to pay his high salary, quickly traded him to the Knicks for guard Micheal Ray Richardson, whom they soon shipped to New Jersey in exchange for former Georgetown Hoya point guard Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd, and journeyman forward Mickey Johnson Floyd once scored 29 points for the Warriors in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Lakers, though he was later traded to the Houston Rockets.\n\n\n1985–1997: The \"Run TMC\" era\nAfter a subpar stretch in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief resurgence under coach Karl, culminating in a 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers that is still shown on TV in the NBA's Greatest Games series The second-half performance by the Warriors' All-Star point guard Sleepy Floyd still stands as the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39) His six consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter led to a 51-point finish for him and a victory for the Warriors.\n\n\n1997–2009: Wilderness years and \"We believe\" mindset\nLongtime Seton Hall college coach P J Carlesimo, who had been recently fired by the Portland Trail Blazers, replaced Adelman as head coach for the 1997–98 season Sprewell was suspended for the remainder of the season for losing his temper and choking Carlesimo during a team practice in December, generating the glaring newspaper headline \"WARRIORS HIT ROCK BOTTOM\" and the declaration by general manager Garry St Jean that Sprewell would never play for the Warriors again He would not play in the NBA again until he was dealt in January 1999 to the New York Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings.\n\n\n2009–present: The Stephen Curry era\nThe Warriors chose future superstar point guard Stephen Curry of Davidson College as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft [30] During the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Chris Mullin Larry Riley, Nelson's longtime assistant coach, [31] was promoted in his place; Riley drafted Curry and traded Jamal Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.\n\n\n2009–2012: Continued struggles and suitable draft picks\nThe Warriors chose future superstar point guard Stephen Curry of Davidson College as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft [30] During the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Chris Mullin Larry Riley, Nelson's longtime assistant coach, [31] was promoted in his place; Riley drafted Curry and traded Jamal Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.\n\n\n2012–2014: Ascension\nThe Warriors' 2012 off-season moves changed the course of the franchise [48] In the 2012 draft, the Warriors selected small forward Harrison Barnes with the 7th overall pick, center Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, small forward Draymond Green with the 35th pick, and 7-foot-1 center Ognjen Kuzmic with the 52nd pick According to sportswriter Anthony Slater, in this draft, \"Golden State got a starter  [Barnes], a rotation player  [Ezeli] and a transcendent talent that perfectly fit the small-ball direction of the league  [Green].\" [48] In addition, Curry agreed to a four-year, $44 million rookie scale contract extension [49] At the time, many basketball writers considered the move risky for Golden State because of Curry's injury history [50] In 2016, however, Slater argued that Curry's relatively inexpensive contract paid \"huge dividends\" by freeing up the necessary funds to allow the team to \"keep a strong core around him\" [48] The team made a series of other moves, trading Dorell Wright, obtaining point guard Jarrett Jack, and signing forward Carl Landry.\n\n\n2014–2019: The Dynasty\nJackson was fired as coach on May 6, 2014, [67] despite a unanimous declaration of support from his players [68] and a three-year 121–109 (.526) record that marked a major turnaround and placed him fourth on the franchise's all-time wins list, trailing Alvin Attles (557), Don Nelson (422) and Eddie Gottlieb (263) [69] Over the 17 years before Jackson took the helm in 2011, the franchise had averaged 30.2 wins per season and made the playoffs only once [70] Jackson became just the third Warriors head coach to notch at least 50 wins in a season, joining Nelson and Attles, who both hit the mark twice.\n\n\n2019–2021: Return to San Francisco and injury struggles\nIn April 2014, the Warriors began the purchase process for a 12-acre (4.9 ha) site in Mission Bay, San Francisco, to hold a new 18,000-seat arena, which was expected to be ready beginning with the 2019–20 NBA season [123] [124] [125] The location was selected after an original proposal to construct the arena on Piers 30 and 32, just south of the Bay Bridge, met with vocal opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts and obstruction of views [126] The new location, which still faced some vocal opposition in San Francisco, eliminated the need for voter approval as required with the original site [127] The move also elicited criticism due to the perceived alienation of a loyal fanbase in Oakland [128] The sale was finalized in October 2015 [129] and naming rights were sold to JPMorgan Chase for the arena to be called Chase Center [130] Although the Warriors considered a name change, possibly returning to their former name of San Francisco Warriors, [131] it was ultimately decided that they would remain the Golden State Warriors upon their return to San Francisco [132]\n\n\n2021–2022: Championship glory\nWith the 2021 NBA draft lottery, the Warriors landed the seventh pick in the draft from the Minnesota Timberwolves from the D'Angelo Russell trade, and their own 14th overall pick [141] With the seventh overall pick, the Warriors selected the NBA G League Ignite's forward Jonathan Kuminga [142] and with the 14th overall pick, the Warriors selected Arkansas guard Moses Moody [143] The Warriors re-signed Curry to a four-year extension deal worth up to $215 million [144] They also acquired Magic forward Otto Porter Jr [145] and Heat forward Nemanja Bjelica [146] to one-year deals On August 10, 2021, Andre Iguodala signed a deal to come back to the Bay Area [147]\n\n\n2022–2023: Injury struggles\nDuring the 2022–23 season, the Warriors faced a challenging regular season due to numerous injuries Key players like Iguodala, DiVincenzo, Thompson, Green, Kuminga, and Curry, who was also unable to participate in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, were impacted [154] [155] [156]\n\n\nLogos and uniforms\nAs the Philadelphia Warriors, their uniforms generally featured the shortened city name \"PHILA\" in front, with a few adjustments to the striping and color scheme on the letters Home uniforms were white and road uniforms were blue with gold accents, with red added during the late 1940s.\n\n\nPhiladelphia\nAs the Philadelphia Warriors, their uniforms generally featured the shortened city name \"PHILA\" in front, with a few adjustments to the striping and color scheme on the letters Home uniforms were white and road uniforms were blue with gold accents, with red added during the late 1940s.\n\n\nSan Francisco: \"The City\"\nMoving to San Francisco in 1962, the Warriors incorporated a similar uniform to the one they previously wore in Philadelphia, but for the first season they wore gold road uniforms with the city name in blue with red drop shadows In the 1963–64 season, the gold and blue were reversed on the road uniform In both seasons, the home white uniform featured the city name in gold with blue drop shadows.\n\n\nCalifornia outline (1971–1988)\nUpon relocating to Oakland and rebranding to the Golden State Warriors in 1971, the team began wearing uniforms that featured \"Golden State\" in Western-style lettering above a circle with the outline of California and a star representing the San Francisco Bay Area inside This uniform was worn until the 1975 championship season, although some uniforms also featured the team name below the circle.\n\n\nRun TMC era uniform (1988–1997)\nIn 1988, the Warriors updated their uniform, now featuring the team name written diagonally in front along with numbers on the left chest The updated \"California outline\" logo was moved to the left leg This uniform was introduced in time for the arrival of Don Nelson as head coach and the rise of Run TMC.\n\n\nThunder era (1997–2010)\nThe Warriors identity was drastically changed in the 1997–98 season, now featuring a dark navy blue, bright gold and orange color scheme The uniform heavily incorporated the lightning bolt motif, with the gold \"Warriors\" wordmark now featuring the lightning bolt shooting atop the \"W\" The alternate \"Thunder\" logo was added to the right leg [157]\n\n\nReturn to classic look (2010–2017)\nIn 2010, the Warriors returned to a modern version of the team's \"The CITY\" uniform, this time incorporating the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge as part of the logo The uniform also incorporated striping inspired by the bridge's suspension cables During Christmas Day games between 2013 and 2016, the Warriors would subtly tweak their uniforms to match every other team's designs [5]\n\n\nNike era (2017–present)\nThe Warriors kept their primary uniforms after switching from Adidas to Nike in 2017, with the white uniform becoming the \"Association\" uniform and the blue uniform becoming the \"Icon\" uniform From 2017 to 2019, the Warriors kept their slate gray uniforms as its \"Statement\" uniform, tweaking the design to reference Oakland as \"The Town\" by incorporating the city's oak tree logo to the uniform [163]\n\n\nCity and Earned uniforms\nIn the 2017–18 season, the Warriors wore gold \"City\" uniforms with \"The Bay\" atop a blue circle and a dragon silhouette atop the Golden Gate Bridge; this paid tribute to the Bay Area's Chinese American community [168] In 2018–19, the Warriors wore a variation of this \"City\" uniform in navy blue with gold accents [169]\n\n\nClassic uniforms\nThe Warriors have worn throwback versions of \"The CITY\" uniforms on select games since the 1990s, most recently wearing them in the 2020–21 season They've also worn other throwback uniforms in tribute to several great moments in Warriors history, such as the 1974–75 \"Cinderella\" championship uniforms, the famous Sleepy Floyd game-inspired uniforms from 1987, the Run TMC uniforms from the 1990s, and in their final game in Oakland in 2019, a white uniform based on the 2007 \"We Believe\" era uniforms.\n\n\nRivalries\nWhile the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the NBA in 1970, the two teams' rivalry began to develop in the 2014–15 season when they met in the first of four consecutive NBA Finals Previously, no pair of teams had faced each other in more than two consecutive Finals The Warriors have won three of the four NBA Finals in which they faced the Cavaliers, losing in 2016, and winning in 2015, 2017, and 2018.\n\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\nWhile the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the NBA in 1970, the two teams' rivalry began to develop in the 2014–15 season when they met in the first of four consecutive NBA Finals Previously, no pair of teams had faced each other in more than two consecutive Finals The Warriors have won three of the four NBA Finals in which they faced the Cavaliers, losing in 2016, and winning in 2015, 2017, and 2018.\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\nThe Warriors have a lengthy history with the Los Angeles Lakers as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960s Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike, unlike in the Dodgers–Giants or 49ers–Rams rivalries of the MLB and NFL, respectively, in which both teams and fanbases express fierce animosity against one another [178] [179] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991 Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s [180] [181] The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262–173, and the postseason series 25–11 [182] [183]\n\n\nSacramento Kings\nSince the Sacramento Kings relocated there in 1985, they have shared a geographic rivalry with the Warriors, as both cities are 86 miles apart from one another However, despite the Kings joining the BAA in 1948 (when they were then known as the Royals and based in Rochester, New York), due to both teams having long periods of failing to make the playoffs, the two teams would not face each other in the postseason until 2023, where they faced off in the first round [184] In a bitterly fought series, including a rough play between Domantas Sabonis and Draymond Green in game 2 where Green stomped roughly on Sabonis's chest after he grabbed Green's leg (resulting in Green being suspended in game 3) [185] and several violent viral fan scuffles throughout the series (as opposing fans were widespread at both Chase Center and Golden 1 Center due to the geographic proximity), [186] the Warriors would defeat the Kings in seven games to advance to the semifinals The series would draw the highest first and second round playoff TV ratings for the NBA since 1999, with game 7 peaking at 11.9 million viewers on ABC [187]\n\n\nMedia\nBob Fitzgerald has done television play-by-play, and former Warriors swingman Kelenna Azubuike does color commentary for the Warriors on NBC Sports Bay Area, where they telecast more

Born on June 7, 1972, in Wellington, New Zealand, Urban has established himself as a versatile and talented actor in the film industry.\n\n## Early Life\n\nUrban was born to a German immigrant father, who owned a leather goods store in Wellington. His mother, who worked for Film Facilities in Wellington, exposed Urban to classic New Zealand cinema at an early age, sparking his interest in the film industry. Urban attended St Mark's Church School, where he showed a keen interest in public performance and began acting at the age of eight in a single line in an episode of the New Zealand television series Pioneer Woman. As he continued to participate in school stage productions, Urban took a break from acting after high school, only to return later in his career.\n\n## Career\n\nUrban's first Hollywood role came in 2002 with the horror film Ghost Ship. He then went on to work on several high-profile films, including The Lord of the Rings trilogy, where he played the role of Éomer in The Two Towers and The Return of the King. Urban's performance in the trilogy earned him recognition and praise from critics and audiences alike. In 2004, he appeared in The Bourne Supremacy as Russian Federal Security Service agent Kirill, a role that showcased his ability to play complex and nuanced characters. Urban has also appeared in films such as The Chronicles of Riddick, Star Trek, and Doom, cementing his status as a versatile actor in the film industry.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nIn September 2004, Urban married his longtime partner, Natalie Wihongi, who was his makeup artist on the 2000 television film The Privateers. Together, they have two sons, Hunter and Indiana, with Indiana being named after the eponymous hero of the Indiana Jones franchise, one of Urban's favorite movie series. The couple lived in the affluent Herne Bay section of Auckland, New Zealand. However, they announced their separation in June 2014.\n\n## Philanthropy\n\nUrban serves as a celebrity ambassador for KidsCan, a charity that supports over 16,000 disadvantaged children in New Zealand by providing them with essentials such as food, clothing, and shoes. Through his work with KidsCan, Urban aims to make a positive impact on the lives of children in need and to raise awareness about the importance of charity work.\n\n## Filmography\n\n### Film\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Notes |\n| 1992 | Savage |  |  |\n| 1994 | Airborne | John |  |\n| 1998 | The Price of Milk |  |  |\n| 2002 | Ghost Ship | 2nd Mate Greer |  |\n| 2002 | The Bourne Identity | Kirill |  |\n| 2002 | The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers | Éomer |  |\n| 2004 | The Chronicles of Riddick | Vaako |  |\n| 2004 | The Bourne Supremacy | Kirill |  |\n| 2005 | Star Trek | Leonard McCoy |  |\n| 2009 | Land of the Lost | Dr. Warren Thoreau |  |\n| 2009 | Dredd | Chief Judge Joseph Dredd |  |\n| 2013 | Star Trek Into Darkness | Leonard McCoy |  |\n| 2013 | The Legend of Hercules | Amphitryon |  |\n| 2016 | Star Trek Beyond | Leonard McCoy |  |\n\n### Television\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Notes |\n| 1990 | Shortland Street |  |  |\n| 1990 | A Girl of the Limberlost |  |  |\n| 1991 | The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles |  |  |\n| 1992 | Hercules: The Legendary Journeys |  |  |\n| 1992 | Shark in the Park |  |  |\n| 1992 | Close to Home |  |  |\n| 1993 | The Violent Earth |  |  |\n| 1993 | Road to Avonlea |  |  |\n| 1994 | The Flying Scotsman |  |  |\n| 1995 | The Foot Shooting Party |  |  |\n| 1995 | Xena: Warrior Princess |  |  |\n| 1999 | Hercules: The Legendary Journeys |  |  |\n| 2000 | The Privateers |  |  |\n| 2000 | Highlander: The Raven |  |  |\n| 2002 | The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers | Éomer |  |\n| 2003 | The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King | Éomer |  |\n| 2013 | Almost Human | Dr. Lee |  |\n\n### Video Games\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Notes |\n| 2004 | The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age | Éomer |  |\n| 2005 | Star Trek: Elite Force II | Leonard McCoy |  |\n| 2013 | Star Trek Online | Leonard McCoy |  |\n\nNote: The above filmography is not exhaustive and is intended to provide a general overview of Karl Urban's work in film, television, and video games.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Karl_Urban\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nUrban was born in Wellington, New Zealand [3] His father, a German immigrant, [3] owned a leather goods store, and his mother once worked for Film Facilities in Wellington Through his mother, the young Urban was exposed to classic New Zealand cinema and developed an interest in the film industry [4] Urban attended St Mark's Church School, [5] where he showed an early love for public performance His first acting role came at age eight, when he had a single line in one episode of the New Zealand television series Pioneer Woman [3] Though continuing to take part in school stage productions, he did not act professionally again until after high school [3]\n\n\nCareer\nUrban's first Hollywood role was in the 2002 horror film Ghost Ship Since then, he has worked on many high-profile movies, including the second and third installments of The Lord of the Rings trilogy (The Two Towers and The Return of the King) as Éomer, The Bourne Supremacy (as Russian Federal Security Service agent Kirill), The Chronicles of Riddick, Star Trek and Doom The Hollywood Reporter speculated that Urban was one of several actors being considered for the part of British secret service agent James Bond in Casino Royale, directed by fellow New Zealander Martin Campbell [6]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn September 2004, Urban married his longtime partner, Natalie Wihongi, who was his makeup artist for the 2000 television film The Privateers [28] Together they have two sons; Hunter and Indiana His second son was named for the eponymous hero of the Indiana Jones franchise, [29] which he has stated is one of his favourite movie series [30] They lived in the affluent Herne Bay section of Auckland, New Zealand [31] The couple announced their separation in June 2014 [31]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nUrban serves as a celebrity ambassador for KidsCan, a charity that currently supports over 16,000 disadvantaged children in New Zealand by providing them with essentials such as food, clothing, and shoes [33]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Sebastián_Piñera", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nPiñera was born in Santiago de Chile on 1 December 1949, [10] [11] as the third child of José Piñera Carvallo (1917–1991) and Magdalena Echenique Rozas (1919–2000) [12] Among his ancestors on his maternal side is his mother's great-great-grandmother, Luisa Pinto Garmendia, the sister of President Aníbal Pinto Garmendia and daughter of President Francisco Antonio Pinto and Luisa Garmendia Alurralde, who was a descendant of the penultimate Inca emperor, Huayna Capac [13] He was a nephew of the former oldest living Roman Catholic bishop in the world, Bernardino Piñera, who died in 2020 due to complications from COVID-19 [14] [15]\n\n\nCareer\nPiñera was an economics lecturer from 1971 until 1988 at the University of Chile, the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, and Adolfo Ibáñez University In 1971, he was in charge of Economic Political Theory in the School of Economics at the University of Chile, and in 1972, at the Valparaiso Business School [20]\n\n\nTeaching\nPiñera was an economics lecturer from 1971 until 1988 at the University of Chile, the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, and Adolfo Ibáñez University In 1971, he was in charge of Economic Political Theory in the School of Economics at the University of Chile, and in 1972, at the Valparaiso Business School [20]\n\n\nFoundations\nIn 1989, with Cecilia Morel, Danica Radic, and Paula Délano, Piñera created the Enterprising Women Foundation (Fundación Mujer Emprende), originally called The House of Youth (La Casa de la Juventud) The foundation aims to assist in the development of young women of lower income [21]\n\n\nBusinesses\nPiñera was general manager of the Banco de Talca In 1982, a warrant was issued for his arrest on charges of violating banking law and fraudulent loans, [30] in an event where over US$38 million were not paid to the Central Bank of Chile, Piñera being the Banco de Talca's CEO The money disappeared and was never paid [31] Piñera spent 24 days in hiding while his brother, José Piñera, appealed the order, making some calls to underestimate the crime A writ of habeas corpus, first rejected by the Appeals Court but then approved by the Supreme Court, acquitted Piñera [32] According to the Pandora Papers, Sebastián Piñera's case was throw out due to political intervention [30]\n\n\nPolitical career\nIn 1988, after Pinochet had lost the referendum on his continued rule and Chile was returning to democracy, Piñera offered his support for the Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle in his pre-candidacy for president [47]\n\n\n2009–10 presidential elections\nPiñera ran for President of Chile in the 2009–2010 election [51] From August 2009, he led in opinion polls, competing with left-of-center candidates Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, Marco Enríquez-Ominami, and Jorge Arrate In the 13 December 2009 election, Piñera placed first in the results with 44.05% of the votes, while Frei placed second with 29.6% [52] Neither candidate received more than half of the total votes; therefore, as per the Constitution, Chileans returned to the polls for a final run-off election on Sunday, 17 January 2010 [53]\n\n\nPrivate to public transition\nPiñera became the first billionaire to be sworn into the Chilean Presidency [64] He offered to sell his shares in major corporations before being sworn in on 11 March 2010, to avoid conflicts of interest Piñera placed US$400 million in blind trusts [65]\n\n\nCouncil of Ministers\nPiñera announced his \"cabinet of unity\" on 9 February 2010 in Chile's National Historical Museum The cabinet was made up of 16 men and 6 women Among Piñera's nominees was Jaime Ravinet, the previous president's defense minister; until accepting Piñera's offer, he had been a member of the Christian Democratic Party Another nominee was Cristián Larroulet, who was an economic planning adviser under Pinochet [78] Piñera first met with his new ministers one day later and issued a formal memorandum calling upon all members to renounce their positions in all private companies by 28 February to avoid conflicts of interest The memorandum also said that in regards to national heritage, secretaries of state whose affiliation with companies having direct receipt of fiscal monies must either remove themselves from those associations or honor the restrictions of their competitors [79]\n\n\nFirst presidency (2010–2014)\nPiñera was sworn in as the 34th President of the Republic of Chile on 11 March 2010, in a ceremony held in a plenary session of the National Congress in Valparaíso In the same ceremony, Piñera's Cabinet ministers were sworn in The ceremony was also marked by a 6.9 Mw earthquake and subsequent aftershocks that upset the invitees [80]\n\n\nCabinet\nIn January 2018, Piñera unveiled his cabinet to harsh criticism: his interior minister, Andrés Chadwick, was a vocal supporter of Pinochet dictatorship, which had previously appointed him president of the Catholic University Students Federation [111] In 2012 Chadwick expressed \"deep repentance\" for this support after discovering \"over the years\" serious human rights violations committed by the dictatorship, while defending the regime on other grounds [112]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nOn February 22, 2019, Piñera met with Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó in Cúcuta, Colombia President Piñera also attended the Venezuela Aid Live concert.\n\n\nCriticism\nEarly in 2012, physicist Frank Duarte sharply criticized Piñera's performance in the handling

{"title": "Westminster_Abbey", "content": "\nHistory\nHistorians agree that there was a monastery dedicated to Saint Peter on the site prior to the 11th century, though its exact origin is somewhat obscure One legend claims that it was founded by the Saxon king Sæberht of Essex, and another claims that its founder was the fictional 2nd-century British king Lucius [3] One tradition claims that a young fisherman on the River Thames had a vision of Saint Peter near the site This seems to have been quoted as the origin of the salmon that Thames fishermen offered to the abbey, a custom still observed annually by the Fishmongers' Company [4]\n\n\nEdward the Confessor's abbey\nBetween 1042 and 1052, Edward the Confessor began rebuilding Saint Peter's Abbey to provide himself with a royal burial church It was built in the Romanesque style and was the first church in England built on a cruciform floorplan [8] The master stonemason for the project was Leofsi Duddason, [9] with Godwin and Wendelburh Gretsyd (meaning \"fat purse\") as patrons, and Teinfrith as \"churchwright\", probably meaning someone who worked on the carpentry and roofing [10] Endowments from Edward supported a community that increased from a dozen monks during Dunstan's time, to as many as 80 [11] The building was completed around 1060 and was consecrated on 28 December 1065, about a week before Edward's death on 5 January 1066 [12] A week later, he was buried in the church; nine years later, his wife Edith was buried alongside him [13] His successor, Harold Godwinson, was probably crowned here, although the first documented coronation is that of William the Conqueror later that year [14]\n\n\nHenry III's rebuilding\nWestminster Abbey continued to be used as a coronation site, but after Edward the Confessor, no monarchs were buried there until Henry III began to rebuild it in the Gothic style Henry III wanted it built as a shrine to venerate Edward, to match great French churches such as Rheims Cathedral and Sainte-Chapelle, [22] and as a burial place for himself and his family [23] Construction began on 6 July 1245 under Henry's master mason, Henry of Reynes [9] The first building stage included the entire eastern end, the transepts, and the easternmost bay of the nave The Lady chapel, built from around 1220 at the extreme eastern end, was incorporated into the chevet of the new building  \n\n\nCompletion of the Gothic church\nFrom 1376, Abbot Nicholas Litlyngton and Richard II donated large sums to finish the church The remainder of the old nave was pulled down and rebuilding commenced, with his mason Henry Yevele closely following the original design even though it was now more than 100 years out of date [34] [35] During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, Richard prayed at Edward the Confessor's shrine for \"divine aid when human counsel was altogether wanting\" before meeting the rebels at Smithfield In the modern day, the abbey holds Richard's full-length portrait, the earliest of an English king, on display near the west door [36]\n\n\nDissolution and Reformation\nIn the 1530s, Henry VIII broke away from the authority of the Catholic Church in Rome and seized control of England's monasteries, including Westminster Abbey, beginning the English Reformation [45] In 1535, when the king's officers assessed the abbey's funds, their annual income was £3,000 [46] Henry's agents removed many relics, saints' images, and treasures from the abbey The golden feretory that housed the coffin of Edward the Confessor was melted down, and monks hid his bones to save them from destruction [47] The monastery was dissolved and the building became the cathedral for the newly created Diocese of Westminster [48] The abbot, William Benson, became dean of the cathedral, while the prior and five of the monks were among the twelve newly created canons [49]\n\n\n18th and 19th centuries\nAt the end of the 17th century, the architect Christopher Wren was appointed the abbey's first Surveyor of the Fabric He began a project to restore the exterior of the church, [44] which was continued by his successor, William Dickinson [55] After over two hundred years, the abbey's two western towers were built in the 1740s in a Gothic–Baroque style by Nicholas Hawksmoor and John James [44] [2]\n\n\n20th century\nThe abbey saw \"Prayers For Prisoners\" suffragette protests in 1913 and 1914 Protesters attended services and interrupted proceedings by chanting \"God Save Mrs Pankhurst\" and praying for suffragette prisoners In one protest, a woman chained herself to her chair during a sermon by the Archbishop of Canterbury [2] On 11 June 1914, a bomb planted by suffragettes of the Women's Social and Political Union exploded inside the abbey [64] No serious injuries were reported, [65] but the bomb blew off a corner of the Coronation Chair [64] It also caused the Stone of Scone to break in half, although this was not discovered until 1950 when four Scottish nationalists broke into the church to steal the stone and return it to Scotland [64]\n\n\n21st century\nIn June 2009, the first major building work in 250 years was proposed [76] A corona – a crown-like architectural feature – was suggested to be built around the lantern over the central crossing, replacing an existing pyramidal structure dating from the 1950s [77] This was part of a wider £23-million development of the abbey completed in 2013 [76] On 4 August 2010, the Dean and Chapter announced that, \"after a considerable amount of preliminary and exploratory work\", efforts toward the construction of a corona would not be continued [78]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe building is chiefly built in a Geometric Gothic style, using Reigate stone for facings The church has an eleven-bay nave with aisles, transepts, and a chancel with ambulatory and radiating chapels The building is supported with two tiers of flying buttresses The western end of the nave and the west front were designed by Henry Yevele in a Perpendicular Gothic style The Henry VII Chapel was built in a late Perpendicular style in Huddlestone stone, probably by Robert and William Vertue The west towers were designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor and blend the Gothic style of the abbey with the Baroque style fashionable during his lifetime [2]\n\n\nInterior\nThe church's interior has Purbeck marble piers and shafting The roof vaulting is quadripartite, with ridge ribs and bosses [2] and, at 102 feet (31 m), it is one of Britain's highest church vaults [8] To accommodate as many guests as possible during coronations, the transepts were designed to be unusually long [95] and the choir was placed east (rather than west) of the crossing; this is also seen in Rheims Cathedral [96] The 13th-century interior would have been painted in bright colours and gilded, although the piers would have been left unpainted [97]\n\n\nChapter house and Pyx Chamber\nThe octagonal chapter house was used by the abbey monks for daily meetings, where they would hear a chapter of the Rule of St Benedict and receive their instructions for the day from the abbot [116] The chapter house was built between 1250 and 1259 and is one of the largest in Britain, measuring nearly 60 feet (18 m) across [117] For 300 years after the English Reformation, it was used to store state records until they were moved to the Public Record Office in 1863 [118] It was restored by George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century [119]\n\n\nHenry VII Chapel\nThe Henry VII Lady Chapel, also known simply as the Henry VII Chapel, is a large lady chapel at the far eastern end of the abbey which was paid for by the will of King Henry VII [124] The chapel, built in late Perpendicular Gothic style, inspired English poet John Leland to call it the orbis miraculum (the wonder of the world) [125] The tombs of several monarchs, including Edward V, Henry VII, Edward VI, Mary I, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles II, George II and Mary, Queen of Scots, are in the chapel [126]\n\n\nMonastic buildings\nMany rooms used by the monks have been repurposed The dormitory became a library and a school room, and the monks' offices have been converted into houses for the clergy [133] The abbot had his own lodgings, and ate separately from the rest of the monks The lodgings, now used by the Dean of Westminster, are probably the oldest continuously occupied residence in London [134] They include the Jericho Parlour (covered in wooden linenfold panelling), the Jerusalem Chamber (commissioned in 1369), and a grand dining hall with a minstrels' gallery which is now used by Westminster School [134] The prior also had his own household, separate from the monks, on the site of present-day Ashburnham House in Little Dean's Yard (now also part of Westminster School) [135] [136]\n\n\nArtworks and treasures\nThe nave and transepts have sixteen crystal chandeliers made of hand-blown Waterford glass Designed by A B Read and Stephen Dykes Bower, they were donated by the Guinness family in 1965 to commemorate the abbey's 900th anniversary [137] The choir stalls were designed by Edward Blore in 1848 [100] Some stalls are assigned to high commissioners of countries in the Commonwealth of Nations [138]\n\n\nCosmati pavement\nAt the crossing in front of Edward the Confessor's shrine and the main altar is the Cosmati pavement, a 700-year-old tile floor made of almost 30,000 pieces of coloured glass and stone [149] Measuring almost 25 feet square, [149] coronations take place here [150]\n\n\nStained glass\nThe abbey's 13th-century windows would have been filled with stained glass, but much of this was destroyed in the English Civil War and the Blitz and was replaced with clear, plain glass Since the 19th century, new stained glass, designed by artists such as Ninian Comper (on the north side of the nave) and Hugh Easton and Alan Younger (in the Henry VII Chapel), has replaced clear glass [159]\n\n\nQueen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries\nThe Westminster Abbey Museum was located in the 11th-century vaulted undercroft beneath the former monks' dormitory This is one of the oldest areas of the abbey, dating almost to the foundation of the church by Edward the Confessor in 1065 This space had been used as a museum since 1908, [164] but was closed to the public when it was replaced as a museum in June 2018 by the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries (high in the abbey's triforium and accessed through the Weston Tower, which encloses a lift and stairs) [82]\n\n\nBurials and memorials\nOver 3,300 people are buried or commemorated in the abbey [167] For much of its history, most of the people buried there (other than monarchs) were people with a connection to the church – either ordinary locals or the monks of the abbey, who were generally buried without surviving markers [168] Since the 18th century, it has been an honour for any British person to be buried or commemorated in the abbey – a practice boosted by the lavish funeral and monument of Isaac Newton, who died in 1727 [169] By 1900, so many prominent figures were buried in the abbey that the writer William Morris called it a \"National Valhalla\" [170]\n\n\nPoets' Corner\nThe south transept of the church is known as Poets' Corner because of its high number of burials of, and memorials to, poets and writers The first was Geoffrey Chaucer (buried around 1400), who was employed as Clerk of the King's Works and had apartments in the abbey A second poet, Edmund Spenser (who was local to the abbey), was buried nearby in 1599 The idea of a Poets' Corner did not crystallise until the 18th century, when memorials were established to writers buried elsewhere, such as William Shakespeare and John Milton Since then, writers buried in Poets' Corner have included John Dryden, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Charles Dickens, and Rudyard Kipling Not all writers buried in the abbey are in the south transept; Ben Jonson is buried standing upright in the north aisle of the nave, and Aphra Behn in the cloisters [174]\n\n\nThe Unknown Warrior\nOn the floor, just inside the Great West Door in the centre of the nave, is the grave of the Unknown Warrior: an unidentified soldier killed on a European battlefield during the First World War Although many countries have a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (or Warrior), the one in Westminster Abbey was the first; it came about as a response to the unprecedented death toll of the war [175] The idea came from army chaplain David Railton, who suggested it in 1920 [176] The funeral was held on 11 November 1920, the second anniversary of the end of the war [175] The Unknown Warrior lay in state for a week afterwards, and an estimated 1.25 million people viewed his gravesite in that time This grave is the only floor stone in the abbey on which it is forbidden to walk, [177] and every visit by a foreign head of state begins with a visit to it [176]\n\n\nRoyal occasions\nThe abbey has strong connections with the royal family It has been patronised by monarchs, been the location for coronations, royal weddings and funerals, and several monarchs have attended services there One monarch was born and one died at Westminster Abbey In 1413, Henry IV collapsed while praying at the shrine of Edward the Confessor He was moved into the Jerusalem Chamber, and died shortly afterwards [178] Edward V was born in the abbot's house in 1470 [38]\n\n\nCoronations\nSince the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066, 40 English and British monarchs have been crowned in Westminster Abbey (not counting Edward V, Lady Jane Grey, and Edward VIII, who were never crowned) [182] [183] In 1216, Henry III could not be crowned in the abbey because London was occupied by hostile forces at the time Henry was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral, and had a second coronation at Westminster Abbey in 1220 [139] When he had the abbey rebuilt, it was designed with long transepts to accommodate many guests at future coronations [95] Much of the order of service derives from the Liber Regalis, an illuminated manuscript made in 1377 for the coronation of Richard II and held in the abbey's collections [184] On 6 May 2023, the coronation of Charles III took place at the abbey [183] The area used in the church is the crossing, known in the abbey as \"the theatre\" because of its suitability for grand events The space in the crossing is clear rather than filled with immovable pews (like many similar churches), allowing for temporary seating in the transepts [182]\n\n\nWeddings\nAt least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey [188] Royal weddings at the abbey were relatively rare before the 20th century, with royals often married in a Chapel Royal or at Windsor Castle; this changed with the 1922 wedding of Princess Mary at the abbey In 1923, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon became the first royal bride to leave her bouquet on the grave of the Unknown Warrior, a practice continued by many royal brides since [189]\n\n\nFunerals\nMany royal funerals took place at the abbey between that of Edward the Confessor in 1066 [31] and that of Prince Henry, the last royal buried in the church, in 1790 There were no royal funerals at the abbey from then until that of Queen Alexandra in 1925; the queen was buried in Windsor Castle [193] Other queen consorts, such as Mary of Teck in 1953 and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002, have also had funerals at the abbey before being buried elsewhere [193]\n\n\nPeople\nWestminster Abbey is a collegiate church governed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster as established by a royal charter from Elizabeth I dated 21 May 1560, which created it as the Collegiate Church of St Peter Westminster (a royal peculiar) [198] In 2019, David Hoyle was appointed Dean of Westminster [199] The chapter consists of four canons and a senior administrative officer, known as the Receiver General [198] One of the canons is also rector of the adjoining St Margaret's Church, Westminster, and is often the chaplain of the Speaker of the House of Commons [200] In addition to the dean and canons, there are minor canons [201]\n\n\nDean and Chapter\nWestminster Abbey is a collegiate church governed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster as established by a royal charter from Elizabeth I dated 21 May 1560, which created it as the Collegiate Church of St Peter Westminster (a royal peculiar) [198] In 2019, David Hoyle was appointed Dean of Westminster [199] The chapter consists of four canons and a senior administrative officer, known as the Receiver General [198] One of the canons is also rector of the adjoining St Margaret's Church, Westminster, and is often the chaplain of the Speaker of the House of Commons [200] In addition to the dean and canons, there are minor canons [201]\n\n\nKing's almsmen\nSix King's (or Queen's) almsmen and women are supported by the abbey They are appointed by royal warrant on the recommendation of the dean and the Home Secretary, attend Matins and Evensong on Sundays, and perform requested duties for a small stipend On duty, they wear a distinctive red gown with a crowned rose badge on the left shoulder [202]\n\n\nSchools\nWestminster School is in the abbey Instruction has taken place since the 14th century with the monks of the abbey; the school regards its founder as Elizabeth I, who dissolved the monastery for the last time and provided for the establishment of the school, [204] the dean, canons, assistant clergy, and lay officers [205] The schoolboys were rambunctious; Westminster boys have defaced the Coronation Chair, disrupted services, and once interrupted the consecration of four bishops with a bare-knuckle fight in the cloisters [204] One schoolboy carved on the Coronation Chair that he had slept in it overnight, making him probably its longest inhabitant [206] Westminster School became independent of the abbey Dean and Chapter in 1868, although the institutions remain closely connected [205] Westminster Abbey Choir School, also on the abbey grounds, educates the choirboys who sing for abbey services [207]\n\n\nOrder of the Bath\nThe Most Honourable Order of the Bath is a British order of chivalry whose spiritual home is the abbey's Henry VII Chapel [60] The order was founded by George I in 1725, [208] fell out of fashion after 1812, and was revived by George V in 1913 [209] The name derives from the elaborate medieval ceremony for appointing a knight, which included bathing as a symbol of purification [60] Members are given stalls with their banner, crest, and a stall plate at installation ceremonies in the abbey every four years [210] Since there are more members than stalls, some members wait many years for their installation [211] The Order of the Bath is the fourth-oldest British orders of chivalry, after the Orders of the Garter, the Thistle, and St Patrick (the latter is presently dormant) [212]\n\n\nMusic\nAndrew Nethsingha has been the abbey's organist and master of the choristers since 2023 [213] Peter Holder is the sub-organist, [214] Matthew Jorysz the assistant organist, [215] and Dewi Rees is the organ scholar [216]\n\n\nChoir\nSince its foundation in the 14th century, the primary role of the Westminster Abbey choir has been to sing for daily services; the choir also plays a central role in many state occasions, including royal weddings and funerals, coronations, and memorial services [217] In 2012, the choir accepted an invitation from Pope Benedict XVI to sing with the Sistine Chapel Choir at a Papal Mass in St Peter's Basilica [218] The all-male choir consists of twelve professional adult singers and thirty boy choristers from eight to 13 years old who attend the Westminster Abbey Choir School [219]\n\n\nOrgan\nThe first record of an organ at Westminster Abbey was the mention of a gift of three marks from Henry III in 1240 for the repair of one (or more) organs [220] Unum parem organorum (\"a pair of organs\") was recorded in the Lady Chapel in 1304 [220] An inventory compiled for the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540 lists a pair of organs in the choir and one in the Islip Chapel [220] During the Commonwealth, a Royalist source said that soldiers who were billeted in the abbey \"brake downe the Organ, and pawned the pipes at severall Ale-houses for pots of Ale\"; an organ was played at the Restoration in 1660, however, suggesting that it had not been completely destroyed [220] In 1720, an organ gifted by George II and built by Christopher Shrider was installed over the choir screen; organs had previously been hidden on the north side of the choir The organ was rebuilt by William Hill & Son in 1848 [220]\n\n\nBells\nThere have been bells at the abbey since at least the time of Henry III, and the current bells were installed in the north-west tower in 1971 [223] The ring is made up of ten bells, hung for change ringing, which were cast in 1971 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry and tuned to the musical notes F#, E, D, C#, B, A, G, F#, E and D The tenor bell in D (588.5 Hz) has a weight of 30 cwt, 1 qtr, 15 lb (3,403 lb, or 1,544 kg) [224] Two additional service bells were cast by Robert Mot in 1585 and 1598, and a sanctus bell was cast in 1738 by Richard Phelps and Thomas Lester Two bells are unused; one was cast c. 1320, and the second was cast in 1742 by Thomas Lester [224] The Westminster Abbey Company of Ringers ring peals on special occasions, such as the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton [225]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nWestminster Abbey is mentioned in the play Henry VIII by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, when a gentleman describes Anne Boleyn's coronation [226] The abbey was mentioned in a 1598 sonnet by Thomas Bastard which begins, \"When I behold, with deep astonishment / To famous Westminster how there restort / Living in brass or stony monument / The princes and the worthies of all sort\" [227] Poetry about the abbey has also been written by Francis Beaumont [227] and John Betjeman [228] The building has appeared in paintings by artists such as Canaletto, [60] Wenceslaus Hollar, [229] William Bruce Ellis Ranken, [230] and J M W Turner [231]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

The chapter consists of four canons and a senior administrative officer, known as the Receiver General.\n\n## King's Almsmen\n\nSix King's (or Queen's) almsmen and women are supported by the abbey. They are appointed by royal warrant on the recommendation of the dean and the Home Secretary, attend Matins and Evensong on Sundays, and perform requested duties for a small stipend.\n\n## Schools\n\nWestminster School is in the abbey. Instruction has taken place since the 14th century with the monks of the abbey. The school regards its founder as Elizabeth I, who dissolved the monastery for the last time and provided for the establishment of the school.\n\n## Order of the Bath\n\nThe Most Honourable Order of the Bath is a British order of chivalry whose spiritual home is the abbey's Henry VII Chapel. The order was founded by George I in 1725, fell out of fashion after 1812, and was revived by George V in 1913.\n\n## Music\n\nAndrew Nethsingha has been the abbey's organist and master of the choristers since 2023. Peter Holder is the sub-organist, Matthew Jorysz the assistant organist, and Dewi Rees is the organ scholar.\n\n## Choir\n\nThe primary role of the Westminster Abbey choir has been to sing for daily services. The choir also plays a central role in many state occasions, including royal weddings and funerals, coronations, and memorial services.\n\n## Organ\n\nThe first record of an organ at Westminster Abbey was the mention of a gift of three marks from Henry III in 1240 for the repair of one (or more) organs. Unum parem organorum (\"a pair of organs\") was recorded in the Lady Chapel in 1304.\n\n## Bells\n\nThere have been bells at the abbey since at least the time of Henry III, and the current bells were installed in the north-west tower in 1971. The ring is made up of ten bells, hung for change ringing.\n\n## In Popular Culture\n\nWestminster Abbey has appeared in numerous works of art, literature, and film, often as a symbol of British tradition and history.\n\nThe article is now complete.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Westminster_Abbey\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nHistorians agree that there was a monastery dedicated to Saint Peter on the site prior to the 11th century, though its exact origin is somewhat obscure One legend claims that it was founded by the Saxon king Sæberht of Essex, and another claims that its founder was the fictional 2nd-century British king Lucius [3] One tradition claims that a young fisherman on the River Thames had a vision of Saint Peter near the site This seems to have been quoted as the origin of the salmon that Thames fishermen offered to the abbey, a custom still observed annually by the Fishmongers' Company [4]\n\n\nEdward the Confessor's abbey\nBetween 1042 and 1052, Edward the Confessor began rebuilding Saint Peter's Abbey to provide himself with a royal burial church It was built in the Romanesque style and was the first church in England built on a cruciform floorplan [8] The master stonemason for the project was Leofsi Duddason, [9] with Godwin and Wendelburh Gretsyd (meaning \"fat purse\") as patrons, and Teinfrith as \"churchwright\", probably meaning someone who worked on the carpentry and roofing [10] Endowments from Edward supported a community that increased from a dozen monks during Dunstan's time, to as many as 80 [11] The building was completed around 1060 and was consecrated on 28 December 1065, about a week before Edward's death on 5 January 1066 [12] A week later, he was buried in the church; nine years later, his wife Edith was buried alongside him [13] His successor, Harold Godwinson, was probably crowned here, although the first documented coronation is that of William the Conqueror later that year [14]\n\n\nHenry III's rebuilding\nWestminster Abbey continued to be used as a coronation site, but after Edward the Confessor, no monarchs were buried there until Henry III began to rebuild it in the Gothic style Henry III wanted it built as a shrine to venerate Edward, to match great French churches such as Rheims Cathedral and Sainte-Chapelle, [22] and as a burial place for himself and his family [23] Construction began on 6 July 1245 under Henry's master mason, Henry of Reynes [9] The first building stage included the entire eastern end, the transepts, and the easternmost bay of the nave The Lady chapel, built from around 1220 at the extreme eastern end, was incorporated into the chevet of the new building  \n\n\nCompletion of the Gothic church\nFrom 1376, Abbot Nicholas Litlyngton and Richard II donated large sums to finish the church The remainder of the old nave was pulled down and rebuilding commenced, with his mason Henry Yevele closely following the original design even though it was now more than 100 years out of date [34] [35] During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, Richard prayed at Edward the Confessor's shrine for \"divine aid when human counsel was altogether wanting\" before meeting the rebels at Smithfield In the modern day, the abbey holds Richard's full-length portrait, the earliest of an English king, on display near the west door [36]\n\n\nDissolution and Reformation\nIn the 1530s, Henry VIII broke away from the authority of the Catholic Church in Rome and seized control of England's monasteries, including Westminster Abbey, beginning the English Reformation [45] In 1535, when the king's officers assessed the abbey's funds, their annual income was £3,000 [46] Henry's agents removed many relics, saints' images, and treasures from the abbey The golden feretory that housed the coffin of Edward the Confessor was melted down, and monks hid his bones to save them from destruction [47] The monastery was dissolved and the building became the cathedral for the newly created Diocese of Westminster [48] The abbot, William Benson, became dean of the cathedral, while the prior and five of the monks were among the twelve newly created canons [49]\n\n\n18th and 19th centuries\nAt the end of the 17th century, the architect Christopher Wren was appointed the abbey's first Surveyor of the Fabric He began a project to restore the exterior of the church, [44] which was continued by his successor, William Dickinson [55] After over two hundred years, the abbey's two western towers were built in the 1740s in a Gothic–Baroque style by Nicholas Hawksmoor and John James [44] [2]\n\n\n20th century\nThe abbey saw \"Prayers For Prisoners\" suffragette protests in 1913 and 1914 Protesters attended services and interrupted proceedings by chanting \"God Save Mrs Pankhurst\" and praying for suffragette prisoners In one protest, a woman chained herself to her chair during a sermon by the Archbishop of Canterbury [2] On 11 June 1914, a bomb planted by suffragettes of the Women's Social and Political Union exploded inside the abbey [64] No serious injuries were reported, [65] but the bomb blew off a corner of the Coronation Chair [64] It also caused the Stone of Scone to break in half, although this was not discovered until 1950 when four Scottish nationalists broke into the church to steal the stone and return it to Scotland [64]\n\n\n21st century\nIn June 2009, the first major building work in 250 years was proposed [76] A corona – a crown-like architectural feature – was suggested to be built around the lantern over the central crossing, replacing an existing pyramidal structure dating from the 1950s [77] This was part of a wider £23-million development of the abbey completed in 2013 [76] On 4 August 2010, the Dean and Chapter announced that, \"after a considerable amount of preliminary and exploratory work\", efforts toward the construction of a corona would not be continued [78]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe building is chiefly built in a Geometric Gothic style, using Reigate stone for facings The church has an eleven-bay nave with aisles, transepts, and a chancel with ambulatory and radiating chapels The building is supported with two tiers of flying buttresses The western end of the nave and the west front were designed by Henry Yevele in a Perpendicular Gothic style The Henry VII Chapel was built in a late Perpendicular style in Huddlestone stone, probably by Robert and William Vertue The west towers were designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor and blend the Gothic style of the abbey with the Baroque style fashionable during his lifetime [2]\n\n\nInterior\nThe church's interior has Purbeck marble piers and shafting The roof vaulting is quadripartite, with ridge ribs and bosses [2] and, at 102 feet (31 m), it is one of Britain's highest church vaults [8] To accommodate as many guests as possible during coronations, the transepts were designed to be unusually long [95] and the choir was placed east (rather than west) of the crossing; this is also seen in Rheims Cathedral [96] The 13th-century interior would have been painted in bright colours and gilded, although the piers would have been left unpainted [97]\n\n\nChapter house and Pyx Chamber\nThe octagonal chapter house was used by the abbey monks for daily meetings, where they would hear a chapter of the Rule of St Benedict and receive their instructions for the day from the abbot [116] The chapter house was built between 1250 and 1259 and is one of the largest in Britain, measuring nearly 60 feet (18 m) across [117] For 300 years after the English Reformation, it was used to store state records until they were moved to the Public Record Office in 1863 [118] It was restored by George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century [119]\n\n\nHenry VII Chapel\nThe Henry VII Lady Chapel, also known simply as the Henry VII Chapel, is a large lady chapel at the far eastern end of the abbey which was paid for by the will of King Henry VII [124] The chapel, built in late Perpendicular Gothic style, inspired English poet John Leland to call it the orbis miraculum (the wonder of the world) [125] The tombs of several monarchs, including Edward V, Henry VII, Edward VI, Mary I, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles II, George II and Mary, Queen of Scots, are in the chapel [126]\n\n\nMonastic buildings\nMany rooms used by the monks have been repurposed The dormitory became a library and a school room, and the monks' offices have been converted into houses for the clergy [133] The abbot had his own lodgings, and ate separately from the rest of the monks The lodgings, now used by the Dean of Westminster, are probably the oldest continuously occupied residence in London [134] They include the Jericho Parlour (covered in wooden linenfold panelling), the Jerusalem Chamber (commissioned in 1369), and a grand dining hall with a minstrels' gallery which is now used by Westminster School [134] The prior also had his own household, separate from the monks, on the site of present-day Ashburnham House in Little Dean's Yard (now also part of Westminster School) [135] [136]\n\n\nArtworks and treasures\nThe nave and transepts have sixteen crystal chandeliers made of hand-blown Waterford glass Designed by A B Read and Stephen Dykes Bower, they were donated by the Guinness family in 1965 to commemorate the abbey's 900th anniversary [137] The choir stalls were designed by Edward Blore in 1848 [100] Some stalls are assigned to high commissioners of countries in the Commonwealth of Nations [138]\n\n\nCosmati pavement\nAt the crossing in front of Edward the Confessor's shrine and the main altar is the Cosmati pavement, a 700-year-old tile floor made of almost 30,000 pieces of coloured glass and stone [149] Measuring almost 25 feet square, [149] coronations take place here [150]\n\n\nStained glass\nThe abbey's 13th-century windows would have been filled with stained glass, but much of this was destroyed in the English Civil War and the Blitz and was replaced with clear, plain glass Since the 19th century, new stained glass, designed by artists such as Ninian Comper (on the north side of the nave) and Hugh Easton and Alan Younger (in the Henry VII Chapel), has replaced clear glass [159]\n\n\nQueen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries\nThe Westminster Abbey Museum was located in the 11th-century vaulted undercroft beneath the former monks' dormitory This is one of the oldest areas of the abbey, dating almost to the foundation of the church by Edward the Confessor in 1065 This space had been used as a museum since 1908, [164] but was closed to the public when it was replaced as a museum in June 2018 by the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries (high in the abbey's triforium and accessed through the Weston Tower, which encloses a lift and stairs) [82]\n\n\nBurials and memorials\nOver 3,300 people are buried or commemorated in the abbey [167] For much of its history, most of the people buried there (other than monarchs) were people with a connection to the church – either ordinary locals or the monks of the abbey, who were generally buried without surviving markers [168] Since the 18th century, it has been an honour for any British person to be buried or commemorated in the abbey – a practice boosted by the lavish funeral and monument of Isaac Newton, who died in 1727 [169] By 1900, so many prominent figures were buried in the abbey that the writer William Morris called it a \"National Valhalla\" [170]\n\n\nPoets' Corner\nThe south transept of the church is known as Poets' Corner because of its high number of burials of, and memorials to, poets and writers The first was Geoffrey Chaucer (buried around 1400), who was employed as Clerk of the King's Works and had apartments in the abbey A second poet, Edmund Spenser (who was local to the abbey), was buried nearby in 1599 The idea of a Poets' Corner did not crystallise until the 18th century, when memorials were established to writers buried elsewhere, such as William Shakespeare and John Milton Since then, writers buried in Poets' Corner have included John Dryden, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Charles Dickens, and Rudyard Kipling Not all writers buried in the abbey are in the south transept; Ben Jonson is buried standing upright in the north aisle of the nave, and Aphra Behn in the cloisters [174]\n\n\nThe Unknown Warrior\nOn the floor, just inside the Great West Door in the centre of the nave, is the grave of the Unknown Warrior: an unidentified soldier killed on a European battlefield during the First World War Although many countries have a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (or Warrior), the one in Westminster Abbey was the first; it came about as a response to the unprecedented death toll of the war [175] The idea came from army chaplain David Railton, who suggested it in 1920 [176] The funeral was held on 11 November 1920, the second anniversary of the end of the war [175] The Unknown Warrior lay in state for a week afterwards, and an estimated 1.25 million people viewed his gravesite in that time This grave is the only floor stone in the abbey on which it is forbidden to walk, [177] and every visit by a foreign head of state begins with a visit to it [176]\n\n\nRoyal occasions\nThe abbey has strong connections with the royal family It has been patronised by monarchs, been the location for coronations, royal weddings and funerals, and several monarchs have attended services there One monarch was born and one died at Westminster Abbey In 1413, Henry IV collapsed while praying at the shrine of Edward the Confessor He was moved into the Jerusalem Chamber, and died shortly afterwards [178] Edward V was born in the abbot's house in 1470 [38]\n\n\nCoronations\nSince the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066, 40 English and British monarchs have been crowned in Westminster Abbey (not counting Edward V, Lady Jane Grey, and Edward VIII, who were never crowned) [182] [183] In 1216, Henry III could not be crowned in the abbey because London was occupied by hostile forces at the time Henry was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral, and had a second coronation at Westminster Abbey in 1220 [139] When he had the abbey rebuilt, it was designed with long transepts to accommodate many guests at future coronations [95] Much of the order of service derives from the Liber Regalis, an illuminated manuscript made in 1377 for the coronation of Richard II and held in the abbey's collections [184] On 6 May 2023, the coronation of Charles III took place at the abbey [183] The area used in the church is the crossing, known in the abbey as \"the theatre\" because of its suitability for grand events The space in the crossing is clear rather than filled with immovable pews (like many similar churches), allowing for temporary seating in the transepts [182]\n\n\nWeddings\nAt least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey [188] Royal weddings at the abbey were relatively rare before the 20th century, with royals often married in a Chapel Royal or at Windsor Castle; this changed with the 1922 wedding of Princess Mary at the abbey In 1923, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon became the first royal bride to leave her bouquet on the grave of the Unknown Warrior, a practice continued by many royal brides since [189]\n\n\nFunerals\nMany royal funerals took place at the abbey between that of Edward the Confessor in 1066 [31] and that of Prince Henry, the last royal buried in the church, in 1790 There were no royal funerals at the abbey from then until that of Queen Alexandra in 1925; the queen was buried in Windsor Castle [193] Other queen consorts, such as Mary of Teck in 1953 and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002, have also had funerals at the abbey before being buried elsewhere [193]\n\n\nPeople\nWestminster Abbey is a collegiate church governed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster as established by a royal charter from Elizabeth I dated 21 May 1560, which created it as the Collegiate Church of St Peter Westminster (a royal peculiar) [198] In 2019, David Hoyle was appointed Dean of Westminster [199] The chapter consists of four canons and a senior administrative officer, known as the Receiver General [198] One of the canons is also rector of the adjoining St Margaret's Church, Westminster, and is often the chaplain of the Speaker of the House of Commons [200] In addition to the dean and canons, there are minor canons [201]\n\n\nDean and Chapter\nWestminster Abbey is a collegiate church

canons [201]\n\n\nKing's almsmen\nSix King's (or Queen's) almsmen and women are supported by the abbey They are appointed by royal warrant on the recommendation of the dean and the Home Secretary, attend Matins and Evensong on Sundays, and perform requested duties for a small stipend On duty, they wear a distinctive red gown with a crowned rose badge on the left shoulder [202]\n\n\nSchools\nWestminster School is in the abbey Instruction has taken place since the 14th century with the monks of the abbey; the school regards its founder as Elizabeth I, who dissolved the monastery for the last time and provided for the establishment of the school, [204] the dean, canons, assistant clergy, and lay officers [205] The schoolboys were rambunctious; Westminster boys have defaced the Coronation Chair, disrupted services, and once interrupted the consecration of four bishops with a bare-knuckle fight in the cloisters [204] One schoolboy carved on the Coronation Chair that he had slept in it overnight, making him probably its longest inhabitant [206] Westminster School became independent of the abbey Dean and Chapter in 1868, although the institutions remain closely connected [205] Westminster Abbey Choir School, also on the abbey grounds, educates the choirboys who sing for abbey services [207]\n\n\nOrder of the Bath\nThe Most Honourable Order of the Bath is a British order of chivalry whose spiritual home is the abbey's Henry VII Chapel [60] The order was founded by George I in 1725, [208] fell out of fashion after 1812, and was revived by George V in 1913 [209] The name derives from the elaborate medieval ceremony for appointing a knight, which included bathing as a symbol of purification [60] Members are given stalls with their banner, crest, and a stall plate at installation ceremonies in the abbey every four years [210] Since there are more members than stalls, some members wait many years for their installation [211] The Order of the Bath is the fourth-oldest British orders of chivalry, after the Orders of the Garter, the Thistle, and St Patrick (the latter is presently dormant) [212]\n\n\nMusic\nAndrew Nethsingha has been the abbey's organist and master of the choristers since 2023 [213] Peter Holder is the sub-organist, [214] Matthew Jorysz the assistant organist, [215] and Dewi Rees is the organ scholar [216]\n\n\nChoir\nSince its foundation in the 14th century, the primary role of the Westminster Abbey choir has been to sing for daily services; the choir also plays a central role in many state occasions, including royal weddings and funerals, coronations, and memorial services [217] In 2012, the choir accepted an invitation from Pope Benedict XVI to sing with the Sistine Chapel Choir at a Papal Mass in St Peter's Basilica [218] The all-male choir consists of twelve professional adult singers and thirty boy choristers from eight to 13 years old who attend the Westminster Abbey Choir School [219]\n\n\nOrgan\nThe first record of an organ at Westminster Abbey was the mention of a gift of three marks from Henry III in 1240 for the repair of one (or more) organs [220] Unum parem organorum (\"a pair of organs\") was recorded in the Lady Chapel in 1304 [220] An inventory compiled for the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540 lists a pair of organs in the choir and one in the Islip Chapel [220] During the Commonwealth, a Royalist source said that soldiers who were billeted in the abbey \"brake downe the Organ, and pawned the pipes at severall Ale-houses for pots of Ale\"; an organ was played at the Restoration in 1660, however, suggesting that it had not been completely destroyed [220] In 1720, an organ gifted by George II and built by Christopher Shrider was installed over the choir screen; organs had previously been hidden on the north side of the choir The organ was rebuilt by William Hill & Son in 1848 [220]\n\n\nBells\nThere have been bells at the abbey since at least the time of Henry III, and the current bells were installed in the north-west tower in 1971 [223] The ring is made up of ten bells, hung for change ringing, which were cast in 1971 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry and tuned to the musical notes F#, E, D, C#, B, A, G, F#, E and D The tenor bell in D (588.5 Hz) has a weight of 30 cwt, 1 qtr, 15 lb (3,403 lb, or 1,544 kg) [224] Two additional service bells were cast by Robert Mot in 1585 and 1598, and a sanctus bell was cast in 1738 by Richard Phelps and Thomas Lester Two bells are unused; one was cast c. 1320, and the second was cast in 1742 by Thomas Lester [224] The Westminster Abbey Company of Ringers ring peals on special occasions, such as the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton [225]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nWestminster Abbey is mentioned in the play Henry VIII by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, when a gentleman describes Anne Boleyn's coronation [226] The abbey was mentioned in a 1598 sonnet by Thomas Bastard which begins, \"When I behold, with deep astonishment / To famous Westminster how there restort / Living in brass or stony monument / The princes and the worthies of all sort\" [227] Poetry about the abbey has also been written by Francis Beaumont [227] and John Betjeman [228] The building has appeared in paintings by artists such as Canaletto, [60] Wenceslaus Hollar, [229] William Bruce Ellis Ranken, [230] and J M W Turner [231]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes and references\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "2021_Taliban_offensive", "content": "\nBackground\nIn September 2020, over 5,000 Taliban prisoners, including 400 accused or convicted of major crimes such as murder, were released by the Afghan government as part of the United States–Taliban deal between the United States and the Taliban [117] According to Afghanistan's National Security Council, many of the released prisoners who were \"experts\" returned to the battlefield and strengthened the Taliban's hand [118] Also by the time of Taliban's final offensive, most of the Afghan provincial governors had cut deals with the militants to switch sides and join the Taliban [119] A senior Afghan Interior Ministry official, quoted by the Washington Post, said that Taliban have recruitment teams that reach out to Afghan officials and push them to join the Taliban He says that Afghan government suspects that a long list of governors might have Taliban ties [120]\n\n\nOffensive\nIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province [123] [124] Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam [125] During the month, 405 Afghan National Security Force (ANSF) troops and 260 civilians were killed in clashes, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed to have killed 2,146 Taliban fighters [74] [69] including a Taliban divisional commander, Qari Jabar [29] By the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan [126]\n\n\nInitial advances\nIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province [123] [124] Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second largest dam [125] During the month, 405 Afghan National Security Force (ANSF) troops and 260 civilians were killed in clashes, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed to have killed 2,146 Taliban fighters [74] [69] including a Taliban divisional commander, Qari Jabar [29] By the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan [126]\n\n\nEscalation\nIn July, the Taliban captured 64 districts from the Afghan government and entered the second and third largest cities of Afghanistan, Kandahar and Herat respectively [18] [146] [147] During the month, 335 Afghan National Security Forces and 189 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Ministry of Defense claimed to have killed 3,159 Taliban fighters [74] [69] Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) envoy [75] Iranian media reported that around 300 Afghan soldiers and civilians had crossed the border and entered Iran to escape the Taliban [75]\n\n\nFall of the provincial capitals\nOn 6 August, the Taliban assassinated Dawa Khan Minapal, head of Government Media and Information Centre, in Kabul [182] On the same day, heavy fighting was reported in Jowzjan Province as the Taliban entered the provincial capital, Sheberghan The Taliban confirmed responsibility for the killing of Minapal and warned that it would target senior administration officials in retaliation for increasing airstrikes [183] On the same day, the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Nimroz Province, Zaranj, making it the first capture by the Taliban of a provincial capital since the 2001 American invasion [184] Taliban executed dozens of captured soldiers in the province, and gouged out eyes of some [185] [186] [187] The rebels proceeded to open the local prisons, allowing many inmates to escape As Zaranj had reportedly been captured with almost no resistance, Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary voiced suspicions that someone had \"sold\" the city to the Taliban [188] Social media posts suggested that the Taliban were welcomed by some residents of the city which has a long history of lawlessness Images appearing on social media showed Taliban fighters driving captured military Humvees, luxury SUVs and pickups through the streets while flying Taliban flags as local residents—mostly youths and young men—cheered them on [189] A UN envoy also warned the country was entering a 'deadlier phase' of the war [190] The governments of Britain and United States warned its citizens to leave Afghanistan \"immediately\" amid the Taliban advance and the worsening security situation [191] [192]\n\n\nNATO airlifts\nOn 12 August, a few hours after the fall of Herat, the United States and United Kingdom governments announced the deployment of 3,000 and 600 of their troops, respectively, to the Kabul airport to secure the airlifting of their nationals, embassy staff, and the Afghan civilians who worked with the coalition forces out of the country Officials said that the first deployment would occur in the next 24 to 48 hours, and that it would be completed by the end of the month According to those sources, charter aircraft were to be used for the evacuation, as the Kabul airport still allowed commercial airliners to fly at the time; military aircraft were to be used if that became impossible According to the British government, the evacuation and its timing had long been planned, but an Afghan official said that the timing was brought forward as the security situation rapidly deteriorated In addition to the 3,000 US troops, an additional 3,500 were placed on standby in Kuwait in case the situation escalated to a renewed armed conflict with the Taliban [256] [257] [258] Canada announced that Canadian special forces units will be deployed to evacuate embassy personnel in Kabul, which houses Afghan families who have worked with Canadian staff in the past [259] The Danish and Norwegian governments announced that their embassies in Kabul would close for security reasons, and proceeded to evacuate their diplomatic staff and Afghans who worked alongside them [260]\n\n\nFall of Kabul\nOn 15 August, despite issuing a statement saying it had no plans to take the Afghan capital \"by force\", the Taliban entered the outskirts of Kabul from multiple directions, including Kalakan District, Qarabagh District, and Paghman District [261] A citywide blackout and possible assault and inmate uprising at Pul-e-Charkhi prison was reported [262] [263] Boeing CH-47 Chinook and Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters began landing at the American embassy in Kabul to carry out evacuations and diplomats were rapidly shredding classified documents [264]\n\n\nWar crimes\nThe Taliban committed a number of war crimes during their 2021 offensive.\n\n\nKey factors\nKey processes in the 2021 Taliban offensive started following the February 2020 US–Taliban deal, including a bottom-up succession of negotiated or paid surrenders to the Taliban from village level upwards, [88] [89] the Taliban's effective use of online social media [89] and its strategical choice of attacking northern provinces, [109] [89] and the Taliban's freedom of movement on the main Afghan highways that resulted from the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) following the US-recommended strategy of sacrificing rural areas in favour of defending key urban centres [32] [66] [89]\n\n\nTaliban strategy\nStarting in early 2020, the Taliban started a bottom-up campaign of negotiations in rural villages with the lowest-ranked government officials Officials named the resulting deals \"ceasefires\" According to Afghan and US officials interviewed by Susannah George of The Washington Post, the word \"ceasefire\" was misleading, since the officials were paid by the Taliban to transfer ANSF weapons to the Taliban [88] Continuing through to mid 2021, each successive surrender was used to help convince other governmental and village leaders and scale up in size to district level, to allow the Taliban forces to take control of much of Afghanistan without military fights [88] [89] After US president Biden's April 2021 announcement confirming a full unconditional US withdrawal, the chain of surrenders accelerated, scaling up to province-level surrenders [88]\n\n\nSuccession of negotiated or paid surrenders\nStarting in early 2020, the Taliban started a bottom-up

military fights [88] [89] After US president Biden's April 2021 announcement confirming a full unconditional US withdrawal, the chain of surrenders accelerated, scaling up to province-level surrenders [88]\n\n\nRole of online social media\nThe Taliban used online social media to convince Afghans that \"the government was illegitimate\" and that the Taliban would be successful in taking control of Afghanistan Saad Mohseni, head of TOLOnews, stated that the Taliban's \"outreach was fantastic\" and that they \"capitalised on intratribal, ethnic, religious and ideological differences to win over people\" and exploited popular complaints against the government [89]\n\n\nNorthern Afghanistan\nDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north may have been an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of US forces [109]\n\n\nFreedom of military movement on highways\nAndrew Watkins, senior analyst for Afghanistan at the International Crisis Group, said there was no evidence that the Taliban had increased their manpower to conduct this offensive, aside from utilising some of the 5,000 insurgents who had been released earlier [32] Watkins believes that the end of US airstrikes changed the scenario He says that the end of US airstrikes granted the insurgents freedom of movement and they were able to regroup, plan and strengthen their supply lines without fear of US airstrikes [32] An international official interviewed by Voice of America stated that the Taliban had been able to move their forces freely throughout Afghanistan after the US–Taliban deal with almost no intervention from the Afghan government forces [66]\n\n\nDrop in US support for the ANSF\nAccording to Sami Sadat, a three-star general of the ANSF, the February 2020 US–Taliban deal resulted to an \"effectively .. overnight\" change in the rules for US air support for the Afghan armed forces, leading to a sudden increase in battle effectiveness by the Taliban The April 2021 confirmation by US president Biden of the US pullout resulted in the loss of contractors, proprietary software and weapons systems including the Afghan army's helicopter missile-defence system The Afghan army had been trained on a high-tech military model using helicopters, airstrikes and technically specialised reconnaissance units According to Sadat, the loss of technical support made the US high-tech army model ineffective, losing helicopter support for resupplying military bases, and aerial and laser-guided weapons [110]\n\n\nIssues with Afghan forces\n\"Former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani said that some professional military and intelligence officials as well as strong army units were given promises before the fall of Kabul that they would be evacuated, and their departure was one of the main reasons for the collapse of the Afghan military.\" [295]\n\n\nThe effect of promises of evacuation on the Afghan military\n\"Former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani said that some professional military and intelligence officials as well as strong army units were given promises before the fall of Kabul that they would be evacuated, and their departure was one of the main reasons for the collapse of the Afghan military.\" [295]\n\n\nTraining and funding\nAccording to official US \"lessons learned\" reports, the US coalition delayed its initial funding of the ANSF when the Taliban were weak after the 2001 US invasion, and when the Taliban were stronger, \" [cut] corners on training and funding\" The errors in training led to provincial police extorting money from local residents and getting paid for ghost soldiers [111]\n\n\nGhost soldiers\nCorrupt Afghan army officers leading ghost battalions, who pocket the salaries of absent soldiers, were a known issue in the Afghan military [112] [296] In a 2016 report, the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said \"neither the United States nor its Afghan allies know how many Afghan soldiers and police actually exist, how many are in fact available for duty, or, by extension, the true nature of their operational capabilities\" In early 2019, at least 42,000 ghost soldiers were removed from the army's payroll [112] However, the same year Afghanistan's Ministry of Defense denied the existence of ghost soldiers in the Afghan military The ministry's spokesman, Rohullah Ahmadzai, said that all personnel of Afghan military have physical presence on their duties and those who were involved in corruption are under investigation by the ministry [297]\n\n\nLack of loyalty towards government in Kabul\nMany Afghans are more loyal towards their traditional ethnic, tribal and even familial ties than they are to the Afghan army, which the provincial Taliban commanders exploited to negotiate surrender of many troops [114] Any sense of loyalty towards central government in Kabul is overshadowed by strong loyalty towards tribes and region [115] Mike Martin, a former British army officer, said that Ghani lacked the political skills to keep  Afghanistan's many different ethnic groups loyal to the idea of a national cause [114] Veteran Italian general and a former Chief of Staff of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), Giorgio Battisti, said the division of Afghanistan along the tribal lines and loyalties is \"stronger than loyalty to any institution\" He said that an ethnic Tajik Afghan sent to Helmand province does not understand why he has to defend ethnic Pashtun Afghans there [300]\n\n\nSalary payment management\nFor years the Pentagon was responsible for paying salary directly to the Afghan soldiers [113] The responsibility for those payment was transferred to the Kabul government since the announcement of planned withdrawal in April Since then numerous Afghan soldiers have complained that they have not been paid in months and in many cases their units were no longer receiving food, supplies or ammunition [113] Gen Wesley Clark, a former NATO supreme allied commander, told CNN that many Afghan soldiers saw the job in military as paycheck, and not a cause He said that Afghan military is composed of various tribes and factions that were historically at odds with each other He also said that it is an old Afghan trick to side with the winner or at least stay away from the losing side, and that is why Afghan military disintegrated so quickly [302]\n\n\nMilitary politicisation\nThe politicisation of Afghan military resulted in unqualified politicians, [110] loyal to Ashraf Ghani, securing key positions in Afghan military [61] Hamdullah Mohib, Ghani's national security adviser, took direct control of military operations despite having no military experience According to several senior government officials and diplomats, Mohib's orders often bypassed the normal chain of command [32] [31] Experts say that there were Generals in Afghan security forces that were put in charge through connections rather than capability [304]\n\n\nAlleged human rights abuses\nPatricia Gossman, a senior Human Rights Watch researcher, told Insider that issues such as human rights abuses and corruption undermined state credibility in the eyes of Afghan communities and played a big role in the country's fall Gossman said that US and its allies had aligned themselves with notorious figures in Afghanistan who were reviled by many communities because of atrocities committed by them in the past [304] Afghan leaders within the government, military, and police have been accused of crimes ranging from corruption to murder, rape, torture, and war crimes Asadullah Khalid, a former Afghan defense minister, was allegedly engaged in or ordered torture, sexual violence, and extrajudicial killings, according to Human Rights Watch Abdul Raziq Achakzai, a former Afghan National Police chief, was accused of running secret detention centers and carrying out or ordering torture and extrajudicial killings by human right organisations Erol Yayboke, a Center for Strategic and International Studies expert, told Insider that when it came to Afghanistan, the US and its allies were \"choosing the least bad partner.\" [304]\n\n\nForeign support for the Taliban\nThe Taliban's victory was facilitated by support from Pakistan Although Pakistan was a major US ally before and after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, elements of the Pakistan government (including the military and intelligence services) have for decades maintained strong logistical and tactical ties with Taliban militants, and this support helped support the insurgency in Afghanistan [305] [306] For example, the Haqqani Network, a Taliban affiliate based on Pakistan, had strong support from Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the Pakistan intelligence agency [305] Taliban leaders found a safe haven in Pakistan, lived in the country, transacted business and earned funds there, and receiving medical treatment there [305] [306] Some elements of the Pakistani establishment sympathized with Taliban ideology, and many Pakistan officials considered the Taliban as an asset against India [305] [306] Bruce Riedel noted that \"The Pakistani army believes Afghanistan provides strategic depth against India, which is their obsession.\" [306]\n\n\nPakistan\nThe Taliban's victory was facilitated by

obsession.\" [306]\n\n\nRussia and Iran\nDr Antonio Giustozzi, a senior research fellow at Royal United Services Institute on terrorism and conflict, wrote, \"Both the Russians and the Iranians helped the Taliban advance at a breakneck pace in May–August 2021 They contributed to funding and equipping them, but perhaps even more importantly they helped them by brokering deals with parties, groups and personalities close to either country, or even both  [...] The Revolutionary Guards helped the Taliban's advance in western Afghanistan, including by lobbying various strongmen and militia commanders linked to Iran not to resist the Taliban.\" [307]\n\n\nLocal warlord loyalties\nOn 12 August, former US adviser Vali Nasr, said that there was \"no kind of leadership that would give local warlords reasons for why they should resist the Taliban So the more they see the Taliban victory is inevitable, the more the victory becomes inevitable, because they just cut their own deals with them\" [111]\n\n\nUS assessments\nOn 23 June, the United States Intelligence Community estimated that the Afghan government could fall within the next six months following the US withdrawal [309] On 10 August, US officials revised the previous six month estimate, saying that it could happen much more quickly, and that some scenarios envisioned the fall of Kabul within 30 to 90 days [310] [311] On 13 August, reports appeared that \"senior Western diplomatic sources\" expected the Taliban to enter Kabul within the next seven days [312]\n\n\nAftermath\nOne of the consequences of the declining socio-political situation in Afghanistan was the increasing migration flow of citizens The spillover effects of the Taliban offensive meant that thousands of civilians had started considering migrating These migrants did not await the culmination of the war and started their move in the summer of 2021.\n\n\nCivilian exodus\nOne of the consequences of the declining socio-political situation in Afghanistan was the increasing migration flow of citizens The spillover effects of the Taliban offensive meant that thousands of civilians had started considering migrating These migrants did not await the culmination of the war and started their move in the summer of 2021.\n\n\nResettlements in other regions\nOn 5 August, six European Union (EU) member states, including Germany, urged the European Commission to continue deporting rejected asylum seekers back to Afghanistan despite major advances by Taliban [331] A few days later, Germany and the Netherlands temporarily suspended the deportation of Afghan refugees as Taliban insurgents captured more territory [332]\n\n\nEquipment losses\nAccording to a report published on the Oryx blog, [80] since June, the Taliban captured 12 tanks (seven T-54s and five T-62s), 51 armoured fighting vehicles (46 M1117 ASVs, two M1117 Command & Controls and three M113 APCs), 61 mortars and artillery pieces (35 122mm D-30 howitzers, three 76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)s, one 120 mm mortar, two 82 mm M69 mortars, one 60 mm mortar and 19 mortars of unknown origin), eight anti-aircraft guns (two 14.5mm KPV-1s and six 23mm ZU-23s), 16 helicopters (nine Mil Mi-17s, one Mil Mi-24V, four UH-60A Black Hawks and two MD 530Fs), six unmanned aerial vehicles (six Boeing Insitu ScanEagles), and 1,973 trucks, vehicles and jeeps from the Afghan armed forces [78] [358] The Taliban also destroyed nine M1117 ASVs, four Mi-17s and three UH-60A BlackHawks, one DJI Mavic and 104 trucks, vehicles and jeeps Oryx only counts destroyed vehicles and equipment of which photo or videographic evidence is available [78]\n\n\nHuman rights\nFemale MPs have gone into hiding since the offensive [368]\n\n\nProtests and resistance\nAfter the fall of Kabul, former Northern Alliance members and anti-Taliban figures formed a military alliance called the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, under the leadership of Ahmad Massoud and former Vice President Amrullah Saleh [369] [370] They have based themselves in the Panjshir Valley, which was a major base of operations for the original Northern Alliance [17] [371] On 17 August 2021, Afghan Vice President Amrullah Saleh declared himself caretaker President of Afghanistan in Panjshir Valley [372]\nWith the fall of Kabul, former Northern Alliance members and other anti-Taliban forces based in Panjshir, led by Ahmad Massoud and former Vice President Amrullah Saleh, became the primary organized resistance to the Taliban in Afghanistan [123] [27] [373] The Afghan embassy in Tajikistan replaced their presidential portrait of Ghani with one of Saleh, and submitted a request to Interpol to have arrest warrants issued for Ghani, along with his chief advisor Fazel Mahmood and National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib, on charges of having stolen from the Afghan treasury [374] On 1 September, talks broke down and fighting resumed as the Taliban attacked resistance positions [375] On 6 September, the Taliban took full control of the Panjshir province, with resistance fighters retreating to the mountains to continue fighting within the province [376] [377]\n\n\nProtests\nOn 17 August, a small protest was held by several women in Kabul demanding equal rights for women, the first reported women's protest against the new regime [380]\nOn 18 August, larger protests also attended by men emerged in three eastern Pashtun-dominated cities: Jalalabad, Khost, and Asadabad, with protestors waving the flag of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and taking down the Taliban flag [381] [382] [383] In Jalalabad, the Taliban opened fire, killing three and wounding over a dozen [384] On 19 August, demonstrations spread to various parts of Kabul, including one large protest near Kabul Airport where cars and people waved the flag of the republic, and another with over 200 people gathered near the presidential palace in Kabul before it was violently dispersed by the Taliban [379] [385] [386] Protests continued in Khost and Asadabad as well, with the Taliban using violence to disperse protests in both In Asadabad, protests were reported as swelling to the hundreds [384]\n\n\nCreation of new state\nMore than three weeks after the fall of Kabul, the new Taliban rulers announced the creation of a government cabinet for the new state named Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan The cabinet is all male, and is heavily dominated by ethnic Pashtuns, with only three members being of other ethnicity [387] Hasan Akhund was named acting prime minister [388] As of January 2024, the cabinet officially remains in an interim state over two years after its formation [389]\n\n\nSecurity situation\nViolence in the country sharply declined in the year after the Taliban takeover of Kabul, with conflict-related deaths falling by 91% for the year 2022 compared to 2021 [394] Taliban officials as well as civilians have come under attack by terror attacks committed by the Islamic State – Khorasan Province, [395] which have also caused increasing attacks in border regions of neighboring Pakistan [396] as well as the hit-and-run guerilla campaign by the National Resistance Front targeting Taliban [397]\n\n\nEconomic situation\nThe Service sector, making up almost half of the country's economy, fell by 30% in 2021 Within two years of the Taliban's victory, the overall economy of Afghanistan had contracted by 25% [399] According to Gallup polls, the number of Afghans struggling to afford commodities or struggling to find work has increased after the events of 2021 [400]\n\n\nInternational and local reactions\nSome Afghan politicians closely associated with the US-backed Afghan government, including Gul Agha Sherzai, the former governor of Nangahar province, congratulated Taliban on their victory [402]\n\n\nPotential al-Qaeda resurgence\nAccording to a US defense official, the security vacuum left by the withdrawal of US military forces could create an opening for al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups to reorganize The official added that, while the US would still maintain authority to strike al-Qaeda targets in Afghanistan, the lack of a robust US presence on the ground would hamper the ability to identify potential targets The CENTCOM commander Kenneth F McKenzie Jr said that he has not seen anything that would make him believe the Taliban would stop al-Qaeda from using Afghanistan to strengthen and rebuild [419]\n\n\nPotential Jaish-e-Mohammed resurgence\nAfter the Taliban seizure of Afghanistan, The Hindu claimed that many Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) cadres were released, the JeM and Taliban have held meetings and the JeM has been assured of all support in carrying out its terrorist activities in India [423] However, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in an interview with India Today denied any meeting taking place between Taliban and JeM leadership The spokesman also said that Taliban will not allow Afghanistan to be used against India or any other countries [424]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**2021 Taliban Offensive**\n\nThe 2021 Taliban offensive was a military campaign launched by the Taliban in Afghanistan against the Afghan government and its security forces. The campaign began in May 2021 and continued until the fall of Kabul in August 2021, marking the end of the Afghan government's control over the country.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn September 2020, over 5,000 Taliban prisoners, including 400 accused or convicted of major crimes such as murder, were released by the Afghan government as part of the United States–Taliban deal between the United States and the Taliban. According to Afghanistan's National Security Council, many of the released prisoners who were \"experts\" returned to the battlefield and strengthened the Taliban's hand. Also by the time of the Taliban's final offensive, most of the Afghan provincial governors had cut deals with the militants to switch sides and join the Taliban. A senior Afghan Interior Ministry official, quoted by the Washington Post, said that Taliban have recruitment teams that reach out to Afghan officials and push them to join the Taliban. He says that Afghan government suspects that a long list of governors might have Taliban ties.\n\n**Offensive**\n\nThe Taliban offensive began in May 2021, with the capture of 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan's second-largest dam. During the month, 405 Afghan National Security Force (ANSF) troops and 260 civilians were killed in clashes, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed to have killed 2,146 Taliban fighters, including a Taliban divisional commander, Qari Jabar. By the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan.\n\n**Initial Advances**\n\nIn May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province.

During the month, 335 Afghan National Security Forces and 189 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Ministry of Defense claimed to have killed 3,159 Taliban fighters. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers deserted into Tajikistan, according to its Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) envoy. Iranian media reported that around 300 Afghan soldiers and civilians had crossed the border and entered Iran to escape the Taliban.\n\n**Fall of the Provincial Capitals**\n\nOn 6 August, the Taliban assassinated Dawa Khan Minapal, head of Government Media and Information Centre, in Kabul. On the same day, heavy fighting was reported in Jowzjan Province as the Taliban entered the provincial capital, Sheberghan. The Taliban confirmed responsibility for the killing of Minapal and warned that it would target senior administration officials in retaliation for increasing airstrikes. On the same day, the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Nimroz Province, Zaranj, making it the first capture by the Taliban of a provincial capital since the 2001 American invasion.

airlifts\nOn 12 August, a few hours after the fall of Herat, the United States and United Kingdom governments announced the deployment of 3,000 and 600 of their troops, respectively, to the Kabul airport to secure the airlifting of their nationals, embassy staff, and the Afghan civilians who worked with the coalition forces out of the country Officials said that the first deployment would occur in the next 24 to 48 hours, and that it would be completed by the end of the month According to those sources, charter aircraft were to be used for the evacuation, as the Kabul airport still allowed commercial airliners to fly at the time; military aircraft were to be used if that became impossible According to the British government, the evacuation and its timing had long been planned, but an Afghan official said that the timing was brought forward as the security situation rapidly deteriorated In addition to the 3,000 US troops, an additional 3,500 were placed on standby in Kuwait in case the situation escalated to a renewed armed conflict with the Taliban [256] [257] [258] Canada announced that Canadian special forces units will be deployed to evacuate embassy personnel in

transfer ANSF weapons to the Taliban [88] Continuing through to mid 2021, each successive surrender was used to help convince other governmental and village leaders and scale up in size to district level, to allow the Taliban forces to take control of much of Afghanistan without military fights [88] [89] After US president Biden's April 2021 announcement confirming a full unconditional US

successive surrender was used to help convince other governmental and village leaders and scale up in size to district level, to allow the Taliban forces to take control of much of Afghanistan without military fights [88] [89] After US president Biden's April 2021 announcement confirming a full unconditional US withdrawal, the chain of surrenders accelerated, scaling up to province-level surrenders [88]\n\n\nRole of online social media\nThe Taliban used online social media to convince Afghans that \"the government was illegitimate\" and that the Taliban would be successful in taking control of Afghanistan Saad Mohseni, head of TOLOnews, stated that the Taliban's \"outreach was fantastic\" and that they \"capitalised on intratribal, ethnic, religious and ideological differences to win over people\" and exploited popular complaints against the government [89]\n\n\nNorthern Afghanistan\nDuring the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Taliban's concentration of its forces in the north may have been an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of US forces [109]\n\n\nFreedom of military movement on highways\nAndrew Watkins, senior analyst for Afghanistan at the International Crisis Group, said there was no evidence that the Taliban had increased their manpower to conduct this offensive, aside from utilising some of the 5,000 insurgents who had been released earlier [32] Watkins believes that the end of US airstrikes changed the scenario He says that the end of US airstrikes granted the insurgents freedom of movement and they were able to regroup, plan and strengthen their supply lines without fear of US airstrikes [32] An international official interviewed by Voice of America stated that the Taliban had been able to move their forces freely throughout Afghanistan after the US–Taliban deal with almost no intervention from the Afghan government forces [66]\n\n\nDrop in US support for the ANSF\nAccording to Sami Sadat, a three-star general of the ANSF, the February 2020 US–Taliban deal resulted to an \"effectively .. overnight\" change in the rules for US air support for the Afghan armed forces, leading to a sudden increase in battle effectiveness by the Taliban The April 2021 confirmation by US president Biden of the US pullout resulted in the loss of contractors, proprietary software and weapons systems including the Afghan army's helicopter missile-defence system The Afghan army had been trained on a high-tech military model using helicopters, airstrikes and technically specialised reconnaissance units According to Sadat, the loss of technical support made the US high-tech army model ineffective, losing helicopter support for resupplying military bases, and aerial and laser-guided weapons [110]\n\n\nIssues with Afghan forces\n\"Former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani said that some professional military and intelligence officials as well as strong army units were given promises before the fall of Kabul that they would be evacuated, and their departure was one of the main reasons for the collapse of the Afghan military.\" [295]\n\n\nThe effect of promises of evacuation on the Afghan military\n\"Former Afghan president Ashraf Ghani said that some professional military and intelligence officials as well as strong army units were given promises before the fall of Kabul that they would be evacuated, and their departure was one of the main reasons for the collapse of the Afghan military.\" [295]\n\n\nTraining and funding\nAccording to official US \"lessons learned\" reports, the US coalition delayed its initial funding of the ANSF when the Taliban were weak after the 2001 US invasion, and when the Taliban were stronger, \" [cut] corners on training and funding\" The errors in training led to provincial police extorting money from local residents and getting paid for ghost soldiers [111]\n\n\nGhost soldiers\nCorrupt Afghan army officers leading ghost battalions, who pocket the salaries of absent soldiers, were a known issue in the Afghan military [112] [296] In a 2016 report, the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said \"neither the United States nor its Afghan allies know how many Afghan soldiers and police actually exist, how many are in fact available for duty, or, by extension, the true nature of their operational capabilities\" In early 2019, at least 42,000 ghost soldiers were removed from the army's payroll [112] However, the same year Afghanistan's Ministry of Defense denied the existence of ghost soldiers in the Afghan military The ministry's spokesman, Rohullah Ahmadzai, said that all personnel of Afghan military have physical presence on their duties and those who were involved in corruption are under investigation by the ministry [297]\n\n\nLack of loyalty towards government in Kabul\nMany Afghans are more loyal towards their traditional ethnic, tribal and even familial ties than they are to the Afghan army, which the provincial Taliban commanders exploited to negotiate surrender of many troops [114] Any sense of loyalty towards central government in Kabul is overshadowed by strong loyalty towards tribes and region [115] Mike Martin, a former British army officer, said that Ghani lacked the political skills to keep  Afghanistan's many different ethnic groups loyal to the idea of a national cause [114] Veteran Italian general and a former Chief of Staff of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), Giorgio Battisti, said the division of Afghanistan along the tribal lines and loyalties is \"stronger than loyalty to any institution\" He said that an ethnic Tajik Afghan sent to Helmand province does not understand why he has to defend ethnic Pashtun Afghans there [300]\n\n\nSalary payment management\nFor years the Pentagon was responsible for paying salary directly to the Afghan soldiers [113] The responsibility for those payment was transferred to the Kabul government since the announcement of planned withdrawal in April Since then numerous Afghan soldiers have complained that they have not been paid in months and in many cases their units were no longer receiving food, supplies or ammunition [113] Gen Wesley Clark, a former NATO supreme allied commander, told CNN that many Afghan soldiers saw the job in military as paycheck, and not a cause He said that Afghan military is composed of various tribes and factions that were historically at odds with each other He also said that it is an old Afghan trick to side with the winner or at least stay away from the losing side, and that is why Afghan military disintegrated so quickly [302]\n\n\nMilitary politicisation\nThe politicisation of Afghan military resulted in unqualified politicians, [110] loyal to Ashraf Ghani, securing key positions in Afghan military [61] Hamdullah Mohib, Ghani's national security adviser, took direct control of military operations despite having no military experience According to several senior government officials and diplomats, Mohib's orders often bypassed the normal chain of command [32] [31] Experts say that there were Generals in Afghan security forces that were put in charge through connections rather than capability [304]\n\n\nAlleged human rights abuses\nPatricia Gossman, a senior Human Rights Watch researcher, told Insider that issues such as human rights abuses and corruption undermined state credibility in the eyes of Afghan communities and played a big role in the country's fall Gossman said that US and its allies had aligned themselves with notorious figures in Afghanistan who were reviled by many communities because of atrocities committed by them in the past [304] Afghan leaders within the government, military, and police have been accused of crimes ranging from corruption to murder, rape, torture, and war crimes Asadullah Khalid, a former Afghan defense minister, was allegedly engaged in or ordered torture, sexual violence, and extrajudicial killings, according to Human Rights Watch Abdul Raziq Achakzai, a former Afghan National Police chief, was accused of running secret detention centers and carrying out or ordering torture and extrajudicial killings by human right organisations Erol Yayboke, a Center for Strategic and International Studies expert, told Insider that when it came to Afghanistan, the US and its allies were \"choosing the least bad partner.\" [304]\n\n\nForeign support for the Taliban\nThe Taliban's victory was facilitated by support from Pakistan Although Pakistan was a major US ally before and after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, elements of the Pakistan government (including the military and intelligence services) have for decades maintained strong logistical and tactical ties with Taliban militants, and this support helped support the insurgency in Afghanistan [305] [306] For example, the Haqqani Network, a Taliban affiliate based on Pakistan, had strong support from Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the Pakistan intelligence agency [305] Taliban leaders found a safe haven in Pakistan, lived in the country, transacted business and earned funds there, and receiving medical treatment there [305] [306] Some elements of the Pakistani establishment sympathized with Taliban ideology, and many Pakistan officials considered the Taliban as an asset against India [305] [306] Bruce Riedel noted that \"The Pakistani army believes Afghanistan provides strategic depth against India, which is their obsession.\" [306]\n\n\nPakistan\nThe Taliban's victory was facilitated by

officials considered the Taliban as an asset against India [305] [306] Bruce Riedel noted that \"The Pakistani army believes Afghanistan provides strategic depth against India, which is their obsession.\" [306]\n\n\nRussia and Iran\nDr Antonio Giustozzi, a senior research fellow at Royal United Services Institute on terrorism and conflict, wrote, \"Both the Russians and the Iranians helped the Taliban advance at a breakneck pace in May–August 2021 They contributed to funding and equipping them, but perhaps even more importantly they helped them by brokering deals with parties, groups and personalities close to either country, or even both  [...] The Revolutionary Guards helped the Taliban's advance in western Afghanistan, including by lobbying various strongmen and militia commanders linked to Iran not to resist the Taliban.\" [307]\n\n\nLocal warlord loyalties\nOn 12 August, former US adviser Vali Nasr, said that there was \"no kind of leadership that would give local warlords reasons for why they should resist the Taliban So the more they see the Taliban victory is inevitable, the more the victory becomes inevitable, because they just cut their own deals with them\" [111]\n\n\nUS assessments\nOn 23 June, the United States Intelligence Community estimated that the Afghan government could fall within the next six months following the US withdrawal [309] On 10 August, US officials revised the previous six month estimate, saying that it could happen much more quickly, and that some scenarios envisioned the fall of Kabul within 30 to 90 days [310] [311] On 13 August, reports appeared that \"senior Western diplomatic sources\" expected the Taliban to enter Kabul within the next seven days [312]\n\n\nAftermath\nOne of the consequences of the declining socio-political situation in Afghanistan was the increasing migration flow of citizens The spillover effects of the Taliban offensive meant that thousands of civilians had started considering migrating These migrants did not await the culmination of the war and started their move in the summer of 2021.\n\n\nCivilian exodus\nOne of the consequences of the declining socio-political situation in Afghanistan was the increasing migration flow of citizens The spillover effects of the Taliban offensive meant that thousands of civilians had started considering migrating These migrants did not await the culmination of the war and started their move in the summer of 2021.\n\n\nResettlements in other regions\nOn 5 August, six European Union (EU) member states, including Germany, urged the European Commission to continue deporting rejected asylum seekers back to Afghanistan despite major advances by Taliban [331] A few days later, Germany and the Netherlands temporarily suspended the deportation of Afghan refugees as Taliban insurgents captured more territory [332]\n\n\nEquipment losses\nAccording to a report published on the Oryx blog, [80] since June, the Taliban captured 12 tanks (seven T-54s and five T-62s), 51 armoured fighting vehicles (46 M1117 ASVs, two M1117 Command & Controls and three M113 APCs), 61 mortars and artillery pieces (35 122mm D-30 howitzers, three 76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)s, one 120 mm mortar, two 82 mm M69 mortars, one 60 mm mortar and 19 mortars of unknown origin), eight anti-aircraft guns (two 14.5mm KPV-1s and six 23mm ZU-23s), 16 helicopters (nine Mil Mi-17s, one Mil Mi-24V, four UH-60A Black Hawks and two MD 530Fs), six unmanned aerial vehicles (six Boeing Insitu ScanEagles), and 1,973 trucks, vehicles and jeeps from the Afghan armed forces [78] [358] The Taliban also destroyed nine M1117 ASVs, four Mi-17s and three UH-60A BlackHawks, one DJI Mavic and 104 trucks, vehicles and jeeps Oryx only counts destroyed vehicles and equipment of which photo or videographic evidence is available [78]\n\n\nHuman rights\nFemale MPs have gone into hiding since the offensive [368]\n\n\nProtests and resistance\nAfter the fall of Kabul, former Northern Alliance members and anti-Taliban figures formed a military alliance called the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, under the leadership of Ahmad Massoud and former Vice President Amrullah Saleh [369] [370] They have based themselves in the Panjshir Valley, which was a major base of operations for the original Northern Alliance [17] [371] On 17 August 2021, Afghan Vice President Amrullah Saleh declared himself caretaker President of Afghanistan in Panjshir Valley [372]\nWith the fall of Kabul, former Northern Alliance members and other anti-Taliban forces based in Panjshir, led by Ahmad Massoud and former Vice President Amrullah Saleh, became the primary organized resistance to the Taliban in Afghanistan [123] [27] [373] The Afghan embassy in Tajikistan replaced their presidential portrait of Ghani with one of Saleh, and submitted a request to Interpol to have arrest warrants issued for Ghani, along with his chief advisor Fazel Mahmood and National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib, on charges of having stolen from the Afghan treasury [374] On 1 September, talks broke down and fighting resumed as the Taliban attacked resistance positions [375] On 6 September, the Taliban took full control of the Panjshir province, with resistance fighters retreating to the mountains to continue fighting within the province [376] [377]\n\n\nProtests\nOn 17 August, a small protest was held by several women in Kabul demanding equal rights for women, the first reported women's protest against the new regime [380]\nOn 18 August, larger protests also attended by men emerged in three eastern Pashtun-dominated cities: Jalalabad, Khost, and Asadabad, with protestors waving the flag of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and taking down the Taliban flag [381] [382] [383] In Jalalabad, the Taliban opened fire, killing three and wounding over a dozen [384] On 19 August, demonstrations spread to various parts of Kabul, including one large protest near Kabul Airport where cars and people waved the flag of the republic, and another with over 200 people gathered near the presidential palace in Kabul before it was violently dispersed by the Taliban [379] [385] [386] Protests continued in Khost and Asadabad as well, with the Taliban using violence to disperse protests in both In Asadabad, protests were reported as swelling to the hundreds [384]\n\n\nCreation of new state\nMore than three weeks after the fall of Kabul, the new Taliban rulers announced the creation of a government cabinet for the new state named Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan The cabinet is all male, and is heavily dominated by ethnic Pashtuns, with only three members being of other ethnicity [387] Hasan Akhund was named acting prime minister [388] As of January 2024, the cabinet officially remains in an interim state over two years after its formation [389]\n\n\nSecurity situation\nViolence in the country sharply declined in the year after the Taliban takeover of Kabul, with conflict-related deaths falling by 91% for the year 2022 compared to 2021 [394] Taliban officials as well as civilians have come under attack by terror attacks committed by the Islamic State – Khorasan Province, [395] which have also caused increasing attacks in border regions of neighboring Pakistan [396] as well as the hit-and-run guerilla campaign by the National Resistance Front targeting Taliban [397]\n\n\nEconomic situation\nThe Service sector, making up almost half of the country's economy, fell by 30% in 2021 Within two years of the Taliban's victory, the overall economy of Afghanistan had contracted by 25% [399] According to Gallup polls, the number of Afghans struggling to afford commodities or struggling to find work has increased after the events of 2021 [400]\n\n\nInternational and local reactions\nSome Afghan politicians closely associated with the US-backed Afghan government, including Gul Agha Sherzai, the former governor of Nangahar province, congratulated Taliban on their victory [402]\n\n\nPotential al-Qaeda resurgence\nAccording to a US defense official, the security vacuum left by the withdrawal of US military forces could create an opening for al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups to reorganize The official added that, while the US would still maintain authority to strike al-Qaeda targets in Afghanistan, the lack of a robust US presence on the ground would hamper the ability to identify potential targets The CENTCOM commander Kenneth F McKenzie Jr said that he has not seen anything that would make him believe the Taliban would stop al-Qaeda from using Afghanistan to strengthen and rebuild [419]\n\n\nPotential Jaish-e-Mohammed resurgence\nAfter the Taliban seizure of Afghanistan, The Hindu claimed that many Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) cadres were released, the JeM and Taliban have held meetings and the JeM has been assured of all support in carrying out its terrorist activities in India [423] However, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in an interview with India Today denied any meeting taking place between Taliban and JeM leadership The spokesman also said that Taliban will not allow Afghanistan to be used against India or any other countries [424]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Stephen_Sondheim", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nSondheim was born on March 22, 1930, into a Jewish family in New York City, the son of Etta Janet (\"Foxy\"; née Fox; 1897–1992) and Herbert Sondheim (1895–1966) His paternal grandparents, Isaac and Rosa, were German Jews, and his maternal grandparents, Joseph and Bessie, were Lithuanian Jews from Vilnius [7] His father manufactured dresses designed by his mother The composer grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and, after his parents divorced, on a farm near Doylestown, Pennsylvania The only child of affluent parents living in the San Remo at 145 Central Park West, he was described in Meryle Secrest's biography Stephen Sondheim: A Life as an isolated, emotionally neglected child When he lived in New York City, Sondheim attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School He spent several summers at Camp Androscoggin [7] His mother sent him to New York Military Academy in 1940 [8] From 1942 to 1947, he attended George School, a private Quaker preparatory school in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where he wrote his first musical, By George, in 1946 [8] [9] From 1946 to 1950, Sondheim attended Williams College He graduated magna cum laude and received the Hubbard Hutchinson Prize, a two-year fellowship to study music [8]\n\n\nMentorship by Oscar Hammerstein II\nWhen Sondheim was about ten years old (around the time of his parents' divorce), he formed a close friendship with James Hammerstein, son of lyricist and playwright Oscar Hammerstein II, who were neighbors in Bucks County The elder Hammerstein became Sondheim's surrogate father, influencing him profoundly and developing his love of musical theater Sondheim met Hal Prince, who later directed many of his shows, at the opening of South Pacific, Hammerstein's musical with Richard Rodgers The comic musical Sondheim wrote at George School, By George, was a success among his peers and buoyed his self-esteem When he asked Hammerstein to evaluate it as though he had no knowledge of its author, he said it was the worst thing he had ever seen: \"But if you want to know why it's terrible, I'll tell you.\" They spent the rest of the day going over the musical, and Sondheim later said, \"In that afternoon I learned more about songwriting and the musical theater than most people learn in a lifetime.\" [17]\n\n\nEducation\nSondheim began attending Williams College, a liberal arts college in Williamstown, Massachusetts, whose theater program attracted him [24] His first teacher there was Robert Barrow:\n\n\nCareer\nBurt Shevelove invited Sondheim to a party where Sondheim arrived before him but knew no one else well He saw a familiar face, Arthur Laurents, who had seen one of the auditions of Saturday Night, and they began talking Laurents told him he was working on a musical version of Romeo and Juliet with Leonard Bernstein, but they needed a lyricist; Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who were supposed to write the lyrics, were under contract in Hollywood He said that although he was not a big fan of Sondheim's music, he enjoyed the lyrics from Saturday Night and he could audition for Bernstein The next day, Sondheim met and played for Bernstein, who said he would let him know Sondheim wanted to write music and lyrics; he consulted with Hammerstein, who said, as Sondheim related in a 2008 New York Times video interview, \"Look, you have a chance to work with very gifted professionals on a show that sounds interesting, and you could always write your own music eventually My advice would be to take the job.\" [4] West Side Story, directed by Jerome Robbins, opened in 1957 and ran for 732 performances Sondheim expressed dissatisfaction with his lyrics, saying they did not always fit the characters and were sometimes too consciously poetic Initially Bernstein was also credited as a co-writer of the lyrics, but he later offered Sondheim solo credit, as Sondheim had essentially done all of them The New York Times review of the show did not mention the lyrics [32] Sondheim described the division of the royalties, saying that Bernstein received 3% and he received 1% Bernstein suggested evening the percentage at 2% each, but Sondheim refused because he was satisfied with just getting the credit Sondheim later said he wished \"someone stuffed a handkerchief in my mouth because it would have been nice to get that extra percentage\" [4]\n\n\n1954–1959: Early Broadway success\nBurt Shevelove invited Sondheim to a party where Sondheim arrived

handkerchief in my mouth because it would have been nice to get that extra percentage\" [4]\n\n\nGypsy\nIn 1959, Laurents and Robbins approached Sondheim for a musical version of Gypsy Rose Lee's memoir after Irving Berlin and Cole Porter turned it down Sondheim agreed, but Ethel Merman – cast as Mama Rose – had just finished Happy Hunting with an unknown composer (Harold Karr) and lyricist (Matt Dubey) Although Sondheim wanted to write the music and lyrics, Merman refused to let another first-time composer write for her and demanded that Jule Styne write the music [34] Sondheim, concerned that writing lyrics again would pigeonhole him as a lyricist, called his mentor for advice Hammerstein told him he should take the job, because writing a vehicle for a star would be a good learning experience Sondheim agreed; Gypsy opened on May 21, 1959, and ran for 702 performances [4]\n\n\n1962–1966: Music and lyrics\nThe first Broadway production for which Sondheim wrote the music and lyrics was A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, which opened in 1962 and ran for 964 performances [35] The book, based on farces by Plautus, was by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart The show won six Tony Awards (including Best Musical) [36] and had the longest Broadway run of any show for which Sondheim wrote both music and lyrics [37]\n\n\nA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\nThe first Broadway production for which Sondheim wrote the music and lyrics was A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, which opened in 1962 and ran for 964 performances [35] The book,

both music and lyrics [37]\n\n\nAnyone Can Whistle\nSondheim had participated in three straight hits, but his next show—1964's Anyone Can Whistle—was a nine-performance bomb (although it introduced Angela Lansbury to musical theater).\n\n\nDo I Hear a Waltz?\nDo I Hear a Waltz?, based on Laurents's 1952 play The Time of the Cuckoo, was intended as another Rodgers and Hammerstein musical with Mary Martin in the lead A new lyricist was needed, [38] and Laurents and Rodgers's daughter, Mary, asked Sondheim to fill in Although Richard Rodgers and Sondheim agreed that the original play did not lend itself to musicalization, they began writing a musical version [39] The project had many difficulties, including Rodgers's alcoholism Sondheim later called it the one project he truly regretted writing, given that the reasons he wrote it—as a favor to Mary, as a favor to Hammerstein, as an opportunity to work again with Laurents, and as an opportunity to make money—were not reasons to write a musical He then decided to work only when he could write both music and lyrics [11]\n\n\nEvening Primrose and other work\nIn 1966, Sondheim semi-anonymously provided lyrics for \"The Boy From...\", a parody of \"The Girl from Ipanema\" in the off-Broadway revue The Mad Show The song was credited to \"Esteban Río Nido\", [41] Spanish for \"Stephen River Nest\", and in the show's playbill the lyrics were credited to \"Nom De Plume\" That year Goldman and Sondheim hit a creative wall on The Girls Upstairs, and Goldman asked Sondheim about writing a TV musical The result was Evening Primrose, with Anthony Perkins and Charmian Carr Written for the anthology series ABC Stage 67 and produced by Hubbell Robinson, it was broadcast on November 16, 1966 According to Sondheim and director Paul Bogart, the musical was written only because Goldman needed money for rent The network disliked the title and Sondheim's alternative, A Little Night Music [42]\n\n\n1970–1981: Collaborations with Hal Prince\nAfter Do I Hear a Waltz?, Sondheim devoted himself solely to writing both music and lyrics for the theater—and in 1970, he began a collaboration with director Harold Prince resulting in a body of work that is considered one of the high water marks of musical theater history, with critic Howard Kissel writing that the duo had set \"Broadway's highest standards\" [46] [47]\n\n\nCompany\nAfter Do I Hear a Waltz?, Sondheim devoted himself solely to writing both music and lyrics for the theater—and in 1970, he began a collaboration with director Harold Prince resulting in a body of work that is considered one of the high water marks of musical theater history, with critic Howard Kissel writing that the duo had set \"Broadway's highest standards\" [46] [47]\n\n\nFollies\nFollies (1971), with a book by James Goldman, opened on April 4, 1971, at the Winter Garden Theatre and ran for 522 performances after 12 previews [52] The plot centers on a reunion, in a crumbling Broadway theater scheduled for demolition, of performers in Weismann's Follies (a musical revue, based on the Ziegfeld Follies, that played in that theater between the world wars) The production also featured choreography and co-direction by Michael Bennett, who later created A Chorus Line.\n\n\nA Little Night Music\nA Little Night Music (1973), based on Ingmar Bergman's Smiles of a Summer Night and with a score primarily in waltz time, was among Sondheim's greatest commercial successes Time magazine called it his \"most brilliant accomplishment to date\" [55] The original cast included Glynis Johns, Len Cariou, Hermione Gingold, and Judy Kahan The show opened on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre on February 25, 1973, and ran for 601 performances and 12 previews [56] Clive Barnes of The New York Times wrote, \"A Little Night Music is soft on the ears, easy on the eyes, and pleasant on the mind It is less than brash, but more than brassy, and it should give a lot of pleasure It is the remembrance of a few things past, and all to the sound of a waltz and the understanding smile of a memory Good God!— [an] adult musical!\" [57]\n\n\nPacific Overtures\nPacific Overtures (1976), with a book by John Weidman, was one of Sondheim's most unconventional efforts: it explored the westernization of Japan, and was originally presented in a mock-Kabuki style [59] The show closed after a run of 193 performances, [60] and was revived on Broadway in 2004 [61]\n\n\nSweeney Todd\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1979), with a score by Sondheim and a book by Hugh Wheeler, is based on Christopher Bond's 1973 stage play derived from the Victorian original [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] The original production starred Angela Lansbury, Len Cariou, Victor Garber, and Edmund Lyndeck Popular songs from the musical include \"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\", \"The Worst Pies in London\", \"Pretty Women\", \"A Little Priest\", \"Not While I'm Around\", \"By the Sea\", and \"Johanna\" The production earned 9 Tony Award nominations and won 8 awards, including Best Musical, Best Original Score, Best Actress, and Best Actor Richard Eder of The New York Times wrote: \"Mr Sondheim's lyrics can be endlessly inventive There is a hugely amusing recitation of the attributes given by the different professions—priest, lawyer, and so on—to the pies they contribute to At other times the lyrics have a black, piercing poetry to them.\" [67]\n\n\nMerrily We Roll Along\nMerrily We Roll Along (1981), with a book by George Furth, is one of Sondheim's most traditional scores; songs from the musical were recorded by Frank Sinatra and Carly Simon According to Sondheim's music director Paul Gemignani, \"Part of Steve's ability is this extraordinary versatility\" The show was not the success their previous collaborations had been: after a chaotic series of preview performances, it opened to widely negative reviews, and closed after a run of less than two weeks Due to the high quality of Sondheim's score, the show has been repeatedly revised and produced in the ensuing years Martin Gottfried wrote, \"Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs ..

Despite this, Sondheim's work on the show marked the beginning of his successful career as a composer and lyricist.\n\n**Collaboration with Harold Prince**\n\nIn 1970, Sondheim began a long-term collaboration with director Harold Prince, which would result in some of Sondheim's most famous works, including \"Company,\" \"Follies,\" and \"A Little Night Music.\" The collaboration between Sondheim and Prince is widely regarded as one of the most successful and influential in the history of musical theater.\n\n**Notable Works**\n\nSome of Sondheim's most notable works include:\n\n* \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" (1962)\n* \"Company\" (1970)\n* \"Follies\" (1971)\n* \"A Little Night Music\" (1973)\n* \"Pacific Overtures\" (1976)\n* \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" (1979)\n* \"Merrily We Roll Along\" (1981)\n* \"Sunday in the Park with George\" (1984)\n* \"Into the Woods\" (1987)\n* \"Passion\" (1994)\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\nSondheim has received numerous awards and honors throughout his career, including:\n\n* Academy Award\n* Eight Tony Awards\n* Eight Grammy Awards\n* Pulitzer Prize for Drama for \"Sunday in the Park with George\" (1985)\n* Kennedy Center Honors, Lifetime Achievement (1993)\n* Hutchinson Prize for Music Composition (1950)\n* Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1983)\n* Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (2005)\n* Algur H Meadows Award from Southern Methodist University (1994)\n* Special Laurence Olivier Award (2011)\n* Critics' Circle Theatre Award (2012)\n* Member of the American Theater Hall of Fame (2014)\n* Edward MacDowell Medal by The MacDowell Colony (2013)\n* Presidential Medal of Freedom (2015)\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nSondheim was often described as introverted and solitary.

Sondheim related in a 2008 New York Times video interview, \"Look, you have a chance to work with very gifted professionals on a show that sounds interesting, and you could always write your own music eventually My advice would be to take the job.\" [4] West Side Story, directed by Jerome Robbins, opened in 1957 and ran for 732 performances Sondheim expressed dissatisfaction with his lyrics, saying they did not always fit the characters and were sometimes too consciously poetic Initially Bernstein was also credited as a co-writer of the lyrics, but he later offered Sondheim solo credit, as Sondheim had essentially done all of them The New York Times review of the show did not mention the lyrics [32] Sondheim described the division of the royalties, saying that Bernstein received 3% and he received 1% Bernstein suggested evening the percentage at 2% each, but Sondheim refused because he was satisfied with just getting the credit Sondheim later said he wished \"someone stuffed a handkerchief in my mouth because it would have been nice to get that extra percentage\" [4]\n\n\nGypsy\nIn 1959, Laurents and Robbins approached Sondheim for a musical version of Gypsy Rose Lee's memoir after Irving Berlin and Cole Porter turned it down Sondheim agreed, but Ethel Merman – cast as Mama Rose – had just finished Happy Hunting with an unknown composer (Harold Karr) and lyricist (Matt Dubey) Although Sondheim wanted to write the music and lyrics, Merman refused to let another first-time composer write for her and demanded that Jule Styne write the music [34] Sondheim, concerned that writing lyrics again would pigeonhole him as a lyricist, called his mentor for advice Hammerstein told him he should take the job, because writing a vehicle for a star would be a good learning experience Sondheim agreed; Gypsy opened on May 21, 1959, and ran for 702 performances [4]\n\n\n1962–1966: Music and lyrics\nThe first Broadway production for which Sondheim wrote the music and lyrics was A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, which opened in 1962 and ran for 964 performances [35] The book, based on farces by Plautus, was by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart The show won six Tony Awards (including Best Musical) [36] and had the longest Broadway run of any show for which Sondheim wrote both music and lyrics [37]\n\n\nA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the

both music and lyrics [37]\n\n\nAnyone Can Whistle\nSondheim had participated in three straight hits, but his next show—1964's Anyone Can Whistle—was a nine-performance bomb (although it introduced Angela Lansbury to musical theater).\n\n\nDo I Hear a Waltz?\nDo I Hear a Waltz?, based on Laurents's 1952 play The Time of the Cuckoo, was intended as another Rodgers and Hammerstein musical with Mary Martin in the lead A new lyricist was needed, [38] and Laurents and Rodgers's daughter, Mary, asked Sondheim to fill in Although Richard Rodgers and Sondheim agreed that the original play did not lend itself to musicalization, they began writing a musical version [39] The project had many difficulties, including Rodgers's alcoholism Sondheim later called it the one project he truly regretted writing, given that the reasons he wrote it—as a favor to Mary, as a favor to Hammerstein, as an opportunity to work again with Laurents, and as an opportunity to make money—were not reasons to write a musical He then decided to work only when he could write both music and lyrics [11]\n\n\nEvening Primrose and other work\nIn 1966, Sondheim semi-anonymously provided lyrics for \"The Boy From...\", a parody of \"The Girl from Ipanema\" in the off-Broadway revue The Mad Show The song was credited to \"Esteban Río Nido\", [41] Spanish for \"Stephen River Nest\", and in the show's playbill the lyrics were credited to \"Nom De Plume\" That year Goldman and Sondheim hit a creative wall on The Girls Upstairs, and Goldman asked Sondheim about writing a TV musical The result was Evening Primrose, with Anthony Perkins and Charmian Carr Written for the anthology series ABC Stage 67 and produced by Hubbell Robinson, it was broadcast on November 16, 1966 According to Sondheim and director Paul Bogart, the musical was written only because Goldman needed money for rent The network disliked the title and Sondheim's alternative, A Little Night Music [42]\n\n\n1970–1981: Collaborations with Hal Prince\nAfter Do I Hear a Waltz?, Sondheim devoted himself solely to writing both music and lyrics for the theater—and in 1970, he began a collaboration with director Harold Prince resulting in a body of work that is considered one of the high water marks of musical theater history, with critic Howard Kissel writing that the duo had set \"Broadway's highest standards\" [46] [47]\n\n\nCompany\nAfter Do I Hear a Waltz?, Sondheim devoted himself solely to writing both music and lyrics for the theater—and in 1970, he began a collaboration with director Harold Prince resulting in a body of work that is considered one of the high water marks of musical theater history, with critic Howard Kissel writing that the duo had set \"Broadway's highest standards\" [46] [47]\n\n\nFollies\nFollies (1971), with a book by James Goldman, opened on April 4, 1971, at the Winter Garden Theatre and ran for 522 performances after 12 previews [52] The plot centers on a reunion, in a crumbling Broadway theater scheduled for demolition, of performers in Weismann's Follies (a musical revue, based on the Ziegfeld Follies, that played in that theater between the world wars) The production also featured choreography and co-direction by Michael Bennett, who later created A Chorus Line.\n\n\nA Little Night Music\nA Little Night Music (1973), based on Ingmar Bergman's Smiles of a Summer Night and with a score primarily in waltz time, was among Sondheim's greatest commercial successes Time magazine called it his \"most brilliant accomplishment to date\" [55] The original cast included Glynis Johns, Len Cariou, Hermione Gingold, and Judy Kahan The show opened on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre on February 25, 1973, and ran for 601 performances and 12 previews [56] Clive Barnes of The New York Times wrote, \"A Little Night Music is soft on the ears, easy on the eyes, and pleasant on the mind It is less than brash, but more than brassy, and it should give a lot of pleasure It is the remembrance of a few things past, and all to the sound of a waltz and the understanding smile of a memory Good God!— [an] adult musical!\" [57]\n\n\nPacific Overtures\nPacific Overtures (1976), with a book by John Weidman, was one of Sondheim's most unconventional efforts: it explored the westernization of Japan, and was originally presented in a mock-Kabuki style [59] The show closed after a run of 193 performances, [60] and was revived on Broadway in 2004 [61]\n\n\nSweeney Todd\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1979), with a score by Sondheim and a book by Hugh Wheeler, is based on Christopher Bond's 1973 stage play derived from the Victorian original [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] The original production starred Angela Lansbury, Len Cariou, Victor Garber, and Edmund Lyndeck Popular songs from the musical include \"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\", \"The Worst Pies in London\", \"Pretty Women\", \"A Little Priest\", \"Not While I'm Around\", \"By the Sea\", and \"Johanna\" The production earned 9 Tony Award nominations and won 8 awards, including Best Musical, Best Original Score, Best Actress, and Best Actor Richard Eder of The New York Times wrote: \"Mr Sondheim's lyrics can be endlessly inventive There is a hugely amusing recitation of the attributes given by the different professions—priest, lawyer, and so on—to the pies they contribute to At other times the lyrics have a black, piercing poetry to them.\" [67]\n\n\nMerrily We Roll Along\nMerrily We Roll Along (1981), with a book by George Furth, is one of Sondheim's most traditional scores; songs from the musical were recorded by Frank Sinatra and Carly Simon According to Sondheim's music director Paul Gemignani, \"Part of Steve's ability is this extraordinary versatility\" The show was not the success their previous collaborations had been: after a chaotic series of preview performances, it opened to widely negative reviews, and closed after a run of less than two weeks Due to the high quality of Sondheim's score, the show has been repeatedly revised and produced in the ensuing years Martin Gottfried wrote, \"Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs .. But  [despite] that there is nothing ordinary about the music.\" [68] Sondheim later said: \"Did I feel betrayed? I'm not sure I would put it like that What did surprise me was the feeling around the Broadway community—if you can call it that, though I guess I will for lack of a better word—that they wanted Hal and me to fail.\" [45] Sondheim and Furth continued to revise the show in subsequent years An acclaimed feature documentary on the show and its aftermath, Best Worst Thing That Ever Could Have Happened, directed by Merrily cast member Lonny Price, and produced by Bruce David Klein, Kitt Lavoie, and Ted Schillinger, premiered at the New York Film Festival on November 18, 2016 A film adaptation of Merrily We Roll Along, directed by Richard Linklater, began production in 2019 and is planned to continue for the next two decades to allow the actors to age in real time [69] An Off-Broadway revival starring Jonathan Groff, Daniel Radcliffe, and Lindsay Mendez ran from November 2022 to January 2023 at the New York Theatre Workshop; it moved to Broadway in fall 2023.\n\n\n1984–1994: Collaborations with James Lapine\nSondheim decided \"that there are better places to start a show\" and found a new collaborator in James Lapine after he saw Lapine's Twelve Dreams off-Broadway in 1981: \"I was discouraged, and I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't discovered Twelve Dreams at the Public Theatre\"; [45] Lapine has a taste \"for the avant-garde and for visually oriented theater in particular\" Their first collaboration was Sunday in the Park with George (1984), with Sondheim's music evoking Georges Seurat's pointillism Sondheim and Lapine won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the play, [72] and it was revived on Broadway in 2008, and again in a limited run in 2017 [73] [74]\n\n\nSunday in the Park with George\nSondheim decided \"that there are better places to start a show\" and found a new collaborator in James Lapine after he saw Lapine's Twelve Dreams off-Broadway in 1981: \"I was discouraged, and I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't discovered Twelve Dreams at the Public Theatre\";

It's age It's a diminution of energy and the worry that there are no new ideas It's also an increasing lack of confidence I'm not the only one I've checked with other people People expect more of you and you're aware of it and you shouldn't be.\" [89] In December 2007, he said that in addition to continuing work on Bounce, he was \"nibbling at a couple of things with John Weidman and James Lapine\" [90]\n\n\nHere We Are\nSondheim began collaborating with David Ives in 2014 on a musical based on the Luis Buñuel films The Exterminating Angel and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, initially slated for previews at the Public Theater in 2017 [101] That date was cast into doubt after an August 2016 reading for the musical had only the first act finished [102] A November 2016 workshop included Matthew Morrison, Shuler Hensley, Heidi Blickenstaff, Sierra Boggess, Gabriel Ebert, Sarah Stiles, Michael Cerveris, and Jennifer Simard [103] After media outlets mistakenly reported that the show had the working title Buñuel, Sondheim said that it still lacked a title in 2017 [104] The Public Theatre denied reports that the show would be part of its 2019–20 season, but hoped to produce the musical \"when it is ready\" [105] Development reportedly ceased for a time, [106] but resumed for a September 2021 reading of the show, then called Square One [107] Nathan Lane and Bernadette Peters were involved in a reading of this new work, [108] and Sondheim discussed adapting the Buñuel films in the final interview before his death [109] A posthumous production of the collaboration, directed by Joe Mantello, premiered at The Shed in September 2023 as Here We Are [110]\n\n\nOther projects\nThe Kennedy Center staged a 15-week repertory festival of six Sondheim musicals—Sweeney Todd, Company, Sunday in the Park with George, Merrily We Roll Along, Passion, and A Little Night Music—from May to August 2002 [111] [112] [113] The Kennedy Center Sondheim Celebration also included Pacific Overtures, a junior version of Into the Woods, and Frank Rich of The New York Times speaking with the composer for Sondheim on Sondheim on April 28, 2002 [111] [114] The two men took their discussion, dubbed \"A Little Night Conversation with Stephen Sondheim\", on a West Coast tour of different U.S cities [115] [116] including Santa Barbara, San Francisco, Los Angeles, [117] [118] [119] and Portland, Oregon in March 2008, [120] then to Oberlin College in September The Cleveland Jewish News reported on their Oberlin appearance: \"Sondheim said: 'Movies are photographs; the stage is larger than life.'

Born in Allahabad on August 29, 1905, Chand's remarkable skills on the field earned him international recognition and admiration. Throughout his career, he played for the British Indian Army and the Indian national team, winning numerous titles and accolades.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nDhyan Chand was born in a Rajput family in Allahabad, India, on August 29, 1905. His father, Sameshwar Singh, was a soldier in the British Indian Army, and as a result, the family was constantly on the move due to his father's military assignments. Chand's family had to relocate to various cities, which affected his education. He was only able to complete six years of schooling before having to terminate his education.\n\nDespite the challenges he faced, Chand's family finally settled in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India. This marked a turning point in Chand's life, as he began to focus on his passion for sports. His father's influence played a significant role in shaping his early life, and Chand's decision to join the British Indian Army was largely influenced by his father's career.\n\n**Early Career (1922-1932)**\n\nDhyan Chand enlisted in the 1st Brahmans of the British Indian Army on August 29, 1922, his 17th birthday. This marked the beginning of his illustrious career as a soldier and a hockey player. During his early years, Chand primarily played in army hockey tournaments and regimental games. His exceptional skills on the field soon caught the attention of his superiors, and he was selected to play for the Indian Army team that was to tour New Zealand.\n\nThe Indian Army team's tour of New Zealand in 1926 was a groundbreaking moment in Chand's career. The team won 18 matches, drew two, and lost only one, earning widespread praise from spectators. Chand's performance in the two Test matches against the New Zealand squad was particularly noteworthy, as the Indian team won the first match and narrowly lost the second.\n\nChand's promotion to Lance Naik in 1927 marked a significant milestone in his career. This promotion recognized his exceptional skills and dedication to the game. Throughout the 1920s, Chand continued to excel on the field, solidifying his position as one of the top players in the Indian Army team.\n\n**Captaincy and 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics**\n\nDhyan Chand's leadership skills were soon recognized, and he was appointed captain of the Jhansi Heroes, his home team. In 1933, the Jhansi Heroes participated in and won the prestigious Beighton Cup, which Chand considered one of the most significant titles in Indian men's field hockey. This victory marked a turning point in Chand's career, as he began to receive international recognition.\n\nThe 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics presented Chand with an opportunity to showcase his skills on the world stage. The Indian national team, led by Chand, won the gold medal in the Olympic Games, defeating Germany 8-1 in the final match. This victory cemented Chand's position as one of the greatest hockey players of all time.\n\n**East African Tour and Final Tournaments**\n\nAfter the 1936 Olympics, Chand returned to the Indian Army, where he continued to play hockey. He participated in several tournaments, including the Beighton Cup in 1937. Before the Beighton Cup, Chand spent four months in a military camp in Pachmarhi, attending military classes. This marked a significant shift in his career, as he began to focus more on his military duties.\n\nIn 1938, Chand was promoted to the rank of jemadar, equivalent to the present-day naib subedar. This promotion recognized his exceptional leadership skills and dedication to the Indian Army. Chand's final years in the military were marked by his continued involvement in hockey, and he was eventually promoted to the war-substantive rank of lieutenant.\n\n**Final Years**\n\nDhyan Chand continued to hold his emergency commission in the Indian Army post-Independence, with the service number IEC 3526. However, he was not granted a regular commission. In 1951, Chand was honored at India's National Stadium with the inaugural Dhyan Chand Tournament, which he attended to the admiration of the spectators.\n\n**Legacy and Honors**\n\nDhyan Chand remains a legendary figure in Indian and world hockey. His skills have been glorified in various apocryphal stories and anecdotes. A number of these revolve around the fact that Chand had extraordinary control over dribbling the ball. Chand's birthday, August 29, is celebrated as National Sports Day in India since 1995.\n\nThe President of India gives away sports-related awards such as the Major Dhyanchand Khel Ratna, Arjuna Award, and Dronacharya Award on this day at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, India. Chand's legacy extends beyond his on-field accomplishments, as he has inspired generations of athletes and sports enthusiasts.\n\n**Honors**\n\n* 1926: Selected to play for the Indian Army team that toured New Zealand\n* 1927: Promoted to Lance Naik\n* 1933: Won the Beighton Cup with the Jhansi Heroes\n* 1936: Won the gold medal at the Berlin Summer Olympics\n* 1938: Promoted to the rank of jemadar\n* 1943: Promoted to the war-substantive rank of lieutenant\n* 1951: Honored at India's National Stadium with the inaugural Dhyan Chand Tournament\n* August 29: Celebrated as National Sports Day in India since 1995", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Dhyan_Chand\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nChand was born in Allahabad on 29 August 1905 in a Rajput family [17] [18]  to Sharadha Singh  [citation needed] and Sameshwar Singh [19] Chand's father was enlisted in the British Indian Army, where he played hockey for the army He had two brothers – Mool Singh and Roop Singh, the latter was also a hockey player Because of his father's numerous army transfers, the family had to move to different cities, and as such Chand had to terminate his education after only six years of schooling The family finally settled in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India.\n\n\nEarly career (1922–1932)\nOn 29 August 1922 – his 17th birthday – Chand enlisted in the 1st Brahmans of the British Indian Army as a sepoy (private) [21] [22] A reorganisation of the army that year resulted in the 1st Brahmans becoming the 1/1st Punjab Regiment Between 1922 and 1926, Chand exclusively played army hockey tournaments and regimental games Chand was ultimately selected for the Indian Army team which was to tour New Zealand [23] The team won 18 matches, drew two and lost only one, receiving praise from all spectators Following this, in the two Test matches against the New Zealand squad, the team won the first and narrowly lost the second Returning to India, Chand was promoted to Lance Naik in 1927 [21]\n\n\nCaptaincy and 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics\nIn 1933, Chand's home team, the Jhansi Heroes, participated in and won the Beighton Cup, which he considered the most prestigious of India men's national field hockey team tournaments Later, he would state: [29]\n\n\nEast African tour and final tournaments\nAfter returning from Berlin, Chand joined his regiment Between 1936 and the commencement of the War in 1939, he largely confined himself to army hockey, with one visit to Kolkata to take part in the Beighton Cup tournament in 1937 Before the Beighton Cup, Chand spent four months in a military camp in Pachmarhi to attend military classes On 16 March 1938, he was made a Viceroy's Commissioned Officer (VCO; the equivalent of the present-day junior commissioned officer) with the rank of jemadar (now termed naib subedar) [22] With the increasing need for qualified officers during wartime, he was promoted to acting subedar by July 1942 and to the war-substantive rank by early 1943 [35] [36] On 9 April 1943, Chand received an emergency commission as a second lieutenant in the 14th Punjab Regiment, with the war-substantive rank of lieutenant from the same date [37]\n\n\nFinal years\nChand continued to hold his emergency commission in the Indian Army post-Independence, with the service number IEC 3526, but was apparently not granted a regular commission [38] In 1951 he was honored at India's National Stadium with the inaugural Dhyan Chand Tournament, which he attended to the admiration of the spectators.\n\n\nLegacy and honours\nDhyan Chand remains a legendary figure in Indian and world hockey His skills have been glorified in various apocryphal stories and anecdotes A number of these revolve around the fact that Singh had extraordinary control over dribbling the ball Chand's birthday, 29 August, is celebrated as National Sports Day in India since 1995 [43] The President gives away sports-related awards such as the Major Dhyanchand Khel Ratna, Arjuna Award and Dronacharya Award on this day at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, India [citation needed]\n\n\nHonors\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCited sources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "2024_pro-Palestinian_protests_on_university_campuses", "content": "\nBackground\nProtests, including rallies, demonstrations, campaigns, and vigils related to the Israel–Hamas war have occurred across the U.S since the conflict's start on October 7, 2023, alongside other Israel–Hamas war protests around the world Pro-Palestinian protesters criticized U.S military and diplomatic support for Israel and Israel's invasion of the Gaza Strip and its war conduct, which some called a genocide [73] [74]\n\n\nOverview\nThis is a list of pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses in 2024 since protests escalated on April 17, beginning with the Columbia University campus occupation As of May 6, student protests have occurred in 45 out of 50 states in the United States, and the District of Columbia, with encampments, occupations, walkouts or sit-ins on almost 140 campuses [80]\n\n\nFirst encampment protest at Columbia University\nA series of occupation protests by pro-Palestinian students occurred at Columbia University in New York City from April to June 2024, in the context of the broader Israel–Hamas war protests in the United States The protests began on April 17, 2024, when pro-Palestinian students established an encampment of approximately 50 tents on the university campus, calling it the Gaza Solidarity Encampment, [89] [90] and demanded the university divest from Israel.\n\n\nSpread in the United States\nDemonstrations initially spread in the United States on April 22, when students at several universities on the East Coast—including New York University, Yale University, Emerson College, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Tufts University—began occupying campuses, as well as experiencing mass arrests in New York and at Yale [102] Protests emerged throughout the U.S in the following days, with protest camps established on over 40 campuses [103] On April 25, mass arrests occurred at Emerson College, the University of Southern California, and the University of Texas at Austin [104]\n\n\nProtesters' demands\nMany of the protests involve student demands that their schools sever financial ties to Israel and companies involved in the conflict, as well as an end to U.S military support for Israel, [118] [119] as part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement [28] Some protests have also demanded that the universities sever academic ties with Israel, support a ceasefire in Gaza, and disclose investments [120] Student demands have varied among the different occupations, including for universities to stop accepting research money from Israel that supports the military, and an end to college endowments investing with managers who profit from Israeli entities [28]\n\n\nImpact\nIn April 2024, the occupations resulted in the closure of Columbia University and Cal Poly Humboldt for the remainder of the semester, [40] [41] and faculty members in California, Georgia, and Texas also initiated votes of no confidence [126] Columbia, Cal Poly Humboldt, and the University of Southern California canceled their graduation ceremonies due in May [127] [128] [44] On May 13, the University of Amsterdam closed for two days after renewed occupations on campus [42]\n\n\nClosures, cancellations, and graduation protests\nIn April 2024, the occupations resulted in the closure of Columbia University and Cal Poly Humboldt for the remainder of the semester, [40] [41] and faculty members in California, Georgia, and Texas also initiated votes of no confidence [126] Columbia, Cal Poly Humboldt, and the University of Southern California canceled their graduation ceremonies due in May [127] [128] [44] On May 13, the University of Amsterdam closed for two days after renewed occupations on campus [42]\n\n\nDivestment by universities\nOn April 28, Portland State University (PSU) announced it was pausing its financial ties with Boeing, including gifts and grants, over its ties to Israel PSU President Ann Cudd wrote in a campus-wide letter, \"the passion with which these demands are being repeatedly expressed by some in our community motivates\" [34] On May 6, Trinity College Dublin in Ireland agreed to end its investments in Israeli companies that are listed on the United Nations Human Rights Council \"blacklist\" after an encampment on Fellows' Square was erected [131] This included three of the 13 Israeli companies the university's endowment fund had invested in [35] [132]\n\n\nNegotiations with protesters\nOther universities have said they will consider divestment demands regarding Israel-affiliated companies Some have agreed to disclose their investments and committed to increase awareness about Palestine [33] Universities that have come to agreements with protesters over certain demands, in order for encampments to be dismantled, include Northwestern University on April 29; Brown University and Evergreen State College on April 30; the University of Minnesota on May 1; Rutgers University on May 2; Goldsmiths, University of London and University of California, Riverside on May 3; Thompson Rivers University on May 4, the University of California, Berkeley on May 14; [136] Additionally, Wesleyan University allowed encampments on campus to continue, [33] [137] and at the University of Barcelona, the Senate voted to break ties with Israel [138]\n\n\nCampus strikes in California\nOn May 15, members of United Auto Workers Local 4811, the union representing 48,000 graduate students on 10 campuses in the University of California system, voted to authorize a strike because the university unfairly changed policies and discriminated against students who were exercising their right to free speech and created an unsafe work environment by allowing attacks on protesters The authorization did not guarantee a strike, but allowed the executive board to call one at any time [143]\n\n\nParticipants\nSome of the protests are organized by groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace, founded in 1996 as a progressive Jewish anti-Zionist organization; IfNotNow, founded during the 2014 Gaza War; and Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), which has over 200 North American chapters [148] [20] In late 2023, SJP chapters were banned or suspended at Brandeis University, [149] Columbia University, [150] and Rutgers University [151] In Florida, chapters were ordered to disband [152] In response, SJP chapters at the University of Florida and University of South Florida filed federal lawsuits [153] [154] Pro-Palestinian students were also doxxed by Accuracy in Media at Harvard, Columbia, and Yale University [155] [156] American intelligence assessments concluded that Iran had covertly supported the protests using social media by posing as students with operatives providing financial assistance to some protest groups in an attempt to stoke division, [157] [158] but Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said that U.S citizens were protesting \"in good faith\" and that this intelligence \"did not indicate otherwise\" [159] Intelligence reports detailing the specifics of Iranian influence on U.S protests have not been made public [160]\n\n\nOrganizers and ideologies\nSome of the protests are organized by groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace, founded in 1996 as a progressive Jewish anti-Zionist organization; IfNotNow, founded during the 2014 Gaza War; and Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), which has over 200 North American chapters [148] [20] In late 2023, SJP chapters were banned or

otherwise\" [159] Intelligence reports detailing the specifics of Iranian influence on U.S protests have not been made public [160]\n\n\nCounter-protesters, outside groups, and infiltration\nFar-right agitators and white nationalists have been seen at some protests seeking to sow chaos and violence, [174] and at the UCLA campus occupation, where they were among pro-Israeli counter-protesters who attacked the encampment A white supremacist affiliated with Proud Boys has been among the counter-protesters supported by far-right activists across the country [175] Experts have raised concern about far-right groups attempting to infiltrate protests to cause harm, and subsequent reactions from militant far-left activists aligned with the anti-fascist movement [176]\n\n\nControversies\nSeveral protests have been criticized for alleged antisemitism [65] Some students have called some of the incidents reported at protests and on campus \"threatening\" and said they make them feel unsafe Jewish students were targeted for their faith, for wearing Jewish symbols, or were accused of being Zionists and subsequently targeted [179] Some Jewish students have also said the protests created a

takeover,\" and \"terrorism\" [176] The New York Times opined that the protests have come during a presidential election year in which Democrats have \"harnessed promises of stability and normalcy to win critical recent elections\" and that the protests are a messaging opportunity for Republicans to divide Democrats [395] The newspaper also published an article citing NewsGuard, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and Recorded Future on how the media of Russia, China, and Iran have covered the events It concluded that those countries have made overt and covert efforts to capitalize on the protests to denigrate democracy, inflame partisan tensions, criticize Biden ahead of the 2024 presidential election, support Trump, and express support for Hamas and Palestinians generally [396]\n\n\nSpread of protests\nOn April 28, The New York Times wrote that protests outside the U.S were \"sporadic and smaller, and none  [started] a wider student movement\" The \"partisan political context\" was given as a reason for the intensity of protests in the U.S [397] Columbia's status as an Ivy League school, its proximity to New York City and national news media, and its large population of Jewish students were described as fueling increased media attention and political scrutiny that helped spread the protests [397] According to a Washington Monthly study, pro-Palestinian demonstrations and encampments were more prevalent at elite U.S universities The magazine wrote, \"in the vast majority of cases, campuses that educate students mostly from working-class backgrounds have not had any protest activity.\" [401]\n\n\nSee also\n Media related to 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on

10 campuses in the University of California system, voted to authorize a strike because the university unfairly changed policies and discriminated against students who were exercising their right to free speech and created an unsafe work environment by allowing attacks on protesters The authorization did not guarantee a strike, but allowed the executive board to call one at any time [143]\n\n\nParticipants\nSome of the protests are organized by groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace, founded in 1996 as a progressive Jewish anti-Zionist organization; IfNotNow, founded during the

federal lawsuits [153] [154] Pro-Palestinian students were also doxxed by Accuracy in Media at Harvard, Columbia, and Yale University [155] [156] American intelligence assessments concluded that Iran had covertly supported the protests using social media by posing as students with operatives providing financial assistance to some protest groups in an attempt to stoke division, [157] [158] but Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said that U.S citizens were protesting \"in good faith\" and that this intelligence \"did not indicate otherwise\" [159] Intelligence reports detailing

among pro-Israeli counter-protesters who attacked the encampment A white supremacist affiliated with Proud Boys has been among the counter-protesters supported by far-right activists across the country [175] Experts have raised concern about far-right groups attempting to infiltrate protests to cause harm, and subsequent reactions from militant far-left activists aligned with the anti-fascist movement [176]\n\n\nControversies\nSeveral protests have been criticized for alleged antisemitism [65] Some students have called some of the incidents reported at protests and on campus

that most of them felt unsafe due to encampments 72% of respondents wanted them dismantled and 61% considered language used at the protests antisemitic [181] The U.S Department of Education concluded that University of Michigan and CUNY failed to assess whether the protests made the environment hostile [182]\n\n\nAntisemitism allegations\nSeveral protests have been criticized for alleged antisemitism [65] Some students have called some of the incidents reported at protests and on campus \"threatening\" and said they make them feel unsafe Jewish students were targeted for their faith, for wearing Jewish symbols, or were accused of being Zionists and subsequently targeted [179] Some Jewish students have also said the protests created a climate of fear and hate on campus [180]

hostile [182]\n\n\nAllegations of anti-Palestinianism and Islamophobia\nPro-Palestinian protesters and their allies have criticized the disposition of many university administrations as perpetuating a \"Palestine exception\" to academic freedom [185] [186] Pro-Palestinian students and their allies have raised concerns about anti-Palestinianism and Islamophobia Investigations by the U.S Department of Education have been opened at Columbia, Emory University, the University of North Carolina, and at Umass Amherst over their administrations' response to student protests and advocacy since the start of the war [187] [188] [189] [190]\n\n\nViolence\nA study by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) found that 97% of protests were nonviolent and nearly half of those that became violent involved protesters fighting with law enforcement during police interventions [60] [191]\n\n\nVandalism and property damage\nAt Portland State, protesters damaged computers and furniture during their occupation of the campus library At Columbia, protesters shattered windows during their occupation of Hamilton Hall [60] Police and city workers destroyed students' tents, flags

Washington The statue was wrapped with Palestinian scarves and flags, with the words \"Genocidal Warmonger University\" spray-painted on its base [197] [198]\n\n\nResponses\nMost universities facing encampment protests in the spring attempted to negotiate a settlement and disbandment of the encampments with student leaders, often threatening police sweeps to force an agreement In some cases, the end of the school year allowed administrators to reverse course on agreements they had negotiated, such as at the University of Oregon, Northwestern, and Rutgers New Brunswick [142]\n\n\nAdministrative response\nMost universities facing encampment protests in the spring attempted to negotiate a settlement and disbandment of the encampments with student leaders, often threatening police sweeps to force an agreement In some cases, the end of the school year allowed administrators to reverse course on agreements they had negotiated, such as at the University of Oregon, Northwestern, and Rutgers New Brunswick [142]\n\n\nPolice response\nA number of influential business leaders, including Daniel Lubetzky, Daniel Loeb, Len Blavatnik, Joseph Sitt, Howard Schultz, Michael Dell, Bill Ackman, Joshua Kushner, Ted Deutch and Yakir Gabay coordinated an effort in a WhatsApp group chat to urge Mayor Adams to crack down on the encampment at Columbia They offered to pay for private investigators to assist police, and made donations to Adams's 2025 campaign [227]\n\n\nViolence and incitement against protesters\nStudents and student journalists also faced violence at the hands of counter-protesters [242] [243] One protester at Columbia was arrested and hospitalized after a counter-protester rammed his car into a group of picketers [244] [245] Counter-protesters at the University of Pennsylvania approached the encampment with knives, and in a separate incident sprayed a chemical mixture on protesters' tents, food and belongings [246]\n\n\nPro-Israeli attack at UCLA\nOn May 1, around 10:50 PM, a pro-Israeli group attacked the pro-Palestinian protesters' camp for nearly four hours, attempting to breach the barricades surrounding the encampment [250] [251] [252] The attackers, reported to have come from outside campus, [253] carried Israeli flags and assaulted students with sticks, stones, poles, metal fencing, and pepper spray [254] [255] They played loud audio of a child crying, threw wood and a metal barrier into the camp, and threw at least six fireworks into the encampment, including one directly at a group of protesters carrying injured people [252] [256] [257]\n\n\nOpinion polls and referenda\nIn a November 2023 referendum, 78% of McGill students voted to adopt a divestment policy titled Policy Against Genocide in Palestine [261] A May 2024 divestment referendum at DePaul University returned a 91% vote in favor of divestment [262] In April 2024, Columbia College voted on three divestment questions The first asked whether Columbia should divest from Israel, the second asked whether it should cancel the Tel Aviv Global Center program, and the third asked whether Columbia should end its dual degree program with Tel Aviv University The motions passed by 76%, 68%, and 65%, respectively, with 40% voter participation [263] Students at the University of Pennsylvania voted 73% in favor of disclosing all investments in the school's endowment and 63% in favor of ending the university's relationship with Ghost Robotics, with 22% voter participation [264]\n\n\nReactions\nThe Group of Eight, of which the universities of Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Queensland, Monash and ANU are part, has sought legal advice on using terms such as \"intifada\" and \"from the river to the sea\", and has said it would ban those phrases if given definitive legal advice that they are unlawful It said such phrases are \"deeply offensive to many in the Jewish community\" It sent a letter to Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus asking for legal advice on whether these phrases violate Commonwealth law [270] Dreyfus wrote back that he does not give legal advice, noting the universities were taking external legal advice He added that Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 \"makes it a civil offence to do a public act that is reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate people because of their race, colour or national or ethnic origins A person aggrieved by an alleged act of racial discrimination can make a complaint to the Australian Human Rights Commission\" Sydney and Monash urged students not to use the phrases, but stopped short of banning them [271]\n\n\nAustralia\nThe Group of Eight, of which the universities of Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Queensland,

for Primary and Secondary Education, suggested several times that it is \"very questionable\" whether the \"rioters are actually students\" [287]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nWith encampments taking place at institutions and concern over what the president of the Union of Jewish Students described as rising antisemitism on campuses, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak held a meeting with vice chancellors of higher education institutions [69] In response, academics accused Sunak of \"scaremongering\" According to The Guardian, \"Vice-chancellors insist they have no desire to quell challenge or stop difficult discussions on their campuses, arguing that this is part of the core purpose of a university\" Vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England Steve West said there \"was no evidence\" that UK protests were \"getting out of hand\" and called on the government to avoid inflaming the situation [298] The president of advocacy group Universities UK, Dame Sally Mapstone, said universities \"may need to take action\" but that there \"should be no presumption universities would clear protest encampments\" [299] The New York Times reported that authorities took a more \"permissive approach\" to protests on campuses, with an emphasis on facilitating free speech, and that British polling indicates that a majority supports a ceasefire [51]\n\n\nUnited States\nRebecca Karl, a professor at NYU, stated that historically, \"there have been a number of confrontations that have been dealt with by universities in ways that stress that we are not a violent institution.. I'm personally very concerned\" [318] Wadie Said, a professor at the University of Colorado, stated, \"The First Amendment is the hallmark of freedom. You see that being curtailed based on viewpoint discrimination, which is something not supposed to be allowed under the First Amendment\" [319] Jeremi Suri, a UT Austin professor, stated, \"I witnessed the police – the state police, the campus police, the city police – an army of police.. stormed into the student crowd and started arresting students\" [320]\n\n\nFaculty and staff\nRebecca Karl, a professor at NYU, stated that historically, \"there have been a number of confrontations that have been dealt with by universities in ways that stress that we are not a violent institution..

witnessed the police – the state police, the campus police, the city police – an army of police.. stormed into the student crowd and started arresting students\" [320]\n\n\nOrganizations\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations executive director Afaf Nasher criticized the use of police force to break up the protests, stating it undermined academic freedom Civil rights advocates such as the American Civil Liberties Union have raised free speech concerns over the mass arrests that were seen during the protests [325] [57] The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, described some of the responses from law enforcement as \"disproportionate in their impacts\" [58] and was \"troubled\" by how they were being dealt with [326] The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that while \"hate speech is unacceptable,\" it is \"essential in all circumstances to guarantee the freedom of expression and the freedom of peaceful demonstration.\" [327] Farida Shaheed, the U.N special rapporteur on the right to education, said the increase in attacks on student protests represented \"a concerning erosion of intellectual freedom and democratic principles within educational settings\" [328] Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now, called the \"violent dismantling of pro-Palestine encampments and arrests of student protesters a dangerous assault on our democracy\" [329]\n\n\nPolitical\nOn April 22, President Joe Biden criticized and condemned the protests, calling them antisemitic and criticizing those who \"don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians\" [29] Former President Donald Trump said that the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was \"peanuts\" compared to the ongoing protests [334] Speaking at Columbia on April 24, House Speaker Mike Johnson said, \"Congress will not be silent as Jewish students are expected to run for their lives and stay home from their classes hiding in fear.\" [335] Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned \"lawlessness\" during the protests at Columbia, calling it \"unacceptable when Jewish students are targeted for being Jewish, when protests exhibit verbal abuse, systematic intimidation or glorification of the murderous and hateful Hamas or the violence of Oct 7.\" [336]\n\n\nLegislation\nOn April 23, the California State Senate Judiciary Committee passed 2024 SB-1287 on a 10–0 vote, advancing it to the Senate Appropriations Committee [350] The bill would require the California State University system and California Community Colleges system to enact policies that would prohibit violence, harassment, intimidation, and discrimination if they are \"intended to and reasonably understood by the victims or hearers\" to either \"interfere with the free exercise of rights under the First Amendment or Section 2 of Article I of the California Constitution\" or to \"call for or support genocide\" The bill would also restrict the right to assemble on campuses with \"reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, including advance authorization provisions, for public protests and demonstrations at institutions.\" The bill has received support exclusively from Jewish and Zionist organizations It is opposed by the ACLU and the University of California, Davis School of Law, which called the bill unconstitutional [351]\n\n\nLawsuits\nOn May 15, United Auto Workers (UAW)'s Harvard Graduate Student Union sued Harvard University, accusing it of surveillance and retaliation against workplace-related collective action, denying employees union representation in disciplinary hearings, and unfairly changing policies regarding access to campus to discourage protesters [366]\n\n\nOther countries\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the protests were \"horrific\" and antisemitic and must be quelled [67] Jewish U.S Senator Bernie Sanders responded vehemently, accusing Netanyahu of distracting the American people from the Israel–Hamas war [367] and expressing support for the protests [48] Many Israeli academics and civilians, alongside columnists in Israeli media such as The Jerusalem Post and Haaretz, expressed disdain for the protests, with one describing the general reaction as \"seeing them as an attack on the country and not just its government\" [368] [369] [370]\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe Guardian called the protests \"perhaps the most significant student movement since the anti-Vietnam campus protests of the late 1960s\" [63] Protests at Columbia were compared to the 1968 protests due to their scale and tactics, [390] and as echoing the 1968 movement [391] [392] According to The Independent, protesters studied the 1968 movement A Columbia undergraduate said that student organizers learned from the experiences of older generations, calling the movement \"completely built\" on the legacy of the 1968 protests [393] Mark Rudd, who led protests against the Vietnam War at Columbia in the 1960s, said, \"For me, it's the most normal thing in the world to look at the murder of 34,000 people and the displacement of close to 2 million in Gaza and say, ‘Hey, stop!\" [64]\n\n\nComparisons\nThe Guardian called the protests \"perhaps the most significant student movement since the anti-Vietnam campus protests of the

takeover,\" and \"terrorism\" [176] The New York Times opined that the protests have come during a presidential election year in which Democrats have \"harnessed promises of stability and normalcy to win critical recent elections\" and that the protests are a messaging opportunity for Republicans to divide Democrats [395] The newspaper also published an article citing NewsGuard, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and Recorded Future on how the media of Russia, China, and Iran have covered the events It concluded that those countries have made overt and covert efforts to capitalize on the protests to denigrate democracy, inflame partisan tensions, criticize Biden ahead of the 2024 presidential election, support Trump, and express support for Hamas and Palestinians generally [396]\n\n\nSpread of protests\nOn April 28, The New York Times wrote that protests outside the U.S were \"sporadic and smaller, and none  [started] a wider student movement\" The \"partisan political context\" was given as a reason for the intensity of protests in the U.S [397] Columbia's status as an Ivy League school, its proximity to New York City and national news media, and its large population of Jewish students were described as fueling increased media attention and political scrutiny that helped spread the protests [397] According to a Washington Monthly study, pro-Palestinian demonstrations and encampments were more prevalent at elite U.S universities The magazine wrote, \"in the vast majority of cases, campuses that educate students mostly from working-class backgrounds have not had any protest activity.\" [401]\n\n\nSee also\n Media related to 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on

In November 2022, the total volume of the compressed texts of its articles amounted to 20 gigabytes. The English Wikipedia is known for its vast and diverse collection of articles, covering a wide range of topics from science and technology to history and culture.\n\n# Bureaucracy\n\nEditors of the English Wikipedia have pioneered some ideas as conventions, policies, or features which were later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas include \"featured articles,\" the neutral-point-of-view policy, navigation templates, the sorting of short \"stub\" articles into sub-categories, dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration, and weekly collaborations.\n\nThe English Wikipedia has a complex and nuanced bureaucracy, with a system of policies, guidelines, and rules that govern the behavior of editors. The community of editors on the English Wikipedia is known for its high level of engagement and participation, with many editors contributing to the development of policies and guidelines.\n\n# Wikipedians\n\nThe English Wikipedia reached 4,000,000 registered user accounts on 1 April 2007, over a year since the millionth Wikipedian registered an account in February 2006. The community of Wikipedians on the English Wikipedia is a diverse and global one, with editors from all over the world contributing to the development of the encyclopedia.\n\nThe English Wikipedia has a strong focus on developing and supporting new editors, with a range of programs and initiatives aimed at encouraging participation and engagement. The community is also known for its strong sense of camaraderie and collaboration, with many editors working together to improve the quality and accuracy of articles.\n\n# Criticism\n\nThe free online encyclopedia Wikipedia has been criticized since its creation in 2001. Most of the criticism has been directed toward its content, community of established volunteer users, process, and rules. Critics have questioned its factual reliability, the readability and organization of its articles, the lack of methodical fact-checking, and its political bias.\n\nThe English Wikipedia has also been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability, with some critics arguing that the community is too opaque and that decisions are made without sufficient input from the broader community. However, the English Wikipedia has also been praised for its commitment to openness and transparency, with many editors actively engaging with critics and working to address concerns.\n\n# Controversies\n\nA notable discussion within the English Wikipedia community concerns the preference for national variety of the English language, particularly American English and British English. Various suggestions have been made, ranging from standardizing a single form of English to creating separate versions of the English Wikipedia project.\n\nAccording to a style guideline, \"the English Wikipedia has no general preference for a major national variety of the language\" and \"an article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation uses the appropriate variety of English for that nation.\" This guideline reflects the community's commitment to accommodating the diverse needs of editors and readers from different English-speaking countries.\n\n# English varieties\n\nA notable discussion within the English Wikipedia community concerns the preference for national variety of the English language, particularly American English and British English. Various suggestions have been made, ranging from standardizing a single form of English to creating separate versions of the English Wikipedia project.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the English Wikipedia has a policy of accommodating the diverse needs of editors and readers from different English-speaking countries. This policy is reflected in the use of different varieties of English in articles and templates, with editors encouraged to use the form of English that is most suitable for the topic or audience.\n\n# Disputed articles\n\nA 2013 study from Oxford University found that the most disputed articles on the English Wikipedia tend to address broader, global issues. In contrast, articles on other language Wikipedias often focus on regional issues. This pattern is attributed to the status of English as a global lingua franca, leading to contributions from many editors for whom English is a second language.\n\nThe study identified the most disputed entries on the English Wikipedia as George W Bush, anarchism, Muhammad, list of WWE personnel, global warming, circumcision, United States, Jesus, race and intelligence, and Christianity. These articles are often the subject of intense debate and controversy, with many editors actively engaging with each other to resolve disputes and improve the quality of the articles.\n\n# Threats against high schools\n\nThere have been reports of threats of violence against high schools made on Wikipedia. For instance, in 2008, Glen A Wilson High School was the subject of such a threat. Additionally, in 2006, a 14-year-old was arrested for making a threat against Niles West High School on Wikipedia.\n\nThese incidents highlight the need for editors to be aware of the potential consequences of their actions and to exercise caution when engaging with sensitive topics. The English Wikipedia has a range of policies and guidelines aimed at preventing and responding to threats of violence, and editors are encouraged to report any suspicious activity to the community or to the Wikimedia Foundation.\n\n# WikiProjects and assessment\n\nA \"WikiProject\" is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve Wikipedia. These groups may focus on a specific topic area (for example, women's history), a specific location, or a specific kind of task (for example, checking newly created pages).\n\nAs of August 2022, the English Wikipedia had over 2,000 WikiProjects, for which activity varied. WikiProjects are an important part of the English Wikipedia community, providing a framework for collaboration and coordination among editors. They are also a key mechanism for ensuring that Wikipedia meets its commitment to quality and accuracy.\n\n# Internal news publications\n\nCommunity-produced news publications include The Signpost, which is a weekly newsletter that covers news and events from the English Wikipedia. Other community news publications include the \"WikiWorld\" web comic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like The Bugle from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors.\n\nThere are also a number of publications from the Wikimedia Foundation, including the Wikimedia Blog, which provides news and updates about the Wikimedia movement.

{"title": "Steve_Jobs", "content": "\nEarly life\nSteven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah \"John\" Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي) Abdulfattah Jandali was born in a Muslim household to wealthy Syrian parents, the youngest of nine siblings After obtaining his undergraduate degree at the American University of Beirut, Jandali pursued a PhD in political science at the University of Wisconsin There, he met Joanne Schieble, an American Catholic of Swiss-German descent whose parents owned a mink farm and real estate in Green Bay The two fell in love but faced opposition from Schieble's father due to Jandali's Muslim faith When Schieble became pregnant, she arranged for a closed adoption, and travelled to San Francisco to give birth [5]\n\n\nFamily\nChrisann Brennan notes that after Jobs was forced out of Apple, \"he apologized many times over for his behavior\" towards her and Lisa She said Jobs \"said that he never took responsibility when he should have, and that he was sorry\" [291] By this time, Jobs had developed a strong relationship with Lisa and when she was nine, Jobs had her name on her birth certificate changed from \"Lisa Brennan\" to \"Lisa Brennan-Jobs\" [8] Jobs and Brennan developed a working relationship to co-parent Lisa, a change which Brennan credits to the influence of his newly found biological sister, Mona Simpson, who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Jobs [8] Jobs had found Mona after first finding his birth mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, shortly after he left Apple [292]\n\n\nInfancy\nIn his youth, Jobs's parents took him to a Lutheran church [7] When Steve was in high school, Clara admitted to his girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, that she \"was too frightened to love  [Steve] for the first six months of his life .. I was scared they were going to take him away from me Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake I wanted to return him.\" When Chrisann shared this comment with Steve, he stated that he was already aware, [8] and later said that he had been deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara Jobs would \"bristle\" when Paul and Clara were referred to as his \"adoptive parents\", and he regarded them as his parents \"1,000%\" Jobs referred to his biological parents as \"my sperm and egg bank That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more.\" [9]\n\n\nChildhood\nI always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics.. then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do.\n\n\nHomestead High\nThe location of the Los Altos home meant that Jobs would be able to attend nearby Homestead High School, which had strong ties to Silicon Valley [10] He began his first year there in late 1968 along with Bill Fernandez, [24] who introduced Jobs to Steve Wozniak, and would become Apple's first employee Neither Jobs nor Fernandez (whose father was a lawyer) came from engineering households and thus decided to enroll in John McCollum's Electronics I class [24] Jobs had grown his hair long and become involved in the growing counterculture, and the rebellious youth eventually clashed with McCollum and lost interest in the class [24]\n\n\nReed College\nIn September 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon [37] He insisted on applying only to Reed, although it was an expensive school that Paul and Clara could ill afford [38] Jobs soon befriended Robert Friedland, [39] who was Reed's student body president at that time [40] Brennan remained involved with Jobs while he was at Reed.\n\n\n1974–1985\nI was lucky to get into computers when it was a very young and idealistic industry There weren't many degrees offered in computer science, so people in computers were brilliant people from mathematics, physics, music, zoology, whatever They loved it, and no one was really in it for the money  [...] There are people around here who start companies just to make money, but the great companies, well, that's not what they're about.\n\n\nPre-Apple\nIn February 1974, Jobs returned to his parents' home in Los Altos and began looking for a job [46] He was soon hired by Atari, Inc in Los Gatos, California, as a computer technician [46] [47] Back in 1973, Steve Wozniak designed his own version of the classic video game Pong and gave its electronics board to Jobs According to Wozniak, Atari only hired Jobs because he took the board down to the company, and they thought that he had built it himself [48] Atari's cofounder Nolan Bushnell later described him as \"difficult but valuable\", pointing out that \"he was very often the smartest guy in the room, and he would let people know that\" [49]\n\n\nApple (1976–1985)\nBasically Steve Wozniak and I invented the Apple because we wanted a personal computer Not only couldn't we afford the computers that were on the market, those computers were impractical for us to use We needed a Volkswagen The Volkswagen isn't as fast or comfortable as other ways of traveling, but the VW owners can go where they want, when they want and with whom they want The VW owners have personal control of their car.\n\n\n1985–1997\nFollowing his resignation from Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT Inc [119] with $7 million A year later he was running out of money, and he sought venture capital with no product on the horizon Eventually, Jobs attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot, who invested heavily in the company [120] The NeXT computer was shown to the world in what was considered Jobs's comeback event, [121] a lavish invitation-only gala launch event [122] that was described as a multimedia extravaganza [123] The celebration was held at the Louise M Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco, California, on Wednesday, October 12, 1988 Steve Wozniak said in a 2013 interview that while Jobs was at NeXT he was \"really getting his head together\" [99]\n\n\nNeXT computer\nFollowing his resignation from Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT Inc [119] with $7 million A year later he was running out of money, and he sought venture capital with no product on the horizon Eventually, Jobs

October 12, 1988 Steve Wozniak said in a 2013 interview that while Jobs was at NeXT he was \"really getting his head together\" [99]\n\n\nPixar and Disney\nIn 1986, Jobs funded the spinout of The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm's computer graphics division for the price of $10 million, $5 million of which was given to the company as capital and $5 million of which was paid to Lucasfilm for technology rights [131]\n\n\n1997–2011\nIn 1996, Jobs's former company Apple was struggling and its survival depended on completing its next operating system After failed negotiations to purchase Be Inc., [144] [145] Apple eventually came to a deal with NeXT in December [146] for $400 million; the deal was finalized in February 1997, bringing Jobs back to the company he had cofounded [147] Jobs became de facto chief after then-CEO Gil Amelio was ousted in July 1997 He was formally named interim chief executive on September 16 [148] In March 1998, to concentrate Apple's efforts on returning to profitability, Jobs terminated several projects, such as Newton, Cyberdog, and OpenDoc In the coming months, many employees developed a fear of encountering Jobs while riding in the elevator, \"afraid that they might not have a job when the doors opened The reality was that Jobs's summary executions were rare, but a handful of victims was enough to terrorize a whole company.\" [149] Jobs changed the licensing program for Macintosh clones, making it too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines.\n\n\nReturn to Apple\nIn 1996, Jobs's former company Apple was struggling and its survival depended on completing its next operating system After failed negotiations to purchase Be Inc., [144] [145] Apple eventually came to a deal with NeXT in December [146] for $400 million; the deal was finalized in February 1997, bringing Jobs back to the company he had cofounded [147] Jobs became de facto chief after then-CEO Gil Amelio was ousted in July 1997

was that Jobs's summary executions were rare, but a handful of victims was enough to terrorize a whole company.\" [149] Jobs changed the licensing program for Macintosh clones, making it too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines.\n\n\nHealth problems\nIn October 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with cancer In mid 2004, he announced to his employees that he had a cancerous tumor in his pancreas [170] The prognosis for pancreatic cancer is very poor; [171] Jobs stated that he had a rare, less aggressive type, known as islet cell neuroendocrine tumor [170]\n\n\nResignation\nOn January 17, 2011, a year and a half after Jobs returned to work following the liver transplant, Apple announced that he had been granted another leave of absence Jobs announced his leave in a letter to employees, stating his decision was made \"so he could focus on his health\" As it did at the time of his 2009 medical leave, Apple announced that Tim Cook would run day-to-day operations and that Jobs would continue to be involved in major strategic decisions at the company [207] [208] While on leave, Jobs appeared at the iPad 2 launch event on March 2, the WWDC keynote introducing iCloud on June 6, and before the Cupertino City Council on June 7 [209]\n\n\nDeath\nJobs died at his home in Palo Alto, California, around 3 p.m (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, [64] [216] [217] which resulted in respiratory arrest [218] He had lost consciousness the day before and died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side [219] His sister, Mona Simpson, described his death thus: \"Steve's final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life's partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them Steve's final words were: 'Oh wow Oh wow Oh wow.' \" He then lost consciousness and died several hours later [219] A small private funeral was held on October 7, 2011, the details of which, out of respect for Jobs's family, were not made public [220]\n\n\nInnovations and designs\nJobs's design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and Buddhism In India, he experienced Buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey, [241] and his sense of intuition was influenced by the spiritual people with whom he studied [241] Jobs gained insights regarding industrial designs from Richard Sapper [242] According to Apple co-founder Wozniak, \"Steve didn't ever code He wasn't an engineer and he didn't do any original design...\" [243] [244] Daniel Kottke, one of Apple's earliest employees and a college friend of Jobs, stated: \"Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor Steve Jobs was the marketing person.\" [245]\n\n\nApple I\nThe Apple I was designed entirely by Wozniak, but Jobs had the idea of selling the computer, which led to the founding of Apple Computer in 1976 Jobs and Wozniak constructed several of the Apple I prototype by hand, funded by selling some of their belongings Eventually, 200 units were produced [77] One of the main innovations of the Apple I was that it included video display terminal circuitry on its circuit board, allowing it to connect to a low-cost composite video monitor or television, instead of an expensive computer terminal, compared to most existing computers at the time.\n\n\nApple II\nThe Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the world's first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, [86] designed primarily by Wozniak Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's unusual case [253] and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply [84] It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and Wozniak as the first consumer product sold by Apple The Apple II was first sold on June 10, 1977 [254] [255]\n\n\nLisa\nThe Lisa is a personal computer developed by Apple from 1978 and sold in the early 1980s to business users It is the first personal computer with a graphical user interface [256] The Lisa sold poorly at 100,000 units, [257] but despite being considered a commercial failure, it received technical acclaim, introducing several advanced features that reappeared on the Macintosh and eventually IBM PC compatibles In 1982, after Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project, [258] he took over the Macintosh project, adding inspiration from Lisa The final Lisa 2/10 was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL [259]\n\n\nMacintosh\nOnce he joined the Macintosh team, Jobs took over the project after Wozniak had experienced a traumatic airplane accident and temporarily left the company [99] Jobs launched the Macintosh on January 24, 1984, as the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse [260] This first model was later renamed to Macintosh 128k among the prolific series Since 1998, Apple has phased out the Macintosh name in favor of \"Mac\", though the product family has been nicknamed \"Mac\" or \"the Mac\" since inception The Macintosh was introduced by a US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, \"1984\" [261] It aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, received as a \"watershed event\" [262] and a \"masterpiece\" [263] Regis McKenna called the ad \"more successful than the Mac itself\" [264] It uses an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) to save humanity from the conformity of IBM's domination of the computer industry The ad alludes to George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, which describes a dystopian future ruled by a televised \"Big Brother\" [265] [266]\n\n\nNeXT Computer\nAfter Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, he started NeXT, a workstation computer company The NeXT Computer was introduced in 1988 at a lavish launch event Using the NeXT Computer, Tim Berners-Lee created the world's first web browser, the WorldWideWeb The NeXT Computer's operating system, named NeXTSTEP, begat Darwin, which is now the foundation of most of Apple's operating systems such as Macintosh's macOS and iPhone's iOS [268] [269]\n\n\niMac\nApple's iMac G3 was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design is directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple Apple boasted \"the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's\" [270] Described as \"cartoonlike\", the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, color and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a \"breathing\" light effect when the computer went to sleep [271] The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time The iMac's forward-thinking changes include eschewing the floppy disk drive and moving exclusively to USB for connecting peripherals Through the iMac's success, USB was popularized among third-party peripheral makers—as evidenced by the fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic to match the iMac design [272]\n\n\niTunes\niTunes is a media player, media library, online radio broadcaster, and mobile device management application developed by Apple It is used to play, download, and organize digital audio and video on personal computers running the macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems The iTunes Store is also available on the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad [273]\n\n\niPod\nThe first generation of iPod was released October 23, 2001 The major innovation of the iPod was its small size achieved by using a 1.8\" hard drive compared to the 2.5\" drives common to players at that time The capacity of the first-generation iPod ranged from 5 GB to 10 GB [274] The iPod sold for US$399 and more than 100,000 iPods were sold before the end of 2001 The introduction of the iPod resulted in Apple becoming a major player in the music industry [275] Also, the iPod's success prepared the way for the iTunes music store and the iPhone [276] After the first few generations of iPod, Apple released the touchscreen iPod Touch, the reduced-size iPod Mini and iPod Nano, and the screenless iPod Shuffle in the following years [275]\n\n\niPhone\nApple began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007 The iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten Americans were aware of its release Time declared it \"Invention of the Year\" for 2007 and included it in the All-TIME 100 Gadgets list in 2010, in the category of Communication [277] The completed iPhone had multimedia capabilities and functioned as a quad-band touch screen smartphone A year later, the iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 with three key features: support for GPS, 3G data and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA In June 2009, the iPhone 3GS, whose improvements included voice control, a better camera, and a faster processor, was introduced by Phil Schiller [278] The iPhone 4 was thinner than previous models, had a five megapixel camera capable of recording video in 720p HD, and added a secondary front-facing camera for video calls [279] A major feature of the iPhone 4s, introduced in October 2011, was Siri, a virtual assistant capable of voice recognition [280]\n\n\niPad\nThe iPad is an iOS-based line of tablet computers designed and marketed by Apple The first iPad was released on April 3, 2010 The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard The iPad includes built-in Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity on select models As of April 2015 [update], more than 250 million iPads have been sold [281]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1989, Jobs first met his future wife, Laurene Powell, when he gave a lecture at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where she was a student Soon after the event, he stated that Laurene \"was right there in the front row in the lecture hall, and I couldn't take my eyes off of her .. kept losing my train of thought, and started feeling a little giddy\" [282] After the lecture, he met her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner From that point forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, for the rest of his life [283]\n\n\nMarriage\nIn 1989, Jobs first met his future wife, Laurene Powell, when he gave a lecture at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where she was a student Soon after the event, he stated that Laurene \"was right there in the front row in the lecture hall, and I couldn't take my eyes off of her .. kept losing my train of thought, and started feeling a little giddy\" [282] After the lecture, he met her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner From that point forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, for the rest of his life [283]\n\n\nFamily\nChrisann Brennan notes that after Jobs was forced out of Apple, \"he apologized many times over for his behavior\" towards her and Lisa She said Jobs \"said that he never took responsibility when he should have, and that he was sorry\" [291] By this time, Jobs had developed a strong relationship with Lisa and when she was nine, Jobs had her name on her birth certificate changed from \"Lisa Brennan\" to \"Lisa Brennan-Jobs\" [8] Jobs and Brennan developed a working relationship to co-parent Lisa, a change which Brennan credits to the influence of his newly found biological sister, Mona Simpson, who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Jobs [8] Jobs had found Mona after first finding his birth mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, shortly after he left Apple [292]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nJobs's views and actions on philanthropy and charity are a public mystery [302] He maintained privacy even over what few of these actions were publicly known He has been a key figure in public discussions about societal obligations of the wealthy and powerful Through his career, the media investigated and criticized him and Apple as unusually and inexplicably mysterious or absent among powerful leaders and especially billionaires His name is absent from the Million Dollar List of all large global philanthropy [303] Some have speculated about his possible secret role in large anonymous donations [302]\n\n\nHonors and awards\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Steve Jobs**\n\nSteve Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was a visionary entrepreneur, inventor, and designer who co-founded Apple Inc. and Pixar Animation Studios. He is widely recognized as one of the most innovative and influential figures in modern technology and design.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nSteven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah \"John\" Jandali, a Syrian immigrant. Jobs's biological parents were not married at the time of his birth, and he was given up for adoption to Paul and Clara Jobs, a machinist and an accountant, respectively. The Jobs family moved to Mountain View, California, where Steve grew up in a modest home with his adoptive parents and a brother, Ron.\n\n**Family**\n\nJobs's parents took him to a Lutheran church, but he later stated that he did not feel a strong connection to Christianity. In his youth, Jobs's parents admitted to being too frightened to love him for the first six months of his life, and they eventually returned him to the adoption agency. Jobs would later comment on this experience, stating that he was \"too difficult a child\" and that his parents felt they had made a mistake in adopting him.\n\n**Childhood**\n\nJobs attended Homestead High School in Cupertino, California, where he befriended Steve Wozniak, a fellow student who would later become his business partner. Wozniak introduced Jobs to the world of electronics, and Jobs began to develop an interest in design and innovation. Jobs's parents encouraged his interest in electronics, and he began to attend electronics classes at Homestead High.\n\n**Reed College**\n\nIn 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, but dropped out after one semester due to the financial burden on his parents. Despite his short tenure at Reed, Jobs's time at the college had a profound impact on his life and worldview. He befriended Robert Friedland, the student body president, and began to explore his interests in design and philosophy.\n\n**Pre-Apple**\n\nIn 1974, Jobs returned to his parents' home in Los Altos and began looking for a job. He was soon hired by Atari, Inc. as a computer technician. Back in 1973, Wozniak designed his own version of the classic video game Pong and gave its electronics board to Jobs. Atari hired Jobs because they thought he had built the board himself.\n\n**Apple (1976–1985)**\n\nIn 1976, Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple Computer in Jobs's parents' garage. The Apple I was designed entirely by Wozniak, but Jobs had the idea of selling the computer, which led to the founding of Apple Computer.

I was scared they were going to take him away from me Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake I wanted to return him.\" When Chrisann shared this comment with Steve, he stated that he was already aware, [8] and later said that he had been deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara Jobs would \"bristle\" when Paul and Clara were referred to as his \"adoptive parents\", and he regarded them as his parents \"1,000%\" Jobs referred to his biological parents as \"my sperm and egg bank That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more.\" [9]\n\n\nChildhood\nI always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics.. then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do.\n\n\nHomestead High\nThe location of the Los Altos home meant that Jobs would be able to attend nearby Homestead High School, which had strong ties to Silicon Valley [10] He began his first year there in late 1968 along with Bill Fernandez, [24] who introduced Jobs to Steve Wozniak, and would become Apple's first employee Neither Jobs nor Fernandez (whose father was a lawyer) came from engineering households and thus decided to enroll in John McCollum's Electronics I class [24] Jobs had grown his hair long and become involved in the growing counterculture, and the rebellious youth eventually clashed with McCollum and lost interest in the class [24]\n\n\nReed College\nIn September 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon [37] He insisted on applying only to Reed, although it was an expensive school that Paul and Clara could ill afford [38] Jobs soon befriended Robert Friedland, [39] who was Reed's student body president at that time [40] Brennan remained involved with Jobs while he was at Reed.\n\n\n1974–1985\nI was lucky to get into computers when it was a very young and idealistic industry There weren't many degrees offered in computer science, so people in computers were brilliant people from mathematics, physics, music, zoology, whatever They loved it, and no one was really in it for the money  [...] There are people around here who start companies just to make money, but the great companies, well, that's not what they're about.\n\n\nPre-Apple\nIn February 1974, Jobs returned to his parents' home in Los Altos and began looking for a job [46] He was soon hired by Atari, Inc in Los Gatos, California, as a computer technician [46] [47] Back in 1973, Steve Wozniak designed his own version of the classic video game Pong and gave its electronics board to Jobs According to Wozniak, Atari only hired Jobs because he took the board down to the company, and they thought that he had built it himself [48] Atari's cofounder Nolan Bushnell later described him as \"difficult but valuable\", pointing out that \"he was very often the smartest guy in the room, and he would let people know that\" [49]\n\n\nApple (1976–1985)\nBasically Steve Wozniak and I invented the Apple because we wanted a personal computer Not only couldn't we afford the computers that were on the market, those computers were impractical for us to use We needed a Volkswagen The Volkswagen isn't as fast or comfortable as other ways of traveling, but the VW owners can go where they want, when they want and with whom they want The VW owners have personal control of their car.\n\n\n1985–1997\nFollowing his resignation from Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT Inc [119] with $7 million A year later he was running out of money, and he sought venture capital with no product on the horizon Eventually, Jobs attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot, who invested heavily in the company [120] The NeXT computer was shown to the world in what was considered Jobs's comeback event, [121] a lavish invitation-only gala launch event [122] that was described as a multimedia extravaganza [123] The celebration was held at the Louise M Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco, California, on Wednesday, October 12, 1988 Steve Wozniak said in a 2013 interview that while Jobs was at NeXT he was \"really getting his head together\" [99]\n\n\nNeXT computer\nFollowing

Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm's computer graphics division for the price of $10 million, $5 million of which was given to the company as capital and $5 million of which was paid to Lucasfilm for technology rights [131]\n\n\n1997–2011\nIn 1996, Jobs's former company Apple was struggling and its survival depended on completing its next operating system After failed negotiations to purchase Be Inc., [144] [145] Apple eventually came to a deal with NeXT in December [146] for $400 million; the deal was finalized in February 1997, bringing Jobs back to the company he had cofounded [147] Jobs became de facto chief after then-CEO Gil Amelio was ousted in July 1997 He was formally named interim chief executive on September 16 [148] In March 1998, to concentrate Apple's efforts on returning to profitability, Jobs terminated several projects, such as Newton, Cyberdog, and OpenDoc In the coming months, many employees developed a fear of encountering Jobs while riding in the elevator, \"afraid that they might not have a job when the doors opened The reality was that Jobs's summary executions were rare, but a handful of victims was enough to terrorize a whole company.\" [149] Jobs changed the licensing program for Macintosh clones, making it too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines.\n\n\nReturn to Apple\nIn 1996, Jobs's former company

for the manufacturers to continue making machines.\n\n\nHealth problems\nIn October 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with cancer In mid 2004, he announced to his employees that he had a cancerous tumor in his pancreas [170] The prognosis for pancreatic cancer is very poor; [171] Jobs stated that he had a rare, less aggressive type, known as islet cell neuroendocrine tumor [170]\n\n\nResignation\nOn January 17, 2011, a year and a half after Jobs returned to work following the liver transplant, Apple announced that he had been granted another leave of absence Jobs announced his leave in a letter to employees, stating his decision was made \"so he could focus on his health\" As it did at the time of his 2009 medical leave, Apple announced that Tim Cook would run day-to-day operations and that Jobs would continue to be involved in major strategic decisions at the company [207] [208] While on leave, Jobs appeared at the iPad 2 launch event on March 2, the WWDC keynote introducing iCloud on June 6, and before the Cupertino City Council on June 7 [209]\n\n\nDeath\nJobs died at his home in Palo Alto, California, around 3 p.m (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, [64] [216] [217] which resulted in respiratory arrest [218] He had lost consciousness the day before and died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side [219] His sister, Mona Simpson, described his death thus: \"Steve's final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life's partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them Steve's final words were: 'Oh wow Oh wow Oh wow.' \" He then lost consciousness and died several hours later [219] A small private funeral was held on October 7, 2011, the details of which, out of respect for Jobs's family, were not made public [220]\n\n\nInnovations and designs\nJobs's design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and Buddhism In India, he experienced Buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey, [241] and his sense of intuition was influenced by the spiritual people with whom he studied [241] Jobs gained insights regarding industrial designs from Richard Sapper [242] According to Apple co-founder Wozniak, \"Steve didn't ever code He wasn't an engineer and he didn't do any original design...\" [243] [244] Daniel Kottke, one of Apple's earliest employees and a college friend of Jobs, stated: \"Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor Steve Jobs was the marketing person.\" [245]\n\n\nApple I\nThe Apple I was designed entirely by Wozniak, but Jobs had the idea of selling the computer, which led to the founding of Apple Computer in 1976 Jobs and Wozniak constructed several of the Apple I prototype by hand, funded by selling some of their belongings Eventually, 200 units were produced [77] One of the main innovations of the Apple I was that it included video display terminal circuitry on its circuit board, allowing it to connect to a low-cost composite video monitor or television, instead of an expensive computer terminal, compared to most existing computers at the time.\n\n\nApple II\nThe Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the world's first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, [86] designed primarily by Wozniak Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's unusual case [253] and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply [84] It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and Wozniak as the first consumer product sold by Apple The Apple II was first sold on June 10, 1977 [254] [255]\n\n\nLisa\nThe Lisa is a personal computer developed by Apple from 1978 and sold in the early 1980s to business users It is the first personal computer with a graphical user interface [256] The Lisa sold poorly at 100,000 units, [257] but despite being considered a commercial failure, it received technical acclaim, introducing several advanced features that reappeared on the Macintosh and eventually IBM PC compatibles In 1982, after Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project, [258] he took over the Macintosh project, adding inspiration from Lisa The final Lisa 2/10 was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL [259]\n\n\nMacintosh\nOnce he joined the Macintosh team, Jobs took over the project after Wozniak had experienced a traumatic airplane accident and temporarily left the company [99] Jobs launched the Macintosh on January 24, 1984, as the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse [260] This first model was later renamed to Macintosh 128k among the prolific series Since 1998, Apple has phased out the Macintosh name in favor of \"Mac\", though the product family has been nicknamed \"Mac\" or \"the Mac\" since inception The Macintosh was introduced by a US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, \"1984\" [261] It aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, received as a \"watershed event\" [262] and a \"masterpiece\" [263] Regis McKenna called the ad \"more successful than the Mac itself\" [264] It uses an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) to save humanity from the conformity of IBM's domination of the computer industry The ad alludes to George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, which describes a dystopian future ruled by a televised \"Big Brother\" [265] [266]\n\n\nNeXT Computer\nAfter Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, he started NeXT, a workstation computer company The NeXT Computer was introduced in 1988 at a lavish launch event Using the NeXT Computer, Tim Berners-Lee created the world's first web browser, the WorldWideWeb The NeXT Computer's operating system, named NeXTSTEP, begat Darwin, which is now the foundation of most of Apple's operating systems such as Macintosh's macOS and iPhone's iOS [268] [269]\n\n\niMac\nApple's iMac G3 was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design is directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple Apple boasted \"the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's\" [270] Described as \"cartoonlike\", the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, color and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a \"breathing\" light effect when the computer went to sleep [271] The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time The iMac's forward-thinking changes include eschewing the floppy disk drive and moving exclusively to USB for connecting peripherals Through the iMac's success, USB was popularized among third-party peripheral makers—as evidenced by the fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic to match the iMac design [272]\n\n\niTunes\niTunes is a media player, media library, online radio broadcaster, and mobile device management application developed by Apple It is used to play, download, and organize digital audio and video on personal computers running the macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems The iTunes Store is also available on the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad [273]\n\n\niPod\nThe first generation of iPod was released October 23, 2001 The major innovation of the iPod was its small size achieved by using a 1.8\" hard drive compared to the 2.5\" drives common to players at that time The capacity of the first-generation iPod ranged from 5 GB to 10 GB [274] The iPod sold for US$399 and more than 100,000 iPods were sold before the end of 2001 The introduction of the iPod resulted in Apple becoming a major player in the music industry [275] Also, the iPod's success prepared the way for the iTunes music store and the iPhone [276] After the first few generations of iPod, Apple released the touchscreen iPod Touch, the reduced-size iPod Mini and iPod Nano, and the screenless iPod Shuffle in the following years [275]\n\n\niPhone\nApple began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007 The iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten Americans were aware of its release Time declared it \"Invention of the Year\" for 2007 and included it in the All-TIME 100 Gadgets list in 2010, in the category of Communication [277] The completed iPhone had multimedia capabilities and functioned as a quad-band touch screen smartphone A year later, the iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 with three key features: support for GPS, 3G data and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA In June 2009, the iPhone 3GS, whose improvements included voice control, a better camera, and a faster processor, was introduced by Phil Schiller [278] The iPhone 4 was thinner than previous models, had a five megapixel camera capable of recording video in 720p HD, and added a secondary front-facing camera for video calls [279] A major feature of the iPhone 4s, introduced in October 2011, was Siri, a virtual assistant capable of voice recognition [280]\n\n\niPad\nThe iPad is an iOS-based line of tablet computers designed and marketed by Apple The first iPad was released on April 3, 2010 The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard The iPad includes built-in Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity on select models As of April 2015 [update], more than 250 million iPads have been sold [281]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1989, Jobs first met his future wife, Laurene Powell, when he gave a lecture at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where she was a student Soon after the event, he stated that Laurene \"was right there in the front row in the lecture hall, and I couldn't take my eyes off of her .. kept losing my train of thought, and started feeling a little giddy\" [282] After the lecture, he met her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner From that point forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, for the rest of his life [283]\n\n\nMarriage\nIn 1989, Jobs first met his future wife, Laurene Powell, when he gave a lecture at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where she was a student Soon after the event, he stated that Laurene \"was right there in the front row in the lecture hall, and I couldn't take my eyes off of her .. kept losing my train of thought, and started feeling a little giddy\" [282] After the lecture, he met her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner From that point forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, for the rest of his life [283]\n\n\nFamily\nChrisann Brennan notes that after Jobs was forced out of Apple, \"he apologized many times over for his behavior\" towards her and Lisa She said Jobs \"said that he never took responsibility when he should have, and that he was sorry\" [291] By this time, Jobs had developed a strong relationship with Lisa and when she was nine, Jobs had her name on her birth certificate changed from \"Lisa Brennan\" to \"Lisa Brennan-Jobs\" [8] Jobs and Brennan developed a working relationship to co-parent Lisa, a change which Brennan credits to the influence of his newly found biological sister, Mona Simpson, who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Jobs [8] Jobs had found Mona after first finding his birth mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, shortly after he left Apple [292]\n\n\nPhilanthropy\nJobs's views and actions on philanthropy and charity are a public mystery [302] He maintained privacy even over what few of these actions were publicly known He has been a key figure in public discussions about societal obligations of the wealthy and powerful Through his career, the media investigated and criticized him and Apple as unusually and inexplicably mysterious or absent among powerful leaders and especially billionaires His name is absent from the Million Dollar List of all large global philanthropy [303] Some have speculated about his possible secret role in large anonymous donations [302]\n\n\nHonors and awards\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She was the third member of the Braxton family to pursue a music career, following in the footsteps of her sisters Toni, Towanda, Trina, and Tamar. Born on June 7, 1971, in Severn, Maryland, Braxton's life and career were marked by a passion for music and a strong family bond.\n\nEarly Life\n\nTraci Renee Braxton was born in Severn, Maryland, as the third child of her parents, Michael Conrad Braxton Sr. and Evelyn Jackson. Her father was a Methodist clergyman and power company worker, while her mother was a former opera singer and cosmetologist who also served as a pastor.
