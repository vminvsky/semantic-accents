Heard**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard's highly publicized defamation lawsuit captivated the attention of the global community, sparking intense debate and speculation. The drama surrounding their relationship, the civil action, and its aftermath have been extensively covered in the media, making it one of the most sensational celebrity legal battles in recent history. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the key events, developments, and reactions surrounding the Depp v. Heard case.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Depp and Heard's relationship\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard met in 2012 and began dating. In 2015, they got married, and in 2016, Heard filed for divorce. The couple's relationship was marked by allegations of domestic abuse, which Heard claimed Depp perpetrated during their marriage. Depp has consistently denied these allegations, accusing Heard of fabricating them to gain leverage in their divorce proceedings.\n\n### Depp v News Group Newspapers Ltd\n\nIn 2018, Depp sued News Group Newspapers Ltd, the publisher of The Sun, for libel over an article that referred to him as a \"wife-beater.\" The lawsuit was settled out of court, with Depp agreeing to a payment of £375,000. This settlement was later cited as evidence in the Depp v. Heard case.\n\n### Heard's op-ed in The Washington Post\n\nIn December 2018, Heard published an op-ed in The Washington Post, in which she described herself as a survivor of domestic abuse. Although Depp was not named in the article, the op-ed was widely interpreted as referring to their relationship. Depp's lawyers accused Heard of implying that he was a domestic abuser, which led to the libel lawsuit.\n\n### Waldman's comments in the Daily Mail\n\nIn the days following Heard's op-ed, the Daily Mail published a series of articles that included comments from Heard's friend, iO Tillett Wright. The articles quoted Wright as saying that Heard had told him about Depp's alleged abuse. Depp's lawyers pointed to these comments as evidence that Heard had fabricated the abuse allegations.\n\n**Civil action**\n\n### Pre-trial developments\n\nThe Depp v. Heard case was filed in 2019 and went to trial in 2022. Before the trial, Depp's lawyers released a video that showed Heard's friend, iO Tillett Wright, discussing the op-ed and Heard's abuse allegations. The video was widely shared on social media, sparking debate about the credibility of Heard's claims.\n\n### Trial\n\n#### Opening statements\n\nThe trial began on April 11, 2022, with Depp's lawyers delivering opening statements. They argued that Heard had fabricated the abuse allegations to gain leverage in their divorce proceedings and to boost her profile. Heard's lawyers countered that Depp had a history of domestic abuse and that the op-ed was a legitimate expression of Heard's experiences.\n\n#### Testimony\n\nDuring the trial, both Depp and Heard testified about their relationship. Depp denied ever hitting Heard, while Heard described instances of physical and emotional abuse. The trial also featured testimony from other witnesses, including Depp's friends and family members, who corroborated Depp's account of the relationship.\n\n#### Closing arguments\n\nIn closing statements, Depp's lawyers argued that Heard had failed to prove that Depp was a domestic abuser. Heard's lawyers countered that the evidence showed that Depp had a pattern of behavior that was consistent with domestic abuse.\n\n#### Verdict\n\nOn June 1, 2022, the jury delivered a verdict in favor of Depp, finding that Heard had defamed him in her op-ed. The jury awarded Depp $10 million in damages, although the amount was later reduced to $5 million due to a cap on punitive damages. Heard was also awarded $2 million in damages for a counter-claim she made against Depp.\n\n### Post-trial motions\n\nAfter the verdict, Heard's lawyers filed post-trial motions, arguing that the jury's verdict was flawed and that Depp's lawyers had engaged in misconduct. The appeals court denied these motions, and Heard's lawyers announced that she would appeal the decision.\n\n### Appeals, settlement and carrier lawsuit\n\nHeard's lawyers filed an appeal of the verdict, but the appeal was later dropped. In 2022, Heard and Depp reached a settlement in which Heard agreed to drop her appeal and donate $1 million to charity. Depp also agreed to pay Heard $2 million in settlement of her counter-claim.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Livestream\n\nThe trial was livestreamed, allowing the public to follow the proceedings in real-time. The livestream was widely watched, with millions of people tuning in to follow the drama.\n\n### Social media coverage\n\nThe Depp v. Heard case was extensively covered on social media, with many people weighing in on the merits of the case and the credibility of the witnesses.\n\n### Comments by juror\n\nAfter the trial, one of the jurors spoke to the press, saying that the verdict was based on the evidence presented. The juror also commented on the intense media scrutiny surrounding the case.\n\n### The Washington Post\n\nThe Washington Post, which published Heard's op-ed, issued a statement saying that the verdict did not undermine the validity of the op-ed.\n\n### Commentary on verdict\n\nThe verdict in the Depp v. Heard case sparked intense debate and commentary. Many people praised the jury's decision, while others criticized it as a miscarriage of justice.\n\n**Media coverage**\n\n### Film adaptation\n\nThe Depp v. Heard case has been optioned for a film adaptation, with Johnny Depp set to star.\n\n### Books\n\nSeveral books have been written about the Depp v. Heard case, including a memoir by Amber Heard and a biography of Johnny Depp.\n\n### TV\n\nThe case has been the subject of numerous TV specials and documentaries, including a two-part special on CNN.\n\n### Podcast\n\nThe Depp v. Heard case has been extensively covered on podcasts, including a popular true crime podcast that dedicated several episodes to the case.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Johnny Depp\n* Amber Heard\n* Domestic violence\n* Libel\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* Depp v.

The incident resulted in the deaths of 135 people, making it one of the deadliest stadium disasters in football history.\n\n**Background**\n\nKanjuruhan Stadium is a football stadium located in Malang, East Java, Indonesia. It was built in 1962 and has a seating capacity of over 42,000 spectators. The stadium has hosted numerous high-profile football matches, including international friendlies and domestic league matches. Arema FC, the home team, has a significant following in East Java and is known for their passionate supporters.\n\n**Disaster**\n\nThe disaster occurred during a match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya, which is their arch-rival. The match was part of the Indonesian football league, Liga 1. The game began at 8:30 PM local time, and the first half ended with Arema FC leading 2-0. However, in the second half, Persebaya Surabaya scored a goal, reducing the lead to 2-1. The Arema FC fans, who were sitting in the stands, became frustrated with the referee's decisions and began to throw objects onto the pitch.\n\nAs the match resumed, the tension between the fans and the police grew. Riot police were deployed to the stadium to maintain order, but they were unable to prevent the fans from storming the pitch. The fans, who were mostly young men, began to assault the players, coaches, and officials. The police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, but this only exacerbated the situation.\n\nAs the crowd surged towards the exits, a stampede broke out, with fans pushing and trampling each other to escape the chaos. The exits were blocked, and the fans were unable to get out of the stadium quickly enough. Many fans were crushed or trampled, resulting in a large number of casualties", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kanjuruhan_Stadium_disaster\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Disaster\n#Casualties\n##Ages and genders\n#Aftermath\n#Legal\n#Investigation\n##Police\n##Joint fact-finding team\n##Autopsies\n#Trial\n##Result\n#Reactions\n##FIFA\n##International\n##Police\n##Abandoned leagues\n##PSSI\n#In popular culture\n##Drama\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The club was founded in 1966 and has become a prominent force in Cypriot basketball, with a rich history of success both domestically and continentally.\n\n# History\n\n## Founding, early years & First Golden Age (1966–1988)\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. was founded in 1966 by a group of enthusiastic basketball players and enthusiasts in Limassol, Cyprus. Initially, the club was affiliated with the local football club, AEL Limassol, but it quickly established itself as an independent entity. In the early years, AEL Limassol B.C. competed in the Cypriot basketball league, winning its first championship in 1972. The club's first golden era began in 1976, with the arrival of experienced coach Andreas Hadjikyriakos, who led the team to several domestic titles and introduced a more competitive and professional approach to the team.\n\n## Decline, relegation & return to glory (1989–2001)\n\nIn the late 1980s, AEL Limassol B.C. began to experience a decline in fortunes, and the team was relegated to the Cypriot second division in 1992. However, the club's management and coaches worked tirelessly to regroup and rebuild the team, and in 1995, AEL Limassol B.C. returned to the top division, winning the championship in 1997. This marked the beginning of a new era for the club, with the team going on to win several domestic titles and establishing itself as a force to be reckoned with in Cypriot basketball.\n\n## Second Golden Age & various European successes (2002–2010)\n\nIn 2002, AEL Limassol B.C. appointed experienced coach Dragan Raca, who led the team to its second golden era. Under Raca's guidance, AEL Limassol B.C. won several domestic titles, including the Cypriot championship in 2003, and established itself as a major force in Cypriot basketball. The club also experienced success in European competitions, reaching the FIBA EuroCup quarterfinals in 2003 and the FIBA EuroChallenge semifinals in 2006.\n\n### The initial Dragan Raca era (2002–2005)\n\nDuring his initial tenure with AEL Limassol B.C., Raca implemented a new playing style and philosophy, which emphasized speed, agility, and teamwork. The team responded well to Raca's approach, winning several domestic titles and establishing itself as a top contender in Cypriot basketball.\n\n### Organising the FIBA EuroCup All-Star Day Limassol & interest to join Greek A1 Basketball League (2006–2008)\n\nIn 2006, AEL Limassol B.C. hosted the FIBA EuroCup All-Star Day, which featured some of the top players in European basketball. The event was a huge success, attracting large crowds and generating significant interest in the club. During this period, AEL Limassol B.C. also expressed interest in joining the Greek A1 Basketball League, but ultimately decided to remain in the Cypriot league.\n\n### Transformation from EuroChallenge contenders to EuroChallenge favourites (2008–2010)\n\nIn 2008, AEL Limassol B.C. appointed experienced coach Dušan Ivković, who led the team to a major transformation in its playing style and philosophy. Under Ivković's guidance, the team became a top contender in the FIBA EuroChallenge, reaching the semifinals in 2009 and the quarterfinals in 2010.\n\n## Descent into obscurity, dissolution & reformation (2011–2017)\n\nIn 2011, AEL Limassol B.C. experienced a decline in fortunes, and the team was relegated to the Cypriot second division. The club's management and coaches struggled to rebuild the team, and in 2012, AEL Limassol B.C. was dissolved due to financial difficulties. However, in 2015, a group of enthusiasts and investors reformed the club, and AEL Limassol B.C. was re-established in the Cypriot league.\n\n## Recent history (2018–present)\n\n### Return to Division A & reaching two Cup finals (2018–2022)\n\nIn 2018, AEL Limassol B.C. returned to the Cypriot top division, Division A, after a six-year absence. The team went on to reach the Cypriot Cup final in 2019 and 2020, losing to Keravnos B.C. and Etha Engomis B.C. respectively.\n\n### Gradual improvements & participation in the Balkan League (2023–)\n\nIn 2023, AEL Limassol B.C. began to experience gradual improvements, winning several domestic titles and participating in the Balkan League, a regional European competition. The team is expected to continue its upward trajectory in the coming seasons.\n\n# Stadium\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. plays its home games at the Spyros Kyprianou Indoor Hall, a 5,500-seat indoor arena located in Limassol, Cyprus. The stadium is a state-of-the-art facility that hosts various sports and cultural events throughout the year.\n\n# Supporters & rivalries\n\nAEL Limassol B.C. has a dedicated fan base in Cyprus, with supporters from all over the country attending the team's home games. The club's main rivalries are with Keravnos B.C. and Etha Engomis B.C., with whom they compete for domestic titles and regional supremacy.\n\n# Colours & crest history\n\nAEL Limassol B.C.'s colours are blue and white, with the team's crest featuring a lion's head surrounded by a circle. The club's crest has undergone several changes over the years, with the current design being introduced in 2015.\n\n# Mascot\n\nAEL Limassol B.C.'s mascot is Leontas, a lion named after the Greek word for lion. Leontas is a popular figure among the club's fans, and appears at various events and games throughout the year.\n\n## Leontas (\"Lion\")\n\nLeontas, or the lion, is a symbol of strength, courage, and power, making it the perfect mascot for AEL Limassol B.C.

It was a rebellion by the miners on the Ballarat goldfields against the colonial government's policies and laws, particularly the imposition of a monthly mining tax.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Eureka Rebellion was a culmination of growing tensions between the miners and the government over issues such as taxation, land ownership, and representation. The rebellion was sparked by the introduction of the monthly mining tax, which was deeply unpopular among the miners. The tax was seen as an attempt by the government to exploit the miners and restrict their economic freedom. The rebellion was led by a group of miners, led by Peter Lalor, who sought to establish a more democratic and just society.\n\n**Origins in the Victorian gold rush**\n\n### Protests on the goldfields: 1851–1854\n\nIn 1851, the Victorian gold rush began, attracting thousands of miners to the Ballarat goldfields. However, the colonial government, led by Governor Charles La Trobe, imposed a series of laws and regulations that restricted the miners' economic freedom. The government introduced a license fee, which was meant to fund the administration of the goldfields, but the miners saw it as a tax. The fee was increased in 1853, leading to widespread protests and demonstrations.\n\n### La Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin\n\nIn June 1853, La Trobe introduced a monthly mining tax, which was deeply unpopular among the miners. The tax was seen as an attempt by the government to exploit the miners and restrict their economic freedom. The miners saw the tax as a threat to their livelihoods and began to organize protests and demonstrations against it.\n\n### First gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat\n\nIn July 1853, the first gold commissioner, John O'Shanassy, arrived in Ballarat to enforce the government's regulations. However, O'Shanassy was seen as a representative of the government and was met with hostility by the miners. He was forced to leave the area after a series of violent confrontations with the miners.\n\n### Bendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement\n\nIn August 1853, a petition was presented to the Legislative Council by the miners at Bendigo, which called for the abolition of the license fee and the monthly mining tax. The petition was signed by over 40,000 miners and was seen as a significant blow to the government's authority. The Red Ribbon Movement, which emerged in 1853, was a campaign by the miners to boycott the license fee and the monthly mining tax. The movement was led by a group of miners, who wore red ribbons on their hats to show their solidarity with the cause.\n\n### Legislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry\n\nIn September 1853, the Legislative Council called for a Commission of Inquiry into the goldfields and the government's policies. The inquiry was seen as an attempt by the government to address the miners' grievances and to find a solution to the crisis. However, the inquiry was delayed repeatedly, leading to further tensions between the miners and the government.\n\n### Hotham replaces La Trobe\n\nIn June 1854, La Trobe was replaced as governor by Sir Charles Hotham. Hotham was seen as a more hardline governor, who was determined to maintain the government's authority and to enforce its policies. The miners saw Hotham as a threat to their livelihoods and began to organize a rebellion against him.\n\n**Tensions escalate**\n\n### Murder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel\n\nIn November 1853, a miner named James Scobie was murdered by a group of men, who were seen as associates of the government. The murder was seen as a provocation by the miners, who began to organize a rebellion against the government. On December 12, 1853, the Eureka hotel was burned down by a group of miners, who were angry at the government's policies.\n\n### Ballarat Reform League meetings\n\nIn 1853, a series of meetings were held by the Ballarat Reform League, which was a group of miners who were determined to establish a more democratic and just society. The league was led by Peter Lalor, who was a skilled orator and a natural leader. The meetings were attended by thousands of miners, who were angry at the government's policies and were determined to take action.\n\n### Escalating violence as military convoy looted\n\nIn 1854, a military convoy was sent to the goldfields to enforce the government's policies. However, the convoy was met with hostility by the miners, who began to loot and burn the soldiers' equipment. The violence escalated, leading to a series of confrontations between the miners and the soldiers.\n\n**Open rebellion**\n\n### Paramilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross\n\nIn December 1854, a group of miners, led by Lalor, began to mobilize a paramilitary force, which was determined to take on the government. The force was known as the Southern Cross and was seen as a symbol of the miners' rebellion. The miners swore allegiance to the Southern Cross, which was a flag that was seen as a symbol of their freedom and their determination to establish a more democratic and just society.\n\n#### Fortification of the Eureka lead\n\nIn December 1854, the miners constructed a stockade on the Eureka lead, which was seen as a symbol of their rebellion. The stockade was fortified with earthworks and was defended by a group of miners, who were determined to resist the government's attempts to take control of the goldfields.\n\n#### Vinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade\n\nHowever, the stockade was not as well-defended as it seemed. The Vinegar Hill blunder, which was a series of mistakes made by the miners, led to a significant decline in the number of defenders at the stockade. The Irish dimension, which was a factor in the rebellion, also played a significant role in the dwindling numbers at the stockade.\n\n#### Departing detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind\n\nIn December 1854, a detachment of Independent Californian Rangers left the goldfields, leaving behind a small garrison of soldiers. The garrison was seen as a threat by the miners, who were determined to take on the government.\n\n**Battle of the Eureka Stockade**\n\nOn December 3, 1854, the Battle of the Eureka Stockade took place, which was a pivotal moment in the rebellion. The battle was fierce and intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. However, the miners were ultimately defeated, and the stockade was taken by the government.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Trials for sedition and high treason\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, a series of trials were held for sedition and high treason. Peter Lalor and a number of other miners were arrested and charged with treason.

Born on January 23, 1991, in Moscow, Russia, Sorokin moved to Germany with her family at a young age and later transferred to the United States, where she settled in New York City.\n\n**Early life**\n\nSorokin grew up in a middle-class family in Germany, where her parents encouraged her to pursue an education. She demonstrated a talent for languages, speaking fluent German, English, and Russian. After completing high school, Sorokin moved to the United States, where she enrolled in the German International School of New York and later attended the Parsons School of Design. During her time at Parsons, Sorokin became increasingly interested in the art world and began to build relationships with artists, designers, and gallery owners.\n\nSorokin's early life in Germany and the United States laid the groundwork for her future fraudulent activities. Her exposure to the art world and her access to social networks provided her with the skills and opportunities to perpetrate her scams.\n\n**Fraud**\n\nSorokin's scams began in 2013, when she began to pose as a wealthy socialite, using fake identities and backstories to deceive friends, acquaintances, and business associates. She claimed to be the daughter of a wealthy Russian family and presented herself as a high-end fashionista with a penchant for luxury items. Sorokin's scams often involved convincing people to pay for her expenses, such as hotel stays, flights, and dining experiences, under the guise of \"business opportunities\" or \" networking events.\"\n\nSorokin's modus operandi involved befriending people, gaining their trust, and then manipulating them into investing in her business ventures or lending her money. She often used her charm, beauty, and social status to convince people to part with their money. Her scams were often sophisticated, involving fake documents, email accounts, and bank accounts to create a veneer of legitimacy.\n\n**Indictment and arrest**\n\nSorokin's scams came to light in 2017, when she was arrested by federal authorities and charged with multiple counts of grand larceny, theft of services, and attempted grand larceny. The indictment alleged that Sorokin had defrauded several people out of over $275,000.\n\nSorokin's arrest and indictment shocked the art world, with many of her victims speaking out about their experiences with her. The case highlighted the dangers of social engineering and the ease with which scammers can manipulate people into parting with their money.\n\n**Trial, conviction, and sentence**\n\nSorokin's trial began in 2018 and lasted several weeks. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence of Sorokin's scams, including emails, bank statements, and testimony from her victims. Sorokin's defense team argued that she was a victim of circumstance and that she had been manipulated by others into committing her crimes.\n\nIn April 2019, Sorokin was found guilty on multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services. She was sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison, with the possibility of early release after serving 3 years.\n\n**ICE custody**\n\nIn 2022, Sorokin was transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, where she was being held pending deportation. Sorokin's lawyers argued that she was a victim of human trafficking and that her detention was a form of retaliation for her cooperation with law enforcement.\n\n**Media representation**\n\nSorokin's case has been the subject of several media outlets, including The New York Times, The New Yorker, and CNN. Her story has also been adapted into a Netflix series, \"Inventing Anna,\" which premiered in 2022.\n\nThe media coverage of Sorokin's case has sparked debate about the dangers of social engineering and the ease with which scammers can manipulate people into parting with their money. It has also raised questions about the role of social media in facilitating scams and the need for greater awareness and education about online safety.\n\n**After prison**\n\nSorokin has been involved in several art shows and exhibitions since her release from prison. In 2022, she exhibited her work at the Catin Gallery in New York City, featuring a series of paintings and prints inspired by her experiences in prison.\n\nSorokin has also been selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain, using a pseudonym to avoid detection. Her NFTs have been selling for thousands of dollars, with some collectors reportedly purchasing her work as a form of \"white-knight\" investment.\n\nSorokin has also been involved in the fashion industry, collaborating with several designers on limited-edition clothing lines. Her fashion ventures have been met with controversy, with some accusing her of profiting from her notoriety.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nSorokin's personal life has been the subject of much speculation and media attention. She has been in a relationship with a man who has been identified as a former convict, and the couple has been living together in a luxury apartment in New York City.\n\nSorokin has also been open about her struggles with mental health, including depression and anxiety. She has spoken publicly about her experiences with therapy and has encouraged her followers to prioritize their mental health.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Social engineering\n* Non-fungible tokens\n* Fashion industry\n* Art world\n* Human trafficking\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This section is not included in the article as per the requirements)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Anna Sorokin's Instagram account\n* Anna Sorokin's Twitter account\n* \"Inventing Anna\" Netflix series\n* Catin Gallery\n* Blockchain technology", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Anna_Sorokin\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Fraud\n#Indictment and arrest\n#Trial, conviction, and sentence\n#ICE custody\n#Media representation\n#After prison\n##Art shows\n##Non-fungible tokens\n##Fashion\n#Personal life\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This can lead to a decrease in oxygen delivery to the affected area, resulting in hypoxia.\n\n### Hypoxemic hypoxia\n\nHypoxemic hypoxia occurs when the blood does not carry enough oxygen to the tissues and organs. This can be due to various factors, such as high altitude, respiratory disorders, or other conditions that impair gas exchange in the lungs.\n\n#### Carbon monoxide poisoning\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning can cause hypoxemic hypoxia by binding to hemoglobin in the blood, reducing its ability to carry oxygen to tissues and organs.\n\n#### Altitude\n\nHigh altitude can lead to hypoxemic hypoxia due to the lower atmospheric pressure and reduced oxygen availability.\n\n#### Hypoxic breathing gases\n\nBreathing gases that are deficient in oxygen, such as those used in anesthesia or in certain industrial settings, can cause hypoxemic hypoxia.\n\n#### Other\n\nOther factors, such as respiratory disorders, anemia, or histotoxic hypoxia, can also contribute to hypoxemic hypoxia.\n\n### Anemia\n\nAnemia is a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. This can lead to a decrease in oxygen delivery to tissues and organs, resulting in hypoxia.\n\n### Histotoxic hypoxia\n\nHistotoxic hypoxia occurs when cellular respiration is impaired by toxins or other substances that interfere with the normal process of oxygen utilization.\n\nBy extent\n\nHypoxia can be classified based on the extent of the condition.\n\n### Generalized hypoxia\n\nGeneralized hypoxia affects the entire body, resulting in a widespread decrease in oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.\n\n### Localized hypoxia\n\nLocalized hypoxia occurs when a specific region of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply, such as in the case of ischemia or high altitude.\n\n### By affected tissues and organs\n\nHypoxia can also be classified based on the specific tissues and organs affected.\n\n#### Cerebral hypoxia\n\nCerebral hypoxia refers to a decrease in oxygen delivery to the brain, which can lead to neurological symptoms and complications.\n\n#### Corneal hypoxia\n\nCorneal hypoxia occurs when the cornea is deprived of adequate oxygen supply, which can cause vision problems and corneal ulcers.\n\n#### Intrauterine hypoxia\n\nIntrauterine hypoxia refers to a decrease in oxygen delivery to the fetus during pregnancy, which can lead to fetal growth restriction and other complications.\n\n#### Tumor hypoxia\n\nTumor hypoxia occurs when a tumor is deprived of adequate oxygen supply, which can make it more resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n\n#### Vestibular system\n\nHypoxia can also affect the vestibular system, leading to balance and equilibrium disorders.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nHypoxia can manifest in various ways, depending on the severity and duration of the condition.\n\n## Complications\n\nUntreated hypoxia can lead to serious complications, including organ damage, seizures, and even death.\n\nCauses\n\nHypoxia can be caused by various factors, including ischemia, hypoxemic hypoxia, anemia, and histotoxic hypoxia.\n\n## Ischemia\n\nIschemia is a reduction in blood flow to a body part, caused by obstruction of blood vessels. This can lead to a decrease in oxygen delivery to the affected area, resulting in hypoxia.\n\n## Hypoxemic hypoxia\n\nHypoxemic hypoxia occurs when the blood does not carry enough oxygen to the tissues and organs. This can be due to various factors, such as high altitude, respiratory disorders, or other conditions that impair gas exchange in the lungs.\n\n## Anemia\n\nAnemia is a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. This can lead to a decrease in oxygen delivery to tissues and organs, resulting in hypoxia.\n\n## Histotoxic hypoxia\n\nHistotoxic hypoxia occurs when cellular respiration is impaired by toxins or other substances that interfere with the normal process of oxygen utilization.\n\nMechanism\n\nHypoxia can lead to various physiological and pathological responses, depending on the severity and duration of the condition.\n\n## Physiological responses\n\nIn response to hypoxia, the body may attempt to compensate for the lack of oxygen by increasing breathing rate, heart rate, and blood pressure.\n\n## Acute\n\nAcute hypoxia can lead to immediate physiological responses, such as hyperventilation, tachycardia, and vasodilation.\n\n## Chronic\n\nChronic hypoxia can lead to long-term physiological responses, such as polycythemia, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac hypertrophy.\n\n## Pathological responses\n\nProlonged hypoxia can lead to pathological responses, including cerebral ischemia, myocardial ischemia, and tumor angiogenesis.\n\n### Cerebral ischemia\n\nCerebral ischemia occurs when the brain is deprived of adequate oxygen supply, leading to neurological symptoms and complications.\n\n### Myocardial ischemia\n\nMyocardial ischemia occurs when the heart is deprived of adequate oxygen supply, leading to chest pain and other cardiac complications.\n\n### Tumor angiogenesis\n\nTumor angiogenesis occurs when a tumor grows new blood vessels to supply itself with oxygen and nutrients, leading to increased tumor growth and resistance to treatment.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of hypoxia may involve physical examination, history, and various tests.\n\n## Physical examination and history\n\nA thorough physical examination and history may reveal signs and symptoms of hypoxia, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or neurological symptoms.\n\n## Tests\n\nVarious tests, such as pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas analysis, and imaging studies, may be used to diagnose hypoxia.\n\n## Differential diagnosis\n\nDifferential diagnosis may involve ruling out other conditions that may mimic hypoxia, such as respiratory disease or cardiac disease.\n\nPrevention\n\nPrevention of hypoxia may involve measures to prevent ischemia, hypoxemic hypoxia, anemia, and histotoxic hypoxia.\n\n## Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia\n\nPrevention of altitude-induced hypoxia may involve measures such as acclimatization, supplemental oxygen, and medications to reduce the effects of high altitude.\n\nTreatment and management\n\nTreatment and management of hypoxia may involve various strategies to restore adequate oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.\n\n## Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n\nTreatment of acute and chronic cases of hypoxia may involve oxygen therapy, respiratory support, and management of underlying conditions.\n\nOutcomes\n\nOutcomes of hypoxia may vary depending on the severity and duration of the condition.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nEpidemiology of hypoxia may involve studies of the incidence and prevalence of hypoxia in different populations.\n\n## Silent hypoxia\n\nSilent hypoxia refers to hypoxia that is not accompanied by obvious symptoms, but may still have serious consequences.\n\nHistory\n\nHistory of hypoxia may involve studies of the discovery and understanding of hypoxia as a medical condition.\n\n## Etymology\n\nEtymology of hypoxia may involve studies of the origins and meanings of the term \"hypoxia\".\n\nSee also\n\nSee also the following related topics:\n\n* Respiratory disease\n* Cardiac disease\n* Anemia\n* Histotoxic hypoxia\n* Oxygen therapy\n* Respiratory support\n\nNotes\n\n* This article is a general overview of hypoxia and is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the topic.\n* The information in this article is based on general knowledge and may not be applicable to specific individuals or situations.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hypoxia_(medicine)\" following this outline:\n\n#Classification\n##By cause\n##By extent\n###Generalized hypoxia\n###Localized hypoxia\n###By affected tissues and organs\n####Cerebral hypoxia\n####Corneal hypoxia\n####Intrauterine hypoxia\n####Tumor hypoxia\n####Vestibular system\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Complications\n#Causes\n##Ischemia\n##Hypoxemic hypoxia\n###Carbon monoxide poisoning\n###Altitude\n###Hypoxic breathing gases\n###Other\n##Anemia\n##Histotoxic hypoxia\n#Mechanism\n##Physiological responses\n##Acute\n##Chronic\n##Pathological responses\n###Cerebral ischemia\n###Myocardial ischemia\n###Tumor angiogenesis\n#Diagnosis\n##Physical examination and history\n##Tests\n##Differential diagnosis\n#Prevention\n##Prevention of altitude induced hypoxia\n#Treatment and management\n##Treatment of acute and chronic cases\n#Outcomes\n#Epidemiology\n##Silent hypoxia\n#History\n##Etymology\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The film is a remake of the 1940 Disney animated film of the same name and stars Tom Hanks as Geppetto and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Pinocchio.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is a retelling of the classic tale of a wooden puppet named Pinocchio, who is brought to life by a blue fairy and wishes to become a real boy. Pinocchio's desire for adventure and recognition leads him to make a series of poor choices, including lying, stealing, and getting into trouble with the law. As Pinocchio navigates the complexities of the adult world, he must confront the consequences of his actions and learn the value of honesty and responsibility.\n\nThe film also explores themes of parenthood and the complexities of the relationship between Pinocchio and his creator, Geppetto. Through a series of flashbacks, the film reveals Geppetto's backstory and his motivations for creating Pinocchio, as well as his own struggles with parenthood and the consequences of his actions.\n\nThroughout the film, Pinocchio's nose grows as he tells lies, and he must confront the consequences of his actions and learn to tell the truth. The film's climax features a dramatic confrontation between Pinocchio and the villainous Honest John, who seeks to exploit Pinocchio's naivety and desire for adventure.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Tom Hanks as Geppetto\n* Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Pinocchio\n* Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jiminy Cricket\n* Keegan-Michael Key as Lampwick\n* Toney Revolori as Spazzatura\n* Lillo Brancato as Honest John\n* Luke Evans as Stromboli\n* Chris Weitz as Frollo\n* Kyanne Young as The Blue Fairy\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nThe film was in development for several years, with Robert Zemeckis attached to direct and produce. The screenplay was written by David Magee, who also wrote the screenplay for the 2012 film \"Life of Pi\". The film's production was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but production eventually began in 2020.\n\n### Casting\n\nTom Hanks was cast as Geppetto in 2019, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth was cast as Pinocchio in 2020. The casting process was extensive, with Zemeckis and his team holding auditions for months before finding the perfect actors for the roles.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming took place in various locations in Italy, including Rome, Venice, and Siena. The production team used a combination of practical and visual effects to bring the film's magical world to life.\n\n### Visual effects and animation\n\nThe film's visual effects and animation were created by Industrial Light & Magic, a company known for its work on films such as \"Star Wars\" and \"Indiana Jones\". The team used a combination of traditional animation techniques and computer-generated imagery to create the film's memorable characters and sequences.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by Alan Silvestri, who also composed the score for the 1985 film \"Back to the Future\". The soundtrack features a mix of orchestral and choral pieces, as well as a number of catchy pop tunes. One of the standout tracks from the film is \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", a classic song from the original 1940 Disney film.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe film's marketing campaign was extensive, with a number of trailers and TV spots released in the months leading up to the film's release. The film's promotional materials emphasized the film's themes of family, adventure, and self-discovery.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film was released on September 8, 2022, in the United States and Canada. It was released in a number of formats, including IMAX and Dolby Cinema. The film's release was accompanied by a number of special events and promotions, including a red carpet premiere in Los Angeles.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Audience viewership\n\nThe film opened at number one at the box office, earning over $50 million in its opening weekend. The film's audience viewership was diverse, with a mix of families, children, and adults in attendance. The film's success was attributed to its engaging storyline, memorable characters, and stunning visuals.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its faithfulness to the original source material, its stunning visuals, and its engaging storyline. The film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising its visuals and performances. The film's score on Metacritic is 84 out of 100, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\n**Accolades**\n\nThe film won a number of awards, including the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature and the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects.

Aveling's life was marked by his commitment to scientific socialism, secularism, and egalitarianism, as well as his literary and theatrical pursuits.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nEdward Aveling was a complex and multifaceted individual, whose contributions to various fields of endeavor have been largely overshadowed by his high-profile relationship with Eleanor Marx. Despite this, Aveling's own achievements as a writer, lecturer, and advocate for social reform warrant recognition. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Aveling's life and work, highlighting his key roles in promoting secularism, socialism, and scientific thought.\n\n**Early years**\n\nEdward Aveling was born on March 3, 1849, in London, England, to a family of modest means. Little is known about his childhood, but it is documented that Aveling's early education took place in London's working-class schools. His academic abilities were soon recognized, and he went on to attend University College London (UCL), where he studied medicine and developed a strong interest in scientific inquiry.\n\n**University College London**\n\nDuring his time at UCL, Aveling became exposed to the works of prominent scientists and thinkers, including Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley. This exposure had a profound impact on Aveling's worldview, shaping his commitment to scientific socialism and secularism. Aveling's academic achievements at UCL earned him a scholarship, which enabled him to continue his studies at Cambridge University.\n\n**Cambridge**\n\nAt Cambridge, Aveling's interests in scientific inquiry and philosophy led him to engage with prominent academics, including the philosopher and historian Edward Freeman. Aveling's involvement with the Cambridge Union Society and the Cambridge Philosophical Society further nurtured his intellectual and social development. However, Aveling's time at Cambridge was marked by tensions with certain academic authorities, which likely contributed to his decision to leave the university.\n\n**College of Preceptors**\n\nFollowing his departure from Cambridge, Aveling enrolled at the College of Preceptors, a London-based institution dedicated to teacher training and education. Aveling's time at the College of Preceptors allowed him to develop his pedagogical skills and establish himself as a respected educator. His commitment to social reform and secularism continued to grow, as he became increasingly involved with various organizations and movements.\n\n**First marriage**\n\nAveling's personal life was marked by two marriages. His first marriage, to a woman named Ellen Ray, was short-lived and ended in divorce. The exact circumstances of this marriage are not well-documented, but it is clear that Aveling's relationships with women played a significant role in his life and work.\n\n**Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy at London Hospital**\n\nAveling's teaching career progressed rapidly, and he was appointed as a lecturer on comparative anatomy at the London Hospital Medical College. This position allowed him to share his knowledge of scientific inquiry with medical students and professionals. Aveling's lectures were highly regarded, and he became known for his ability to communicate complex scientific concepts in an engaging and accessible manner.\n\n**New College, London**\n\nIn 1879, Aveling was appointed as a lecturer at New College, London, where he taught philosophy and social sciences. This position provided Aveling with an opportunity to develop his skills as a teacher and researcher, as well as to engage with the city's intellectual and cultural elite.\n\n**Professorship of English**\n\nAveling's academic achievements eventually led to the offer of a professorship in English at the University of London. Although Aveling accepted the position, he did so with reservations, as he felt that the role was not aligned with his intellectual and social values.\n\n**Aveling's secularist credo**\n\nAveling's commitment to secularism was unwavering, and he saw it as a fundamental aspect of his worldview. He believed that the separation of church and state was essential for the development of a just and equal society. Aveling's secularist credo was influenced by the ideas of Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant, prominent figures in the British secularist movement.\n\n**National Secular Society and the Hall of Science**\n\nAveling's involvement with the National Secular Society and the Hall of Science reflected his commitment to secularism and scientific inquiry. The Hall of Science, a London-based institution, provided a platform for Aveling to engage with the public on issues related to science, philosophy, and social reform.\n\n**Aveling as interim editor of Foote's Progress and The Freethinker**\n\nAveling's literary and journalistic pursuits led to his appointment as interim editor of Foote's Progress, a prominent secularist periodical. He later became the editor of The Freethinker, a publication that reflected his commitment to secularism and social reform.\n\n**Political career**\n\nAveling's involvement in politics was marked by his association with the socialist movement. He was a vocal advocate for the rights of working-class individuals and the establishment of a more equal society. Aveling's commitment to socialism was influenced by the ideas of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, as well as his own experiences as a teacher and lecturer.\n\n**The American journey of agitation 1886**\n\nIn 1886, Aveling embarked on a journey to the United States, where he became involved in various socialist and labor movements. This trip marked the beginning of Aveling's extensive travels throughout the United States, during which he became acquainted with prominent figures in the American socialist movement.\n\n**Second American journey of 1888**\n\nIn 1888, Aveling returned to the United States, where he continued to engage with various socialist and labor organizations. His involvement with the American socialist movement was marked by his association with figures such as William Morris and Edward Bellamy.\n\n**Aveling as a Playwright**\n\nAveling's literary pursuits extended to the realm of drama, as he became involved in the writing of plays. His theatrical endeavors were likely influenced by his experiences as a teacher and lecturer, as well as his commitment to social reform.\n\n**The Avelings and Ibsen**\n\nAveling's association with the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen reflects his interest in dramatic writing and social commentary. The Avelings' involvement with Ibsen's work was likely influenced by their shared commitment to social reform and their interest in exploring complex social issues through drama.\n\n**Aveling and Darwin**\n\nAveling's relationship with Charles Darwin was marked by mutual respect and admiration. Aveling's commitment to scientific socialism and his interest in the natural sciences were likely influenced by Darwin's groundbreaking work on evolution and the natural world.\n\n**Aveling and Haeckel**\n\nAveling's association with the German zoologist Ernst Haeckel reflects his interest in the natural sciences and his commitment to scientific socialism. Haeckel's ideas on the interconnectedness of all living beings and the importance of scientific inquiry likely influenced Aveling's worldview.\n\n**Aveling's publication of Darwin's letter to Marx**\n\nIn 1890, Aveling published a letter written by Charles Darwin to Karl Marx, which reflected the two men's shared commitment to scientific inquiry and social reform. This publication marked a significant moment in the history of the relationship between science and socialism.\n\n**Later life, death and legacy**\n\nAveling's personal life was marked by his long-term relationship with Eleanor Marx, as well as his involvement with her in various socialist and literary endeavors. Aveling's health began to decline in the late 1890s, and he died on August 9, 1898, at the age of 49. His legacy as a writer, lecturer, and advocate for social reform continues to be celebrated by scholars and enthusiasts of his work.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nEdward Aveling's contributions to the realms of science, literature, and social reform have had a lasting impact on various fields of study. His commitment to secularism, socialism, and egalitarianism reflects the complexities of his worldview and the era in which he lived. Aveling's legacy serves as a reminder of the importance of intellectual curiosity, social activism, and the pursuit of knowledge and understanding.\n\n**Publications by Edward Aveling**\n\nAveling's literary output was extensive, and his writings cover a range of topics, including science, philosophy, and social reform. Some of his notable publications include:\n\n**Selected writings**\n\n* \"The Great Infidel\" (1880)\n* \"The Coming Man\" (1885)\n* \"The Evolution of Man\" (1888)\n* \"The Social Organization of the Future\" (1890)\n\n**Scientific writings**\n\n* \"The Natural History of the Sea\" (1879)\n* \"The Geology of the British Isles\" (1881)\n* \"The Zoology of the British Isles\" (1882)\n\n**Writings coauthored with Eleanor**\n\n* \"The Woman Question\" (1886)\n* \"The Proletarian\" (1891)\n\n**Translations**\n\n* \"The Confessions of St. Augustine\" (1875)\n* \"The Apology of Socrates\" (1876)\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of Edward Aveling's life and work, highlighting his contributions to science, literature, and social reform.

Based in Kolkata, India, the club has a rich history dating back to 1889 and has a massive following across the country. With numerous domestic and international titles to its name, Mohun Bagan has earned a reputation as one of the most successful and beloved football clubs in Asia.\n\n# History\n\n## Early years (1889–99)\n\nMohun Bagan was founded in 1889 by a group of British expatriates, led by Ahibhushan Chaki and Bhupendranath Datta, who were part of the Brahmo Samaj, a Hindu reform movement. The club was initially called the \"Mohun Bagan Athletic Club\" and was named after the Bengali poet and social reformer Ram Mohun Roy. The club's early years saw it compete in local tournaments and friendly matches, gradually building a reputation as a force to be reckoned with in the football scene of Calcutta.\n\n## Administrative and tactical overhaul under Subedar-major Sailen Basu (1900s)\n\nIn the early 20th century, Subedar-major Sailen Basu took charge of the club, implementing significant administrative and tactical reforms. Under his leadership, Mohun Bagan adopted a more structured approach to football, focusing on training, discipline, and team cohesion. Basu's tactical innovations, including the introduction of the \"W-pattern\" formation, helped the team achieve greater success in local and national tournaments.\n\n## The historic year of 1911\n\nThe year 1911 marked a significant milestone in Mohun Bagan's history, as the team became the first Indian club to win the Indian Football Association's (IFA) Shield. This historic victory was achieved under the captaincy of Sailen Basu, who had by then become a legendary figure in Indian football. The win was a testament to the club's growing reputation and marked the beginning of a new era in Indian football.\n\n## Nation-wide exposure of the club (1912–30)\n\nThe 1910s and 1920s saw Mohun Bagan gain widespread recognition across India. The club participated in national tournaments, competing against top teams from across the country. This exposure helped establish Mohun Bagan as a national power in Indian football, with the team's performances earning widespread coverage in the press and attracting fans from all over the country.\n\n## Significant contributions to the national team (1931–47)\n\nDuring this period, Mohun Bagan players made a significant impact on the Indian national team. Several club players represented the country in international competitions, including the 1934 Asian Games, where India won its first-ever medal in football. The club's contributions to the national team helped raise the profile of Indian football globally and cemented Mohun Bagan's status as a leading force in the sport.\n\n## Struggle with consistency (1948–1950s)\n\nFollowing India's independence in 1947, Mohun Bagan experienced a period of relative decline. The club struggled to maintain consistency, failing to dominate local and national tournaments as it had in the past. However, the club's legacy continued to inspire new generations of football players and fans, and it remained a beloved institution in Indian football.\n\n## The golden team (1960-64)\n\nThe 1960s saw the emergence of Mohun Bagan's \"Golden Team,\" which dominated Indian football for several years. Led by players such as Sailen Manna, Chuni Goswami, and PK Banerjee, the team won numerous titles, including the IFA Shield and the National Football League (NFL). This period marked a resurgence in the club's fortunes and cemented its status as one of the top teams in India.\n\n## Decline and revival under P. K. Banerjee (1965-1970s)\n\nIn the late 1960s, P. K. Banerjee, a former Mohun Bagan player and coach, took charge of the club. Under his leadership, the team experienced a period of decline, failing to match the success of the Golden Team. However, Banerjee's vision and tactical acumen helped the club recover from this slump, and it eventually regained its position as a top team in India.\n\n## The National Club of India (1980s)\n\nThe 1980s saw Mohun Bagan establish itself as the \"National Club of India.\" The team won numerous titles, including the IFA Shield and the NFL, and earned a reputation as one of the most successful clubs in the country. This period marked a new era in Mohun Bagan's history, as the club solidified its position as a national power in Indian football.\n\n## Commercialisation and incoming of foreigners (1990–2000)\n\nThe 1990s saw significant changes in Indian football, with the introduction of commercialisation and foreign players. Mohun Bagan was at the forefront of this change, signing high-profile foreign players and adopting a more professional approach to the sport. While this period saw some success, including the club's first-ever top-four finish in the NFL, it also raised concerns about the impact of foreign players on the sport.\n\n## Heightened foreign influence (2000–2010)\n\nThe 2000s saw an increase in foreign players in Indian football, with many top teams, including Mohun Bagan, signing high-profile international players. While this period saw some success, including the club's first-ever title in the I-League, it also raised concerns about the impact of foreign players on the sport and the need for greater investment in Indian football infrastructure.\n\n## Strive for success and ultimate takeover by KGSPL (2010–20)\n\nIn the 2010s, Mohun Bagan continued to strive for success, competing in the I-League and the Federation Cup. However, the club faced financial challenges and struggled to match the success of its rivals. In 2017, the Kolkata-based sports company KGSPL (Kolkata Games and Sports Private Limited) took over the club, bringing in a new era of investment and infrastructure development.\n\n## Newfound dominance (2020–)\n\nUnder the ownership of KGSPL, Mohun Bagan has experienced a resurgence in fortunes, competing in the top tier of Indian football and winning several titles. The club has also invested in its infrastructure, including the development of the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan stadium. This period marks a new era in Mohun Bagan's history, as the club continues to strive for success and cement its position as one of the top teams in India.\n\n# Club crest and kits\n\nMohun Bagan's club crest features a green and maroon color scheme, with the club's initials \"MB\" emblazoned on the crest. The club's kits have undergone several changes over the years, but the current home kit features a green jersey with maroon sleeves and a white crest.\n\n## Kit manufacturers and sponsors\n\nMohun Bagan has partnered with several kit manufacturers and sponsors over the years, including Adidas and Tata Steel.\n\n# Stadiums\n\nMohun Bagan has played its home games at several stadiums over the years, including the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan and the Mohun Bagan Ground.\n\n## Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan\n\nThe Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan is a multi-purpose stadium in Kolkata, India, which has been the home of Mohun Bagan since 2014. The stadium has a seating capacity of over 68,000 and features a state-of-the-art infrastructure.\n\n## Mohun Bagan Ground\n\nThe Mohun Bagan Ground is a smaller stadium in Kolkata, India, which was the home of Mohun Bagan from 1889 to 2014.

The exercises, which involved live-fire drills, air and naval operations, and troop deployments, were the largest and most complex in scale since the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n\nIn the months leading up to Pelosi's visit, there was a significant increase in Chinese military activity around Taiwan. The PLA had been conducting regular incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), with fighter jets and surveillance aircraft repeatedly entering the area. These incursions were seen as a demonstration of China's military strength and a warning to the United States and Taiwan against any potential military action.\n\n### Escalation of tensions\n\nThe escalation of tensions between the United States and China began in June 2022, when the US Navy sent a guided-missile destroyer, the USS Benfold, through the Taiwan Strait. China responded by sending naval ships and fighter jets to the area, and the US ship was forced to alter its course to avoid a confrontation. The incident marked a significant escalation of tensions between the two countries, and it set the stage for the larger military exercises that would follow.\n\n**Military exercises**\n\nThe Chinese military exercises around Taiwan began on August 4, 2022, and continued for several days. The exercises involved live-fire drills, air and naval operations, and troop deployments, and were the largest and most complex in scale since the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis. The exercises included:\n\n* Live-fire drills in the Taiwan Strait, which involved the firing of artillery and anti-ship missiles\n* Air and naval operations in the Taiwan Strait, which involved the deployment of fighter jets and naval ships\n* Troop deployments in the Taiwan Strait, which involved the deployment of troops and equipment\n\nThe exercises were seen as a demonstration of China's military strength and a warning to the United States and Taiwan against any potential military action.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Japan\n\nJapan responded to the Chinese military exercises by increasing its military presence in the region. The Japanese government deployed additional troops and equipment to the island of Okinawa, which is located near Taiwan, and increased its surveillance of Chinese military activity in the area. Japan also expressed concern about the potential for a conflict between China and the United States over Taiwan.\n\n### North Korea\n\nNorth Korea responded to the Chinese military exercises by increasing its own military activity. The North Korean government announced that it would be conducting its own military exercises in response to the Chinese exercises, and it deployed additional troops and equipment to the border with South Korea. North Korea also expressed support for China's position on Taiwan, and criticized the United States for its actions in the region.\n\n### Russia\n\nRussia responded to the Chinese military exercises by expressing support for China's position on Taiwan. The Russian government announced that it would be increasing its military presence in the region, and it deployed additional troops and equipment to the border with China. Russia also expressed concern about the potential for a conflict between China and the United States over Taiwan.\n\n### United States\n\nThe United States responded to the Chinese military exercises by increasing its military presence in the region. The US government deployed additional troops and equipment to the island of Guam, which is located near Taiwan, and increased its surveillance of Chinese military activity in the area. The US government also expressed concern about the potential for a conflict between China and the United States over Taiwan, and announced that it would be taking steps to increase its military readiness in the region.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Chinese military exercises around Taiwan marked a significant escalation of tensions between China and the United States. The exercises demonstrated China's military strength and capability, and served as a warning to the United States and Taiwan against any potential military action. The exercises also marked a significant increase in military activity in the region, and raised concerns about the potential for a conflict between China and the United States.\n\nThe exercises also had significant economic implications, as they disrupted trade and commerce in the region. The exercises also had significant diplomatic implications, as they strained relations between China and the United States, and raised concerns about the potential for a conflict between the two countries.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Taiwan Strait Crisis\n* Chinese military exercises in the South China Sea\n* United States military presence in the Asia-Pacific region\n* Chinese military modernization\n* Taiwan–United States relations\n* China–United States relations", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Chinese_military_exercises_around_Taiwan\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Incursions into Taiwan ADIZ\n##Escalation of tensions\n#Military exercises\n#Reactions\n##Japan\n##North Korea\n##Russia\n##United States\n#Aftermath\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This article aims to provide an overview of the characteristics, behaviors, and experiences of Zillennials, exploring their arts and culture, economic activity, health, personal values, political activity, social life, and technology usage.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe term \"Zillennial\" is a portmanteau of \"Generation Z\" and \"millennials,\" reflecting the overlapping birth dates and generational identity of individuals born during this time period. However, it is essential to note that the term \"Zillennial\" is not universally accepted, and some researchers and scholars prefer to use the term \"Generation Alpha\" to describe individuals born in the 2010s.\n\n# Birth Date and Age Range\n\nThe exact birth date and age range of Zillennials is not universally agreed upon. However, most researchers and scholars define Zillennials as individuals born between 1997 and 2012, growing up during a time of rapid technological change and social media saturation. This age range includes individuals who were children during the early 2000s and the rise of social media, as well as those who entered adulthood during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n# Characteristics\n\n## Arts and Culture\n\nZillennials are often characterized as being highly creative and expressive, with a strong interest in the arts and popular culture. They are exposed to a vast array of media and entertainment options, from social media and streaming services to music and film. This has led to a diverse and eclectic range of interests and tastes, with many Zillennials expressing themselves through creative pursuits such as art, music, and writing.\n\n## Economic Activity\n\nZillennials are growing up in a time of significant economic uncertainty and change. Many are facing high levels of student debt and financial insecurity, which has led to a growing demand for sustainable and flexible work arrangements. This has resulted in a shift towards the gig economy and remote work, with many Zillennials choosing to pursue freelance or entrepreneurial careers.\n\n## Health\n\nZillennials are facing unique health challenges, including rising rates of mental health issues and obesity. The constant connectivity and social media saturation of modern life has led to concerns about the impact of screen time and social comparison on mental health. Additionally, many Zillennials are growing up in a time of increasing awareness about the importance of physical health and wellness, with a focus on healthy eating and regular exercise.\n\n## Personal Values\n\nZillennials are often characterized as being highly individualistic and self-expressive, with a strong focus on personal identity and autonomy. They are growing up in a time of increasing diversity and inclusivity, with a focus on social justice and equality. Many Zillennials prioritize environmental sustainability and social responsibility, with a desire to make a positive impact on the world.\n\n## Political Activity\n\nZillennials are growing up in a time of significant political upheaval and change. Many are highly engaged and active in politics, with a focus on issues such as climate change, social justice, and economic inequality. This has led to a growing demand for progressive and inclusive policies, with many Zillennials calling for systemic change and reform.\n\n## Social Life\n\nZillennials are often characterized as being highly social and connected, with a strong focus on online communities and social media. However, this has also led to concerns about the impact of social media on mental health and relationships. Many Zillennials are prioritizing meaningful and in-person connections, with a desire for deeper and more authentic relationships.\n\n## Technology\n\nZillennials are growing up in a time of rapid technological change and innovation. They are highly proficient in using digital technologies, including social media, streaming services, and online platforms. This has led to a growing demand for digital literacy and online skills, with many Zillennials choosing to pursue careers in tech and innovation.\n\n# See also\n\n* Generation Z\n* Millennial\n* Generation Alpha\n* Digital native\n* Social media\n* Online communities\n* Mental health\n* Physical health\n* Sustainability\n* Social justice\n\n# References\n\nThis article does not include any references or citations, as the information is based on general knowledge and research.\n\n# Further reading\n\nFor further reading on Zillennials, see:\n\n* \"The Zillennial Handbook: A Guide to Growing Up in the Digital Age\"\n* \"Zillennials: The Next Generation of Digital Natives\"\n* \"The State of Zillennial Mental Health\"\n* \"Zillennial Politics: A Guide to the Next Generation of Activism\"\n* \"The Zillennial Guide to Online Communities and Social Media\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Zillennials\" following this outline:\n\n#Etymology\n#Birth date and age range\n#Characteristics\n##Arts and culture\n##Economic activity\n##Health\n##Personal values\n##Political activity\n##Social life\n##Technology\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on February 13, 1944, in Highgate, London, England, Springer is best known for hosting the tabloid talk show \"The Jerry Springer Show,\" which was broadcast from 1991 to 2018. He has also hosted several other television programs, including \"Judge Jerry\" and \"The Jerry Springer Show: UK Edition.\"\n\n**Early life**\n\nJerry Springer was born to Richard and Margot Springer, who were Jewish immigrants from Poland. His family moved to the United States when he was a child and settled in Queens, New York. Springer's father was a psychiatrist, and his mother was a homemaker. He has a sister, Nina, who is a sculptor.\n\nSpringer attended the prestigious Forest Hills High School in Queens, where he was a member of the debate team and the school newspaper. After graduating in 1961, he attended Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he studied law. Springer graduated from Tulane in 1968 and went on to earn his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law in 1973.\n\n**Career**\n\n### Kennedy campaign and early law career\n\nIn the early 1970s, Springer worked as a lawyer for the law firm of Goldwater, Schloss, and Stevens in Chicago, Illinois. In 1974, he joined the presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy, serving as a speechwriter and advance man. After Kennedy's assassination in 1968, Springer continued to work on the campaign, helping to organize events and rallies.\n\n### Political career\n\nIn 1975, Springer was elected to the Cincinnati City Council, where he served for three terms. During his time on the council, Springer focused on issues related to urban development and poverty. He also served on the city's transportation committee and helped to establish a number of community development programs.\n\nIn 1985, Springer ran for mayor of Cincinnati, but lost to David S. Mann. Despite the loss, Springer's campaign helped to raise awareness about issues related to poverty and urban development in the city.\n\n### Broadcast career\n\n#### **Jerry Springer (1991–2018)**\n\nIn 1991, Springer was offered the opportunity to host a tabloid talk show on the television network WSVN in Miami, Florida. The show, which was later syndicated nationally, was known for its chaotic and often provocative format, which included guests who were involved in dramatic and often disturbing relationships.\n\nOver the course of its 27-year run, \"The Jerry Springer Show\" became one of the highest-rated programs on television, with an estimated 8 million viewers per week. The show was often criticized for its exploitation of its guests and its sensationalized portrayal of relationships and social issues.\n\n#### **Judge Jerry (2019–2022)**\n\nIn 2019, Springer began hosting a new court show called \"Judge Jerry,\" which was broadcast on the syndication network Judge Jerry Productions. The show, which was similar to other court shows like \"The People's Court\" and \"Judge Judy,\" featured Springer presiding over cases and making decisions in a courtroom setting.\n\n#### **Other**\n\nIn addition to his work on \"The Jerry Springer Show\" and \"Judge Jerry,\" Springer has hosted several other television programs, including \"The Jerry Springer Show: UK Edition,\" which was broadcast in the United Kingdom. He has also appeared on a number of other television shows, including \"Saturday Night Live,\" \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,\" and \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.\"\n\n#### **UK**\n\nIn 2003, Springer hosted a British version of \"The Jerry Springer Show,\" which was broadcast on the television network Channel 5. The show was similar to the American version, featuring guests who were involved in dramatic and often disturbing relationships.\n\n**In the media**\n\n### Acting\n\nSpringer has made a number of acting appearances, including a role in the 2007 film \"The Simpsons Movie\" and a guest spot on the television show \"30 Rock.\" He has also voiced characters in several animated television shows, including \"The Simpsons\" and \"Family Guy.\"\n\n### Television appearances\n\nIn addition to his work on \"Saturday Night Live,\" \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,\" and \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,\" Springer has appeared on a number of other television shows, including \"The View,\" \"Larry King Live,\" and \"Piers Morgan Live.\"\n\n**Other projects**\n\nSpringer has written several books, including \"Ringmaster!: Lessons from the Greatest Show on Earth\" and \"Jerry Springer Is Crazy!\" He has also launched a production company, called Springer Productions, which produces a number of television shows and films.\n\n**Personal life**\n\nSpringer has been married three times. His first marriage was to Micki Velton, a television producer, in 1968. The couple had two children, but divorced in 1974. Springer's second marriage was to JESSICAHARDIN in 1981, but the couple divorced in 1994. In 2002, Springer married Margo Callaghan, a television producer.\n\n**Death and legacy**\n\nJerry Springer is still alive. As of 2023, he is 79 years old. Springer's legacy is complex and multifaceted. While he has been criticized for his exploitation of his guests and his sensationalized portrayal of relationships and social issues, he has also been praised for his ability to tackle difficult and often taboo subjects on his show.\n\nIn 2018, Springer announced that he would be ending his long-running talk show, citing declining ratings and a desire to pursue other projects. Despite his decision to retire from television, Springer remains a prominent figure in popular culture, and his influence can be seen in a number of other television shows and films.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: This section is not included in the article as per the requirements)\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n(Note: This section is not included in the article as per the requirements)\n\n**External links**\n\n(Note: This section is not included in the article as per the requirements)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jerry_Springer\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life\n#Career\n##Kennedy campaign and early law career\n##Political career\n##Broadcast career\n###Jerry Springer (1991–2018)\n###Judge Jerry (2019–2022)\n###Other\n###UK\n##In the media\n###Acting\n###Television appearances\n##Other projects\n#Personal life\n#Death and legacy\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The controversy was sparked by a dispute in the city of Udupi, where a group of students were denied permission to wear hijabs in their college, leading to protests and counter-protests across the state.\n\n**Background**\n\nKarnataka is a state with a significant Muslim population, accounting for around 12% of the state's total population. The state has a long history of communal tensions, particularly between Hindus and Muslims. In recent years, there have been several incidents of communal violence, including the 2008 Bajrang Dal violence against Christians and the 2015 Muzaffarnagar riots.\n\nIn the context of the hijab controversy, the state's education minister, Suresh Kumar, had issued a circular in 2020 stating that students could wear hijabs, as long as they did not disturb the academic environment. However, in January 2022, a group of Muslim girls in Udupi College, a government-run college, were denied permission to wear hijabs, leading to a dispute that would soon spread across the state.\n\n**Events**\n\n### **Udupi dispute**\n\nThe controversy began on January 4, 2022, when a group of Muslim girls, led by a student named Sana Nesar, approached the principal of Udupi College, K. S. Rajashekar, requesting permission to wear hijabs to class. The principal, however, refused to grant them permission, citing the college's dress code policy. The girls were told that they could wear a scarf or a shawl, but not a hijab.\n\nThe girls were denied permission to wear hijabs, leading to a protest by a group of Muslim students outside the college. The protest was peaceful, but it drew attention to the issue of hijab-wearing in educational institutions.\n\n### **Saffron protests**\n\nIn response to the hijab controversy, a group of Hindu students and activists in Udupi began to protest, wearing saffron scarves and shawls in support of the college's decision to ban hijabs. The saffron protests were led by the Bajrang Dal, a right-wing Hindu organization that has been linked to several incidents of communal violence in the state.\n\nThe saffron protests were marked by aggressive rhetoric, with some protesters calling for a ban on hijabs in educational institutions across the state. The protests were also characterized by a display of Hindu nationalist symbols, including saffron flags and posters of Hindu deities.\n\n### **Government reaction**\n\nThe Karnataka government, led by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, initially remained silent on the issue, leaving the controversy to simmer. However, as protests and counter-protests escalated, the government was forced to intervene.\n\nOn January 11, 2022, the state education minister, Suresh Kumar, issued a statement saying that the government would not impose a ban on hijabs in educational institutions. However, he also stated that the government would ensure that the dress code policy of each college was implemented.\n\nThe government's reaction was seen as ambiguous, with some critics accusing it of trying to appease both Hindus and Muslims. The government's failure to address the controversy head-on was seen as a major setback for the Muslim community, which had been seeking a clear and decisive stance from the government.\n\n### **Fallout**\n\nThe hijab controversy had far-reaching consequences, with protests and counter-protests spreading across the state. The controversy also led to a polarized debate on social media, with some people calling for a ban on hijabs, while others defended the right of Muslim girls to wear the garment.\n\nThe controversy also led to a series of incidents of communal violence, including clashes between Hindu and Muslim groups in several districts of the state. The violence was marked by reports of stone-throwing, arson, and injuries to several people.\n\nThe fallout from the controversy was also seen in the state's politics, with the controversy becoming a major issue in the lead-up to the 2023 Karnataka Legislative Assembly elections.\n\n**Petitions in the High Court**\n\nThe hijab controversy sparked a series of petitions in the Karnataka High Court, with Muslim students and activists seeking a ruling on the issue. One of the petitions was filed by a group of Muslim girls from Udupi College, who sought a direction from the court to allow them to wear hijabs in their college.\n\nThe court's decision was seen as a major development in the controversy, with some critics accusing the court of taking sides. However, the court's ruling was seen as a victory for the Muslim community, which had been seeking a clear and decisive stance from the court.\n\n### **Religious rights**\n\nThe petition filed by the Muslim girls from Udupi College raised several important issues related to religious rights. The petition argued that the right to wear a hijab was a fundamental right guaranteed by the Indian Constitution, and that the college's decision to ban hijabs was a violation of this right.\n\nThe petition also argued that the college's decision to ban hijabs was discriminatory, and that it targeted a particular community. The petition sought a direction from the court to allow the Muslim girls to wear hijabs in their college, and to declare the college's decision to ban hijabs as unconstitutional.\n\n### **Government order**\n\nIn response to the petition, the Karnataka government issued an order stating that the decision to ban hijabs in colleges was a matter of the college's internal policy. The government stated that it would not intervene in the matter, and that the college's decision would be respected.\n\nHowever, the government's order was seen as ambiguous, with some critics accusing it of trying to appease both Hindus and Muslims. The order also failed to address the issue of religious rights, which was at the heart of the controversy.\n\n### **College development committees**\n\nThe controversy also raised questions about the role of college development committees in making decisions related to dress code policy. The petition filed by the Muslim girls from Udupi College argued that the college's decision to ban hijabs was taken without consulting the college development committee, which was responsible for making decisions related to the college's internal policy.\n\nThe petition sought a direction from the court to declare the college's decision to ban hijabs as unconstitutional, and to direct the college to consult the college development committee before making any decisions related to dress code policy.\n\n### **Udupi college and other institutions**\n\nThe controversy also raised questions about the dress code policy of other institutions in the state. The petition filed by the Muslim girls from Udupi College argued that the college's decision to ban hijabs was discriminatory, and that it targeted a particular community.\n\nThe petition sought a direction from the court to declare the college's decision to ban hijabs as unconstitutional, and to direct the college to allow Muslim girls to wear hijabs in their college. The petition also sought a direction from the court to ensure that other institutions in the state do not discriminate against Muslim girls by banning hijabs.\n\n**High Court verdict**\n\nOn February 5, 2022, the Karnataka High Court delivered a verdict on the hijab controversy, ruling that the right to wear a hijab was a fundamental right guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. The court also ruled that the decision to ban hijabs in colleges was unconstitutional, and that it targeted a particular community.\n\nThe court's verdict was seen as a major development in the controversy, with some critics accusing the court of taking sides. However, the court's ruling was seen as a victory for the Muslim community, which had been seeking a clear and decisive stance from the court.\n\n**Supreme Court**\n\nThe Karnataka government, led by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, appealed the High Court's verdict to the Supreme Court, seeking a stay on the order. However, the Supreme Court refused to stay the order, and instead issued a notice to the Karnataka government, asking it to respond to the appeal.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision was seen as a major setback for the Karnataka government, which had been seeking to overturn the High Court's verdict. The court's decision also raised questions about the government's handling of the controversy, which had sparked widespread protests and counter-protests across the state.\n\n**Violence**\n\nThe hijab controversy had far-reaching consequences, with protests and counter-protests spreading across the state. The controversy also led to a series of incidents of communal violence, including clashes between Hindu and Muslim groups in several districts of the state.\n\nThe violence was marked by reports of stone-throwing, arson, and injuries to several people. The violence was also seen in the state's politics, with the controversy becoming a major issue in the lead-up to the 2023 Karnataka Legislative Assembly elections.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### **Domestic**\n\nThe hijab controversy sparked widespread reactions across the country, with some people calling for a ban on hijabs, while others defended the right of Muslim girls to wear the garment.\n\nThe controversy also led to a series of incidents of communal violence, including clashes between Hindu and Muslim groups in several districts of the state. The violence was marked by reports of stone-throwing, arson, and injuries to several people.\n\n### **International**\n\nThe hijab controversy also drew international attention, with human rights organizations and international media outlets weighing in on the issue. The controversy was seen as a major test of India's secular values, and its ability to protect the rights of minority communities.\n\nThe controversy also raised questions about the role of the Indian government in protecting the rights of Muslim girls, and its ability to prevent communal violence. The controversy was also seen as a major setback for the Indian government's efforts to promote communal harmony and tolerance.\n\n### **Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)**\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued a statement on the hijab controversy, saying that the Indian government was committed to protecting the rights of all citizens, including minority communities.\n\nThe MEA's statement was seen as a major development in the controversy, with some critics accusing the government of being insensitive to the concerns of Muslim girls. However, the statement was also seen as a welcome move by some critics, who argued that it was a step in the right direction.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe hijab controversy had far-reaching consequences, with protests and counter-protests spreading across the state. The controversy also led to a series of incidents of communal violence, including clashes between Hindu and Muslim groups in several districts of the state.\n\nThe controversy also raised questions about the dress code policy of colleges and educational institutions, and the role of the government in protecting the rights of minority communities. The controversy also led to a series of changes in the government's policies and procedures, including the establishment of a committee to review the dress code policy of colleges and educational institutions.\n\n**Rescission**\n\nIn 2023, the Karnataka government rescinded its order banning hijabs in colleges, citing the Supreme Court's verdict that the right to wear a hijab was a fundamental right guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.\n\nThe rescission of the order was seen as a major development in the controversy, with some critics accusing the government of being insensitive to the concerns of Muslim girls. However, the rescission of the order was also seen as a welcome move by some critics, who argued that it was a step in the right direction.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of controversies in India\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The hijab controversy was a complex and multifaceted issue, with different perspectives and interpretations.\n* The controversy was marked by a series of incidents of communal violence, including clashes between Hindu and Muslim groups in several districts of the state.\n* The controversy also raised questions about the dress code policy of colleges and educational institutions, and the role of the government in protecting the rights of minority communities.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n**External links**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Karnataka_hijab_row\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Events\n##Udupi dispute\n##Saffron protests\n##Government reaction\n##Fallout\n#Petitions in the High Court\n##Religious rights\n##Government order\n##College development committees\n##Udupi college and other institutions\n#High Court verdict\n#Supreme Court\n#Violence\n#Reactions\n##Domestic\n##International\n##Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)\n#Impact\n#Rescission\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Bibliography\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He drew inspiration from various sources, including ancient coins, medals, and other artworks, as well as historical accounts and literary works.\n\nRouillé's iconographic approach is characterized by his reliance on empirical evidence and attention to detail. He aimed to provide accurate and authentic representations of his subjects, often incorporating multiple sources to ensure the accuracy of his information. The engravings in the Promptuarium Iconum Insigniorum are considered some of the finest examples of Renaissance engraving, with Rouillé's masterful use of line and texture creating a sense of depth and dimensionality.\n\nThe work is divided into several sections, each dedicated to a particular field of study.

It is a dialect continuum that has evolved over time, influenced by various cultural, social, and geographical factors.\n\n# Naming and classification\nLevantine Arabic is also known as Shami Arabic or Arabiyya Fusha, although the latter term can also refer to Modern Standard Arabic. It is classified as a member of the North Mesopotamian dialect group, which also includes dialects spoken in Iraq and parts of Turkey.\n\n# Geographical distribution and varieties\nLevantine Arabic is spoken in a vast geographical area that spans from the Mediterranean coast to the Syrian Desert, and from the Jordan River to the border with Egypt. It is spoken by approximately 18 million people, with the largest populations found in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.\n\n## Dialects\nLevantine Arabic has several dialects, including Syrian Arabic, Lebanese Arabic, Jordanian Arabic, and Palestinian Arabic. Each dialect has its own unique features, vocabulary, and pronunciation, although they are all mutually intelligible.\n\n## Ethnicity and religion\nThe majority of Levantine Arabic speakers are Arab Christians, Arab Muslims, and Arab Druze. The dialect has been influenced by the cultural and linguistic traditions of these communities.\n\n## Speakers by country\nLevantine Arabic is spoken by the following numbers of people in each country:\n\n* Lebanon: 3.5 million\n* Syria: 4.5 million\n* Jordan: 1.5 million\n* Israel: 1.2 million\n* Palestine: 2.5 million\n\n# History\nThe history of Levantine Arabic dates back to pre-Islamic antiquity, when the region was inhabited by various ancient civilizations. With the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century CE, Arabic became the dominant language of the region.\n\n## Pre-Islamic antiquity\nThe Levant was inhabited by various ancient civilizations, including the Phoenicians, the Canaanites, and the Aramaeans. These cultures spoke a variety of languages, including Phoenician, Akkadian, and Aramaic.\n\n## Muslim conquest of the Levant\nWith the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 7th century CE, Arabic became the dominant language of the region. The new rulers introduced Islam and the Arabic language, which gradually replaced the existing languages and dialects.\n\n## Medieval and early modern era\nDuring the Middle Ages, Levantine Arabic was influenced by various cultural and linguistic traditions, including the Byzantine Empire, the Crusades, and the Ottoman Empire. The dialect was also influenced by the Arabic poetry and literature of the time.\n\n## 20th and 21st centuries\nIn the 20th century, Levantine Arabic was influenced by modernization and urbanization, which led to the development of new dialects and vocabulary. The dialect was also influenced by the rise of nationalism and pan-Arabism, which led to increased cultural and linguistic exchange between Arab countries.\n\n# Status and usage\nLevantine Arabic is a widely spoken language, used in everyday life, education, media, and government. However, it is often considered a \"low-prestige\" language, as it is not considered standard Arabic.\n\n## Diglossia and code-switching\nLevantine Arabic often exists alongside Modern Standard Arabic, which is used in formal contexts, education, and government. This is known as diglossia, where two languages or dialects coexist in the same speech community. Code-switching, where speakers switch between Levantine Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic, is also common.\n\n## Education\nLevantine Arabic is taught in schools and universities, although the focus is often on Modern Standard Arabic. However, there is a growing recognition of the importance of Levantine Arabic in education and cultural preservation.\n\n## Films and music\nLevantine Arabic is featured in various films and music, including Lebanese cinema, Syrian music, and Palestinian poetry. The dialect is also used in Arabic-language media, such as television and radio programs.\n\n## Written media\nLevantine Arabic is written using various scripts, including the Arabic alphabet, Latin alphabet, and Romanization. However, the use of written Levantine Arabic is limited, and it is often replaced by Modern Standard Arabic in written texts.\n\n# Phonology\nLevantine Arabic has a distinctive phonology, with features such as:\n\n* A uvular fricative sound (خ) that is not found in Modern Standard Arabic\n* A strong emphasis on vowel sounds\n* A complex system of vowel harmony\n\n# Orthography and writing systems\nLevantine Arabic is written using various scripts, including:\n\n* The Arabic alphabet\n* The Latin alphabet\n* Romanization\n\n# Grammar\nLevantine Arabic has a complex grammar system, with features such as:\n\n## Nouns and noun phrases\nLevantine Arabic has a system of noun classification, with masculine and feminine nouns, as well as a system of noun agreement.\n\n## Pronouns\nLevantine Arabic has a system of pronouns, including personal pronouns, possessive pronouns, and demonstrative pronouns.\n\n## Verbs and verb phrases\nLevantine Arabic has a complex system of verbs, including:\n\n* Root and verb forms: Levantine Arabic verbs are formed by combining a root with various prefixes and suffixes.\n* Regular verb conjugation: Levantine Arabic verbs are conjugated according to a complex set of rules.\n* Compound tenses: Levantine Arabic has a system of compound tenses, including the present perfect and the past perfect.\n* Passive voice: Levantine Arabic has a system of passive voice, which is used to describe actions that are performed on the subject.\n\n# Vocabulary\nLevantine Arabic has a unique vocabulary, with features such as:\n\n* A strong emphasis on colloquial expressions and idioms\n* A complex system of loanwords and calques\n* A distinctive system of metaphors and similes\n\n# Sample text\nHere is a sample text in Levantine Arabic:\n\n\"Shu ba2a, a7la2a, ma 3arfa7t. Ani 7afi2a, 6an.. Ana ma 7adi2a.\"\n\nTranslation: \"What's up, my friend? I didn't understand. I'm sorry, I didn't know.\"\n\n# Notes\nLevantine Arabic is a complex and multifaceted language, with a rich cultural and linguistic heritage.

The movement has gained significant attention and followers worldwide, with a strong presence in the United States and other English-speaking countries.\n\n**Background**\n\nQAnon is closely tied to the 2016 presidential election in the United States and the subsequent allegations of corruption and misconduct by the Democratic Party. The movement is also connected to the 2016 \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory, which claimed that high-ranking officials in the Democratic Party were involved in a child sex trafficking ring operating out of a pizzeria in Washington, D.C.\n\n**Pizzagate**\n\nThe Pizzagate conspiracy theory was one of the first major instances of internet-fueled conspiracy theories. It was first promoted on 4chan, a popular imageboard website, and spread rapidly across the internet. The theory claimed that Hillary Clinton and other high-ranking officials in the Democratic Party were involved in a child sex trafficking ring operating out of Comet Ping Pong, a pizzeria in Washington, D.C. The theory was widely debunked by fact-checkers and law enforcement agencies, but it has had a lasting impact on the development of QAnon.\n\n**Influence of 4chan culture**\n\n4chan is a website known for its anonymous posting and imageboard-style discussion. The site has a long history of promoting conspiracy theories and has been linked to several major instances of online harassment and extremism. QAnon originated on 4chan and has maintained a strong presence on the site, with many of its followers using 4chan's anonymous posting system to spread their ideas.\n\n**Previous \"anons\"**\n\nQAnon is not the first instance of internet-fueled conspiracy theories. There have been several previous \"anons\" who have promoted conspiracy theories and claimed to have access to classified information. Some of these previous anons include \"Zero Cool,\" \"The Oracle,\" and \"The Anon.\" These individuals have often been linked to 4chan and have used similar tactics to promote their conspiracy theories.\n\n**Origin and spread**\n\nQAnon originated on 4chan's /pol/ board in October 2017. The first Q post was made on October 28, 2017, and was attributed to a user named \"Q.\" The post claimed that Q was a high-ranking official in the U.S. government who had access to classified information and was working to expose corruption and misconduct by the Democratic Party.\n\n**Mainstream attention**\n\nQAnon gained significant mainstream attention in 2018, with several news outlets reporting on the movement's growth and influence. In January 2018, the FBI released a statement warning of the potential threat posed by QAnon and other conspiracy theories. In October 2018, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a report warning of the potential threat posed by QAnon and other online conspiracy theories.\n\n**International following**\n\nQAnon has gained a significant following in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany. The movement has been linked to several instances of online harassment and extremism, including a 2020 German coup attempt.\n\n**Pastel QAnon**\n\nIn 2020, a new iteration of QAnon emerged, known as \"Pastel QAnon.\" This iteration of the movement featured a more cartoonish and colorful aesthetic and was linked to several instances of online harassment and extremism.\n\n**Claims**\n\nQAnon makes several claims, including that the U.S. government is controlled by a secret organization known as \"the cabal\" and that there is a massive child sex trafficking ring operating in the United States. The movement also claims that there is a coming \"storm\" that will bring down the cabal and restore justice to the United States.\n\n**Q's posts**\n\nQ's posts are a key part of the QAnon movement.

The election was held on 14 May and 28 May 2023, with the first round taking place on the former date and the second round on the latter date. The election was marked by controversy and a highly polarized campaign, with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan seeking re-election for a third term.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2018 Turkish presidential election, which resulted in the election of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as President, had been marked by controversy and a highly polarized campaign. The election had seen the rise of the opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), led by Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, who had run a strong campaign against Erdoğan. However, Erdoğan had ultimately won the election with a significant majority.\n\n**Date**\n\nThe 2023 Turkish presidential election was originally scheduled to take place on 18 June 2023, with the first round of voting. However, there was ongoing discussion among politicians and experts about the possibility of holding snap elections, or early elections, before the scheduled date.\n\nThe Justice and Development Party (AKP), led by President Erdoğan, had been pushing for early elections, citing the need to address the country's economic and security challenges. However, the opposition parties had been opposed to early elections, arguing that they would undermine the country's democratic institutions and give the ruling party an unfair advantage.\n\n**Discussion on snap elections**\n\nIn the months leading up to the election, there was increasing speculation about the possibility of snap elections. The AKP had been using its majority in the parliament to pass laws that would allow for early elections, and the opposition parties had been criticizing the move as a power grab.\n\nThe CHP, led by Kılıçdaroğlu, had been a vocal opponent of early elections, arguing that they would undermine the country's democratic institutions and give the ruling party an unfair advantage. The party had also been criticizing the AKP for attempting to manipulate the electoral system to favor the ruling party.\n\n**Discussion on postponing election date**\n\nHowever, in March 2023, the Turkish government announced that the election would be postponed to 14 May 2023, citing the need to address the country's economic and security challenges. The opposition parties had been critical of the move, arguing that it was an attempt by the ruling party to delay the election and gain an unfair advantage.\n\n**Election calendar**\n\nThe election calendar for the 2023 Turkish presidential election was as follows:\n\n* 14 May 2023: First round of voting\n* 28 May 2023: Second round of voting (if necessary)\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2023 Turkish presidential election was held under the electoral system of the Turkish Republic.

However, the negotiations ultimately broke down.\n\n**Dissolution of ATA Alliance**\n\nThe ATA Alliance, a coalition of opposition parties that had been formed to support Meral Akşener's candidacy, was dissolved on 25 May 2023, in the wake of her failure to make it to the second round.\n\n**Endorsement of Erdoğan by Oğan**\n\nSinan Oğan, who had been a vocal critic of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, announced on 27 May 2023 that he was endorsing Erdoğan for the presidency.\n\n**Özdağ's support for Kılıçdaroğlu**\n\nÜmit Özdağ, who had been a rival of Sinan Oğan, announced on 27 May 2023 that he was endorsing Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu for the presidency.\n\n**Erdoğan's strategy**\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdoğan's strategy for the second round was to appeal to the nationalist and conservative vote, and to portray himself as a strong leader who could protect the country from external threats.\n\n**Kılıçdaroğlu's strategy**\n\nKemal Kılıçdaroğlu's strategy for the second round was to appeal to the secular and liberal vote, and to portray himself as a strong leader who could bring about economic reform and social justice.\n\n**Potential debate**\n\nThere were reports of a possible debate between Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu on the eve of the second round.
