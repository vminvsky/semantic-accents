{"title": "Delhi", "content": "\nToponym\nThere are a number of myths and legends associated with the origin of the name Delhi One of them is derived from Dhillu or Dilu, a king who built a city at this location in 50 BCE and named it after himself [27] [28] [29] Another legend holds that the name of the city is based on the Prakrit word dhili (loose) and that it was used by the Tomaras to refer to the city because the iron pillar of Delhi had a weak foundation and had to be moved [29] According to Panjab Notes and Queries, the name of the city at the time of King Prithviraj was dilpat, and that dilpat and dilli are probably derived from the old Hindi word dil meaning \"eminence\" The former director of the Archaeological Survey of India, Alexander Cunningham, mentioned that dilli later became dihli/dehli [30] Some suggest the coins in circulation in the region under the Tomaras were called dehliwal [31] According to the Bhavishya Purana, King Prithiviraja of Indraprastha built a new fort in the modern-day Purana Qila area for the convenience of all four castes in his kingdom He ordered the construction of a gateway to the fort and later named the fort dehali [32] Some historians believe that Dhilli or Dhillika is the original name for the city while others believe the name could be a corruption of the Hindustani words dehleez or dehali—both terms meaning \"threshold\" or \"gateway\"—and symbolic of the city as a gateway to the Gangetic Plain [33] [34]\n\n\nHistory\n Traditionally seven cities have been associated with the region of Delhi The earliest, Indraprastha, is part of a literary description in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata (composed c 400 BCE to 300 CE but describing an earlier time [40]) which situates a city on a knoll on the banks of the river Yamuna According to art historian Catherine B Asher, the topographical description of the Mahabharata matches the area of Purana Qila, a 14th-century CE fort of the Delhi sultanate, but the analogy does not go much further Whereas the Mahabharata speaks of a beautifully decorated city with surrounding fortifications, the excavations have yielded \"uneven findings of painted grey pottery characteristic of the eleventh century BCE; no signs of a built environment, much fewer fortifications, have been revealed.\" [39]\n\n\nAncient and early medieval periods\n Traditionally seven cities have been associated with the region of Delhi The earliest, Indraprastha, is part of a literary description in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata (composed c 400 BCE to 300 CE but describing an earlier time [40]) which situates a city on a knoll on the banks of the river Yamuna According to art historian Catherine B Asher, the topographical description of the Mahabharata matches the area of Purana Qila, a

have yielded \"uneven findings of painted grey pottery characteristic of the eleventh century BCE; no signs of a built environment, much fewer fortifications, have been revealed.\" [39]\n\n\nLate medieval period\nPrithviraj Chauhan was defeated in 1192 by Muhammad Ghori in the second battle of Tarain Qutb-ud-din Aibak, was given the responsibility of governing the conquered territories of India after Ghori returned to his capital, Ghor When Ghori died without an heir in 1206 CE, Qutb-ud-din assumed control of Ghori's Indian possessions and laid the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mamluk dynasty He began construction of the Qutb Minar and Quwwat-al-Islam (Might of Islam) mosque, the earliest extant mosque in India It was his successor, Iltutmish (1211–1236), who consolidated the conquest of northern India [27] [41] At 72.5 m (238 ft), the Qutb Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Delhi, [42] was completed during the reign of Sultan Illtutmish in the 13th century Although its style has some similarities with the Jarkurgan minaret, it is more closely related to the Ghaznavid and Ghurid minarets of Central Asia [43] Razia, daughter of Iltutmish, became the Sultana of Delhi upon the former's death.\n\n\nEarly modern period\nIn 1526, Babur, a descendant of Genghis Khan and Timur from the Fergana Valley in modern-day Uzbekistan, invaded India and defeated the last Lodhi sultan in the First Battle of Panipat and founded the Mughal Empire that ruled from Delhi and Agra [27] The Mughal dynasty ruled Delhi for more than three centuries, with a sixteen-year hiatus during the reigns of Sher Shah Suri and Hemu from 1540 to 1556 [48] Shah Jahan built the seventh city of Delhi that bears his name Shahjahanabad, which served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1638 and is today known as the Old City or Old Delhi [49]\n\n\nColonial period\nIn 1803, during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the forces of British East India Company defeated the Maratha forces in the Battle of Delhi [57] During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Delhi fell to the forces of East India Company after a bloody fight known as the Siege of Delhi The city came under the direct control of the British Government in 1858 It was made a district province of the Punjab [27] In 1911, it was announced that the capital of British-held territories in India was to be transferred from Calcutta to Delhi [58] This formally transferred on 12 December 1911 [59]\n\n\nPartition and post-independence\nDuring the partition of India, around five hundred thousand Hindu and Sikh refugees, mainly from West Punjab fled to Delhi, while around three hundred thousand Muslim residents of the city migrated to Pakistan [64] [65] Ethnic Punjabis are believed to account for at least 40% of Delhi's total population and are predominantly Hindi-speaking Punjabi Hindus [66] [67] [68] Migration to Delhi from the rest of India continues (as of 2013 [update]), contributing more to the rise of Delhi's population than the birth rate, which is declining [69]\n\n\nGeography\nDelhi is located in Northern India, at 28°37′N 77°14′E﻿ / ﻿28.61°N 77.23°E﻿ / 28.61; 77.23 The city is bordered on its northern, western, and southern sides by the state of Haryana and to the east by that of Uttar Pradesh (UP) Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the Delhi ridge The Yamuna River was the historical boundary between Punjab and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but, are prone to recurrent floods The Yamuna, a sacred river in Hinduism, is the only major river flowing through Delhi The Hindon River separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi The Delhi ridge originates from the Aravalli Range in the south and encircles the west, northeast, and northwest parts of the city It reaches a height of 318 m (1,043 ft) and is a dominant feature of the region [80]\n\n\nClimate\nDelhi features a dry winter humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa) bordering a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen BSh) The warm season lasts from 21 March to 15 June with an average daily high temperature above 39 °C (102 °F) The hottest day of the year is usually witnessed between 26 and 30 May, with an average high of 42 °C (108 °F) and low of 27 °C (81 °F) [84] The cold season lasts from 26 November to 9 February with an average daily high temperature below 20 °C (68 °F) The coldest day of the year is usually witnessed between 1 and 10 January, with an average low of 6.9 °C (44.4 °F) and high of 19.3 °C (66.7 °F) [84] In early March, the wind direction changes from north-westerly to south-westerly From April to October the weather is hot The monsoon arrives at the end of June, along with an increase in humidity [citation needed] The brief, mild winter starts in late November, peaks in January and heavy fog often occurs [85] Delhi receives an average annual precipitation of 774.4 mm (30.49 in) [86]\n\n\nAir pollution\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), Delhi was the most polluted [106] city in the world in 2014 In 2016, WHO downgraded Delhi to eleventh-worst in the urban air quality database [107] However, as recently as 2022, data from the WHO and IQAir, alongside comprehensive research, ranked Delhi as the fourth most polluted city globally [108] According to one estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people every year [109] [110] [111] Air quality index is generally moderate (101–200) level between January and September, and then it drastically deteriorates to Very Poor (301–400), Severe (401–500) or Hazardous (500+) levels in three months between October and December, [112] [113] due to various factors including stubble burning (a type of biomass burning), fire crackers burning during Diwali and cold weather [114] [115] [116] During 2013–14, peak levels of fine particulate matter (PM) increased by about 44%, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions, construction work and crop burning in adjoining states [109] [117] [118] [119] It has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, PM2.5 considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms [120]\n\n\nCivic administration\nCurrently, the NCT of Delhi is made up of one division, 11 districts, 33 subdivisions, 59 census towns, and 300 villages [138]\nOn the other way, the NCT of Delhi is divided into three municipalities The boundaries of municipalities may be different from district boundaries:\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nAs a first-level administrative division, the National Capital Territory of Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly, Lieutenant Governor, the council of ministers, and Chief Minister Members of the legislative assembly are directly elected from territorial constituencies in the NCT The legislative assembly was abolished in 1956, after which direct federal control was implemented until it was re-established in 1993 The municipal corporation handles civic administration for the city as part of the Panchayati Raj Act The Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi, where both bodies are located The Parliament of India, the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace), Cabinet Secretariat, and the Supreme Court of India are located in the municipal district of New Delhi There are 70 assembly constituencies and seven Lok Sabha (Indian Parliament's lower house) constituencies in Delhi [147] [148]\n\n\nEconomy\nDelhi is the largest commercial center in northern India As of 2016 [update] recent estimates of the economy of the Delhi urban area have ranged from $370 billion to $400 billion (PPP metro GDP) ranking it either the most or second-most productive metro area of India [155] [156] The nominal GSDP of the NCT of Delhi for 2016–17 was estimated at ₹6,224 billion (US$75 billion), 13% higher than in 2015–16 [157] Oxford Economics Global Cities index 2024 ranked Delhi as best city in India and 108th best city in the world in Economics Category.\n\n\nUtility services\nDelhi's municipal water supply is managed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) As of June 2005 [update], it supplied 650 million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963 MGD [164] The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps At 240 MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage [164] Research on Delhi suggests that up to half of the city's water use is unofficial groundwater [165]In Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000 tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD [166] The daily domestic waste water production is 470 MGD and industrial waste water is 70 MGD [167] A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river [167]\n\n\nTransport\nIndira Gandhi International Airport, situated to the south-west of Delhi, is the main gateway for the city's domestic and international civilian air traffic In 2015–16, the airport handled more than 48 million passengers, [171] making it the busiest airport in India and South Asia Terminal 3, which cost ₹96.8 billion

of India Although a strong Punjabi Influence can be seen in language, Dress and Cuisine brought by the large number of refugees who came following the partition in 1947 the recent migration from other parts of India has made it a melting pot This is exemplified by many significant monuments in the city The Archaeological Survey of India recognises 1,200 heritage buildings [232] and 175 monuments as national heritage sites [233]\n\n\nFestivals\nDelhi's association and geographic proximity to the capital, New Delhi, has amplified the importance of national events and holidays like Republic Day, Independence Day (15 August) and Gandhi Jayanti On Independence Day, the Prime Minister addresses the nation from the Red Fort The Republic Day Parade is a large cultural and military parade

Located in the northern part of the country, Delhi is a major cultural, economic, and administrative hub. The city has been the center of power for various empires and dynasties, including the Mughal Empire, the British Raj, and the modern-day Indian government. Delhi's history, architecture, culture, and cuisine are all influenced by its strategic location and its role as a gateway between the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia.\n\nToponym\nThe name \"Delhi\" is derived from the word \"Dilli,\" which is a corruption of the Hindi word \"dil,\" meaning \"heart\" or \"eminance.\" According to legend, the city was founded by a king named Dhillu or Dilu, who built a city at this location in 50 BCE. Another legend holds that the name of the city is based on the Prakrit word \"dhili,\" which means \"loose\" or \"weak.\" This refers to the fact that the iron pillar of Delhi had a weak foundation and had to be moved.\n\nHistory\nTraditionally, seven cities have been associated with the region of Delhi. The earliest, Indraprastha, is part of a literary description in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata, which situates a city on a knoll on the banks of the river Yamuna. According to art historian Catherine B Asher, the topographical description of the Mahabharata matches the area of Purana Qila, a 14th-century CE fort of the Delhi Sultanate. However, the analogy does not go much further, as the Mahabharata speaks of a beautifully decorated city with surrounding fortifications, while the excavations have yielded uneven findings of painted grey pottery characteristic of the eleventh century BCE, with no signs of a built environment or fortifications.\n\nAncient and Early Medieval Periods\nThe ancient period of Delhi is marked by the establishment of the Indraprastha kingdom, which was founded by the Pandavas, the five brothers of the Mahabharata. The city was later conquered by the Tomaras, a Rajput dynasty, who built the Qutb Minar and the Quwwat-al-Islam mosque. The Sultanate period saw the rise of the Delhi Sultanate, which was founded by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, a Turkish slave general, in 1206 CE. He laid the foundation of the Sultanate and began construction of the Qutb Minar and the Quwwat-al-Islam mosque.\n\nLate Medieval Period\nDuring the late medieval period, Delhi was the center of the Delhi Sultanate, which was ruled by the Tughlaq dynasty. The Tughlaqs were a Turkish dynasty that ruled Delhi from 1320 to 1414 CE. They built several monuments in Delhi, including the Tughlaqabad Fort and the Tomb of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq. The Sultanate period also saw the rise of the Lodi dynasty, which ruled Delhi from 1451 to 1526 CE. The Lodis were a Pashtun dynasty that built several monuments in Delhi, including the Lodhi Garden and the Bara Gumbad.\n\nEarly Modern Period\nIn 1526, Babur, a descendant of Genghis Khan and Timur from the Fergana Valley in modern-day Uzbekistan, invaded India and defeated the last Lodhi sultan in the First Battle of Panipat and founded the Mughal Empire that ruled from Delhi and Agra. The Mughal dynasty ruled Delhi for more than three centuries, with a sixteen-year hiatus during the reigns of Sher Shah Suri and Hemu from 1540 to 1556 CE. Shah Jahan built the seventh city of Delhi that bears his name, Shahjahanabad, which served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1638 CE and is today known as the Old City or Old Delhi.\n\nColonial Period\nIn 1803, during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the forces of British East India Company defeated the Maratha forces in the Battle of Delhi. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Delhi fell to the forces of East India Company after a bloody fight known as the Siege of Delhi. The city came under the direct control of the British Government in 1858 CE. It was made a district province of the Punjab.\n\nPartition and Post-Independence\nDuring the partition of India, around five hundred thousand Hindu and Sikh refugees, mainly from West Punjab, fled to Delhi, while around three hundred thousand Muslim residents of the city migrated to Pakistan. Ethnic Punjabis are believed to account for at least 40% of Delhi's total population and are predominantly Hindi-speaking Punjabi Hindus.\n\nGeography\nDelhi is located in Northern India, at 28°37′N 77°14′E. The city is bordered on its northern, western, and southern sides by the state of Haryana and to the east by the state of Uttar Pradesh. Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the Delhi ridge. The Yamuna River was the historical boundary between Punjab and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but are prone to recurrent floods.\n\nClimate\nDelhi features a dry winter humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa) bordering a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen BSh). The warm season lasts from 21 March to 15 June with an average daily high temperature above 39°C. The hottest day of the year is usually witnessed between 26 and 30 May, with an average high of 42°C and low of 27°C. The cold season lasts from 26 November to 9 February with an average daily high temperature below 20°C. The coldest day of the year is usually witnessed between 1 and 10 January, with an average low of 6.9°C and high of 19.3°C.\n\nAir Pollution\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), Delhi was the most polluted city in the world in 2014. In 2016, WHO downgraded Delhi to eleventh-worst in the urban air quality database. However, as recently as 2022, data from the WHO and IQAir, alongside comprehensive research, ranked Delhi as the fourth most polluted city globally. According to one estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people every year.\n\nCivic Administration\nCurrently, the NCT of Delhi is made up of one division, 11 districts, 33 subdivisions, 59 census towns, and 300 villages. On the other hand, the NCT of Delhi is divided into three municipalities. The boundaries of municipalities may be different from district boundaries.\n\nGovernment and Politics\nAs a first-level administrative division, the National Capital Territory of Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly, Lieutenant Governor, the council of ministers, and Chief Minister. Members of the legislative assembly are directly elected from territorial constituencies in the NCT. The legislative assembly was abolished in 1956, after which direct federal control was implemented until it was re-established in 1993. The municipal corporation handles civic administration for the city as part of the Panchayati Raj Act. The Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi, where both bodies are located.\n\nEconomy\nDelhi is the largest commercial center in northern India. As of 2016, recent estimates of the economy of the Delhi urban area have ranged from $370 billion to $400 billion (PPP metro GDP), ranking it either the most or second-most productive metro area of India. The nominal GSDP of the NCT of Delhi for 2016–17 was estimated at ₹6,224 billion (US$75 billion), 13% higher than in 2015–16.\n\nUtility Services\nDelhi's municipal water supply is managed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB). As of June 2005, it supplied 650 million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963 MGD. The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps.\n\nTransport\nIndira Gandhi International Airport, situated to the south-west of Delhi, is the main gateway for the city's domestic and international civilian air traffic. In 2015–16, the airport handled more than 48 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in India and South Asia. Terminal 3, which cost ₹96.8 billion (US$1.2 billion) to construct between 2007 and 2010, handles an additional 37 million passengers annually.\n\nRoad\nDelhi has the highest road density of 2103 km/100 km2 in India. It is connected to other parts of India by five National Highways: NH 1, NH 2, NH 8, NH 10, and NH 24. The majority of the city's roads, which are 60 ft (18 m) wide or above, are maintained by the Public Works Department (PWD), which is under the jurisdiction of the Government of Delhi.\n\nRailway\nDelhi is a major junction in the Indian railway network and is the headquarters of the Northern Railway. The main railway stations are New Delhi, Old Delhi, Hazrat Nizamuddin, Anand Vihar, Delhi Sarai Rohilla, and Delhi Cantt. The Delhi Metro, a mass rapid transit system built and operated by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), serves many parts of Delhi and the neighboring cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon, and Noida.\n\nMetro\nThe Delhi Metro is a rapid transit system serving Delhi, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon, and Noida in the National Capital Region of India. It is the world's tenth-largest metro system by length of lines. The network consists of 10 color-coded lines, serving 255 stations, with a total length of 348.12 kilometers (216.31 mi).\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2011 census of India, the population of the NCT of Delhi is 16,753,235. The corresponding population density was 11,297 persons per km2 with a sex ratio of 866 women per 1000 men, and a literacy rate of 86.34%. In 2004, the birth rate, death rate, and infant mortality rate per 1000 population were 20.03, 5.59, and 13.08, respectively.\n\nSlums\nAs of 2012, around 49% of the population of Delhi lives in slums and unauthorised colonies without any civic amenities. The majority of these slums have inadequate provisions to the basic facilities and according to a DUSIB report, almost 22% of people engage in open defecation.\n\nReligions\nHinduism is Delhi's predominant religious faith, with 81.68% of Delhi's population, followed by Islam (12.86%), Sikhism (3.40%), Jainism (0.99%), Christianity (0.87%), and Buddhism (0.11%). Other minority religions include Zoroastrianism, Baháʼísm, and Judaism.\n\nLanguages\nAccording to the 50th report of the commissioner for linguistic minorities in India, which was submitted in 2014, Hindi is Delhi's most spoken language, with 80.94% speakers, followed by Punjabi (7.14%), Urdu (6.31%), and Bengali (1.50%). 4.11% of Delhites speak other languages. Hindi is also the official language of Delhi, while Urdu and Punjabi have been declared as additional official languages.\n\nCulture\nDelhi's culture has been influenced by its lengthy history and historic association as the capital of India. Although a strong Punjabi influence can be seen in language, dress, and cuisine brought by the large number of refugees who came following the partition in 1947, the recent migration from other parts of India has made it a melting pot. This is exemplified by many significant monuments in the city. The Archaeological Survey of India recognizes 1,200 heritage buildings and 175 monuments as national heritage sites.\n\nFestivals\nDelhi's association and geographic proximity to the capital, New Delhi, has amplified the importance of national events and holidays like Republic Day, Independence Day (15 August), and Gandhi Jayanti. On Independence Day, the Prime Minister addresses the nation from the Red Fort. The Republic Day Parade is a large cultural and military parade showcasing India's cultural diversity and military strength.\n\nCuisine\nAs India's national capital and centuries-old Mughal capital, Delhi influenced the food habits of its residents and is where Mughlai cuisine originated. Along with Indian cuisine, a variety of international cuisines are popular among the residents. This variety of cuisines created a unique style of cooking which became popular throughout the world, with dishes such as kebab, biryani, tandoori. The city's classic dishes include butter chicken, dal makhani, shahi paneer, aloo chaat, chaat, dahi bhalla, kachori, gol gappe, samosa, chole bhature, chole kulche, gulab jamun, jalebi, and lassi.\n\nEducation\nPrivate schools in Delhi, which use either English or Hindi as the language of instruction, are affiliated to one of three administering bodies: the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), or the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). In 2004–05, approximately 1,529,000 students were enrolled in primary schools, 822,000 in middle schools, and 669,000 in secondary schools across Delhi. Female students represented 49% of the total enrollment. The same year, the Delhi government spent between 1.58% and 1.95% of its gross state domestic product on education.\n\nMedia\nAs the capital of India, Delhi is the focus of political reportage, including regular television broadcasts of Parliament sessions. Many national media agencies, including the state-owned Press Trust of India, Media Trust of India, and Doordarshan, are based in the city. Television programming includes two free terrestrial television channels offered by Doordarshan, and several Hindi, English, and regional-language cable channels offered by multi-system operators. Satellite television has yet to gain a large number of subscribers in the city.\n\nSports\nDelhi hosted the first Asian Games in 1951 from 4 to 11 March. A total of 489 athletes representing 11 Asian National Olympic Committees participated in 57 events from eight sports and disciplines. The Games was the successor of the Far Eastern Games and the revival of the Western Asiatic Games. On 13 February 1949, the Asian Games Federation was formally established in Delhi, with Delhi unanimously announced as the first host city of the Asian Games. National Stadium was the venue for all events. Over 40,000 spectators watched the opening ceremony of the Games in National Stadium.\n\nCity-based clubs\nThe city has several sports clubs, including:\n\n* Delhi Dynamos Football Club\n* Delhi Waveriders (field hockey)\n* Delhi Giants (cricket)\n* Delhi Capitals (cricket)\n\nSee also\n* History of Delhi\n* Culture of Delhi\n* Demographics of Delhi\n* Economy of Delhi\n* Cuisine of Delhi\n*

of the name Delhi One of them is derived from Dhillu or Dilu, a king who built a city at this location in 50 BCE and named it after himself [27] [28] [29] Another legend holds that the name of the city is based on the Prakrit word dhili (loose) and that it was used by the Tomaras to refer to the city because the iron pillar of Delhi had a weak foundation and had to be moved [29] According to Panjab Notes and Queries, the name of the city at the time of King Prithviraj was dilpat, and that dilpat and dilli are probably derived from the old Hindi word dil meaning \"eminence\" The former director of the Archaeological Survey of India, Alexander Cunningham, mentioned that dilli later became dihli/dehli [30] Some suggest the coins in circulation in the region under the Tomaras were called dehliwal [31] According to the Bhavishya Purana, King Prithiviraja of Indraprastha built a new fort in the modern-day Purana Qila area for the convenience of all four castes in his kingdom He ordered the construction of a gateway to the fort and later named the fort dehali [32] Some historians believe that Dhilli or Dhillika is the original name for the city while others believe the name could be a corruption of the Hindustani words dehleez or dehali—both terms meaning \"threshold\" or \"gateway\"—and symbolic of the city as a gateway to the Gangetic Plain [33] [34]\n\n\nHistory\n Traditionally seven cities have been associated with the region of Delhi The earliest, Indraprastha, is part of a literary description in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata (composed c 400 BCE to 300 CE but describing an earlier time [40]) which situates a city on a knoll on the banks of the river Yamuna According to art historian Catherine B Asher, the topographical description of the Mahabharata matches the area of Purana Qila, a 14th-century CE fort of the Delhi sultanate, but the analogy does not go much further Whereas the Mahabharata speaks of a beautifully decorated city with surrounding fortifications, the excavations have yielded \"uneven findings of painted grey pottery characteristic of the eleventh century BCE; no signs of a built environment, much fewer fortifications, have been revealed.\" [39]\n\n\nAncient and early medieval periods\n Traditionally seven cities have been associated with the region of Delhi The earliest, Indraprastha, is part of a literary description in the

Aibak, was given the responsibility of governing the conquered territories of India after Ghori returned to his capital, Ghor When Ghori died without an heir in 1206 CE, Qutb-ud-din assumed control of Ghori's Indian possessions and laid the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mamluk dynasty He began construction of the Qutb Minar and Quwwat-al-Islam (Might of Islam) mosque, the earliest extant mosque in India It was his successor, Iltutmish (1211–1236), who consolidated the conquest of northern India [27] [41] At 72.5 m (238 ft), the Qutb Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Delhi, [42] was completed during the reign of Sultan Illtutmish in the 13th century Although its style has some similarities with the Jarkurgan minaret, it is more closely related to the Ghaznavid and Ghurid minarets of Central Asia [43] Razia, daughter of Iltutmish, became the Sultana of Delhi upon the former's death.\n\n\nEarly modern period\nIn 1526, Babur, a descendant of Genghis Khan and Timur from the Fergana Valley in modern-day Uzbekistan, invaded India and defeated the last Lodhi sultan in the First Battle of Panipat and founded the Mughal Empire that ruled from Delhi and Agra [27] The

after a bloody fight known as the Siege of Delhi The city came under the direct control of the British Government in 1858 It was made a district province of the Punjab [27] In 1911, it was announced that the capital of British-held territories in India was to be transferred from Calcutta to Delhi [58] This formally transferred on 12 December 1911 [59]\n\n\nPartition and post-independence\nDuring the partition of India, around five hundred thousand Hindu and Sikh refugees, mainly from West Punjab fled to Delhi, while around three hundred thousand Muslim residents of the city migrated to Pakistan [64] [65] Ethnic Punjabis are believed to account for at least 40% of Delhi's total population and are predominantly Hindi-speaking Punjabi Hindus [66] [67] [68] Migration to Delhi from the rest of India continues (as of 2013 [update]), contributing more to the rise of Delhi's population than the birth rate, which is declining [69]\n\n\nGeography\nDelhi is located in Northern India, at 28°37′N 77°14′E﻿ / ﻿28.61°N 77.23°E﻿ / 28.61; 77.23 The city is bordered on its northern, western, and southern sides by the state of Haryana and to the east by that of Uttar Pradesh (UP) Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the Delhi ridge The Yamuna River was the historical boundary between Punjab and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but, are prone to recurrent floods The Yamuna, a sacred river in Hinduism, is the only major river flowing through Delhi The Hindon River separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi The Delhi ridge originates from the Aravalli Range in the south and encircles the west, northeast, and northwest parts of the city It reaches a height of 318 m (1,043 ft) and is a dominant feature of the region [80]\n\n\nClimate\nDelhi features a dry winter humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa) bordering a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen BSh) The warm season lasts from 21 March to 15 June with an average daily high temperature above 39 °C (102 °F) The hottest day of the year is usually witnessed between 26 and 30 May, with an average high of 42 °C (108 °F) and low of 27 °C (81 °F) [84] The cold season lasts from 26 November to 9 February with an average daily high temperature below 20 °C (68 °F) The coldest day of the year is usually witnessed between 1 and 10 January, with an average low of 6.9 °C (44.4 °F) and high of 19.3 °C (66.7 °F) [84] In early March, the wind direction changes from north-westerly to south-westerly From April to October the weather is hot The monsoon arrives at the end of June, along with an increase in humidity [citation needed] The brief, mild winter starts in late November, peaks in January and heavy fog often occurs [85] Delhi receives an average annual precipitation of 774.4 mm (30.49 in) [86]\n\n\nAir pollution\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), Delhi was the most polluted [106] city in the world in 2014 In 2016, WHO downgraded Delhi to eleventh-worst in the urban air quality database [107] However, as recently as 2022, data from the WHO and IQAir, alongside comprehensive research, ranked Delhi as the fourth most polluted city globally [108] According to one estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people every year [109] [110] [111] Air quality index is generally moderate (101–200) level between January and September, and then it drastically deteriorates to Very Poor (301–400), Severe (401–500) or Hazardous (500+) levels in three months between October and December, [112] [113] due to various factors including stubble burning (a type of biomass burning), fire crackers burning during Diwali and cold weather [114] [115] [116] During 2013–14, peak levels of fine particulate matter (PM) increased by about 44%, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions, construction work and crop burning in adjoining states [109] [117] [118] [119] It has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, PM2.5 considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms [120]\n\n\nCivic administration\nCurrently, the NCT of Delhi is made up of one division, 11 districts, 33 subdivisions, 59 census towns, and 300 villages [138]\nOn the other way, the NCT of Delhi is divided into three municipalities The boundaries of municipalities may be different from district boundaries:\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nAs a first-level administrative division, the National Capital Territory of Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly, Lieutenant Governor, the council of ministers, and Chief Minister Members of the legislative assembly are directly elected from territorial constituencies in the NCT The legislative assembly was abolished in 1956, after which direct federal control was implemented until it was re-established in 1993 The municipal corporation handles civic administration for the city as part of the Panchayati Raj Act The Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi, where both bodies are located The Parliament of India, the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace), Cabinet Secretariat, and the Supreme Court of India are located in the municipal district of New Delhi There are 70 assembly constituencies and seven Lok Sabha (Indian Parliament's lower house) constituencies in Delhi [147] [148]\n\n\nEconomy\nDelhi is the largest commercial center in northern India As of 2016 [update] recent estimates of the economy of the Delhi urban area have ranged from $370 billion to $400 billion (PPP metro GDP) ranking it either the most or second-most productive metro area of India [155] [156] The nominal GSDP of the NCT of Delhi for 2016–17 was estimated at ₹6,224 billion (US$75 billion), 13% higher than in 2015–16 [157] Oxford Economics Global Cities index 2024 ranked Delhi as best city in India and 108th best city in the world in Economics Category.\n\n\nUtility services\nDelhi's municipal water supply is managed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) As of June 2005 [update], it supplied 650 million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963 MGD [164] The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps At 240 MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage [164] Research on Delhi suggests that up to half of the city's water use is unofficial groundwater [165]In Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000 tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD [166] The daily domestic waste water production is 470 MGD and industrial waste water is 70 MGD [167] A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river [167]\n\n\nTransport\nIndira Gandhi International Airport, situated

additional official languages [231]\n\n\nCulture\nDelhi's culture has been influenced by its lengthy history and historic association as the capital of India Although a strong Punjabi Influence can be seen in language, Dress and Cuisine brought by the large number of refugees who came following the partition in 1947 the recent migration from other parts of India has made it a melting pot This is exemplified by many significant monuments in the city The Archaeological Survey of India recognises 1,200 heritage buildings [232] and 175 monuments as national heritage sites [233]\n\n\nFestivals\nDelhi's association and geographic proximity to the capital, New Delhi, has amplified the importance of national events and holidays like Republic Day, Independence Day (15 August) and Gandhi Jayanti On Independence Day, the Prime Minister addresses the nation from the Red Fort The Republic Day Parade is a large cultural and military parade showcasing India's cultural diversity and military strength [244] [245] Over the centuries, Delhi has become known for its composite culture, and a festival that symbolises this is the Phool Walon Ki Sair, which takes place in

variety of international cuisines are popular among the residents [253] This variety of cuisines created a unique style of cooking which became popular throughout the world, with dishes such as Kebab, biryani, tandoori The city's classic dishes include butter chicken, dal makhani, shahi paneer, aloo chaat, chaat, dahi bhalla, kachori, gol gappe, samosa, chole bhature, chole kulche, gulab jamun,

bodies, the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) [257] or the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) In 2004–05, approximately 1,529,000 students were enrolled in primary schools, 822,000 in middle schools and 669,000 in secondary schools across Delhi [258] Female students represented 49% of the total enrolment The same year, the Delhi government spent between 1.58% and 1.95% of its gross state domestic product on education [258]\n\n\nMedia\nAs the capital of India, Delhi is the focus of political reportage,

Sudan, and Tunis in the east and Ceuta and Melilla in the west Control of this trade in gold and slaves fed the Spanish treasury [5]\n\n\nBarbarossa brothers arrive\nOttoman privateer brothers Aruj and Hayreddin, both known to Europeans as Barbarossa (\"Redbeard\"), were corsair chiefs, skilful politicians and warriors feared by the Christian armies of the Mediterranean [9] In 1512, they were famous for victories against Spanish naval vessels on the high sea and off the shores of Andalusia, and were successfully operating off the coast of Hafsid Tunisia Scholars and notables of Bejaïa asked them for help in dislodging the Spanish [10] They failed however, due to Bejaïa's formidable fortifications Aruj was wounded while trying to storm the city, and his arm had to be amputated [11] He realized that his forces' position in the valley of La Goulette hampered their efforts against the Spaniards and moved them to Jijel, whose inhabitants had asked him for help Jijel was a center for trade between Africa and Italy, occupied since 1260 by the Genoese Aruj conquered it in 1514, established a base of operations there and formalized an alliance with the Banu Abbas leaders of Lesser Kabylia [12] [13] Aruj attacked Bejaïa again with a larger force in the spring of the following year, but withdrew when his ammunition ran out and the emir of Tunis refused to supply him with any more [13] He did however succeed in capturing hundreds of Spanish prisoners [14]\n\n\nNew masters of Algiers\nPedro Navarro and  Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros captured Bejaïa in 1510, after taking Oran in 1509 The leader of Algiers, sheikh Salim al-Thumi of the Thaaliba, recognized Catholic king Ferdinand II of Aragon as his sovereign, and made a number of pledges He said he would pay tribute every year, release Christian prisoners, forsake piracy, and not allow the enemies of Spain from entering his harbor [15] To monitor the residents of Algiers and their compliance with these pledges, Pedro Navarro captured the island of Peñon, within artillery range of the city, and garrisoned 200 men in a fort there [16] Residents of Algiers sought to break free of the Spanish and took advantage of the excitement over the death of King Ferdinand to send a delegation to Jijel in 1516 seeking help from Aruj and his men [12]\n\n\nCampaign of Tlemcen: Death of Aruj\nAfter vanquishing his army at the Battle of Oued Djer in June 1517, Aruj killed Spanish vassal Hamid bin Abid, Prince of Ténès, seized his city, [24] and expelled the Spaniards stationed there He then divided his kingdom into two parts: an eastern part based in Dellys to be ruled by his brother Hayreddin, and a western part centered on the city of Algiers, to be ruled by him personally [26]\n\n\nAlgiers joins the Ottoman Empire\nHayreddin was proclaimed Sultan of Algiers in late 1519, [32] but the death of his older brother left him in a difficult situation He faced serious threats from the Spanish, the Zayyanid and the Hafsid dynasty, as well as the tribes of the central Maghreb [30] He increasingly felt a need for Ottoman financial and military support to maintain his prestige and his possessions around Algiers [33] [34] In early 1520, a delegation of Algerian notables and ulemas led by Sinan Rais arrived in Constantinople, [35] They had instructions to propose to Ottoman sultan Selim I that Algiers join the Ottoman Empire, [36] and make clear him the strategic importance of Algiers in the Western Mediterranean [32] Historian Nicolas Vatin points out that after an earlier reluctance from the Sublime Porte, Algiers officially became part of the Ottoman Empire under Selim I in the summer of 1520 [37] The Sublime Porte named Hayreddin Barbarossa beylerbey lit. 'Prince of princes', and supported him with 2000 janissaries [32]\n\n\nReconquest of Algiers\nSultan Belkadi defeated Barbarossa at the Battle of Issers in 1518 with joint Kuku-Hafsid forces, then captured Algiers in 1520 and ruled over it for five years (1520–1525) [39] [40] [41] Hayreddin retreated to Jijel in 1521 Unable to rely solely on Andalusian recruits, he took advantage of the social divisions within the Maghreb to ally himself with the Kabyle people of Beni Abbas, rivals of Kuku [40] [42] Thus he bolstered his ranks with local tribesmen [40] Hayreddin's corsairs aimed to attain supremacy in the central Maghreb using their religious zeal [40] They captured Collo in 1521, then Annaba and Constantine in 1523 [43] Hayreddin crossed the mountains of Kabylia without incident to face Belkadi in Thénia, but Belkadi was killed by his own soldiers before a battle could take place [44] The debacle caused by this assassination cleared the road to Algiers, whose population had complained about Belkadi and opened the gates for Hayreddin in 1525 [45] [46]\n\n\nMorisco rescue missions\nIn summer 1529 Barbarossa sent ships under Aydin Rais to help Spanish Muslim Moriscos flee the Spanish Inquisition, [47] After he descended on the Valencian coast, captured Christians and took 200 Muslims aboard his ships, he defeated a Spanish squadron sent under Admiral Rodrigo de Portuondo  [es] at Formentera, capturing seven ships and their crews including the dead admiral's son, and freed 1000 Muslim galley slaves [50]\n\n\nHayreddin's successors (1534–1580)\nBarbarossa raided the coasts of Spain and Italy, taking thousands of prisoners in Mahon and Naples [53] He captured Italian countess Giulia Gonzaga, but she escaped shortly afterward [55] The sultan called Barbarossa to the Porte in 1533 to become Kapudan Pasha (Admiral) He put Hasan Agha in charge in Algiers as his deputy and went to Constantinople [56] Two years later in June 1535, Charles V of Spain conquered Tunis, held by Hayreddin at the time [57]\n\n\nWar against the Spanish-Moroccans\nThe Saadi dynasty of Morocco expanded eastward, [81] taking Tlemcen and Mostaganem and reaching the Chelif River [72] These incursions into western Algeria resulted in the campaign of Tlemcen in 1551, where Hassan Pasha defeated the Moroccans and solidified Ottoman control of western Algeria [72] This was followed by the Battle of Taza (1553) and the capture of Fez in 1554, in which Salah Rais defeated the Moroccan army, and conquered Morocco as far west as Fez, then put Ali Abu Hassun in place as ruler and vassal to the Ottoman sultan [82] The Saadi ruler Mohammed al-Shaykh concluded an alliance with Spain, but his armies were again removed from Tlemcen in 1557 [83]\n\n\nGolden Age of Algiers: 17th century\nIncreasingly independent from Constantinople, 17th-century Algiers engaged in widespread privateering in what became known as the \"golden age of corsairs\" [99] In raids on the Roman Mediterranean countryside, they wreaked havoc and took captives in Civitavecchia [100] The expulsion of the Moriscos reinforced the corso with new sailors who painfully weakened Spain, ravaging its mainland and domains in Sicily and the islands of Italy, where people were taken captive en masse [101]\n\n\nOttoman suzerainty weakens\nIn the 16th century France signed capitulation treaties with the Ottomans, formalizing the Franco-Ottoman alliance [110] In 1547, French trade rights and coral fishing were established in Algiers [111] The French trade post in eastern Algeria, known as the Bastion of France, was taken over by the French Compagnie corail  [fr] [112] Originally built to export coral, it engaged in wheat trade against the agreement, it was also fortified and turned into a military supply base and a center of espionage [112] Believing it gave too many privileges to foreigners, Algiers disapproved of Constantinople's foreign policy [113]\n\n\nAli Bitchin Rais\nThe Barbary corsair captains, also known as the raïs, were represented by the tai'fa, or community of corsair captains The captains were led by a Kapudan Rais (Admiral and Minister of Foreign affairs) [121] Since their privateering provided most of the Regency's revenue, they became the dominant politico-military power of early 17th century Algiers [122] A great influx of crewsmen allowing operations to scale up, both Moriscos expelled from Spain and European renegades [122] who renounced their Christian faith between 1609 and 1619 Historian Jean-Baptiste Gramaye gave their numbers as: 857 Germans, 138 Hamburgers, 300 English, 130 Dutch and Flemings, 160 Danes, 250 Poles, Hungarians and Moscovites [123] Their skills proved valuable for the strength of the Algerian fleet [123]\n\n\nCoulougli revolt\nCoulouglis were the offspring  in Algiers of Turkish men and Algerian women [134] The rise in power of the Turkish janissaries in the early 17th century gradually weakened the appointed triennial Ottoman pashas In 1596 the coulouglis provided Khider Pasha  [fr] with crucial help in suppressing the mutiny of the janissaries [135] This prompted the janissaries to consider excluding the coulouglis from strategic positions in the Regency [136]\n\n\nForeign policy\n\nThe Hapsburg Empire signed a peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire in the early 17th century, ending the Long Turkish War [113] However this didn't concern both the Sovereign Order of Malta and the North African Regencies who pursued their holy war against each other Their privateers were motivated by desires of vengeance, wealth and salvation [142] The kingdoms of England, France and the Dutch Republic were seen as allies by the Ottoman Regencies until the end of the 16th century because of their common Spanish enemy [143] But when James I of England and the Dutch opted for peace with Spain in 1604 and 1609 respectively and increased their shipping in the Mediterranean, [144] Algerian and Tunisian corsairs attacked their ships, amassing wealth, capturing slaves and goods while taking advantage of their strong fleet, maritime European weakness and Ottoman incapacity to force the Regencies to respect the Ottoman capitulations [145] This prompted European powers to negotiate treaties directly with Algiers on commerce, tribute payments and slave ransoms [113] in an acknowledgement of the autonomy of Algiers despite its formal subordination to the Sublime Porte [146]\n\n\nKingdom of France\nFrance was the first European country to establish relations with Algiers [153] They began direct negotiations in 1617 after more than 900 ships were taken and 8000 Frenchmen enslaved, [157] They reached an impasse however in part over two cannons Dutch corsair Simon Rais had taken with him to give to Charles, Duke of Guise when he left the Algerian navy in 1607 [158] A treaty was signed in 1619, [159] and another in 1628 [160] [112] Algerians undertook to: [161] [162]\n\n\nKingdom of England\nEnglish admiral Robert Mansell led an expedition in 1621 that sent burning fireships into the fleet moored in Algiers It failed to take Algiers, however, and Mansell was recalled to England on 24 May 1621 [170] James I negotiated directly with the pasha of Algiers in 1622 but more than 3000 Englishmen remained enslaved in Algiers [171] The Regency's corsairs crossed the English and Bristol channels and launched multiple raids on the English coasts, [172]  prompting Sir John Eliot, Vice-Admiral of Devon to say: “..whole Sea seem’d theirs” [173] Descents on land and kidnappings of inhabitants were more recurrent in the mid 17th century, when a barbary raid on Cornwall took place in 1654 [172]\n\n\nDutch Republic\nThe English peace treaty with Algiers affected Dutch shipping Merchants arriving at The Hague all said that the Dutch were losing trade to the English [179] [180] From 1661 to 1664, the Dutch sent Michiel de Ruyter and Cornelis Tromp on several expeditions to Algiers in an attempt to make the Algerians accept the free ships, free goods principle [181] [180] Although the Algerians had accepted the principle in 1663, they reneged a year later De Ruyter was again dispatched to Algiers, but hostilities with England began, leading up to the Second Anglo-Dutch War, cut his mission short [182]\n\n\nMaghrebi wars (1678–1756)\n\nAlgeria's relations with other Maghreb countries were troubled most of the time, [187] for several historical reasons [80] Algiers considered Tunisia a dependency because Algiers had annexed it to the Ottoman Empire, which made the appointment of its pashas a prerogative of the Algerian beylerbeys [188] Tunis had inherited ambitions in the Constantine region from the Hafsid era, and rejected Algerian suzerainty Algerian historian Yahya Bouaziz commented on Algerian-Moroccan relations: \n\nTunisian campaigns\nTunis adamantly refused subordination to Algeria [187] Beginning in 1590, the diwân of Tunisian janissaries revolted against Algiers, and the country became a vassal of Constantinople itself [187] A peace treaty concluded on 17 May 1628 after an Algerian victory described the borders between them [190]\n\n\nMoroccan campaigns\nIn 1678, Moulay Ismail mounted an expedition to Tlemcen The tribes of Orania joined his contingents on the Upper Moulouya, and together they advanced to the Chelif to give battle there [202] The Ottoman Algerians brought in artillery and routed the Moroccans Negotiations with Dey Chabane fixed the border at the Moulouya, where it remained for the rest of the Saadian period [203] In 1691, Moulay Ismail launched a new offensive against Orania, and Dey Chabane, supported by 10,000 janissaries and 3,000 Zwawa infantry, [204] killed 5,000 and routed the rest of the attackers at the Moulouya before marching on Fez [205] Moulay Ismail surrendered According to French historian Henri de Grammont: \"He came before the victor with his hands bound, kissed the ground three times, and said to him: You are the knife, and I the flesh that you can cut.\" [206] [189] He agreed to pay tribute and sign the treaty of Oujda confirming the Moulouya river border [207] In 1694, the Ottoman sultan invited that of Morocco to cease his attacks against Algiers [203]\n\n\nDey Muhammad ben Othman Pasha (1766–1792)\nBy the end of the 17th century, Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli had extended their rule in the hinterland, compelled by the need to supply their port cities, extensive trade with Europe and meeting the janissaries' payroll [214] The janissaries took the reins of power in the Barbary states at the expense of the corsairs Their officers obtained the right from the Ottoman sultan to be appointed as pashas (representatives of the sultan), [215] gaining uncontested legitimacy and a more peaceful system of succession [215]\n\n\nEarly 18th century transformations\nBy the end of the 17th century, Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli had extended their rule in the hinterland, compelled by the need to supply their port cities, extensive trade with Europe and meeting the janissaries' payroll [214] The janissaries took the reins of power in the Barbary states at the expense of the corsairs Their officers obtained the right from the Ottoman sultan to be appointed as pashas (representatives of the sultan), [215] gaining uncontested legitimacy and a more peaceful system of succession [215]\n\n\nMuhammad ben Othman's policy\nMuhammad ben Othman Pasha became dey in 1766 as his predecessor Dey Ali Bousbaa  [fr] had wished He ruled over a powerful and prosperous Algiers for a full quarter-century until he died in 1791 [111] [223] He was a \"rational, courageous, and determined man who adhered to working according to Islamic law, loved jihad, was austere even with regard to public treasury funds\", according to the memoirs of Ahmad Sharif al-Zahhar, a naqib al-ashraf of Algiers in its late Ottoman era [224] He successfully handled most of the problems he faced during his rule, especially Spanish and Portuguese raids, [225]  during which he placed in the state treasury 200.000 Algerian sequin that he had saved from his private salary and did not take it back [225]\n\n\nWar with Denmark\nDey Muhammad Othman Pasha increased the annual royalties paid by the Netherlands, Venice, Sweden and Denmark They accepted, except for Denmark, which assigned Frederick Kaas to lead four ships of the line, two bomb galiots and two frigates against the city of Algiers in 1770 The bombardment ended in failure [229] Algerian pirates attacked Dano-Norwegian ships for a whole year afterwards [230] Denmark submitted to the dey's conditions and agreed to pay 2.5 million dollars in compensation for the damage to the city, and provide 44 cannons, 500 quintals of gunpowder, and 50 sails It also agreed to ransom its captives and pay royalties every two years with various gifts to officials [231]\n\n\nWar with Spain\nThe War of the Spanish Succession, gave western bey Mustapha Bouchelaghem the opportunity to capture Oran and Mers-el Kebir in 1708, [232] but he lost them back in 1732 to a successful campaign by the Duke of Montemar [233] In 1775 Irish-born admiral of the Spanish Empire Alejandro O'Reilly led an expedition to knock down pirate activity in the Mediterranean The assault's spectacular failure dealt a humiliating blow to the Spanish military reorganisation [234]\n\n\nDecline of Algiers (1800–1830)\nThe Jews of Algiers became an economic power and eliminated many European merchant houses from the Mediterranean, which deeply worried the Marseillais defending their threatened monopoly [b] French consuls resented the Jews, and urged their king to pass ordinances to prevent them from trading in French ports But the Jewish merchants dealt in prize goods from the corsairs as well as in more usual merchandise, and were essential to the government because of their contacts and skill in aligning their affairs with the interests of the Algerian state [241] They were at the origin of various Algerian disputes with Spain and especially with France [241] [242]\n\n\nAlgerian Jewish merchants\nThe Jews of Algiers became an economic power and eliminated many European merchant houses from the Mediterranean, which deeply worried the Marseillais defending their threatened monopoly [b] French consuls resented the Jews, and urged their king to pass ordinances to prevent them from trading in French ports But the Jewish merchants dealt in prize goods from the corsairs as well as in more usual merchandise, and were essential to the government because of their contacts and skill in aligning their affairs with the interests of the Algerian state [241] They were at the origin of various Algerian disputes with Spain and especially with France [241] [242]\n\n\nCrisis of the 19th century\nDuring Napoleon's campaign in Egypt (1798-1801), Algiers supplied the French army with large quantities of wheat [244] In the early 19th century, it was struck with political turmoil and economic stress [245] Between 1803 and 1805, famine caused by failed wheat harvests resulted in public riots [245] that led to the death of prominent Jewish grain merchant Naphtali Busnash who was blamed for the shortages Dey Mustapha Pasha  [fr]'s assassination followed, despite encouraging an anti-Jewish pogrom, which began a 20-year period of coups, [245] in which seven deys perished [246]\n\n\nBarbary Wars\nInternal fiscal problems in the early 19th century led Algiers to again engage in widespread piracy against American and European shipping, taking full advantage of the Napoleonic Wars [259] As the most prominent Barbary state, [260] [261] wishing to profit and make political gains on divisions between European nations, Algiers declared war on the U.S in 1785 on the pretext of asserting its rights to search and seizure in the absence of a treaty with a given nation [262] It captured 11 American ships and enslaved 100 sailors In 1797 Raïs Hamidou captured 16 Portuguese ships and 118 prisoners [263] The U.S agreed to buy peace with Algiers in 1795 for $10 million including ransoms and annual tribute over 12 years [259] Another treaty with the Kingdom of Portugal in 1812 brought $690,337 in ransom and $500,000 in tribute [264] But Algiers was defeated in the Second Barbary War; U.S admiral Stephen Decatur captured the Algerian flagship Mashouda in a battle off Cape Gata, killing Raïs Hamidou on 17 June 1815 [265] Decatur went to Algiers and demanded war reparations from the dey and the immediate cessation of tribute to him on 29 June 1815 [265]\n\n\nFrench invasion\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the merchants of Algiers sold massive amounts of wheat to France, largely bought on credit Hussein Dey demanded in 1827 that the restored Kingdom of France pay a 31-year-old debt contracted by Napoleon in 1799 for supplies to feed the soldiers in his Napoleonic campaign in Egypt

Beylik of Algiers, was a Muslim state that existed from the 16th to the 19th century in what is now Algeria. It was a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire and was governed by the dey, who was the supreme ruler of the regency.\n\nEstablishment (1516–1533)\n\nThe Regency of Algiers was established in 1516, when the Ottoman Empire conquered the city of Algiers from the Spanish. The Ottomans had been expanding their empire in North Africa since the early 16th century, and they saw the conquest of Algiers as an important strategic move. The city was a major trading center, and its conquest gave the Ottomans control over the Mediterranean trade routes.\n\nMany in the exodus from Spain settle in Morroco and at Cherchell The Spanish Empire, feeling threatened by its exiles in North Africa, conquered Maghrebi coastal ports after the Emirate of Granada fell in 1492, and garrisoned walled and fortified defensive strongpoints it called presidios [1] First Melilla fell in 1497, [2] then the Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera in 1508 On the Algerian coast, Mers El Kébir fell in 1505, followed in 1509 by Oran, the most important seaport of the time, directly linked to Tlemcen, capital of the Zayyanid Kingdom [3] After the Spanish conquest of Tripoli in 1510, the Hafsids in Tunis decided they did not have the means to resist and submitted to Spanish sovereignty in humiliating agreements [4] The Spaniards had gained control of caravan trade routes passing through Béjaïa, Algiers, Oran and Tlemcen from Tripoli, western Sudan, and Tunis in the east and Ceuta and Melilla in the west Control of this trade in gold and slaves fed the Spanish treasury [5]\n\nSpanish expansion in the Maghreb\n\nThe Spanish expansion in the Maghreb was a major factor in the establishment of the Regency of Algiers. The Spanish had been conquering the coastal cities of North Africa since the early 16th century, and they saw the conquest of Algiers as an important strategic move. The city was a major trading center, and its conquest gave the Spanish control over the Mediterranean trade routes.\n\nMany in the exodus from Spain settle in Morroco and at Cherchell The Spanish Empire, feeling threatened by its exiles in North Africa, conquered Maghrebi coastal ports after the Emirate of Granada fell in 1492, and garrisoned walled and fortified defensive strongpoints it called presidios [1] First Melilla fell in 1497, [2] then the Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera in 1508 On the Algerian coast, Mers El Kébir fell in 1505, followed in 1509 by Oran, the most important seaport of the time, directly linked to Tlemcen, capital of the Zayyanid Kingdom [3] After the Spanish conquest of Tripoli in 1510, the Hafsids in Tunis decided they did not have the means to resist and submitted to Spanish sovereignty in humiliating agreements [4] The Spaniards had gained control of caravan trade routes passing through Béjaïa, Algiers, Oran and Tlemcen from Tripoli, western Sudan, and Tunis in the east and Ceuta and Melilla in the west Control of this trade in gold and slaves fed the Spanish treasury [5]\n\nBarbarossa brothers arrive\n\nThe Barbarossa brothers, Aruj and Hayreddin, were Ottoman privateers who arrived in Algiers in the early 16th century. They were skilled politicians and warriors who were feared by the Christian armies of the Mediterranean. Aruj was the elder brother and was known as the \"Redbeard\" for his red beard. Hayreddin was the younger brother and would later become the Sultan of Algiers.\n\nOttoman privateer brothers Aruj and Hayreddin, both known to Europeans as Barbarossa (\"Redbeard\"), were corsair chiefs, skilful politicians and warriors feared by the Christian armies of the Mediterranean [9] In 1512, they were famous for victories against Spanish naval vessels on the high sea and off the shores of Andalusia, and were successfully operating off the coast of Hafsid Tunisia Scholars and notables of Bejaïa asked them for help in dislodging the Spanish [10] They failed however, due to Bejaïa's formidable fortifications Aruj was wounded while trying to storm the city, and his arm had to be amputated [11] He realized that his forces' position in the valley of La Goulette hampered their efforts against the Spaniards and moved them to Jijel, whose inhabitants had asked him for help Jijel was a center for trade between Africa and Italy, occupied since 1260 by the Genoese Aruj conquered it in 1514, established a base of operations there and formalized an alliance with the Banu Abbas leaders of Lesser Kabylia [12] [13] Aruj attacked Bejaïa again with a larger force in the spring of the following year, but withdrew when his ammunition ran out and the emir of Tunis refused to supply him with any more [13] He did however succeed in capturing hundreds of Spanish prisoners [14]\n\nNew masters of Algiers\n\nThe new masters of Algiers were the Barbarossa brothers, who had arrived in the city in the early 16th century. They were skilled politicians and warriors who were feared by the Christian armies of the Mediterranean. Aruj was the elder brother and was known as the \"Redbeard\" for his red beard. Hayreddin was the younger brother and would later become the Sultan of Algiers.\n\nPedro Navarro and  Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros captured Bejaïa in 1510, after taking Oran in 1509 The leader of Algiers, sheikh Salim al-Thumi of the Thaaliba, recognized Catholic king Ferdinand II of Aragon as his sovereign, and made a number of pledges He said he would pay tribute every year, release Christian prisoners, forsake piracy, and not allow the enemies of Spain from entering his harbor [15] To monitor the residents of Algiers and their compliance with these pledges, Pedro Navarro captured the island of Peñon, within artillery range of the city, and garrisoned 200 men in a fort there [16] Residents of Algiers sought to break free of the Spanish and took advantage of the excitement over the death of King Ferdinand to send a delegation to Jijel in 1516 seeking help from Aruj and his men [12]\n\nCampaign of Tlemcen: Death of Aruj\n\nThe campaign of Tlemcen was a military campaign led by Aruj against the Zayyanid dynasty in the early 16th century. Aruj was the leader of the Ottoman forces in North Africa and was determined to conquer the Zayyanid kingdom. The Zayyanid dynasty was a powerful and wealthy kingdom that controlled much of North Africa.\n\nAfter vanquishing his army at the Battle of Oued Djer in June 1517, Aruj killed Spanish vassal Hamid bin Abid, Prince of Ténès, seized his city, [24] and expelled the Spaniards stationed there He then divided his kingdom into two parts: an eastern part based in Dellys to be ruled by his brother Hayreddin, and a western part centered on the city of Algiers, to be ruled by him personally [26]\n\nAlgiers joins the Ottoman Empire\n\nIn 1520, the Ottoman Empire officially joined the Regency of Algiers, and Hayreddin became the Sultan of Algiers. He was the first Ottoman sultan to rule the city, and he quickly established himself as a powerful and effective leader.\n\nHayreddin was proclaimed Sultan of Algiers in late 1519, [32] but the death of his older brother left him in a difficult situation He faced serious threats from the Spanish, the Zayyanid and the Hafsid dynasty, as well as the tribes of the central Maghreb [30] He increasingly felt a need for Ottoman financial and military support to maintain his prestige and his possessions around Algiers [33] [34] In early 1520, a delegation of Algerian notables and ulemas led by Sinan Rais arrived in Constantinople, [35] They had instructions to propose to Ottoman sultan Selim I that Algiers join the Ottoman Empire, [36] and make clear him the strategic importance of Algiers in the Western Mediterranean [32] Historian Nicolas Vatin points out that after an earlier reluctance from the Sublime Porte, Algiers officially became part of the Ottoman Empire under Selim I in the summer of 1520 [37] The Sublime Porte named Hayreddin Barbarossa beylerbey lit. 'Prince of princes', and supported him with 2000 janissaries [32]\n\nReconquest of Algiers\n\nThe reconquest of Algiers was a military campaign led by the Ottoman Empire against the Zayyanid dynasty in the early 16th century. The Ottoman Empire had been seeking to expand its territory in North Africa for many years, and the Zayyanid kingdom was a major obstacle to this goal.\n\nSultan Belkadi defeated Barbarossa at the Battle of Issers in 1518 with joint Kuku-Hafsid forces, then captured Algiers in 1520 and ruled over it for five years (1520–1525) [39] [40] [41] Hayreddin retreated to Jijel in 1521 Unable to rely solely on Andalusian recruits, he took advantage of the social divisions within the Maghreb to ally himself with the Kabyle people of Beni Abbas, rivals of Kuku [40] [42] Thus he bolstered his ranks with local tribesmen [40] Hayreddin's corsairs aimed to attain supremacy in the central Maghreb using their religious zeal [40] They captured Collo in 1521, then Annaba and Constantine in 1523 [43] Hayreddin crossed the mountains of Kabylia without incident to face Belkadi in Thénia, but Belkadi was killed by his own soldiers before a battle could take place [44] The debacle caused by this assassination cleared the road to Algiers, whose population had complained about Belkadi and opened the gates for Hayreddin in 1525 [45] [46]\n\nMorisco rescue missions\n\nThe Morisco rescue missions were a series of military campaigns led by the Ottoman Empire against the Spanish Empire in the early 16th century. The Ottoman Empire had been seeking to help the Moriscos, who were Muslim subjects of the Spanish Empire, and to weaken the Spanish Empire.\n\nIn summer 1529 Barbarossa sent ships under Aydin Rais to help Spanish Muslim Moriscos flee the Spanish Inquisition, [47] After he descended on the Valencian coast, captured Christians and took 200 Muslims aboard his ships, he defeated a Spanish squadron sent under Admiral Rodrigo de Portuondo  [es] at Formentera, capturing seven ships and their crews including the dead admiral's son, and freed 1000 Muslim galley slaves [50]\n\nHayreddin's successors (1534–1580)\n\nHayreddin's successors were a series of Ottoman sultans who ruled Algiers after his death in 1534. They continued to expand the Ottoman Empire's territory in North Africa and to weaken the Spanish Empire.\n\nBarbarossa raided the coasts of Spain and Italy, taking thousands of prisoners in Mahon and Naples [53] He captured Italian countess Giulia Gonzaga, but she escaped shortly afterward [55] The sultan called Barbarossa to the Porte in 1533 to become Kapudan Pasha (Admiral) He put Hasan Agha in charge in Algiers as his deputy and went to Constantinople [56] Two years later in June 1535, Charles V of Spain conquered Tunis, held by Hayreddin at the time [57]\n\nWar against the Spanish-Moroccans\n\nThe war against the Spanish-Moroccans was a series of military campaigns fought between the Ottoman Empire and the Spanish-Moroccan alliance in the mid-16th century. The Ottoman Empire had been seeking to expand its territory in North Africa and to weaken the Spanish Empire.\n\nThe Saadi dynasty of Morocco expanded eastward, [81] taking Tlemcen and Mostaganem and reaching the Chelif River [72] These incursions into western Algeria resulted in the campaign of Tlemcen in 1551, where Hassan Pasha defeated the Moroccans and solidified Ottoman control of western Algeria [72] This was followed by the Battle of Taza (1553) and the capture of Fez in 1554, in which Salah Rais defeated the Moroccan army, and conquered Morocco as far west as Fez, then put Ali Abu Hassun in place as ruler and vassal to the Ottoman sultan [82] The Saadi ruler Mohammed al-Shaykh concluded an alliance with Spain, but his armies were again removed from Tlemcen in 1557 [83]\n\nGolden Age of Algiers: 17th century\n\nThe Golden Age of Algiers was a period of prosperity and cultural achievement in the city of Algiers in the 17th century. During this time, the city became a major center of trade and commerce, and its population grew significantly.\n\nIncreasingly independent from Constantinople, 17th-century Algiers engaged in widespread privateering in what became known as the \"golden age of corsairs\" [99] In raids on the Roman Mediterranean countryside, they wreaked havoc and took captives in Civitavecchia [100] The expulsion of the Moriscos reinforced the corso with new sailors who painfully weakened Spain, ravaging its mainland and domains in Sicily and the islands of Italy, where people were taken captive en masse [101]\n\nOttoman suzerainty weakens\n\nThe Ottoman suzerainty over Algiers weakened in the 17th century, as the city began to assert its independence from the Ottoman Empire. This was due in part to the decline of the Ottoman Empire's power and influence in the region.\n\nIn the 16th century France signed capitulation treaties with the Ottomans, formalizing the Franco-Ottoman alliance [110] In 1547, French trade rights and coral fishing were established in Algiers [111] The French trade post in eastern Algeria, known as the Bastion of France, was taken over by the French Compagnie corail  [fr] [112] Originally built to export coral, it engaged in wheat trade against the agreement, it was also fortified and turned into a military supply base and a center of espionage [112] Believing it gave too many privileges to foreigners, Algiers disapproved of Constantinople's foreign policy [113]\n\nAli Bitchin Rais\n\nAli Bitchin Rais was a Barbary corsair who ruled Algiers in the late 17th century. He was a skilled politician and warrior who was feared by the Christian armies of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Barbary corsair captains, also known as the raïs, were represented by the tai'fa, or community of corsair captains The captains were led by a Kapudan Rais (Admiral and Minister of Foreign affairs) [121] Since their privateering provided most of the Regency's revenue, they became the dominant politico-military power of early 17th century Algiers [122] A great influx of crewsmen allowing operations to scale up, both Moriscos expelled from Spain and European renegades [122] who renounced their Christian faith between 1609 and 1619 Historian Jean-Baptiste Gramaye gave their numbers as: 857 Germans, 138 Hamburgers, 300 English, 130 Dutch and Flemings, 160 Danes, 250 Poles, Hungarians and Moscovites [123] Their skills proved valuable for the strength of the Algerian fleet [123]\n\nCoulougli revolt\n\nThe Coulougli revolt was a rebellion led by the Coulougli, a group of people of Turkish and Algerian descent, against the ruling class of Algiers in the early 17th century.\n\nThe Coulouglis were the offspring  in Algiers of Turkish men and Algerian women [134] The rise in power of the Turkish janissaries in the early 17th century gradually weakened the appointed triennial Ottoman pashas In 1596 the coulouglis provided Khider Pasha  [fr] with crucial help in suppressing the mutiny of the janissaries [135] This prompted the janissaries to consider excluding the coulouglis from strategic positions in the Regency [136]\n\nForeign policy\n\nThe foreign policy of Algiers in the 17th century was marked by a series of conflicts with European powers, including the French, English, and Dutch.\n\nThe Hapsburg Empire signed a peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire in the early 17th century, ending the Long Turkish War [113] However this didn't concern both the Sovereign Order of Malta and the North African Regencies who pursued their holy war against each other Their privateers were motivated by desires of vengeance, wealth and salvation [142] The kingdoms of England, France and the Dutch Republic were seen as allies by the Ottoman Regencies until the end of the 16th century because of their common Spanish enemy [143] But when James I of England and the Dutch opted for peace with Spain in 1604 and 1609 respectively and increased their shipping in the Mediterranean, [144] Algerian and Tunisian corsairs attacked their ships, amassing wealth, capturing slaves and goods while taking advantage of their strong fleet, maritime European weakness and Ottoman incapacity to force the Regencies to respect the Ottoman capitulations [145] This prompted European powers to negotiate treaties directly with Algiers on commerce, tribute payments and slave ransoms [113] in an acknowledgement of the autonomy of Algiers despite its formal subordination to the Sublime Porte [146]\n\nKingdom of France\n\nThe Kingdom of France was the first European country to establish relations with Algiers, and it maintained a significant presence in the city throughout the 17th century.\n\nThe French were the first European country to establish relations with Algiers [153] They began direct negotiations in 1617 after more than 900 ships were taken and 8000 Frenchmen enslaved, [157] They reached an impasse however in part over two cannons Dutch corsair Simon Rais had taken with him to give to Charles, Duke of Guise when he left the Algerian navy in 1607 [158] A treaty was signed in 1619, [159] and another in 1628 [160] [112] Algerians undertook to: [161] [162]\n\nKingdom of England\n\nThe Kingdom of England was another European power that established relations with Algiers in the 17th century.\n\nEnglish admiral Robert Mansell led an expedition in 1621 that sent burning fireships into the fleet moored in Algiers It failed to take Algiers, however, and Mansell was recalled to England on 24 May 1621 [170] James I negotiated directly with the

slaves and goods while taking advantage of their strong fleet, maritime European weakness and Ottoman incapacity to force the Regencies to respect the Ottoman capitulations [145] This prompted European powers to negotiate treaties directly with Algiers on commerce, tribute payments and slave ransoms [113] in an acknowledgement of the autonomy of Algiers despite its formal subordination to the Sublime Porte [146]\n\n\nKingdom of France\nFrance was the first European country to establish relations with Algiers [153] They began direct negotiations in 1617 after more than 900 ships were taken and 8000 Frenchmen enslaved, [157] They reached an impasse however in part over two cannons Dutch corsair Simon Rais had taken with him to give to Charles, Duke of Guise when he left the Algerian navy in 1607 [158] A treaty was signed in 1619, [159] and another in 1628 [160] [112] Algerians undertook to: [161] [162]\n\n\nKingdom of England\nEnglish admiral Robert Mansell led an expedition in 1621 that sent burning fireships into the fleet moored in Algiers It failed to take Algiers, however, and Mansell was recalled to England on 24 May 1621 [170] James I negotiated directly with the pasha of Algiers in 1622 but more than 3000 Englishmen remained enslaved in Algiers [171] The Regency's corsairs crossed the English and Bristol channels and launched multiple raids on the English coasts, [172]  prompting Sir John Eliot, Vice-Admiral of Devon to say: “..whole Sea seem’d theirs” [173] Descents on land and kidnappings of inhabitants were more recurrent in the mid 17th century, when a barbary raid on Cornwall took place in 1654 [172]\n\n\nDutch Republic\nThe English peace treaty with Algiers affected Dutch shipping Merchants arriving at The Hague all said that the Dutch were losing trade to the English [179] [180] From 1661 to 1664, the Dutch sent Michiel de Ruyter and Cornelis Tromp on several expeditions to Algiers in an attempt to make the Algerians accept the free ships, free goods principle [181] [180] Although the Algerians had accepted the principle in 1663, they reneged a year later De Ruyter was again dispatched to Algiers, but hostilities with England began, leading up to the Second Anglo-Dutch War, cut his mission short [182]\n\n\nMaghrebi wars (1678–1756)\n\nAlgeria's relations with other Maghreb countries were troubled most of the time, [187] for several historical reasons [80] Algiers considered Tunisia a dependency because Algiers had annexed it to the Ottoman Empire, which made the appointment of its pashas a prerogative of the Algerian beylerbeys [188] Tunis had inherited ambitions in the Constantine region from the Hafsid era, and rejected Algerian suzerainty Algerian historian Yahya Bouaziz commented on Algerian-Moroccan relations: \n\nTunisian campaigns\nTunis adamantly refused subordination to Algeria [187] Beginning in 1590, the diwân of Tunisian janissaries revolted against Algiers, and the country became a vassal of Constantinople itself [187] A peace treaty concluded on 17 May 1628 after an Algerian victory described the borders between them [190]\n\n\nMoroccan campaigns\nIn 1678, Moulay Ismail mounted an expedition to Tlemcen The tribes of Orania joined his contingents on the Upper Moulouya, and together they advanced to the Chelif to give battle there [202] The Ottoman Algerians brought in artillery and routed the Moroccans Negotiations with Dey Chabane fixed the border at the Moulouya, where it remained for the rest of the Saadian period [203] In 1691, Moulay Ismail launched a new offensive against Orania, and Dey Chabane, supported by 10,000 janissaries and 3,000 Zwawa infantry, [204] killed 5,000 and routed the rest of the attackers at the Moulouya before marching on Fez [205] Moulay Ismail surrendered According to French historian Henri de Grammont: \"He came before the victor with his hands bound, kissed the ground three times, and said to him: You are the knife, and I the flesh that you can cut.\" [206] [189] He agreed to pay tribute and sign the treaty of Oujda confirming the Moulouya river border [207] In 1694, the Ottoman sultan invited that of Morocco to cease his attacks against Algiers [203]\n\n\nDey Muhammad ben Othman Pasha (1766–1792)\nBy the end of the 17th century, Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli had extended their rule in the hinterland, compelled by the need to supply their port cities, extensive trade with Europe and meeting the janissaries' payroll [214] The janissaries took the reins of power in the Barbary states at the expense of the corsairs Their officers obtained the right from the Ottoman sultan to be appointed as pashas (representatives of the sultan), [215] gaining uncontested legitimacy and a more peaceful system of succession [215]\n\n\nEarly 18th century transformations\nBy the end of the 17th century, Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli had extended their rule in the hinterland, compelled by the need to supply their port cities, extensive trade with Europe and meeting the janissaries' payroll [214] The janissaries took the reins of power in the Barbary states at the expense of the corsairs Their officers obtained the right from the Ottoman sultan to be appointed as pashas (representatives of the sultan), [215] gaining uncontested legitimacy and a more peaceful system of succession [215]\n\n\nMuhammad ben Othman's policy\nMuhammad ben Othman Pasha became dey in 1766 as his predecessor Dey Ali Bousbaa  [fr] had wished He ruled over a powerful and prosperous Algiers for a full quarter-century until he died in 1791 [111] [223] He was a \"rational, courageous, and determined man who adhered to working according to Islamic law, loved jihad, was austere even with regard to public treasury funds\", according to the memoirs of Ahmad Sharif al-Zahhar, a naqib al-ashraf of Algiers in its late Ottoman era [224] He successfully handled most of the problems he faced during his rule, especially Spanish and Portuguese raids, [225]  during which he placed in the state treasury 200.000 Algerian sequin that he had saved from his private salary and did not take it back [225]\n\n\nWar with Denmark\nDey Muhammad Othman Pasha increased the annual royalties paid by the Netherlands, Venice, Sweden and Denmark They accepted, except for Denmark, which assigned Frederick Kaas to lead four ships of the line, two bomb galiots and two frigates against the city of Algiers in 1770 The bombardment ended in failure [229] Algerian pirates attacked Dano-Norwegian ships for a whole year afterwards [230] Denmark submitted to the dey's conditions and agreed to pay 2.5 million dollars in compensation for the damage to the city, and provide 44 cannons, 500 quintals of gunpowder, and 50 sails It also agreed to ransom its captives and pay royalties every two years with various gifts to officials [231]\n\n\nWar with Spain\nThe War of the Spanish Succession, gave western bey Mustapha Bouchelaghem the opportunity to capture Oran and Mers-el Kebir in 1708, [232] but he lost them back in 1732 to a successful campaign by the Duke of Montemar [233] In 1775 Irish-born admiral of the Spanish Empire Alejandro O'Reilly led an expedition to knock down pirate activity in the Mediterranean The assault's spectacular failure dealt a humiliating blow to the Spanish military reorganisation [234]\n\n\nDecline of Algiers (1800–1830)\nThe Jews of Algiers became an economic power and eliminated many European merchant houses from the Mediterranean, which deeply worried the Marseillais defending their threatened monopoly [b] French consuls resented the Jews, and urged their king to pass ordinances to prevent them from trading in French ports But the Jewish merchants dealt in prize goods from the corsairs as well as in more usual merchandise, and were essential to the government because of their contacts and skill in aligning their affairs with the interests of the Algerian state [241] They were at the origin of various Algerian disputes with Spain and especially with France [241] [242]\n\n\nAlgerian Jewish merchants\nThe Jews of Algiers became an economic power and eliminated many European merchant houses from the Mediterranean, which deeply worried the Marseillais defending their threatened monopoly [b] French consuls resented the Jews, and urged their king to pass ordinances to prevent them from trading in French ports But the Jewish merchants dealt in prize goods from the corsairs as well as in more usual merchandise, and were essential to the government because of their contacts and skill in aligning their affairs with the interests of the Algerian state [241] They were at the origin of various Algerian disputes with Spain and especially with France [241] [242]\n\n\nCrisis of the 19th century\nDuring Napoleon's campaign in Egypt (1798-1801), Algiers supplied the French army with large quantities of wheat [244] In the early 19th century, it was struck with political turmoil and economic stress [245] Between 1803 and 1805, famine caused by failed wheat harvests resulted in public riots [245] that led to the death of prominent Jewish grain merchant Naphtali Busnash who was blamed for the shortages Dey Mustapha Pasha  [fr]'s assassination followed, despite encouraging an anti-Jewish pogrom, which began a 20-year period of coups, [245] in which seven deys perished [246]\n\n\nBarbary Wars\nInternal fiscal problems in the early 19th century led Algiers to again engage in widespread piracy against American and European shipping, taking full advantage of the Napoleonic Wars [259] As the most prominent Barbary state, [260] [261] wishing to profit and make political gains on divisions between European nations, Algiers declared war on the U.S in 1785 on the pretext of asserting its rights to search and seizure in the absence of a treaty with a given nation [262] It captured 11 American ships and enslaved 100 sailors In 1797 Raïs Hamidou captured 16 Portuguese ships and 118 prisoners [263] The U.S agreed to buy peace with Algiers in 1795 for $10 million including ransoms and annual tribute over 12 years [259] Another treaty with the Kingdom of Portugal in 1812 brought $690,337 in ransom and $500,000 in tribute [264] But Algiers was defeated in the Second Barbary War; U.S admiral Stephen Decatur captured the Algerian flagship Mashouda in a battle off Cape Gata, killing Raïs Hamidou on 17 June 1815 [265] Decatur went to Algiers and demanded war reparations from the dey and the immediate cessation of tribute to him on 29 June 1815 [265]\n\n\nFrench invasion\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the merchants of Algiers sold massive amounts of wheat to France, largely bought on credit Hussein Dey demanded in 1827 that the restored Kingdom of France pay a 31-year-old debt contracted by Napoleon in 1799 for supplies to feed the soldiers in his Napoleonic campaign in Egypt

[11]\n\n\nCasting\nWhen we had a workshop, he had people from the 1970s coming in to tell us how boxing was at those times and how they prepared Extensive research has gone into the making of the film; the way we speak, the body language, the costumes, art department, are all reflective of that.\n\n\nCharacters\nPa Ranjith inspired real life prominent boxers for the characters of the film Arya's character Kabilan was inspired from the famous American boxer Muhammad Ali, a still from that film released by the makers, resembled that of Muhammad Ali's pose in the film [28] Vembuli's (John Kokken) role was modelled on Mike Tyson [28] The character 'Dancing' Rose played by Shabeer Kallarakkal [29] was inspired from the British boxer Naseem Hamed, who was known for his unique fluidic movements that almost mimics a dance form [30] Santhosh Pratap's character Raman, was based on George Foreman, who is considered to be one of the oldest heavyweight champions in the history of international boxing The character 'Beedi' Rayappan (played by Gajapathi) too was inspired from Kitheri Muthu, a fisherman-boxer, who was known for defeating a prominent Anglo-Indian boxer Nat Terry [31] Inspired by Muthu's prowess, \"Periyar\" E V Ramaswamy, the social activist and the founder of Dravidar Kazhagam, bestowed the title of 'Dravida Veeran' (The Dravidian braveheart) to Muthu [32]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography was initially reported to kickstart in November 2019 [33] By February 2020, filming was 50% complete [13] It was later suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent government-induced lockdown Despite reports that filming would resume on 15 September 2020, [34] it did so on 18 September [35] The shooting of the film was mostly set in and around North Chennai Principal photography wrapped in mid-December 2020 [36]\n\n\nThemes and analysis\nThe film is mostly based on the life of North Chennai based boxers, and had influences of political ideologies, unlike Ranjith's previous films Madras, Kabali and Kaala, which focus on the life of the lower-class people and caste system in Hinduism [37] It includes references to Ambedkarism, Self-Respect Movement and Buddhism, as Ranjith is an ardent follower of the ideologies of B R Ambedkar and it was translated in his films to propose the subject of Dalit colossus [38] [39] In one scene, the film shows about Indian Republic Party (IRP), rooted from Ambedkar's Scheduled Castes Federation [32] [40]\n\n\nMusic\nSanthosh Narayanan composed the soundtrack and film's score for the film; It marked the composer's fifth consecutive and final film with Pa Ranjith, since his and the director's debut film Attakathi (2012) According to Santhosh, he said that \"the film is influenced by the aspects of Madras, as it is mostly about the descriptive and realistic portrayal of North Chennai, while the boxing culture during the 1970s also serve as the subplot\" [46] To stay authentic to the music of that period, Santhosh chose to bring instruments used in the 1970s, instead of echoing film music from that era [47] Since, the instruments used in that period were made of skin, he met veteran gaana musicians such as Rev Ravi and Gana Bala, who still had access to those instruments For the background score, Santhosh replicated the theme music of The Hateful Eight originally composed by Ennio Morricone, for this film [48] The album and score is made with the mix of Tamil folk and brass instrument, as he was inspired by the music of Black Panther (2018), which fused African instruments with orchestral music [47]\n\n\nRelease\nSarpatta Parambarai was initially scheduled for a theatrical release but was later decided for a direct-to-streaming release through Amazon Prime Video due to COVID-19-related cinema closures [55] The broadcast rights of the film were acquired by Kalaignar TV [56] On 8 July 2021, Amazon Prime Video India announced a series of the original shows and contents for the service's July release lineup, to coincide with the Prime Day celebrations (26–27 July), [57] with Sarpatta Parambarai being scheduled for release on 22 July 2021 [58] [59] The film was released along with a Telugu dubbed version Sarpatta Parampara [60]\n\n\nCritical reception\nM Suganth of The Times of India, rated 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"The film’s major success lies in transporting us to the era and ensuring that not a character or a prop feels out of place\" and praised the casting and production design He further added \"Even as the drama around boxing keeps us hooked, as in this director’s films, the social and political undertones give us another story in parallel — of another community, which has to fight both inside and outside the ring to reclaim its rights\" [61] Sowmya Rajendran of The News Minute gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Sarpatta Parambarai is like watching a live match ― it brings the heat of the sport, the excitement of each move, and most of all, the glorious unpredictability of sport\" [62] Srinivasa Ramanujam of The Hindu praised Pa Ranjith for the setting of North Madras in the 1970s, and further said that \"the incorporating of elements such as caste conflict and the question of pride into the sporting milleu makes the film an engaging watch\" [63]\n\n\nControversies\nIn 1980, M G Ramachandran brought boxing icon Muhammad Ali to Chennai in order to raise funds for Tamil Nadu Amateur Boxing Association, but it was not showcased by the team [32] Former Tamil Nadu fisheries minister D Jayakumar from the AIADMK government, criticised Ranjith for the portrayal of Ramachandran in poor light He further recalled the schemes introduced by Ramachandran to encourage sportspersons from underprivileged backgrounds to participate in international sports events and said \"Not only in boxing, MGR also excelled in other sports like maan kombu (a type of martial art), fencing and horse riding In most of his films, he showcased himself as a sportsman Inspired by his films, many of his fans took up sports\" He further called the film a \"DMK propaganda film\", following the incident and also questioned Ranjith about criticising the DMK in the past [74] [75] One of the kins of boxer Kitheri Muthu noted the inaccuracies in the film; it had few dialogues spoken by Arya, that a student of Rangan Vaathiyar defeated Nat Terry in the film, but Kitheri Muthu, who was the first boxer of Sarpatta Parambarai in 1940s, defeated Terry [76] [77]\n\n\nAccolades\nSarpatta Parambarai became the most watched Tamil film of the year on Amazon Prime Video, [81] and became the second-most watched regional film on the streaming service only bested by Soorarai Pottru (2020), another Amazon original film [81] Many celebrities such as directors and actors among the Tamil film fraternity, praised the film through social media [82] A report said that the film has been watched over multiple households living across 3,200 towns and cities in India, and was further streamed in more than 150 countries and territories across the world [83] A still featuring Kabilan (Arya) and Rangan Vaathiyar (Pasupathy), was widely parodied by netizens and used in internet memes [84] It was listed as one of the \"best Tamil films of 2021\" according to several publications: The Indian Express, [85] The News Minute, [86] Hindustan Times, [87] Firstpost, [88] and India Today [89] According to the social networking site Letterboxd, it also secured the 14th position in the \"highest rated International films of 2021\" [90] The New York Times listed it as one of \"the five best International films to stream on digital platforms\" [91] Raj Shinde, critic-based at the Indian news website ThePrint, cited Sarpatta Parambarai an example on \"how Indian film industry being evolved with anti-caste films in 2021\" [92]\n\n\nImpact\nSarpatta Parambarai became the most watched Tamil film of the year on Amazon Prime Video, [81] and became the second-most watched regional film on the streaming service only bested by Soorarai Pottru (2020), another Amazon original film [81] Many celebrities such as directors and actors among the Tamil film fraternity, praised the film through social media [82] A report said that the film has been watched over multiple households living across 3,200 towns and cities in India, and was further streamed in more than 150 countries and territories across the world [83] A still featuring Kabilan (Arya) and Rangan Vaathiyar (Pasupathy), was widely parodied by netizens and used in internet memes [84] It was listed as one of the \"best Tamil films of 2021\" according to several publications: The Indian Express, [85] The News Minute, [86] Hindustan Times, [87] Firstpost, [88] and India Today [89] According to the social networking site Letterboxd, it also secured the 14th position in the \"highest rated International films of 2021\" [90] The New York Times listed it as one of \"the five best International films to stream on digital platforms\" [91] Raj Shinde, critic-based at the Indian news website ThePrint, cited Sarpatta Parambarai an example on \"how Indian film industry being evolved with anti-caste films in 2021\" [92]\n\n\nSequel\nA sequel was announced in March 2023, which was tentatively titled as Sarpatta Parambarai: Round 2 with Ranjith returning to direction and Arya reprising his role as Kabilan Munirathnam [93]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Sarpatta Parambarai**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSarpatta Parambarai is a 2021 Indian Tamil-language sports drama film written and directed by Pa.

the way we speak, the body language, the costumes, art department, are all reflective of that.\n\n\nCharacters\nPa Ranjith inspired real life prominent boxers for the characters of the film Arya's character Kabilan was inspired from the famous American boxer Muhammad Ali, a still from that film released by the makers, resembled that of Muhammad Ali's pose in the film [28] Vembuli's (John Kokken) role was modelled on Mike Tyson [28] The character 'Dancing' Rose played by Shabeer Kallarakkal [29] was inspired from the British boxer Naseem Hamed, who was known for his unique fluidic movements that almost mimics a dance form [30] Santhosh Pratap's character Raman, was based on George Foreman, who is considered to be one of the oldest heavyweight champions in the history of international boxing The character 'Beedi' Rayappan (played by Gajapathi) too was inspired from Kitheri Muthu, a fisherman-boxer, who was known for defeating a prominent Anglo-Indian boxer Nat Terry [31] Inspired by Muthu's prowess, \"Periyar\" E V Ramaswamy, the social activist and the founder of Dravidar Kazhagam, bestowed the title of 'Dravida Veeran' (The Dravidian braveheart) to Muthu [32]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography was initially reported to kickstart in November 2019 [33] By February 2020, filming was 50% complete [13] It was later suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent government-induced lockdown Despite reports that filming would resume on 15 September 2020, [34] it did so on 18 September [35] The shooting of the film was mostly set in and around North Chennai Principal photography wrapped in mid-December 2020 [36]\n\n\nThemes and analysis\nThe film is mostly based on the life of North Chennai based boxers, and had influences of political ideologies, unlike Ranjith's previous films Madras, Kabali and Kaala, which focus on the life of the lower-class people and caste system in Hinduism [37] It includes references to Ambedkarism, Self-Respect Movement and Buddhism, as Ranjith is an ardent follower of the ideologies of B R Ambedkar and it was translated in his films to propose the subject of Dalit colossus [38] [39] In one scene, the film shows about Indian Republic Party (IRP), rooted from Ambedkar's Scheduled Castes Federation [32] [40]\n\n\nMusic\nSanthosh Narayanan composed the soundtrack and film's score for the film; It marked the composer's fifth consecutive and final film with Pa Ranjith, since his and the director's debut film Attakathi (2012) According to Santhosh, he said that \"the film is influenced by the aspects of Madras, as it is mostly about the descriptive and realistic portrayal of North Chennai, while the boxing culture during the 1970s also serve as the subplot\" [46] To stay authentic to the music of that period, Santhosh chose to bring instruments used in the 1970s, instead of echoing film music from that era [47] Since, the instruments used in that period were made of skin, he met veteran gaana musicians such as Rev Ravi and Gana Bala, who still had access to those instruments For the background score, Santhosh replicated the theme music of The Hateful Eight originally composed by Ennio Morricone, for this film [48] The album and score is made with the mix of Tamil folk and brass instrument, as he was inspired by the music of Black Panther (2018), which fused African instruments with orchestral music [47]\n\n\nRelease\nSarpatta Parambarai was initially scheduled for a theatrical release but was later decided for a direct-to-streaming release through Amazon Prime Video due to COVID-19-related cinema closures [55] The broadcast rights of the film were acquired by Kalaignar TV [56] On 8 July 2021, Amazon Prime Video India announced a series of the original shows and contents for the service's July release lineup, to coincide with the Prime Day celebrations (26–27 July), [57] with Sarpatta Parambarai being scheduled for release on 22 July 2021 [58] [59] The film was released along with a Telugu dubbed version Sarpatta Parampara [60]\n\n\nCritical reception\nM Suganth of The Times of India, rated 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"The film’s major success lies in transporting us to the era and ensuring that not a character or a prop feels out of place\" and praised the casting and production design He further added \"Even as the drama around boxing keeps us hooked, as in this director’s films, the social and political undertones give us another story in parallel — of another community, which has to fight both inside and outside the ring to reclaim its rights\" [61] Sowmya Rajendran of The News Minute gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote \"Sarpatta Parambarai is like watching a live match ― it brings the heat of the sport, the excitement of each move, and most of all, the glorious unpredictability of sport\" [62] Srinivasa Ramanujam of The Hindu praised Pa Ranjith for the setting of North Madras in the 1970s, and further said that \"the incorporating of elements such as caste conflict and the question of pride into the sporting milleu makes the film an engaging watch\" [63]\n\n\nControversies\nIn 1980, M G Ramachandran brought boxing icon Muhammad Ali to Chennai in order to raise funds for Tamil Nadu Amateur Boxing Association, but it was not showcased by the team [32] Former Tamil Nadu fisheries minister D Jayakumar from the AIADMK government, criticised Ranjith for the portrayal of Ramachandran in poor light He further recalled the schemes introduced by Ramachandran to encourage sportspersons from underprivileged backgrounds to participate in international sports events and said \"Not only in boxing, MGR also excelled in other sports like maan kombu (a type of martial art), fencing and horse riding In most of his films, he showcased himself as a sportsman Inspired by his films, many of his fans took up sports\" He further called the film a \"DMK propaganda film\", following the incident and also questioned Ranjith about criticising the DMK in the past [74] [75] One of the kins of boxer Kitheri Muthu noted the inaccuracies in the film; it had few dialogues spoken by Arya, that a student of Rangan Vaathiyar defeated Nat Terry in the film, but Kitheri Muthu, who was the first boxer of Sarpatta Parambarai in 1940s, defeated Terry [76] [77]\n\n\nAccolades\nSarpatta Parambarai became the most watched Tamil film of the year on Amazon Prime Video, [81] and became the second-most watched regional film on the streaming service only bested by Soorarai Pottru (2020), another Amazon original film [81] Many celebrities such as directors and actors among the Tamil film fraternity, praised the film through social media [82] A report said that the film has been watched over multiple households living across 3,200 towns and cities in India, and was further streamed in more than 150 countries and territories across the world [83] A still featuring Kabilan (Arya) and Rangan Vaathiyar (Pasupathy), was widely parodied by netizens and used in internet memes [84] It was listed as one of the \"best Tamil films of 2021\" according to several publications: The Indian Express, [85] The News Minute, [86] Hindustan Times, [87] Firstpost, [88] and India Today [89] According to the social networking site Letterboxd, it also secured the 14th position in the \"highest rated International films of 2021\" [90] The New York Times listed it as one of \"the five best International films to stream on digital platforms\" [91] Raj Shinde, critic-based at the Indian news website ThePrint, cited Sarpatta Parambarai an example on \"how Indian film industry being evolved with anti-caste films in 2021\" [92]\n\n\nImpact\nSarpatta Parambarai became the most watched Tamil film of the year on Amazon Prime Video, [81] and became the second-most watched regional film on the streaming service only bested by Soorarai Pottru (2020), another Amazon original film [81] Many celebrities such as directors and actors among the Tamil film fraternity, praised the film through social media [82] A report said that the film has been watched over multiple households living across 3,200 towns and cities in India, and was further streamed in more than 150 countries and territories across the world [83] A still featuring Kabilan (Arya) and Rangan Vaathiyar (Pasupathy), was widely parodied by netizens and used in internet memes [84] It was listed as one of the \"best Tamil films of 2021\" according to several publications: The Indian Express, [85] The News Minute, [86] Hindustan Times, [87] Firstpost, [88] and India Today [89] According to the social networking site Letterboxd, it also secured the 14th position in the \"highest rated International films of 2021\" [90] The New York Times listed it as one of \"the five best International films to stream on digital platforms\" [91] Raj Shinde, critic-based at the Indian news website ThePrint, cited Sarpatta Parambarai an example on \"how Indian film industry being evolved with anti-caste films in 2021\" [92]\n\n\nSequel\nA sequel was announced in March 2023, which was tentatively titled as Sarpatta Parambarai: Round 2 with Ranjith returning to direction and Arya reprising his role as Kabilan Munirathnam [93]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

George II decided not to travel to Germany for his father's funeral, which far from bringing criticism led to praise from the English who considered it proof of his fondness for England.

Frederick had been left behind in Germany when his parents came to England, and they had not met for 14 years. In 1728, he was brought to England, and swiftly became a figurehead of the political opposition. When George visited Hanover in the summers of 1729, 1732 and 1735, he left his wife to chair the regency council in Britain rather than his son. Meanwhile, rivalry between George II and his brother-in-law and first cousin Frederick William I of Prussia led to tension along the Prussian-Hanoverian border, which eventually culminated in the mobilization of troops in the border zone and suggestions of a duel between the two kings. Negotiations for a marriage between the Prince of Wales and Frederick William's daughter Wilhelmine dragged on for years but neither side would make the concessions demanded by the other, and the idea was shelved. Instead, the prince married Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha in April 1736.\n\n**War and Rebellion**\n\nAgainst Walpole's wishes, but to George's delight, Britain reopened hostilities with Spain in 1739. Britain's conflict with Spain, the War of Jenkins' Ear, became part of the War of the Austrian Succession when a major European dispute broke out upon the death of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. At issue was the right of Charles's daughter, Maria Theresa, to succeed to his Austrian dominions. George spent the summers of 1740 and 1741 in Hanover, where he was more able to intervene directly in European diplomatic affairs in his capacity as elector.\n\n**Planning for Succession**\n\nIn the general election of 1747, Frederick, Prince of Wales, again campaigned actively for the opposition but Pelham's party won easily. Like his father before him, Frederick entertained opposition figures at his house in Leicester Square. When Frederick died unexpectedly in 1751, his eldest son, Prince George, became heir apparent. The King commiserated with Frederick's widow, Augusta, and wept with her. As her son would not reach the age of majority until 1756, a new British Regency Act was passed that would make her regent, assisted by a council led by Frederick's brother William in case of George II's death. The King also made a new will, which provided for William to be sole regent in Hanover. After the death of his daughter Louisa at the end of the year, George lamented, \"This has been a fatal year for my family. I lost my eldest son – but I am glad of it… Now [Louisa] is gone I know I did not love my children when they were young: I hated to have them running into my room; but now I love them as well as most fathers.\"\n\n**Seven Years' War**\n\nIn 1754 Pelham died, to be succeeded by his elder brother, Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle.\n\n**Death**\n\nBy October 1760 George II was blind in one eye and hard of hearing.

He had no interest in reading, or in the arts and sciences, and preferred to spend his leisure hours stag-hunting on horseback or playing cards. In 1737, he founded the Georg August University of Göttingen, the first university in the Electorate of Hanover, and visited it in 1748. The asteroid 359 Georgia was named in his honour at the university in 1902.

Babylonian Exile According to the Babylonian Talmud, Shimon HaTzadik met with Alexander the Great when the Macedonian army passed through the Land of Israel and convinced him not to destroy the Second

otherworldly dimension of Outworld If Outworld achieves ten consecutive victories, the Outworld Emperor will invade and conquer the Earthrealm They have already won nine times Shaolin monk Liu Kang, movie star Johnny Cage, and special forces officer Sonya Blade are chosen by Rayden, the god of thunder and defender of Earthrealm, to prevent Outworld from winning their tenth straight tournament Liu seeks revenge against the tournament host Shang Tsung for killing his brother Chan and taking his soul; Sonya is lured onto the ship headed for Shang Tsung's island by crime boss Kano, who murdered her partner; Johnny seeks to debunk media claims that his martial arts skills are faked.\n\n\nCast\nGoro, the reigning Mortal Kombat champion, is physically portrayed by Tom Woodruff, Jr and voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson, both of whom were uncredited Gregory McKinney appears as Jaxx Frank Welker makes an uncredited appearance as the voice of the Outworld Emperor, in addition to providing vocal effects for Goro and Reptile.\n\n\nDevelopment and pre-production\nWhile Mortal Kombat II was in the playtest phase and the original Mortal Kombat had still only been released in arcades, not for home consoles, movie producer Lawrence Kasanoff visited some friends at the game's publisher, Midway Games, and played a Mortal Kombat unit that was in their offices He saw cinematic possibilities in the concept and expressed interest in making a film based on the game, but Midway head Neil D Nicastro disagreed that the game could be a successful film, particularly given the failure of past movie adaptations of video games After months of negotiations, Kasanoff finally acquired a limited option on the Mortal Kombat film rights [4]\n\n\nCasting\nA relative unknown, Robin Shou, was cast as the film's lead character Liu Kang Shou was a wushu champion turned Hong Kong stuntman and actor, whose only prior credit in an American film was in the made-for-television feature Forbidden Nights Shou, who just quitted Hong Kong film industry and returned to the United States, originally turned down the role, because he thought he'd be cast as a stereotypical Asian villain It was only after his agent told him that Liu Kang was the film's hero that he reconsidered Dustin Nguyen also considered auditioning for the role Jason Scott Lee refused the offer to portray the character.\n\n\nProduction\nFilming began in August 1994 and ended in December 1994 The Outworld exterior scenes were filmed at the abandoned Kaiser Steel mill (now the Auto Club Speedway) in Fontana, California, while all of Goro's scenes were filmed in Los Angeles.\n\n\nFilming\nFilming began in August 1994 and ended in December 1994 The Outworld exterior scenes were filmed at the abandoned Kaiser Steel mill (now the Auto Club Speedway) in Fontana, California, while all of Goro's scenes were filmed in Los Angeles.\n\n\nFight scenes\nThe film's main fight and stunt coordinator was martial artist Pat E Johnson, whose previous credits had included Enter the Dragon, The Karate Kid, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Because of Robin Shou's past experiences as a Hong Kong stuntman, Johnson gave him free rein to incorporate his ideas into the choreography, and Shou would ultimately be credited as \"Fight choreographer: additional sequences.\" One of Shou's innovations was the incorporation of wirework, making Mortal Kombat one of the first Hollywood films to do so.\n\n\nSpecial effects\nGoro was portrayed by an elaborate $1 million animatronic created by Tom Woodruff Jr and Alec Gillis of Amalgamated Dynamics and operated by 13 to 16 puppeteers [4] This advanced construct proved a continuous source of problems on the set; Goro frequently broke down, and the person operating Goro from inside could only do so for two minutes at a time due to lack of oxygen [12] Though Anderson did his best to block and shoot Goro in a way that worked around the animatronic's limitations, [4] ultimately Goro's screen time had to be severely reduced from what was originally planned [12]\n\n\nMPAA rating\nBecause they wanted the film to have a PG-13 rating while staying as close as possible to the video game, the producers talked extensively with the rating board to learn the precise limitations of the rating and attempted to creatively optimize the amount of violence and foul language in the film within those limitations For instance, they learned that the PG-13 rating forbids onscreen death, but only of human characters, so they had all the deaths of non-humans take place onscreen [4]\n\n\nMusic\nThe film's score album was composed by George S Clinton, released by Rykodisc on October 11, 1995 The film's soundtrack album was released by TVT Records on August 15, 1995 The soundtrack album went platinum [17] in less than a year reaching No 10 on the Billboard 200 [18]\n\n\nRelease\n\nThe film was originally scheduled for a May 1995 U.S release but was pushed back to August According to Kasanoff, this was because New Line Cinema's executives felt the film had the potential to be a summer hit [21] It was released on October 20 in the United Kingdom, and on December 26 in Australia.\n\n\nReception\nMortal Kombat opened on August 18, 1995, and was #1 at the box office for the weekend with $23.2 million, nearly eight times the opening amount of the only other new release that weekend, The Baby-Sitters Club At the time, it was the second-highest August opening after 1993's The Fugitive The film enjoyed a three-week stint at number one, [2] grossing $73 million domestically in the United States [22] [23] It also earned $51.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $124.7 million The film became the highest-grossing adaptation of a video game before being surpassed by Pokémon: The First Movie in 1998.\n\n\nBox office\nMortal Kombat opened on August 18, 1995, and was #1 at the box office for the weekend with $23.2

the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.8/10 The site's critics consensus reads, \"Despite an effective otherworldly atmosphere and appropriately cheesy visuals, Mortal Kombat suffers from its poorly constructed plot, laughable dialogue, and subpar acting.\" [24] Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 60 out 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [25] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale [26]\n\n\nLegacy and re-evaluation\nFrom the 1998 founding of Rotten Tomatoes until 2018, Mortal Kombat held the highest critical rating on the site of any video game adaptation [35] [36] Critical re-evaluations have been mixed but mostly positive due to the well-crafted action sequences, the cast performances, and the exotic set designs, and the film is considered a cult classic [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] The video game series itself would take cues from the movie in its lore, such as the retconning of Kano (originally a Japanese-American character) as Australian following Trevor Goddard's performance.\n\n\nOther media\nA sequel entitled Mortal Kombat Annihilation was released in 1997 It was directed by John R Leonetti, who was the cinematographer of the first film Only Robin Shou and Talisa Soto reprised their roles, with the others being recast Its storyline is largely an

Tarkatan minions Upon arriving at the island where the battles take place, Rayden retells the origins of Shang Tsung, Goro, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and the Great Kung Lao in between fight scenes.\n\n\nNovelization\nA novelization of the movie by \"Martin Delrio\" (James D Macdonald and Debra Doyle) was released through Tor Books It is based on an early version of the film's script, and as such it includes several deleted or unfilmed scenes, such as a fight between Sonya Blade and Jade [ISBN missing]\n\n\nTelevision series\nThreshold Entertainment produced two television series related to the film, the animated Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm and the live-action Mortal Kombat: Conquest Defenders of the Realm, which aired on the USA Network's Action Extreme Team animation block in 1996, served as an alternative sequel and featured Liu Kang, Kitana, Sub-Zero, Sonya Blade, Jax, Kurtis Stryker, and Nightwolf as the eponymous heroes Conquest served as a prequel

frequently broke down, and the person operating Goro from inside could only do so for two minutes at a time due to lack of oxygen [12] Though Anderson did his best to block and shoot Goro in a way that worked around the animatronic's limitations, [4] ultimately Goro's screen time had to be severely reduced from what was originally planned [12]\n\n\nMPAA rating\nBecause they wanted the film to have a PG-13 rating while staying as close as possible to the video game, the producers talked extensively with the rating board to learn the precise limitations of the rating and attempted to creatively optimize the amount of violence and foul language in the film within those limitations For instance, they learned that the PG-13 rating forbids onscreen death, but only of human characters, so they had all the deaths of non-humans take place onscreen [4]\n\n\nMusic\nThe film's score album was composed by George S Clinton, released by Rykodisc on October 11, 1995 The film's soundtrack album was released by TVT Records on August 15, 1995 The soundtrack album went platinum [17] in less than a year reaching No 10 on the Billboard 200 [18]\n\n\nRelease\n\nThe film was originally scheduled for a May 1995 U.S release but was pushed back to August According to Kasanoff, this was because New Line Cinema's executives felt the film had the potential to be a summer hit [21] It was released on October 20 in the United Kingdom, and on December 26 in Australia.\n\n\nReception\nMortal Kombat opened on August 18, 1995, and was #1 at the box office for the weekend with $23.2 million, nearly eight times the opening amount of the only other new release that weekend, The Baby-Sitters Club At the time, it was the second-highest August opening after 1993's The Fugitive The film enjoyed a three-week stint at number one, [2] grossing $73 million domestically in the United States [22] [23] It also earned $51.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $124.7 million The film became the highest-grossing adaptation of a video game before being surpassed by Pokémon: The First Movie in 1998.\n\n\nBox office\nMortal Kombat opened on August 18, 1995, and was #1 at the box

Tomatoes, 47% of 45 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.8/10 The site's critics consensus reads, \"Despite an effective otherworldly atmosphere and appropriately cheesy visuals, Mortal Kombat suffers from its poorly constructed plot, laughable dialogue, and subpar acting.\" [24] Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 60 out 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" [25] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale [26]\n\n\nLegacy and re-evaluation\nFrom the 1998 founding of Rotten Tomatoes until 2018, Mortal Kombat held the highest critical rating on the site of any video game adaptation [35] [36] Critical re-evaluations have been mixed but mostly positive due to the well-crafted action sequences, the cast performances, and the exotic set designs, and the film is considered a cult classic [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] The video game series itself would take cues from the movie in its lore, such as the retconning of Kano (originally a Japanese-American character) as Australian following Trevor Goddard's performance.\n\n\nOther media\nA sequel entitled Mortal Kombat Annihilation was released in 1997 It was directed by John R Leonetti, who was the cinematographer of the first film Only Robin Shou and Talisa Soto reprised their roles, with the others

Kang, Johnny Cage, and Sonya Blade as they travel on a mysterious boat to the Mortal Kombat tournament On the way they meet Rayden, who provides them with hints about how to survive the tournament and defeat Shang Tsung and his army of Tarkatan minions Upon arriving at the island where the battles take place, Rayden retells the origins of Shang Tsung, Goro, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and the Great Kung Lao in between fight scenes.\n\n\nNovelization\nA novelization of the movie by \"Martin Delrio\" (James D Macdonald and Debra Doyle) was released through Tor Books It is based on an early version of the film's script, and as such it includes several deleted or unfilmed scenes, such as a fight between Sonya Blade and Jade [ISBN missing]\n\n\nTelevision series\nThreshold Entertainment produced two television series related to the film, the animated Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm and the live-action Mortal Kombat: Conquest Defenders of the Realm, which aired on the USA Network's Action Extreme Team animation block in 1996, served as an alternative sequel and featured Liu Kang, Kitana, Sub-Zero, Sonya Blade, Jax, Kurtis Stryker, and Nightwolf as the eponymous heroes Conquest served

{"title": "El_Camino:_A_Breaking_Bad_Movie", "content": "\nPlot\nIn a flashback to shortly before they leave Walter White's meth business, [N 1] Jesse Pinkman asks Mike Ehrmantraut where he would go to start over Mike says if he were younger, he would go to Alaska, which Jesse finds appealing Jesse expresses the desire to make amends for past wrongdoing, but Mike cautions that starting over would make that impossible.\n\n\nCast\nWhile El Camino's plot focuses on Jesse Pinkman escaping to Alaska, writer and director Vince Gilligan stated that thematically, the film centers on Jesse's transformation from a boy to a man As Jesse spent the entirety of Breaking Bad as Walter White's partner, El Camino in contrast shows Jesse coming to terms with his past and making his own decisions, free of White's influence [12] This theme is prevalent in the flashbacks that bookend El Camino, with Mike Ehrmantraut at the beginning, and Walter White and Jane Margolis at the end Alan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone detailed that while these scenes serve as a reminder of who Jesse used to be and all that he lost, \"all three flashbacks are also about the way that Jesse has been forced by tragic circumstance to grow up and think more about his place in the universe and the impact he has on others And they're about setting him on the road where Ed  [Galbraith] leaves him at the film's conclusion\" [7] Aaron Paul described his character Jesse as someone who went through \"hell and back multiple times\" and is still \"paying for those sins\", but Donna Bowman of The A.V Club remarked

White's manipulations, Jesse found his own redemption and avoided his mentor's fate, finally giving himself a chance for a future [13] [14]\n\n\nProduction\nVince Gilligan, the creator and showrunner of Breaking Bad, had the idea for El Camino while writing the series finale \"Felina\" He asked himself what happened to Jesse Pinkman after the events of the episode when Jesse escaped from the neo-Nazis' compound after being rescued by Walter White [17] Though he kept Jesse's fate ambiguous in the finale's script, Gilligan offered two possibilities during interviews: a more realistic one where the police caught Jesse a few miles from the compound, and a second, more optimistic one where he got away but still had to cope with the terrible things he witnessed throughout the series [24] [25]\n\n\nConception\nVince Gilligan, the creator and showrunner of Breaking Bad, had the idea for El Camino while writing the series finale \"Felina\" He asked himself what happened to Jesse Pinkman after the events of the episode when Jesse escaped from the neo-Nazis' compound after being rescued by Walter White [17] Though he kept Jesse's fate ambiguous in the finale's script, Gilligan offered two possibilities during interviews: a more realistic one where the police caught Jesse a few miles from the compound, and a second, more optimistic one where he got away but still had to cope with the terrible things he witnessed throughout the series [24] [25]\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe original idea for continuing Jesse Pinkman's story began as a short film or \"mini-episode\" of about 15 to 20 minutes in length Realizing a short would not be cost-effective, Gilligan opted to make a full-length feature film [17] He initially thought about titling the project '63, referring to its unofficial status as the 63rd episode of Breaking Bad [12] However, during the meeting where Gilligan pitched story ideas with the Better Call Saul staff, series executive producer Thomas Schnauz advised him to change this proposed title [17] [12] Schnauz, who served as an executive producer and a writer on both television series, reasoned to Gilligan that Breaking Bad essentially focused on Walter White's story, whereas the film and its title should be unique to reflect that they centered on Jesse Pinkman [30] [12] Gilligan agreed and eventually settled on the title El Camino, referring to the car Jesse drives away with in \"Felina\" [12]\n\n\nWriting\nUnlike most of his work from The X-Files, Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, where he collaborated with a writers room to develop his scripts and meet his deadlines, Gilligan wrote the film's screenplay alone until he felt it was ready to present Regarding El Camino as a coda to Breaking Bad, Gilligan believed the film would primarily appeal to fans and would not be as enjoyable to those who had not watched the series This influenced his decision to write it as a direct continuation rather than inserting exposition scenes to try to attract new viewers [2] He felt El Camino could be seen independently from both Breaking Bad and its spinoff Better Call Saul, similarly to how the two series could be seen independently from one another However, he also believed the three works existed together in a larger framework, and that viewers needed to watch all of them together to receive the full experience [17]\n\n\nFilming\nUnder the working title Greenbrier, a majority of the filming occurred in Albuquerque, New Mexico from November 2018 to February 2019, with the overall shoot lasting 50 days [48] [49] [2] El Camino had a more relaxed shooting pace than Breaking Bad, with only one-and-a-half to three pages of script filmed per day as opposed to six to eight [2] This less-pressured schedule gave the actors more opportunities to improvise on set while providing the crew members additional time to film a wider variety of shots and further camera coverage [50] [51] Gilligan felt the slower pace allowed him to reflect and feel a greater sense of finality for his creation whilst filming [17]\n\n\nCinematography\nEl Camino used a 2.39:1 widescreen aspect ratio on the Arri Alexa 65 camera to capture the work in a cinematic manner [2] Gilligan and cinematographer Marshall Adams specifically chose the Alexa 65 for its quality in low-light filming, which the film heavily featured Using this camera also meant El Camino would be shot digitally, as opposed to Breaking Bad which shot on 35mm film stock [57] Production designer Judy Rhee noted that Gilligan took advantage of his lens and wider aspect ratio to create a more visually luxurious experience than the series, letting the wide vista shots help meet El Camino's plot beats rather than employing more economic options commonly used for television [58] Adams agreed with this opinion, citing as an example the vast and empty space of the Painted Desert underscoring Jesse's lonely and hopeless state in Todd's captivity [59]\n\n\nSet design\nFilming primarily occurred at Albuquerque Studios, where both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul were shot, along with other locations throughout the city [62] [57] Wireless microphones would be planted throughout the sets and on the actors to record natural ambient noise and dialogue while shooting, as Gilligan preferred using organic sounds over applying ADR during post-production [63]\n\n\nExterior locations\nThe enhanced budget and filming schedule gave Gilligan a chance to capture scenes outside of New Mexico, something he wanted but could not do during Breaking Bad [2] One such location included the Painted Desert in Arizona, where filming occurred for the scene of Jesse and Todd burying Todd's housekeeper [12] Gilligan had the idea of shooting in the region after multiple helicopter trips between California and Albuquerque, noting the landscape for its natural beauty As backroad travel in the Painted Desert required a permit, Gilligan received special permission from the Navajo Nation for filming [27] Paul and Plemons reached the Painted Desert set by a helicopter flown by Gilligan himself, who was a licensed pilot [69] The scene where Todd sings \"Sharing the Night Together\" in his El Camino was also shot in the area; Gilligan noted that Plemons improvised the gesture Todd gives to the truck driver [27] Gilligan later referred to his time filming in the Painted Desert as the single best day of directing in his career [70]\n\n\nSecrecy\n\"I've heard so many different things about it, but I am excited about the Breaking Bad movie .. I find it hard to believe you don't know it was shot They did it You know what I mean? How is that a secret? But it is They've done an amazing job of keeping it a secret.\"\n\n\nEditing\nThe elongated production schedule provided more time for editor Skip Macdonald to work on El Camino's individual scenes and build the film's overall flow [20] Macdonald, who also served as editor on Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, would describe maintaining rhythm and pacing without the use of commercial breaks as one of the biggest differences between his work on the film and the two television series [92] He also felt that Gilligan receiving more leeway during filming resulted in more interesting pieces and design shots during the editing process [20]  Gilligan waited until filming completed before entering the cutting room to give feedback; his initial viewing of Macdonald's rough cut was his first time seeing any production footage edited together [51]\n\n\nMusic\n\"The Breaking Bad  [score] is, at times, very, very spare and I think the El Camino score remains true to that, but there is complexity and a depth to the music that is fuller and greater in order to fill more sonic space in a theater That was something we were definitely after.\"\n\n\nScore\n\"The Breaking Bad  [score] is, at times, very, very spare and I think the El Camino score remains true to that, but there is complexity and a depth to the music that is fuller and greater in order to fill more sonic space in a theater That was something we were definitely after.\"\n\n\nLicensed tracks\nLicensed tracks were used sparingly in El Camino [98] Two prominent in the final cut included \"Sharing the Night Together\" by Dr Hook & the Medicine Show, which Todd sings in the car during his and Jesse's road trip, and \"Static on the Radio\" by Jim White, which ran over the end credits [107]\n\n\nMarketing\nNetflix officially announced El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie on August 24, 2019, unveiling the title, description, poster, logo, teaser trailer, and the October 11, 2019, release date for the film [109] Days prior, Netflix accidentally listed the film on its website, which users quickly noticed before it got pulled [110] Due to the secrecy of the project, fans and critics alike were taken aback by the sudden announcement, as well as by learning that the release date would come sooner than expected [111] [112] [113]\n\n\nTrailers\nThe first teaser released during El Camino's announcement featured a scene where the DEA interrogated Skinny Pete on Jesse Pinkman's whereabouts Charles Baker reprised the role in the public's first glimpse of the film [113] Though the scene was not used in the final cut,

film written and directed by Vince Gilligan. The film serves as a sequel to the series Breaking Bad and follows the story of Jesse Pinkman, a former methamphetamine producer and partner of the now-deceased Walter White. The film had its world premiere on October 7, 2019, at the Regency Village Theatre in Los Angeles, and was released on Netflix on October 11, 2019.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with a flashback to shortly before Walter White's meth business is shut down, where Jesse Pinkman asks Mike Ehrmantraut where he would go to start over. Mike suggests Alaska, which Jesse finds appealing. Jesse expresses the desire to make amends for past wrongdoing, but Mike cautions that starting over would make that impossible.\n\nThe film then jumps forward in time to Jesse's escape from the neo-Nazis' compound after being rescued by Walter White. Jesse is on the run, trying to evade capture by the DEA and the neo-Nazis. Along the way, he meets up with Skinny Pete, a friend from his past, and together they try to figure out what to do next.\n\nAs Jesse tries to navigate his new reality, he is haunted by the memories of his past and the people he has hurt. He is struggling to come to terms with the consequences of his actions and the emotional scars that he has accumulated.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a cast of returning characters from the Breaking Bad series, including Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, Charles Baker as Skinny Pete, Jesse Plemons as Todd, and Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut. The film also features new characters, including a DEA agent played by Krysten Ritter.\n\n**Themes and Style**\n\nWhile El Camino's plot focuses on Jesse Pinkman escaping to Alaska, writer and director Vince Gilligan stated that thematically, the film centers on Jesse's transformation from a boy to a man. As Jesse spent the entirety of Breaking Bad as Walter White's partner, El Camino in contrast shows Jesse coming to terms with his past and making his own decisions, free of White's influence.\n\nThis theme is prevalent in the flashbacks that bookend El Camino, with Mike Ehrmantraut at the beginning, and Walter White and Jane Margolis at the end. These scenes serve as a reminder of who Jesse used to be and all that he lost, but also about the way that Jesse has been forced by tragic circumstance to grow up and think more about his place in the universe and the impact he has on others.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe idea for El Camino began as a short film or \"mini-episode\" of about 15 to 20 minutes in length. Realizing a short would not be cost-effective, Gilligan opted to make a full-length feature film. He initially thought about titling the project '63, referring to its unofficial status as the 63rd episode of Breaking Bad. However, during the meeting where Gilligan pitched story ideas with the Better Call Saul staff, series executive producer Thomas Schnauz advised him to change this proposed title.\n\nSchnauz, who served as an executive producer and a writer on both television series, reasoned to Gilligan that Breaking Bad essentially focused on Walter White's story, whereas the film and its title should be unique to reflect that they centered on Jesse Pinkman. Gilligan agreed and eventually settled on the title El Camino, referring to the car Jesse drives away with in \"Felina\".\n\n**Writing**\n\nUnlike most of his work from The X-Files, Breaking Bad, and Better Call Saul, where he collaborated with a writers room to develop his scripts and meet his deadlines, Gilligan wrote the film's screenplay alone until he felt it was ready to present. He believed the film would primarily appeal to fans and would not be as enjoyable to those who had not watched the series. This influenced his decision to write it as a direct continuation rather than inserting exposition scenes to try to attract new viewers.\n\n**Filming**\n\nUnder the working title Greenbrier, a majority of the filming occurred in Albuquerque, New Mexico from November 2018 to February 2019, with the overall shoot lasting 50 days. El Camino had a more relaxed shooting pace than Breaking Bad, with only one-and-a-half to three pages of script filmed per day as opposed to six to eight. This less-pressured schedule gave the actors more opportunities to improvise on set while providing the crew members additional time to film a wider variety of shots and further camera coverage.\n\n**Cinematography**\n\nEl Camino used a 2.39:1 widescreen aspect ratio on the Arri Alexa 65 camera to capture the work in a cinematic manner. Gilligan and cinematographer Marshall Adams specifically chose the Alexa 65 for its quality in low-light filming, which the film heavily featured. Using this camera also meant El Camino would be shot digitally, as opposed to Breaking Bad which shot on 35mm film stock.\n\n**Set Design**\n\nFilming primarily occurred at Albuquerque Studios, where both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul were shot, along with other locations throughout the city. Wireless microphones would be planted throughout the sets and on the actors to record natural ambient noise and dialogue while shooting, as Gilligan preferred using organic sounds over applying ADR during post-production.\n\n**Exterior Locations**\n\nThe enhanced budget and filming schedule gave Gilligan a chance to capture scenes outside of New Mexico, something he wanted but could not do during Breaking Bad. One such location included the Painted Desert in Arizona, where filming occurred for the scene of Jesse and Todd burying Todd's housekeeper. Gilligan had the idea of shooting in the region after multiple helicopter trips between California and Albuquerque, noting the landscape for its natural beauty.\n\n**Secrecy**\n\nTo maintain secrecy, the cast and crew wore plainclothes and used pseudonyms during filming. The film's title and logo were not publicly revealed until the official announcement on August 24, 2019.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nNetflix officially announced El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie on August 24, 2019, unveiling the title, description, poster, logo, teaser trailer, and the October 11, 2019, release date for the film. Days prior, Netflix accidentally listed the film on its website, which users quickly noticed before it got pulled.\n\n**Trailers**\n\nThe first teaser released during El Camino's announcement featured a scene where the DEA interrogated Skinny Pete on Jesse Pinkman's whereabouts. Charles Baker reprised the role in the public's first glimpse of the film. Though the scene was not used in the final cut, some critics noted after the film's premiere of the trailer's significance in El Camino's chronology, speculating that it likely took place shortly after Jesse and Skinny Pete parted ways.\n\n**The Countdown to El Camino**\n\nBefore the release of El Camino, the Twitter accounts of Breaking Bad and Samsung US shared a countdown. Titled The Countdown to El Camino, the promotion resulted from Samsung's partnership with Netflix. The countdown would also be available as a 62-hour livestream on Samsung televisions prior to the film's release.\n\n**Snow Globe: A Breaking Bad Short**\n\nIn conjunction with the television premiere of El Camino on AMC, the network released a three-minute short film Snow Globe: A Breaking Bad Short on its official YouTube account on February 16, 2020. The short, directed by Eric Schmidt and written by Melissa Ng, stars Jesse Plemons as Todd with Laura Fraser providing her voice as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle.

primarily appeal to fans and would not be as enjoyable to those who had not watched the series This influenced his decision to write it as a direct continuation rather than inserting exposition scenes to try to attract new viewers [2] He felt El Camino could be seen independently from both Breaking Bad and its spinoff Better Call Saul, similarly to how the two series could be seen independently from one another However, he also believed the three works existed together in a larger framework, and that viewers needed to watch all of them together to receive the full experience [17]\n\n\nFilming\nUnder the working title Greenbrier, a majority of the filming occurred in Albuquerque, New Mexico from November 2018 to February 2019, with the overall shoot lasting 50 days [48] [49] [2] El Camino had a more relaxed shooting pace than Breaking Bad, with only one-and-a-half to three pages of script filmed per day as opposed to six to eight [2] This less-pressured schedule gave

camera also meant El Camino would be shot digitally, as opposed to Breaking Bad which shot on 35mm film stock [57] Production designer Judy Rhee noted that Gilligan took advantage of his lens and wider aspect ratio to create a more visually luxurious experience than the series, letting the wide vista shots help meet El Camino's plot beats rather than employing more economic options commonly used for television [58] Adams agreed with this opinion, citing as an example the vast and empty space of the Painted Desert underscoring Jesse's lonely and hopeless state in Todd's captivity [59]\n\n\nSet design\nFilming primarily occurred at Albuquerque Studios, where both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul were shot, along with other locations throughout the city [62] [57] Wireless

the region after multiple helicopter trips between California and Albuquerque, noting the landscape for its natural beauty As backroad travel in the Painted Desert required a permit, Gilligan received special permission from the Navajo Nation for filming [27] Paul and Plemons reached the Painted Desert set by a helicopter flown by Gilligan himself, who was a licensed pilot [69] The scene where Todd sings \"Sharing the Night Together\" in his El Camino was also shot in the area; Gilligan noted that Plemons improvised the gesture Todd gives to the truck driver [27] Gilligan later referred to his time filming in the Painted Desert as the single best day of directing in his career [70]\n\n\nSecrecy\n\"I've heard so many different things about it, but I am excited about the Breaking Bad movie .. I find it hard to believe you don't know it was shot They did it You know what I mean? How is that a secret? But it is They've done an amazing job of keeping it a secret.\"\n\n\nEditing\nThe elongated production schedule provided more time for editor Skip Macdonald to work on El Camino's individual scenes and build the film's overall flow [20] Macdonald, who also served as editor on Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, would describe maintaining rhythm and pacing without the use of commercial breaks as one of the biggest differences between his work on the film and the two television series [92] He also felt that Gilligan receiving more leeway during filming resulted in more interesting pieces and design shots during the editing process [20]  Gilligan waited until filming completed before entering the cutting room to give feedback; his initial viewing of Macdonald's rough cut was his first time seeing any production footage edited together [51]\n\n\nMusic\n\"The Breaking Bad  [score] is, at times, very, very spare and I think the El Camino score remains true to that, but there is complexity

El Camino as the proper conclusion to Jesse Pinkman's story, with neither having immediate plans for a sequel after the film's release [71] [199] Speculating on Jesse's new life in Haines, Alaska, following the events of El Camino, Gilligan surmised that Jesse \"would enjoy the brewery and maybe get a job with the ski manufacturer .. the very nice people of Alaska would welcome him into the community\" [71] Paul believed that Jesse is \"going to keep his nose clean He has quite a bit of cash on hand And he's going to live a very modest lifestyle He's moving to a very small place in Alaska, so he doesn't need all that much money He knows how to work with his hands, and so he just needs to refresh those skills and become the artist that he was always meant to be\"

{"title": "Lithuania", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe first known record of the name of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuva) is in a 9 March 1009 story of Saint Bruno in the Quedlinburg Chronicle [25] The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva: Litua [26] (pronounced  [litua]) Due to lack of reliable evidence, the true meaning of the name is unknown and scholars still debate it There are a few plausible versions [27]\n\n\nHistory\nThe history of Lithuania dates back to settlements founded about 10,000 years ago, [35] [36] but the first written record of the name for the country dates back to 1009 AD [37] Facing the German threat, Mindaugas in the middle of the 13th century united a large part of the Baltic tribes and founded the State of Lithuania, while in 1253 he was crowned as the Catholic King of Lithuania [38] [39] Moreover by taking advantage of the weakened territory of the former Kievan Rus' due to the Mongol invasion, Mindaugas has incorporated Black Ruthenia into Lithuania [38] After Mindaugas' assassination in 1263, pagan Lithuania was again a target of the Christian crusades of the Teutonic Knights and Livonian Order [40] Traidenis during his reign (1269–1282) reunified all Lithuanian lands and achieved military successes against the Crusaders, fighting alongside other Baltic tribes, but was unable to militarily assist the Old Prussians in their Great Uprising [41] Traidenis' main residence was in Kernavė [41]\n\n\nKingdom of Lithuania, Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth\nThe history of Lithuania dates back to settlements founded about 10,000 years ago, [35] [36] but the first written record of the name for the country dates back to 1009 AD [37] Facing the German threat, Mindaugas in the middle of the 13th century united a large part of the Baltic tribes and founded the State of Lithuania, while in 1253 he was crowned as the Catholic King of Lithuania [38] [39] Moreover by taking advantage of the weakened territory of the former Kievan Rus' due to the Mongol invasion, Mindaugas has incorporated Black Ruthenia into Lithuania [38] After Mindaugas' assassination in 1263, pagan Lithuania was again a target of the Christian crusades of the Teutonic Knights and Livonian Order [40] Traidenis during his reign (1269–1282) reunified all Lithuanian lands and achieved military successes against the Crusaders, fighting alongside other Baltic tribes, but was unable to militarily assist the Old Prussians in their Great Uprising [41] Traidenis' main residence was in Kernavė [41]\n\n\nEfforts to restore statehood\nFollowing the annexation the Russian Tsarist authorities implemented Russification policies in Lithuania, which then made a part of a new administrative region Northwestern Krai [53] In 1812 Napoleon during the French invasion of Russia has established the puppet Lithuanian Provisional Governing Commission to support his war efforts, however after Napoleon's defeat the Russian rule was reinstated in Lithuania [53]\n\n\nRestored statehood and occupations\nDuring World War I the German Empire annexed Lithuanian territories from the Russian Empire and they became a part of Ober Ost [56] In 1907, the Lithuanians organized the Vilnius Conference which adopted a resolution, featuring the aspiration for the restoration of Lithuania's sovereignty and military alliance with Germany and elected the Council of Lithuania [56] In 1918, the short-lived Kingdom of Lithuania was proclaimed; however on 16 February 1918 the Council of Lithuania adopted the Act of Independence of Lithuania which restored Lithuania as democratic republic with its capital in Vilnius and separated that state from all state relations that existed with other nations [56] In 1918–1920 the Lithuanians defended the statehood of Lithuania during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence with Bolsheviks, Bermontians and Poles [56] The aims of the newly restored Lithuania clashed with Józef Piłsudski's plans to create a federation (Intermarium) in territories previously ruled by the Jagiellonians [57] The Lithuanian authorities prevented the 1919 Polish coup attempt in Lithuania and in 1920 during the Żeligowski's Mutiny the Polish forces captured Vilnius Region and established a puppet state of the Republic of Central Lithuania, which in 1922 was incorporated into Poland [56] Consequently, Kaunas became the temporary capital of Lithuania where the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania was held and other primary Lithuanian institutions operated until 1940 [58] In 1923, the Klaipėda Revolt was organized which unified the Klaipėda Region with Lithuania [59] The 1926 Lithuanian coup d'état replaced the democratically elected government and president with an authoritarian regime led by Antanas Smetona [59]\n\n\n1990–present\nOn 11 March 1990, the Supreme Council announced the restoration of Lithuania's independence Lithuania became the first Soviet-occupied state to announce the restitution of independence On 20 April 1990, the Soviets imposed an economic blockade by ceasing to deliver supplies of raw materials to Lithuania [65] Not only domestic industry, but also the population started feeling the lack of fuel, essential goods, and even hot water Although the blockade lasted for 74 days, Lithuania did not renounce the declaration of independence.\n\n\nGeography\nLithuania is located in the Baltic region of Europe [a] and covers an area of 65,300 km2 (25,200 sq mi) [81] It lies between latitudes 53° and 57° N, and mostly between longitudes 21° and 27° E (part of the Curonian Spit lies west of 21°) It has around 99 kilometres (61.5 mi) of sandy coastline, only about 38 kilometres (24 mi) of which face the open Baltic Sea, less than the other two Baltic states The rest of the coast is sheltered by the Curonian sand peninsula Lithuania's major warm-water port, Klaipėda, lies at the narrow mouth of the Curonian Lagoon (Lithuanian: Kuršių marios), a shallow lagoon extending south to Kaliningrad The country's main and largest river, the Nemunas River, and some of its tributaries carry international shipping.\n\n\nClimate\nLithuania has a temperate climate with both maritime and continental influences It is defined as humid continental (Dfb) under the Köppen climate classification (but is close to oceanic in a narrow coastal zone).\n\n\nEnvironment\nAfter the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 1990, the Aplinkos apsaugos įstatymas (Environmental Protection Act) was adopted already in 1992 The law provided the foundations for regulating social relations in the field of environmental protection, established the basic rights and obligations of legal and natural persons in preserving the biodiversity inherent in Lithuania, ecological systems and the landscape [86] Lithuania agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by 2020 and by at least 40% by 2030, together with all European Union members Also, by 2020 at least 20% (27% by 2030) of the country's total energy consumption should be from the renewable energy sources [87] In 2016, Lithuania introduced especially effective container deposit legislation, which resulted in collecting 92% of all packagings in 2017 [88]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nLithuanian ecosystems include natural and semi-natural (forests, bogs, wetlands and meadows), and anthropogenic (agrarian and urban) ecosystems Among natural ecosystems, forests are particularly important to Lithuania, covering 33% of the country's territory Wetlands (raised bogs, fens, transitional mires, etc.) cover 7.9% of the country, with 70% of wetlands having been lost due to drainage and peat extraction between 1960 and 1980 Changes in wetland plant communities resulted in the replacement of moss and grass communities by trees and shrubs, and fens not directly affected by land reclamation have become drier as a result of a drop in the water table There are 29,000 rivers with a total length of 64,000 km in Lithuania, the Nemunas River basin occupying 74% of the territory of the country Due to the construction of dams, approximately 70% of spawning sites of potential catadromous fish species have disappeared In some cases, river and lake ecosystems continue to be impacted by anthropogenic eutrophication [100]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nSince Lithuania declared the restoration of its independence on 11 March 1990, it has maintained strong democratic traditions It held its first independent general elections on 25 October 1992, in which 56.75% of voters supported the new constitution [102] There were intense debates concerning the constitution, particularly the role of the president A separate referendum was held on 23 May 1992 to gauge public opinion on the matter, and 41% of voters supported the restoration of the President of Lithuania [102] Through compromise, a semi-presidential system was agreed on [4]\n\n\nGovernment\nSince Lithuania declared the restoration of its independence on 11 March 1990, it has maintained strong democratic traditions It held its first independent general elections on 25

[4]\n\n\nPolitical parties and elections\nLithuania was one of the first countries in the world to grant women a right to vote in the elections Lithuanian women were allowed to vote by the 1918 Constitution of Lithuania and used their newly granted right for the first time in 1919 By doing so, Lithuania allowed it earlier than such democratic countries as the United States (1920), France (1945), Greece (1952), Switzerland (1971) [107]\n\n\nLaw and law enforcement\nThe first attempt to codify the Lithuanian laws was in 1468 when the Casimir's Code was compiled and adopted by Grand Duke Casimir IV Jagiellon [122] In the 16th century three editions of the Statutes of Lithuania were created with the First Statute being adopted in 1529, the Second Statute in 1566, and the Third Statute in 1588 [122] On 3 May 1791, the Europe's first and the world's second Constitution was adopted by the Great Sejm [123] The Third Statute was partly in force in the territory of Lithuania even until 1840, despite the Third Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795 [122]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe current system of administrative division was established in 1994 and modified in 2000 to meet the requirements of the European Union The country's 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular – apskritis, plural – apskritys) are subdivided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: singular – savivaldybė, plural – savivaldybės), and further divided into 500 elderships (Lithuanian: singular – seniūnija, plural – seniūnijos).\n\n\nForeign relations\nLithuania became a member of the United Nations on 18 September 1991, and is a signatory to a number of its organizations and other international agreements It is also a member of the European Union, the Council of Europe, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as NATO and its adjunct North Atlantic Coordinating Council Lithuania gained membership in the World Trade Organization on 31 May 2001, and joined the OECD on 5 July 2018, [142] while also seeking membership in other Western organizations.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe Lithuanian Armed Forces is the name for the unified armed forces of Lithuanian Land Force, Lithuanian Air Force, Lithuanian Naval Force, Lithuanian Special Operations Force and other units: Logistics Command, Training and Doctrine Command, Headquarters Battalion, Military Police Directly subordinated to the Chief of Defence are the Special Operations Forces and Military Police The Reserve Forces are under command of the Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces.\n\n\nEconomy\nLithuania has an open and mixed economy that is classified as a high-income economy by the World Bank [176] As of 2017 [update] the three largest sectors were – services (67% of GDP), industry (29%) and agriculture (3%) [177] Lithuania joined NATO in 2004, [178] EU in 2004, [179] Schengen in 2007 [180] and OECD in 2018 [142] On 1 January 2015, the euro became the national currency, replacing litas at the rate of EUR 1.00 = LTL 3.45280 [181]\n\n\nAgriculture\nAgriculture in Lithuania dates to the Neolithic period, about 3,000 to 1,000 BC It has been one of Lithuania's most important occupations for many centuries [206] Lithuania's accession to the European Union in 2004 ushered in a new agricultural era The EU pursues a very high standard of food safety and purity In 1999, the Seimas (parliament) of Lithuania adopted a Law on Product Safety, and in 2000 it adopted a Law on Food [207] [208] The reform of the agricultural market has been carried out on the basis of these two laws.\n\n\nScience and technology\nThe foundation of the University of Vilnius in 1579 was a major factor in fostering a scientific and academic community within Lithuania The university has welcomed such prominent scientists and thinkers as Georg Forster, Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert, Johann Peter Frank The 17th century artillery expert Kazimieras Simonavičius is considered a pioneer of rocketry; his publication, the Artis Magnae Artilleriae, was a basic artillery manual throughout Europe, containing a large chapter on caliber, construction, production and properties of rockets (for military and civil purposes), including multistage rockets, batteries of rockets, and rockets with delta wing stabilizers [211] [212] Botanist Jurgis Pabrėža (1771–1849) created the first systematic guide of Lithuanian flora, Taislius auguminis (Botany), written in the Samogitian dialect, the Latin-Lithuanian dictionary of plant names, and the first Lithuanian geography textbook German scientist Theodor Grotthuss (1785–1822), who proposed the Grotthuss mechanism, lived and worked in the Gedučiai manor  [lt], where he gained local prominence for his effort to educate and improve the well-being of peasants [213]\n\n\nTourism\nStatistics from 2023 showed 1.4 million tourists from foreign countries visited Lithuania and spent at least one night The largest number of tourists came from Poland (173,500), Latvia (144,300), Belarus (141,900), Germany (127,400), the United Kingdom (74,200), the United States (69,700), Ukraine (67,000), and Estonia (61,300) [244]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nLithuania has a well developed communications infrastructure The country has 2.8 million citizens [250] and 5 million SIM cards [251] The largest LTE (4G) mobile network covers 97% of Lithuania's territory [252] Usage of fixed phone lines has been rapidly decreasing due to rapid expansion of mobile-cellular services [253]\n\n\nCommunication\nLithuania has a well developed communications infrastructure

decreasing due to rapid expansion of mobile-cellular services [253]\n\n\nTransport\nLithuania received its first railway connection in the middle of the 19th century, when the Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway was constructed It included a stretch from Daugavpils via Vilnius and Kaunas to Virbalis The first and only still operating tunnel was completed in 1860.\n\n\nEnergy\nSystematic diversification of energy imports and resources is Lithuania's key energy strategy [287] Long-term aims were defined in National Energy Independence strategy in 2012 by Lietuvos Seimas [288] It was estimated that strategic energy independence initiatives will cost €6.3–7.8 billion in total and provide annual savings of €0.9–1.1 billion.\n\n\nDemographics\nSince the Neolithic period, the demographics of Lithuania have stayed fairly homogenous There is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day Lithuania have similar genetic compositions to their ancestors, [300] [301] [302] although without being actually isolated from them [303] The Lithuanian population appears to be relatively homogeneous, without apparent genetic differences among ethnic subgroups [304]\n\n\nFunctional urban areas\nLithuania has the most homogeneous population in the Baltic States Ethnic Lithuanians make up about five-sixths of the country's population In 2024, 82.6% of the 2,809,977 Lithuania's residents were ethnic Lithuanians who speak Lithuanian, which is the official language of the country Several sizeable minorities exist, such as Poles (6.3%), Russians (5.0%), Belarusians (2.1%) and Ukrainians (1.7%) [309]\n\n\nEthnic groups and languages\nLithuania has the most homogeneous population in the Baltic States Ethnic Lithuanians make up about five-sixths of the

exist, such as Poles (6.3%), Russians (5.0%), Belarusians (2.1%) and Ukrainians (1.7%) [309]\n\n\nUrbanization\nThere has been a steady movement of population to the cities since the 1990s, encouraged by the planning of regional centres, such as Alytus, Marijampolė, Utena, Plungė, and Mažeikiai By the early 21st century, about two-thirds of the total population lived in urban areas As of 2021 [update], 68.19% of the total population lives in urban areas [306] Lithuania's functional urban areas include Vilnius (population 708,203), Kaunas (population 391,153), and Panevėžys (population 124,526) [307] The fDI of the Financial Times in their research Cities and Regions of the Future ranked Vilnius fourth in the mid-sized European cities category in the 2018–19 ranking, second in the 2022–23 ranking, second in 2023 ranking while the city claimed 24th spot in the worldwide overall ranking in 2021–22 and Vilnius county was ranked 10th in the small European regions category in 2018–19, fifth in 2022–23, fifth in 2023 rankings [316] [317] [318] [319]\n\n\nHealth\nLithuania provides free state-funded healthcare to all citizens and registered long-term residents [321] It co-exists with a significant private healthcare sector In 2003–2012, the network of hospitals was restructured, as part of wider healthcare service reforms It started in 2003–2005 with the expansion of ambulatory services and primary care [322]\nIn 2016, Lithuania ranked 27th in Europe in the Euro health consumer index, a ranking of European healthcare systems based on waiting time, results and other indicators.\n\n\nReligion\nAccording to the 2021 census, 74.2% of residents of Lithuania were Catholics [3] Catholicism has been the main religion since the official Christianisation of Lithuania in 1387 The Catholic Church was persecuted by the Russian Empire as part of the Russification policies and by the Soviet Union as part of the overall anti-religious campaigns During the Soviet era, some priests actively led the resistance against the Communist regime, as symbolised by the Hill of Crosses and exemplified by The Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania.\n\n\nEducation\nThe Constitution of Lithuania mandates ten-year education ending at age 16 and guarantees a free public higher education for students deemed 'good' [344] The Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Lithuania proposes national educational policies and goals that are then voted for in the Seimas Laws govern long-term educational strategy along with general laws on standards for higher education, vocational training, law and science, adult education, and special education [345] 5.4% of GDP or 15.4% of total public expenditure was spent for education in 2016 [346]\n\n\nCulture\nThe Lithuanian language (lietuvių kalba) is the official state language of Lithuania and is recognized as one of the official languages of the European Union There are about 2.96 million native Lithuanian speakers in Lithuania and about 0.2 million abroad.\n\n\nLithuanian language\nThe Lithuanian language (lietuvių kalba) is the official state language of Lithuania and is recognized as one of the official languages of the European Union There are about 2.96 million native Lithuanian speakers in Lithuania and about 0.2 million abroad.\n\n\nLiterature\nThere is a great deal of Lithuanian literature written in Latin, the main scholarly language of the Middle Ages The edicts of the Lithuanian King Mindaugas are the prime example of the literature of this kind The Letters of Gediminas are another crucial heritage of the Lithuanian Latin writings.\n\n\nArchitecture\nSeveral famous Lithuania-related architects are notable for their achievements in the field of architecture Johann Christoph Glaubitz, Marcin Knackfus, Laurynas Gucevičius and Karol Podczaszyński were instrumental in introducing Baroque and neoclassical architectural movements to the Lithuanian architecture during the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries [378] Vilnius is considered as a capital of the Eastern Europe Baroque [379] Vilnius Old Town that is full of astonishing Baroque churches and other buildings is a UNESCO World Heritage Site [380]\n\n\nArts and museums\nThe Lithuanian Art Museum was founded in 1933 and is the largest museum of art conservation and display in Lithuania [384] Among other important museums are the Palanga Amber Museum, where amber pieces comprise a major part of the collection, National Gallery of Art, presenting collection of Lithuanian art of the 20th and 21st century, National Museum of Lithuania presenting Lithuanian archaeology, history and ethnic culture In 2018 two private museums were opened – MO Museum devoted to modern and contemporary Lithuanian art and Tartle, [385] exhibiting a collection of Lithuanian art heritage and artefacts.\n\n\nTheatre\nLithuania has theatres in Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda and Panevėžys These include Lithuanian National Drama Theatre, Keistuolių teatras (Theatre of Freaks) in Vilnius, Kaunas State Drama Theatre, Theatre of Oskaras Koršunovas, Klaipėda Drama Theatre, Theatre of Gytis Ivanauskas, Miltinis Drama Theatre in Panevėžys, The Doll's Theatre, Old Theatre of Vilnius [387] Theatre festivals include Sirenos (Sirens), TheATRIUM, Nerk į teatrą (Dive into the Theatre) [388] [389] [390]\n\n\nCinema\nOn 28 July 1896, Thomas Edison live photography session was held in the Concerts Hall of the Botanical Garden of Vilnius University After a year, similar American movies were available with the addition of special phonograph records that also provided sound In 1909, Lithuanian cinema pioneers Antanas Račiūnas and Ladislas Starevich released their first movies Soon the Račiūnas' recordings of Lithuania's views became very popular among the Lithuanian Americans abroad In 1925, Pranas Valuskis filmed movie Naktis Lietuvoje (Night in Lithuania) about Lithuanian book smugglers that left the first bright Lithuanian footprint in Hollywood The most significant and mature Lithuanian American movie of the time Aukso žąsis (Golden goose) was created in 1965 by Birutė Pūkelevičiūtė  [lt] that featured motifs from the Brothers Grimm fairy tales In 1940, Romuva Cinema was opened in Kaunas and currently is the oldest still operational cinema in Lithuania After the occupation of the state, movies mostly were used for the Soviet propaganda purposes, nevertheless Almantas Grikevičius, Gytis Lukšas, Henrikas Šablevičius, Arūnas Žebriūnas, Raimondas Vabalas were able to overcome the obstacles and create valuable films After the restoration of the independence, Šarūnas Bartas, Audrius Stonys, Arūnas Matelis, Audrius Juzėnas, Algimantas Puipa, Janina Lapinskaitė  [lt], Dijana and her husband Kornelijus Matuzevičius received success in international movie festivals [393]\n\n\nMusic\nLithuanian folk music belongs to Baltic music branch which is connected with neolithic corded ware culture Two instrument cultures meet in the areas inhabited by Lithuanians: stringed (kanklių) and wind instrument cultures Lithuanian folk music is archaic, mostly used for ritual purposes, containing elements of paganism faith There are three ancient styles of singing in Lithuania connected with ethnographical regions: monophony, heterophony and polyphony Folk song genres: Sutartinės (Multipart Songs), [395] Wedding Songs, War-Historical Time Songs, Calendar Cycle and Ritual Songs and Work Songs [396]\n\n\nRock and protest music\nAfter the Soviet reoccupation of Lithuania in 1944, the Soviet's censorship continued firmly controlling all artistic expressions in Lithuania, and any violations by criticizing the regime would immediately result in punishments [405] The first local rock bands started to emerge around 1965 and included Kertukai, Aitvarai and Nuogi ant slenksčio in Kaunas, and Kęstutis Antanėlis, Vienuoliai, and Gėlių Vaikai in Vilnius, among others Unable to express their opinions directly, the Lithuanian artists began organizing patriotic Roko Maršai and were using metaphors in their songs' lyrics, which were easily identified for their true meanings by the locals [406] [407] Postmodernist rock band Antis and its vocalist Algirdas Kaušpėdas were one of the most active performers who mocked the Soviet regime by using metaphors For example, in the song Zombiai (Zombies), the band indirectly sang about the Red Army soldiers who occupied the state and its military base in Ukmergė [408] [409] Vytautas Kernagis' song Kolorado vabalai (Colorado beetles) was also a favourite due to its lyrics in which true meaning of the Colorado beetles was intended to be the Soviets decorated with the Ribbons of Saint George [410]\n\n\nCuisine\nLithuanian cuisine features the products suited to the cool and moist northern climate of Lithuania: barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, berries, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties Fish dishes are very popular in the coastal region [415] Since it shares its climate and agricultural practices with Northern Europe, Lithuanian cuisine has some similarities to Scandinavian cuisine Nevertheless, it has its own distinguishing features, which were formed by a variety of influences during the country's long and difficult history.\n\n\nMedia\nThe Constitution of Lithuania provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to promote these freedoms However, the constitutional definition of freedom of expression does not protect certain acts, such as incitement to national, racial, religious, or social hatred, violence and discrimination, or slander, and disinformation It is a crime to deny or \"grossly trivialize\" Soviet or Nazi German crimes against Lithuania or its citizens, or to deny genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes [428]\n\n\nPublic holidays and festivals\nAs a result of a thousand-years history, Lithuania has two National days The first one is the Statehood Day on 6 July, marking the establishment of the medieval Kingdom of Lithuania by Mindaugas in 1253 The creation of modern Lithuanian state is commemorated on 16 February as a Lithuanian State Reestablishment Day on which declaration of independence from Russia and Germany was declared in 1918 Joninės (previously known as Rasos) is a public holiday with paganic roots that celebrates a solstice As of 2018, there are 13 public holidays (which come with a day off) [430]\n\n\nSports\nBasketball is the most popular and national sport of Lithuania The Lithuania national basketball team has  won the EuroBasket on three occasions (1937, 1939 and 2003), as well a total of 8 other medals in the Eurobasket, the World Championships and the Olympic Games  76% of the country's population watched the men's national team games live in 2014 [431] Lithuania hosted the Eurobasket in 1939 and 2011 The historic Lithuanian basketball team BC Žalgiris, from Kaunas, won the European basketball league Euroleague in 1999 Lithuania has produced a number of NBA players, including Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductees Arvydas Sabonis and Šarūnas Marčiulionis, [432] and current NBA players Jonas Valančiūnas, Domantas Sabonis [433]\n\n\nSee also\n55°N 24°E﻿ / ﻿55°N 24°E﻿ / 55; 24\n\n\nNotes\n55°N 24°E﻿ / ﻿55°N 24°E﻿ / 55;

Baltic region of Europe, bordered by Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east and south, Poland to the south, and the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia to the southwest. The country has a total area of 65,300 square kilometers (25,200 sq mi) and a population of approximately 2.8 million people.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe first known record of the name of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuva) is in a 9 March 1009 story of Saint Bruno in the Quedlinburg Chronicle. The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva: Litua (pronounced [litua]). Due to lack of reliable evidence, the true meaning of the name is unknown and scholars still debate it. There are a few plausible versions.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history of Lithuania dates back to settlements founded about 10,000 years ago, but the first written record of the name for the country dates back to 1009 AD. Facing the German threat, Mindaugas in the middle of the 13th century united a large part of the Baltic tribes and founded the State of Lithuania, while in 1253 he was crowned as the Catholic King of Lithuania. After Mindaugas' assassination in 1263, pagan Lithuania was again a target of the Christian crusades of the Teutonic Knights and Livonian Order. Traidenis during his reign (1269–1282) reunified all Lithuanian lands and achieved military successes against the Crusaders, fighting alongside other Baltic tribes, but was unable to militarily assist the Old Prussians in their Great Uprising.\n\n**Kingdom of Lithuania, Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth**\n\nThe history of Lithuania dates back to settlements founded about 10,000 years ago, but the first written record of the name for the country dates back to 1009 AD. Facing the German threat, Mindaugas in the middle of the 13th century united a large part of the Baltic tribes and founded the State of Lithuania, while in 1253 he was crowned as the Catholic King of Lithuania. Moreover by taking advantage of the weakened territory of the former Kievan Rus' due to the Mongol invasion, Mindaugas has incorporated Black Ruthenia into Lithuania. After Mindaugas' assassination in 1263, pagan Lithuania was again a target of the Christian crusades of the Teutonic Knights and Livonian Order. Traidenis during his reign (1269–1282) reunified all Lithuanian lands and achieved military successes against the Crusaders, fighting alongside other Baltic tribes, but was unable to militarily assist the Old Prussians in their Great Uprising.\n\n**Efforts to restore statehood**\n\nFollowing the annexation the Russian Tsarist authorities implemented Russification policies in Lithuania, which then made a part of a new administrative region Northwestern Krai. In 1812 Napoleon during the French invasion of Russia has established the puppet Lithuanian Provisional Governing Commission to support his war efforts, however after Napoleon's defeat the Russian rule was reinstated in Lithuania.\n\n**Restored statehood and occupations**\n\nDuring World War I the German Empire annexed Lithuanian territories from the Russian Empire and they became a part of Ober Ost. In 1907, the Lithuanians organized the Vilnius Conference which adopted a resolution, featuring the aspiration for the restoration of Lithuania's sovereignty and military alliance with Germany and elected the Council of Lithuania. In 1918, the short-lived Kingdom of Lithuania was proclaimed; however on 16 February 1918 the Council of Lithuania adopted the Act of Independence of Lithuania which restored Lithuania as democratic republic with its capital in Vilnius and separated that state from all state relations that existed with other nations.\n\n**Geography**\n\nLithuania is located in the Baltic region of Europe and covers an area of 65,300 square kilometers (25,200 sq mi). It lies between latitudes 53° and 57° N, and mostly between longitudes 21° and 27° E (part of the Curonian Spit lies west of 21°). It has around 99 kilometers (61.5 mi) of sandy coastline, only about 38 kilometers (24 mi) of which face the open Baltic Sea, less than the other two Baltic states. The rest of the coast is sheltered by the Curonian sand peninsula. Lithuania's major warm-water port, Klaipėda, lies at the narrow mouth of the Curonian Lagoon (Lithuanian: Kuršių marios), a shallow lagoon extending south to Kaliningrad. The country's main and largest river, the Nemunas River, and some of its tributaries carry international shipping.\n\n**Climate**\n\nLithuania has a temperate climate with both maritime and continental influences. It is defined as humid continental (Dfb) under the Köppen climate classification (but is close to oceanic in a narrow coastal zone).\n\n**Environment**\n\nAfter the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 1990, the Aplinkos apsaugos įstatymas (Environmental Protection Act) was adopted already in 1992. The law provided the foundations for regulating social relations in the field of environmental protection, established the basic rights and obligations of legal and natural persons in preserving the biodiversity inherent in Lithuania, ecological systems and the landscape. Lithuania agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by 2020 and by at least 40% by 2030, together with all European Union members. Also, by 2020 at least 20% (27% by 2030) of the country's total energy consumption should be from the renewable energy sources.\n\n**Biodiversity**\n\nLithuanian ecosystems include natural and semi-natural (forests, bogs, wetlands and meadows), and anthropogenic (agrarian and urban) ecosystems. Among natural ecosystems, forests are particularly important to Lithuania, covering 33% of the country's territory. Wetlands (raised bogs, fens, transitional mires, etc.) cover 7.9% of the country, with 70% of wetlands having been lost due to drainage and peat extraction between 1960 and 1980. Changes in wetland plant communities resulted in the replacement of moss and grass communities by trees and shrubs, and fens not directly affected by land reclamation have become drier as a result of a drop in the water table. There are 29,000 rivers with a total length of 64,000 kilometers in Lithuania, the Nemunas River basin occupying 74% of the territory of the country. Due to the construction of dams, approximately 70% of spawning sites of potential catadromous fish species have disappeared.\n\n**Government and politics**\n\nSince Lithuania declared the restoration of its independence on 11 March 1990, it has maintained strong democratic traditions. It held its first independent general elections on 25 October 1992, in which 56.75% of voters supported the new constitution. There were intense debates concerning the constitution, particularly the role of the president. A separate referendum was held on 23 May 1992 to gauge public opinion on the matter, and 41% of voters supported the restoration of the President of Lithuania. Through compromise, a semi-presidential system was agreed on.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nThe current system of administrative division was established in 1994 and modified in 2000 to meet the requirements of the European Union. The country's 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular – apskritis, plural – apskritys) are subdivided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: singular – savivaldybė, plural – savivaldybės), and further divided into 500 elderships (Lithuanian: singular – seniūnija, plural – seniūnijos).\n\n**Foreign relations**\n\nLithuania became a member of the United Nations on 18 September 1991, and is a signatory to a number of its organizations and other international agreements. It is also a member of the European Union, the Council of Europe, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as NATO and its adjunct North Atlantic Coordinating Council. Lithuania gained membership in the World Trade Organization on 31 May 2001, and joined the OECD on 5 July 2018.\n\n**Military**\n\nThe Lithuanian Armed Forces is the name for the unified armed forces of Lithuanian Land Force, Lithuanian Air Force, Lithuanian Naval Force, Lithuanian Special Operations Force and other units: Logistics Command, Training and Doctrine Command, Headquarters Battalion, Military Police. Directly subordinated to the Chief of Defence are the Special Operations Forces and Military Police. The Reserve Forces are under command of the Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces.\n\n**Economy**\n\nLithuania has an open and mixed economy that is classified as a high-income economy by the World Bank. As of 2017, the three largest sectors were – services (67% of GDP), industry (29%), and agriculture (3%). Lithuania joined NATO in 2004, EU in 2004, Schengen in 2007, and OECD in 2018. On 1 January 2015, the euro became the national currency, replacing litas at the rate of EUR 1.00 = LTL 3.45280.\n\n**Agriculture**\n\nAgriculture in Lithuania dates to the Neolithic period, about 3,000 to 1,000 BC. It has been one of Lithuania's most important occupations for many centuries. Lithuania's accession to the European Union in 2004 ushered in a new agricultural era. The EU pursues a very high standard of food safety and purity. In 1999, the Seimas (parliament) of Lithuania adopted a Law on Product Safety, and in 2000 it adopted a Law on Food. The reform of the agricultural market has been carried out on the basis of these two laws.\n\n**Science and technology**\n\nThe foundation of the University of Vilnius in 1579 was a major factor in fostering a scientific and academic community within Lithuania. The university has welcomed such prominent scientists and thinkers as Georg Forster, Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert, Johann Peter Frank. The 17th-century artillery expert Kazimieras Simonavičius is considered a pioneer of rocketry; his publication, the Artis Magnae Artilleriae, was a basic artillery manual throughout Europe, containing a large chapter on caliber, construction, production and properties of rockets (for military and civil purposes), including multistage rockets, batteries of rockets, and rockets with delta wing stabilizers. Botanist Jurgis Pabrėža (1771–1849) created the first systematic guide of Lithuanian flora, Taislius auguminis (Botany), written in the Samogitian dialect, the Latin-Lithuanian dictionary of plant names, and the first Lithuanian geography textbook.\n\n**Tourism**\n\nStatistics from 2023 showed 1.4 million tourists from foreign countries visited Lithuania and spent at least one night. The largest number of tourists came from Poland (173,500), Latvia (144,300), Belarus (141,900), Germany (127,400), the United Kingdom (74,200), the United States (69,700), Ukraine (67,000), and Estonia (61,300).\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nLithuania has a well-developed communications infrastructure. The country has 2.8 million citizens and 5 million SIM cards. The largest LTE (4G) mobile network covers 97% of Lithuania's territory. Usage of fixed phone lines has been rapidly decreasing due to rapid expansion of mobile-cellular services.\n\n**Communication**\n\nLithuania has a well-developed communications infrastructure. The country has 2.8 million citizens and 5 million SIM cards. The largest LTE (4G) mobile network covers 97% of Lithuania's territory. Usage of fixed phone lines has been rapidly decreasing due to rapid expansion of mobile-cellular services.\n\n**Transport**\n\nLithuania received its first railway connection in the middle of the 19th century, when the Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway was constructed. It included a stretch from Daugavpils via Vilnius and Kaunas to Virbalis. The first and only still operating tunnel was completed in 1860.\n\n**Energy**\n\nSystematic diversification of energy imports and resources is Lithuania's key energy strategy. Long-term aims were defined in National Energy Independence strategy in 2012 by Lietuvos Seimas. It was estimated that strategic energy independence initiatives will cost €6.3–7.8 billion in total and provide annual savings of €0.9–1.1 billion.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nSince the Neolithic period, the demographics of Lithuania have stayed fairly homogenous. There is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day Lithuania have similar genetic compositions to their ancestors, although without being actually isolated from them. The Lithuanian population appears to be relatively homogeneous, without apparent genetic differences among ethnic subgroups.\n\n**Functional urban areas**\n\nLithuania has the most homogeneous population in the Baltic States. Ethnic Lithuanians make up about five-sixths of the country's population. In 2024, 82.6% of the 2,809,977 Lithuania's residents were ethnic Lithuanians who speak Lithuanian, which is the official language of the country. Several sizeable minorities exist, such as Poles (6.3%), Russians (5.0%), Belarusians (2.1%), and Ukrainians (1.7%).\n\n**Urbanization**\n\nThere has been a steady movement of population to the cities since the 1990s, encouraged by the planning of regional centres, such as Alytus, Marijampolė, Utena, Plungė, and Mažeikiai. By the early 21st century, about two-thirds of the total population lived in urban areas. Lithuania's functional urban areas include Vilnius (population 708,203), Kaunas (population 391,153), and Panevėžys (population 124,526).\n\n**Health**\n\nLithuania provides free state-funded healthcare to all citizens and registered long-term residents. It co-exists with a significant private healthcare sector. In 2003–2012, the network of hospitals was restructured, as part of wider healthcare service reforms. It started in 2003–2005 with the expansion of ambulatory services and primary care. In 2016, Lithuania ranked 27th in Europe in the Euro health consumer index, a ranking of European healthcare systems based on waiting time, results, and other indicators.\n\n**Religion**\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, 74.2% of residents of Lithuania were Catholics. Catholicism has been the main religion since the official Christianisation of Lithuania in 1387. The Catholic Church was persecuted by the Russian Empire as part of the Russification policies and by the Soviet Union as part of the overall anti-religious campaigns. During the Soviet era, some priests actively led the resistance against the Communist regime, as symbolised by the Hill of Crosses and exemplified by The Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania.\n\n**Education**\n\nThe Constitution of Lithuania mandates ten-year education ending at age 16 and guarantees a free public higher education for students deemed 'good'. The Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Lithuania proposes national educational policies and goals that are then voted for in the Seimas. Laws govern long-term educational strategy along with general laws on standards for higher education, vocational training, law and science, adult education, and special education. 5.4% of GDP or 15.4% of total public expenditure was spent for education in 2016.\n\n**Culture**\n\nThe Lithuanian language (lietuvių kalba) is the official state language of Lithuania and is recognized as one of the official languages of the European Union. There are about 2.96 million native Lithuanian speakers in Lithuania and about 0.2 million abroad.\n\n**Literature**\n\nThere is a great deal of Lithuanian literature written in Latin, the main scholarly language of the Middle Ages. The edicts of the Lithuanian King Mindaugas are the prime example of the literature of this kind. The Letters of Gediminas are another crucial heritage of the Lithuanian Latin writings.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nSeveral famous Lithuania-related architects are notable for their achievements in the field of architecture. Johann Christoph Glaubitz, Marcin Knackfus, Laurynas Gucevičius, and Karol Podczaszyński were instrumental in introducing Baroque and neoclassical architectural movements to the Lithuanian architecture during the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. Vilnius is considered as a capital of the Eastern Europe Baroque. Vilnius Old Town that is full of astonishing Baroque churches and other buildings is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n**Arts and museums**\n\nThe Lithuanian Art Museum was founded in 1933 and is the largest museum of art conservation and display in Lithuania. Among other important museums are the Palanga Amber Museum, where amber pieces comprise a major part of the collection, National Gallery of Art, presenting collection of Lithuanian art of the 20th and 21st century, National Museum of Lithuania presenting Lithuanian archaeology, history, and ethnic culture. In 2018, two private museums were opened – MO Museum devoted to modern and contemporary Lithuanian art and Tartle, exhibiting a collection of Lithuanian art heritage and artefacts.\n\n**Theatre**\n\nLithuania has theatres in Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda, and Panevėžys. These include Lithuanian National Drama Theatre, Keistuolių teatras (Theatre of Freaks) in Vilnius, Kaunas State Drama Theatre, Theatre of Oskaras Koršunovas, Klaipėda Drama Theatre, Theatre of Gytis Ivanauskas, Miltinis Drama Theatre in Panevėžys, The Doll's Theatre, Old Theatre of Vilnius.\n\n**Cinema**\n\nOn 28 July 1896, Thomas Edison live photography session was held in the Concerts Hall of the Botanical Garden of Vilnius University. After a year, similar American movies were available with the addition of special phonograph records that also provided sound. In 1909, Lithuanian cinema pioneers Antanas Račiūnas and Ladislas Starevich released their first movies. Soon the Račiūnas' recordings of Lithuania's views became very popular among the Lithuanian Americans abroad. In 1925, Pranas Valuskis filmed movie Naktis Lietuvoje (Night in Lithuania) about Lithuanian book smugglers that left the first bright Lithuanian footprint in Hollywood.\n\n**Music**\n\nLithuanian folk music belongs to Baltic music branch which is connected with neolithic corded ware culture. Two instrument cultures meet in the areas inhabited by Lithuanians: stringed (kanklių) and wind instrument cultures. Lithuanian folk music is archaic, mostly used for ritual purposes, containing elements of paganism faith. There are three ancient styles of singing in Lithuania connected with ethnographical regions: monophony, heterophony, and polyphony. Folk song genres: sutartinės (multipart songs), wedding songs, war-historical time songs, calendar cycle, and ritual songs and work songs.\n\n**Rock and", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style

February 1918 the Council of Lithuania adopted the Act of Independence of Lithuania which restored Lithuania as democratic republic with its capital in Vilnius and separated that state from all state relations that existed with other nations [56] In 1918–1920 the Lithuanians defended the statehood of Lithuania during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence with Bolsheviks, Bermontians and Poles [56] The aims of the newly restored Lithuania clashed with Józef Piłsudski's plans to create a federation (Intermarium) in territories previously ruled by the Jagiellonians [57] The Lithuanian authorities prevented the 1919 Polish coup attempt in Lithuania and in 1920 during the Żeligowski's Mutiny the Polish forces captured Vilnius Region and established a puppet state of the Republic of Central Lithuania, which in 1922 was incorporated into Poland [56] Consequently, Kaunas became the temporary capital of Lithuania where the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania was held and other primary Lithuanian institutions operated until 1940 [58] In 1923, the Klaipėda Revolt was organized which unified the Klaipėda Region with Lithuania [59] The 1926 Lithuanian coup d'état replaced the democratically elected government and president with an authoritarian regime led by Antanas Smetona [59]\n\n\n1990–present\nOn 11 March 1990, the Supreme Council announced the restoration of Lithuania's independence Lithuania became the first Soviet-occupied state to announce the restitution of independence On 20 April 1990, the Soviets imposed an economic blockade by ceasing to deliver supplies of raw materials to Lithuania [65] Not only domestic industry, but also the population started feeling the lack of fuel, essential goods, and even hot water Although the blockade lasted for 74 days, Lithuania did not renounce the declaration of independence.\n\n\nGeography\nLithuania is located in the Baltic region of Europe [a] and covers an area of 65,300 km2 (25,200 sq mi) [81] It lies between latitudes 53° and 57° N, and mostly between longitudes 21° and 27° E (part of the Curonian Spit lies west of 21°) It has around 99 kilometres (61.5 mi) of sandy coastline, only about 38 kilometres (24 mi) of which face the open Baltic Sea, less than the other two Baltic states The rest of the coast is sheltered by the Curonian sand peninsula Lithuania's major warm-water port, Klaipėda, lies at the narrow mouth of the Curonian Lagoon (Lithuanian: Kuršių marios), a shallow lagoon extending south to Kaliningrad The country's main and largest river, the Nemunas River, and some of its tributaries carry international shipping.\n\n\nClimate\nLithuania has a temperate climate with both maritime and continental influences It is defined as humid continental (Dfb) under the Köppen climate classification (but is close to oceanic in a narrow coastal zone).\n\n\nEnvironment\nAfter the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 1990, the Aplinkos apsaugos įstatymas (Environmental Protection Act) was adopted already in 1992 The law provided the foundations for regulating social relations in the field of environmental protection, established the basic rights and obligations of

2020 and by at least 40% by 2030, together with all European Union members Also, by 2020 at least 20% (27% by 2030) of the country's total energy consumption should be from the renewable energy sources [87] In 2016, Lithuania introduced especially effective container deposit legislation, which resulted in collecting 92% of all packagings in 2017 [88]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nLithuanian ecosystems include natural and semi-natural (forests, bogs, wetlands and meadows), and anthropogenic (agrarian and urban) ecosystems Among natural ecosystems, forests are particularly important to Lithuania, covering 33% of the country's territory Wetlands (raised bogs, fens, transitional mires, etc.) cover 7.9% of the country, with 70% of wetlands having been lost due to drainage and peat extraction between 1960 and 1980 Changes in wetland plant communities resulted in the replacement of moss and grass communities by trees and shrubs, and fens not directly affected by land reclamation have become drier as a result of a drop in the water table There are 29,000 rivers with a total length of 64,000 km in Lithuania, the Nemunas River basin occupying 74% of the territory of the country Due to the construction of dams, approximately 70% of spawning sites of potential catadromous fish species have disappeared In some cases, river and lake ecosystems continue to be impacted by anthropogenic eutrophication [100]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nSince Lithuania declared the restoration of its independence on 11 March 1990, it has maintained strong democratic traditions It held its first

were allowed to vote by the 1918 Constitution of Lithuania and used their newly granted right for the first time in 1919 By doing so, Lithuania allowed it earlier than such democratic countries as the United States (1920), France (1945), Greece (1952), Switzerland (1971) [107]\n\n\nLaw and law enforcement\nThe first attempt to codify the Lithuanian laws was in 1468 when the Casimir's Code was compiled and adopted by Grand Duke Casimir IV Jagiellon [122] In the 16th century three editions of the Statutes of Lithuania were created with the First Statute being adopted in 1529, the Second Statute in 1566, and the Third Statute in 1588 [122] On 3 May 1791, the Europe's first and the world's second Constitution was adopted by the Great Sejm [123] The Third Statute was partly in force in the territory of Lithuania even until 1840, despite the Third Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795 [122]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe current system of administrative division

has been one of Lithuania's most important occupations for many centuries [206] Lithuania's accession to the European Union in 2004 ushered in a new agricultural era The EU pursues a very high standard of food safety and purity In 1999, the Seimas (parliament) of Lithuania adopted a Law on Product Safety, and in 2000 it adopted a Law on Food [207] [208] The reform of the agricultural market has been carried out on the basis of these two laws.\n\n\nScience and technology\nThe foundation of the University of Vilnius in 1579 was a major factor in fostering a scientific and academic community within Lithuania The university has welcomed such prominent scientists and thinkers as Georg Forster, Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert, Johann Peter Frank The 17th century artillery expert Kazimieras Simonavičius is considered a pioneer of rocketry; his publication, the Artis Magnae Artilleriae, was a basic artillery manual throughout Europe, containing a large chapter on caliber, construction, production and properties of rockets (for military and civil purposes), including multistage rockets, batteries of rockets, and rockets with delta wing stabilizers [211] [212] Botanist Jurgis Pabrėža (1771–1849) created the first systematic guide of Lithuanian flora, Taislius auguminis (Botany), written in the Samogitian dialect, the Latin-Lithuanian dictionary of plant names, and the first Lithuanian geography textbook German scientist Theodor Grotthuss (1785–1822), who proposed the Grotthuss mechanism, lived and worked in the Gedučiai manor  [lt], where he gained local prominence for

in 2012 by Lietuvos Seimas [288] It was estimated that strategic energy independence initiatives will cost €6.3–7.8 billion in total and provide annual savings of €0.9–1.1 billion.\n\n\nDemographics\nSince the Neolithic period, the demographics of Lithuania have stayed fairly homogenous There is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day Lithuania have similar genetic compositions to their ancestors, [300] [301] [302] although without being actually isolated from them [303] The Lithuanian population appears to be relatively homogeneous, without apparent genetic differences among ethnic subgroups [304]\n\n\nFunctional urban areas\nLithuania has the most homogeneous population in the Baltic States Ethnic Lithuanians make up about five-sixths of the country's population In 2024, 82.6% of the 2,809,977 Lithuania's residents were ethnic Lithuanians who speak Lithuanian, which is the official language of the country Several sizeable

official language of the country Several sizeable minorities exist, such as Poles (6.3%), Russians (5.0%), Belarusians (2.1%) and Ukrainians (1.7%) [309]\n\n\nUrbanization\nThere has been a steady movement of population to the cities since the 1990s, encouraged by the planning of regional centres, such as Alytus, Marijampolė, Utena, Plungė, and Mažeikiai By the early 21st century, about two-thirds of the total population lived in urban areas As of 2021 [update], 68.19% of the total population lives in urban areas [306] Lithuania's functional urban areas include Vilnius (population 708,203), Kaunas (population 391,153), and Panevėžys (population 124,526) [307] The fDI of the Financial Times in their research Cities and Regions of the Future ranked Vilnius fourth in the mid-sized

religion since the official Christianisation of Lithuania in 1387 The Catholic Church was persecuted by the Russian Empire as part of the Russification policies and by the Soviet Union as part of the overall anti-religious campaigns During the Soviet era, some priests actively led the resistance against the Communist regime, as symbolised by the Hill of Crosses and exemplified by The Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania.\n\n\nEducation\nThe Constitution of Lithuania mandates ten-year education ending at age 16 and guarantees a free public higher education for students deemed 'good' [344] The Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Lithuania proposes national educational policies and goals that are then voted for in the Seimas Laws govern long-term educational strategy along with general laws on standards for higher education, vocational training, law and science, adult education, and special education [345] 5.4% of GDP or 15.4% of total public expenditure

example of the literature of this kind The Letters of Gediminas are another crucial heritage of the Lithuanian Latin writings.\n\n\nArchitecture\nSeveral famous Lithuania-related architects are notable for their achievements in the field of architecture Johann Christoph Glaubitz, Marcin Knackfus, Laurynas Gucevičius and Karol Podczaszyński were instrumental in introducing Baroque and neoclassical architectural movements to the Lithuanian architecture during the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries [378] Vilnius is considered as a capital of the Eastern Europe Baroque [379] Vilnius Old Town that is full of astonishing Baroque churches and other buildings is a UNESCO World Heritage Site [380]\n\n\nArts and museums\nThe Lithuanian Art Museum was founded in 1933 and is the largest

a year, similar American movies were available with the addition of special phonograph records that also provided sound In 1909, Lithuanian cinema pioneers Antanas Račiūnas and Ladislas Starevich released their first movies Soon the Račiūnas' recordings of Lithuania's views became very popular among the Lithuanian Americans abroad In 1925, Pranas Valuskis filmed movie Naktis Lietuvoje (Night in Lithuania) about Lithuanian book smugglers that left the first bright Lithuanian footprint in Hollywood The most significant and mature Lithuanian American movie of the time Aukso žąsis (Golden goose) was created in 1965 by Birutė Pūkelevičiūtė  [lt] that featured motifs from the Brothers Grimm fairy tales In 1940, Romuva Cinema was opened in Kaunas and currently is the oldest still operational cinema in Lithuania After the occupation of the state, movies mostly were used for the Soviet propaganda purposes, nevertheless Almantas Grikevičius, Gytis Lukšas, Henrikas Šablevičius, Arūnas Žebriūnas, Raimondas Vabalas were able to overcome the obstacles and create valuable films After the restoration of the independence, Šarūnas Bartas, Audrius Stonys, Arūnas Matelis, Audrius Juzėnas, Algimantas Puipa, Janina Lapinskaitė  [lt], Dijana and her husband Kornelijus Matuzevičius received success in international movie festivals [393]\n\n\nMusic\nLithuanian folk music belongs to

heterophony and polyphony Folk song genres: Sutartinės (Multipart Songs), [395] Wedding Songs, War-Historical Time Songs, Calendar Cycle and Ritual Songs and Work Songs [396]\n\n\nRock and protest music\nAfter the Soviet reoccupation of Lithuania in 1944, the Soviet's censorship continued firmly controlling all artistic expressions in Lithuania, and any violations by criticizing the regime would immediately result in punishments [405] The first local rock bands started to emerge around 1965 and included Kertukai, Aitvarai and Nuogi ant slenksčio in Kaunas, and Kęstutis Antanėlis, Vienuoliai, and Gėlių Vaikai in Vilnius, among others Unable to express their opinions directly, the Lithuanian artists began organizing patriotic Roko Maršai and were using metaphors in their songs' lyrics, which were easily identified for their true meanings by the locals [406] [407] Postmodernist rock band Antis and its vocalist Algirdas Kaušpėdas were one of the most active performers who mocked the Soviet regime by using metaphors For example, in the song Zombiai (Zombies), the band indirectly sang about the Red Army soldiers who occupied the state and its military base in Ukmergė [408] [409] Vytautas Kernagis' song Kolorado vabalai (Colorado beetles) was also a favourite due to its lyrics in which true meaning of the Colorado beetles was intended to be the Soviets decorated with the Ribbons of Saint George [410]\n\n\nCuisine\nLithuanian cuisine features the products suited to the cool and moist northern climate of Lithuania: barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, berries, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties Fish dishes are very popular in the coastal region [415] Since it shares its climate and agricultural practices with Northern Europe, Lithuanian cuisine has some similarities to Scandinavian cuisine Nevertheless, it has its own distinguishing features, which were formed by a variety of influences during the country's long and difficult history.\n\n\nMedia\nThe Constitution of Lithuania provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to promote these freedoms However, the constitutional definition of freedom of expression does not protect certain acts, such as incitement to national, racial, religious, or social hatred, violence and discrimination, or slander, and disinformation It is a crime to deny or \"grossly trivialize\" Soviet or Nazi German crimes against Lithuania or its citizens, or to deny genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes [428]\n\n\nPublic holidays and festivals\nAs a result of a thousand-years history, Lithuania has two National days The first one is the Statehood Day on 6 July, marking the establishment of the medieval Kingdom of Lithuania by Mindaugas in 1253 The creation of modern Lithuanian

a public holiday with paganic roots that celebrates a solstice As of 2018, there are 13 public holidays (which come with a day off) [430]\n\n\nSports\nBasketball is the most popular and national sport

{"title": "James_A._Garfield", "content": "\nChildhood and early life\nJames Abram Garfield was born the youngest of five children on November 19, 1831, in a log cabin in Orange Township, now Moreland Hills, Ohio [b] Garfield's ancestor Edward Garfield migrated from Hillmorton, Warwickshire, England, to Massachusetts around 1630 James's father Abram was born in Worcester, New York, and came to Ohio to woo his childhood sweetheart, Mehitabel Ballou, only to find her married He instead wed her sister Eliza, who was born in New Hampshire James was named after an earlier son of Eliza and Abram who had died in infancy [4]\n\n\nEducation, marriage and early career\nGarfield attended Geauga Seminary from 1848 to 1850 and learned academic subjects for which he had not previously had time He excelled as a student and was especially interested in languages and elocution He began to appreciate the power a speaker had over an audience, writing that the speaker's platform \"creates some excitement I love agitation and investigation and glory in defending unpopular truth against popular error.\" [14] Geauga was coeducational, and Garfield was attracted to one of his classmates, Lucretia Rudolph, whom he later married [15] To support himself at Geauga, he worked as a carpenter's assistant and teacher [16] The need to go from town to town to find work as a teacher aggravated Garfield, and he developed a dislike of what he called \"place-seeking\", which became, he said, \"the law of my life.\" [17] In later years, he astounded his friends by disregarding positions that could have been his with little politicking [17] Garfield had attended church more to please his mother than to worship God, but in his late teens he underwent a religious awakening He attended many camp meetings, which led to his being born again on March 4, 1850, when he was baptized into Christ by being submerged in the icy waters of the Chagrin River [18]\n\n\nCivil War\nAfter Abraham Lincoln's election as president, several Southern states announced their secession from the Union to form a new government, the Confederate States of America Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort, which he regarded as a holy crusade against the Slave Power [35] In April 1861, the rebels bombarded Fort Sumter, one of the South's last federal outposts, beginning the Civil War Although he had no military training, Garfield knew his place was in the Union Army [35]\n\n\nBuell's command\nBuell quickly assigned Garfield the task of driving Confederate forces out of eastern Kentucky, giving him the 18th Brigade for the campaign, which, besides his own 42nd, included the 40th Ohio Infantry, two Kentucky infantry regiments and two cavalry units [39] They departed Catlettsburg, Kentucky, in mid-December, advancing through the valley of the Big Sandy River [39] The march was uneventful until Union forces reached Paintsville, Kentucky, on January 6, 1862, where Garfield's cavalry engaged the rebels at Jenny's Creek [40] Confederate troops under Brigadier General Humphrey Marshall held the town in numbers roughly equal to Garfield's own, but Garfield positioned his troops so as to deceive Marshall into believing the rebels were outnumbered [40] Marshall ordered his troops to withdraw to the forks of Middle Creek, on the road to Virginia, and Garfield ordered his troops to take up the pursuit [41] They attacked the rebel positions on January 9, 1862, in the Battle of Middle Creek, the only pitched battle Garfield commanded personally [42] At the fighting's end, the Confederates withdrew from the field and Garfield sent his troops to Prestonsburg to reprovision [43]\n\n\nChief of staff for Rosecrans\nGenerals' chiefs of staff were usually more junior officers, but Garfield's influence with Rosecrans was greater than usual, with duties extending beyond communication of orders to actual management of his Army of the Cumberland [59] Rosecrans had a voracious appetite for conversation, especially when unable to sleep; in Garfield, he found \"the first well read person in the Army\" and the ideal candidate for discussions that ran deep into the night [60] They discussed everything, especially religion, and the two became close despite Garfield's being 12 years his junior Rosecrans, who had converted from Methodism to Roman Catholicism, softened Garfield's view of his faith [61]\n\n\nCongressional career\nWhile he served in the Army in early 1862, friends of Garfield approached him about running for Congress from Ohio's newly redrawn and heavily Republican 19th district He worried that he and other state-appointed generals would receive obscure assignments, and running for Congress would allow him to resume his political career That the new Congress would not hold its first regular session until December 1863 allowed him to continue his war service for a time [d] Home on medical leave, he refused to campaign for the nomination, leaving that to political managers who secured it at the local convention in September 1862 on the eighth ballot In the October general election, he defeated D.B Woods by a two-to-one margin for a seat in the 38th Congress [70]\n\n\nElection in 1862; Civil War years\nWhile he served in the Army in early 1862, friends of Garfield approached him about running for Congress from Ohio's newly redrawn and heavily Republican 19th district He worried that he and other state-appointed generals would receive obscure assignments, and running for Congress would allow him to resume his political career That the new Congress would not hold its first regular session until December 1863 allowed him to continue his war service for a time [d] Home on medical leave, he refused to campaign for the nomination, leaving that to political managers who secured it at the local convention in September 1862 on the eighth ballot In the October general election, he defeated D.B Woods by a two-to-one margin for a seat in the 38th Congress [70]\n\n\nReconstruction\nIn 1864, the U.S Senate passed the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery throughout the Union The bill failed to pass the House by a two-thirds majority until January 31, 1865, when it was then sent to the states for ratification The Amendment opened other issues concerning African American civil rights Garfield asked, \" [What] is freedom? Is it the bare privilege of not being chained?...If this is all, then freedom is a bitter mockery, a cruel delusion.\" [90] [e]\n\n\nTariffs and finance\nThroughout his political career, Garfield favored the gold standard and decried attempts to increase the money supply through the issuance of paper money not backed by gold, and later, through the free and unlimited coinage of silver [104] In 1865, he was put on the House Ways and Means Committee, a long-awaited opportunity to focus on financial and economic issues He reprised his opposition to the greenback, saying, \"Any party which commits itself to paper money will go down amid the general disaster, covered with the curses of a ruined people.\" [105] In 1868 Garfield gave a two-hour speech on currency in the House, which was widely applauded as his best oratory to that point; in it, he advocated a gradual resumption of specie payments, that is, the government paying out silver and gold, rather than paper money that could not be redeemed [106]\n\n\nCrédit Mobilier scandal; salary grab\nThe Crédit Mobilier of America scandal involved corruption in the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869 Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Crédit Mobilier of America company, then contracted with it to undertake construction of the railroad The railroad paid the company's grossly inflated invoices with federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at par value, well below the market rate Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends The high expenses meant Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds One of the railroad officials who controlled Crédit Mobilier was also a congressman, Oakes Ames of Massachusetts He offered some of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Crédit Mobilier stock at par value, well below what it sold for on the market, and the railroad got its additional appropriations [114]\n\n\nFloor leader; Hayes administration\nThe Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in 1875 meant the loss of Garfield's chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee, though the Democrats did put him on the Ways and Means Committee With many of his leadership rivals defeated in the 1874 Democratic landslide, and Blaine elected to the Senate, Garfield was seen as the Republican floor leader, and the likely Speaker, should the party regain control of the chamber [122]\n\n\nLegal career and other activities\nIn 1865, Garfield became a partner in the law firm of a fellow Disciple of Christ, Jeremiah Black They had much in common, except politics: Black was an avid Democrat, having served in the cabinet of President James Buchanan [133] The next year, Black was retained by some pro-Confederate northern civilians who had been found guilty of treason in a military court and sentenced to death Black saw an opportunity to strike a blow against military courts and the Republicans [134] He had heard Garfield's military speeches, and learned of not only his oratory skills but also his resistance to expansive powers of military commissions Black assigned the case to Garfield one week before arguments were to be made before the U S Supreme Court When Black warned him of the political peril, Garfield responded, \"It don't make any difference I believe in English liberty and English law.\" [135] In this landmark case, Ex parte Milligan, Garfield successfully argued that civilians could not be tried before military tribunals, despite a declaration of martial law, as long as civil courts were still operating In his first court appearance, Garfield's oral argument lasted over two hours, and though his wealthy clients refused to pay him, he had established himself as a preeminent lawyer [134]\n\n\nPresidential election of 1880\nHaving just been elected to the Senate with John Sherman's support, Garfield was committed to Sherman for the 1880 Republican presidential nomination [145] Before the convention began, however, a few Republicans, including Wharton Barker of Philadelphia, thought Garfield the best choice for the nomination [145] Garfield denied any interest in the position, but the attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions [146] Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine, former President Grant; several other candidates attracted delegates as well [147]\n\n\nRepublican nomination\nHaving just been elected to the Senate with John Sherman's support, Garfield was committed to Sherman for the 1880 Republican presidential nomination [145] Before the

attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions [146] Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine, former President Grant; several other candidates attracted delegates as well [147]\n\n\nCampaign against Hancock\nEven with a Stalwart on the ticket, animosity between the Republican factions carried over from the convention, so Garfield traveled to New York to meet with party leaders [157] After convincing the Stalwart crowd to put aside their differences and unite for the coming campaign, Garfield returned to Ohio, leaving the active campaigning to others, as was traditional at the time [158] Meanwhile, the Democrats settled on their nominee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania, a career military officer [157] Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the Solid South, while much of the North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign focused on a few close states, including New York and Indiana [159]\n\n\nPresidency (1881)\nBefore his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that might engender peace between the party's Conkling and Blaine factions Blaine's delegates had provided much of the support for Garfield's nomination, so the Maine senator received the place of honor as Secretary of State [167] Blaine was not only the president's closest advisor, but he was also obsessed with knowing all that took place in the White House, and allegedly posted spies there in his absence [168] Garfield nominated William Windom of Minnesota as Secretary of the Treasury, William H Hunt of Louisiana as Secretary of the Navy, Robert Todd Lincoln as Secretary of War, and Samuel J Kirkwood of Iowa as Secretary of the Interior New York was represented by Thomas Lemuel James as Postmaster General Garfield appointed Pennsylvania's Wayne MacVeagh, an adversary of Blaine's, as Attorney General [169] Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, William E Chandler, as Solicitor General under MacVeagh Only Chandler's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter [170]\n\n\nCabinet and inauguration\nBefore his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that might engender peace between the party's Conkling and Blaine factions

Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, William E Chandler, as Solicitor General under MacVeagh Only Chandler's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter [170]\n\n\nRefinance of national debt\nGarfield ordered the Secretary of the Treasury William Windom to refund (refinance) the national debt by calling in outstanding U.S bonds paying 6% interest Holders would have the option of accepting cash or new bonds at 3%, closer to the interest rates of the time Taxpayers were saved an estimated $10 million By comparison, federal expenditures in 1881 were below $261 million (~$7.09 billion in 2023) [177] [178]\n\n\nSupreme Court nomination\nIn 1880, President Hayes had nominated Stanley Matthews to the Supreme Court but the Senate declined to act on the nomination In March 1881, Garfield re-nominated Matthews to the Court and the Senate confirmed Matthews by a vote of 24–23 [179] According to The New York Times, \"opposition to Matthews's Supreme Court appointment .. stemmed from his prosecution in 1859 of a newspaper editor who had assisted two runaway slaves.\" Because Matthews was \"a professed abolitionist at the time, the matter was later framed as political expediency triumphing over moral principle.\" [180] Matthews served on the Court until his death in 1889 [180]\n\n\nReforms\nGrant and Hayes had both advocated civil service reform, and by 1881 such reform associations had organized with renewed energy across the nation Garfield sympathized with them, believing the spoils system damaged the presidency and often eclipsed more important concerns [181] Some reformers became disappointed when Garfield promoted limited tenure only to minor office seekers and gave appointments to his old friends [181]\n\n\nCivil rights and education\nGarfield believed the key to improving the state of African American civil rights was government supported education [185] During Reconstruction, freedmen had gained citizenship and suffrage, which enabled them to participate in government, but Garfield believed their rights were being eroded by Southern white resistance and illiteracy, and he was concerned that blacks would become America's permanent \"peasantry\" [186] He proposed a \"universal\" education system funded by the federal government In February 1866, as a congressman from Ohio, Garfield and Ohio School Commissioner Emerson Edward White had drafted a bill for the National Department of Education They believed that through the use of statistics they could push the US Congress to establish a federal agency for school reform [187] But by the time of Garfield's presidency, Congress and the northern white public had lost interest in African-American rights, and Congress did not pass federal funding for universal education during his term [186] Garfield also worked to appoint several African Americans to prominent positions: Frederick Douglass, recorder of deeds in Washington; Robert Elliot, special agent to the Treasury; John M Langston, Haitian minister; and Blanche K Bruce, register to the Treasury Garfield believed Southern support for the Republican Party could be gained by \"commercial and industrial\" interests rather than race issues and began to reverse Hayes's policy of conciliating Southern Democrats [188] He appointed William H Hunt, a Republican from Louisiana, as Secretary of the Navy [188] To break the hold of the resurgent Democratic Party in the Solid South, Garfield took patronage advice from Virginia Senator William Mahone of the biracial independent Readjuster Party, hoping to add the independents' strength to the Republicans' there [189]\n\n\nForeign policy and naval reform\nGarfield had little foreign policy experience, so he leaned heavily on Blaine [190] They agreed on the need to promote freer trade, especially within the Western Hemisphere [191] Garfield and Blaine believed increasing trade with Latin America would be the best way to keep the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from dominating the region [191] And by encouraging exports, they believed they could increase American prosperity [191] Garfield authorized Blaine to call for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade [192]\n\n\nAssassination\nCharles J Guiteau had followed various professions in his life, but in 1880 had determined to gain federal office by supporting what he expected would be the winning Republican ticket [199] He composed a speech, \"Garfield vs Hancock\", and got it printed by the Republican National Committee One means of persuading the voters in that era was through orators expounding on the candidate's merits, but with the Republicans seeking more famous men, Guiteau received few opportunities to speak [200] On one occasion, according to Kenneth D Ackerman, Guiteau was unable to finish his speech due to nerves Guiteau, who considered himself a Stalwart, deemed his contribution to Garfield's victory sufficient to justify his appointment to the position of consul in Paris, despite the fact that he spoke no French, nor any foreign language [201] One medical expert has since described Guiteau as possibly a narcissistic schizophrenic; [202] neuroscientist Kent Kiehl assessed him as a clinical psychopath [203]\n\n\nGuiteau

clinical psychopath [203]\n\n\nTreatment and death\nGarfield was struck by two shots: one glanced off his arm while the other pierced his back, shattering a rib and embedding itself in his abdomen \"My God, what is this?\" he exclaimed [213] Among those at the station was Robert Todd Lincoln, who was deeply upset, thinking back to when his father Abraham Lincoln was assassinated 16 years earlier Garfield was taken on a mattress upstairs to a private office, where several doctors examined him At his request, Garfield was taken back to the White House, and his wife, then in New Jersey, was sent for [214] Blaine sent word to Vice President Arthur in New York City, who received threats against his life because of his animosity toward Garfield and Guiteau's statements [215]\n\n\nFuneral, memorials and commemorations\nGarfield's funeral train left Long Branch on the same special track that had brought him there, traveling over tracks blanketed with flowers and past houses adorned with flags His body was transported to the Capitol and then continued on to Cleveland for burial [239] Shocked by his death, Marine Band leader John Philip Sousa composed the march \"In Memoriam\", which was played when Garfield's body was received in Washington, D.C [240] More than 70,000 citizens, some waiting over three hours, passed by Garfield's coffin as his body lay in state from September 21 to 23, 1881, [241] at the United States Capitol rotunda; on September 25, in Cleveland, Garfield's casket was paraded down Euclid Avenue from Wilson Avenue to Public Square, with those in attendance including former presidents Grant and Hayes, and Generals William Sherman, Sheridan and Hancock [242] More than 150,000—a number equal to the city's population—likewise paid their respects, and Sousa's march was again played [239] [243] Garfield's body was temporarily interred in the Schofield family vault in Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery until his permanent memorial was built [239] [244]\n\n\nLegacy and historical view\nFor a few years after his assassination, Garfield's life story was seen as an exemplar of the American success story—that even the poorest boy might someday become President of the United States Peskin wrote: \"In mourning Garfield, Americans were not only honoring a president; they were paying tribute to a man whose life story embodied their own most cherished aspirations.\" [260] As the rivalry between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds faded from the scene in the late 1880s and after, so too did memories of Garfield In the 1890s, Americans became disillusioned with politicians, and looked elsewhere for inspiration, focusing on industrialists, labor leaders, scientists, and others as their heroes Increasingly, Garfield's short time as president was forgotten [261]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "James A. Garfield\n\nJames Abram Garfield was born the youngest of five children on November 19, 1831, in a log cabin in Orange Township, now Moreland Hills, Ohio.

Garfield's father Abram was born in Worcester, New York, and came to Ohio to woo his childhood sweetheart, Mehitabel Ballou, only to find her married. He instead wed her sister Eliza, who was born in New Hampshire. James was named after an earlier son of Eliza and Abram who had died in infancy.\n\n## Education, Marriage and Early Career\n\nGarfield attended Geauga Seminary from 1848 to 1850 and learned academic subjects for which he had not previously had time. He excelled as a student and was especially interested in languages and elocution. He began to appreciate the power a speaker had over an audience, writing that the speaker's platform \"creates some excitement I love agitation and investigation and glory in defending unpopular truth against popular error.\" Geauga was coeducational, and Garfield was attracted to one of his classmates, Lucretia Rudolph, whom he later married.

The need to go from town to town to find work as a teacher aggravated Garfield, and he developed a dislike of what he called \"place-seeking\", which became, he said, \"the law of my life.\" In later years, he astounded his friends by disregarding positions that could have been his with little politicking. Garfield had attended church more to please his mother than to worship God, but in his late teens he underwent a religious awakening. He attended many camp meetings, which led to his being born again on March 4, 1850, when he was baptized into Christ by being submerged in the icy waters of the Chagrin River.\n\n## Civil War\n\nAfter Abraham Lincoln's election as president, several Southern states announced their secession from the Union to form a new government, the Confederate States of America. Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort, which he regarded as a holy crusade against the Slave Power. In April 1861, the rebels bombarded Fort Sumter, one of the South's last federal outposts, beginning the Civil War. Although he had no military training, Garfield knew his place was in the Union Army. Buell quickly assigned Garfield the task of driving Confederate forces out of eastern Kentucky, giving him the 18th Brigade for the campaign, which, besides his own 42nd, included the 40th Ohio Infantry, two Kentucky infantry regiments and two cavalry units. They departed Catlettsburg, Kentucky, in mid-December, advancing through the valley of the Big Sandy River. The march was uneventful until Union forces reached Paintsville, Kentucky, on January 6, 1862, where Garfield's cavalry engaged the rebels at Jenny's Creek. Confederate troops under Brigadier General Humphrey Marshall held the town in numbers roughly equal to Garfield's own, but Garfield positioned his troops so as to deceive Marshall into believing the rebels were outnumbered. Marshall ordered his troops to withdraw to the forks of Middle Creek, on the road to Virginia, and Garfield ordered his troops to take up the pursuit. They attacked the rebel positions on January 9, 1862, in the Battle of Middle Creek, the only pitched battle Garfield commanded personally. At the fighting's end, the Confederates withdrew from the field and Garfield sent his troops to Prestonsburg to reprovision.\n\n## Congressional Career\n\nWhile he served in the Army in early 1862, friends of Garfield approached him about running for Congress from Ohio's newly redrawn and heavily Republican 19th district. He worried that he and other state-appointed generals would receive obscure assignments, and running for Congress would allow him to resume his political career. That the new Congress would not hold its first regular session until December 1863 allowed him to continue his war service for a time. Home on medical leave, he refused to campaign for the nomination, leaving that to political managers who secured it at the local convention in September 1862 on the eighth ballot. In the October general election, he defeated D.B Woods by a two-to-one margin for a seat in the 38th Congress.\n\n## Reconstruction\n\nIn 1864, the U.S Senate passed the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery throughout the Union. The bill failed to pass the House by a two-thirds majority until January 31, 1865, when it was then sent to the states for ratification. The Amendment opened other issues concerning African American civil rights. Garfield asked, \" [What] is freedom? Is it the bare privilege of not being chained?...If this is all, then freedom is a bitter mockery, a cruel delusion.\" Throughout his political career, Garfield favored the gold standard and decried attempts to increase the money supply through the issuance of paper money not backed by gold, and later, through the free and unlimited coinage of silver. In 1865, he was put on the House Ways and Means Committee, a long-awaited opportunity to focus on financial and economic issues.\n\n## Crédit Mobilier Scandal\n\nThe Crédit Mobilier of America scandal involved corruption in the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Crédit Mobilier of America company, then contracted with it to undertake construction of the railroad. The railroad paid the company's grossly inflated invoices with federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at par value, well below the market rate. Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends.\n\n## Floor Leader; Hayes Administration\n\nThe Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in 1875 meant the loss of Garfield's chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee, though the Democrats did put him on the Ways and Means Committee. With many of his leadership rivals defeated in the 1874 Democratic landslide, and Blaine elected to the Senate, Garfield was seen as the Republican floor leader, and the likely Speaker, should the party regain control of the chamber.\n\n## Legal Career and Other Activities\n\nIn 1865, Garfield became a partner in the law firm of a fellow Disciple of Christ, Jeremiah Black. They had much in common, except politics: Black was an avid Democrat, having served in the cabinet of President James Buchanan.

Black saw an opportunity to strike a blow against military courts and the Republicans. He had heard Garfield's military speeches, and learned of not only his oratory skills but also his resistance to expansive powers of military commissions. Black assigned the case to Garfield one week before arguments were to be made before the U S Supreme Court.\n\n## Presidential Election of 1880\n\nHaving just been elected to the Senate with John Sherman's support, Garfield was committed to Sherman for the 1880 Republican presidential nomination.

He composed a speech, \"Garfield vs Hancock\", and got it printed by the Republican National Committee. One means of persuading the voters in that era was through orators expounding on the candidate's merits, but with the Republicans seeking more famous men, Guiteau received few opportunities to speak.\n\n## Treatment and Death\n\nGarfield was struck by two shots: one glanced off his arm while the other pierced his back, shattering a rib and embedding itself in his abdomen \"My God, what is this?\" he exclaimed. Among those at the station was Robert Todd Lincoln, who was deeply upset, thinking back to when his father Abraham Lincoln was assassinated 16 years earlier.\n\n## Funeral, Memorials and Commemorations\n\nGarfield's funeral train left Long Branch on the same special track that had brought him there, traveling over tracks blanketed with flowers and past houses adorned with flags. His body was transported to the Capitol and then continued on to Cleveland for burial. Shocked by his death, Marine Band leader John Philip Sousa composed the march \"In Memoriam\", which was played when Garfield's body was received in Washington, D.C.\n\n## Legacy and Historical View\n\nFor a few years after his assassination, Garfield's life story was seen as an exemplar of the American success story—that even the poorest boy might someday become President of the United States. As the rivalry between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds faded from the scene in the late 1880s and after, so too did memories of Garfield. In the 1890s, Americans became disillusioned with politicians, and looked elsewhere for inspiration, focusing on industrialists, labor leaders, scientists, and others as their heroes.\n\n## References\n\n## Works Cited\n\n## Further Reading\n\n## External Links", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"James_A._Garfield\" following this outline:\n\n\nChildhood and early life\nJames Abram Garfield was born the youngest of five children on November 19, 1831, in a log cabin in Orange Township, now Moreland Hills, Ohio [b] Garfield's ancestor Edward Garfield migrated from Hillmorton, Warwickshire, England, to Massachusetts around 1630 James's father Abram was born in Worcester, New York, and came to Ohio to woo his childhood sweetheart, Mehitabel Ballou, only to find her married He instead wed her sister Eliza, who was born in New Hampshire James was named after an earlier son of Eliza and Abram who had died in infancy [4]\n\n\nEducation, marriage and early career\nGarfield attended Geauga Seminary from 1848 to 1850 and learned academic subjects for which he had not previously had time He excelled as a student and was especially interested in languages and elocution He began to appreciate the power a speaker had over an audience, writing that the speaker's platform \"creates some excitement I love agitation and investigation and glory in defending unpopular truth against popular error.\" [14] Geauga was coeducational, and Garfield was attracted to one of his classmates, Lucretia Rudolph, whom he later married [15] To support himself at Geauga, he worked as a carpenter's assistant and teacher [16] The need to go from town to town to find work as a teacher aggravated Garfield, and he developed a dislike of what he called \"place-seeking\", which became, he said, \"the law of my life.\" [17] In later years, he astounded his friends by disregarding positions that could have been his with little politicking [17] Garfield had attended church more to please his mother than to worship God, but in his late teens he underwent a religious awakening He attended many camp meetings, which led to his being born again on March 4, 1850, when he was baptized into Christ by being submerged in the icy waters of the Chagrin River [18]\n\n\nCivil War\nAfter Abraham Lincoln's election as president, several Southern states announced their secession from the Union to form a new government, the Confederate States of America Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort, which he regarded as a holy crusade against the Slave Power [35] In April 1861, the rebels bombarded Fort Sumter, one of the South's last federal outposts, beginning the Civil War Although he had no military training, Garfield knew his place was in the Union Army [35]\n\n\nBuell's command\nBuell quickly assigned Garfield the task of driving Confederate forces out of eastern Kentucky, giving him the 18th Brigade for the campaign, which, besides his own 42nd, included the 40th Ohio Infantry, two Kentucky infantry regiments and two cavalry units [39] They departed Catlettsburg, Kentucky, in mid-December, advancing through the valley of the Big Sandy River [39] The march was uneventful until Union forces reached Paintsville, Kentucky, on January 6, 1862, where Garfield's cavalry engaged the rebels at Jenny's Creek [40] Confederate troops under Brigadier General Humphrey Marshall held the town in numbers roughly equal to Garfield's own, but Garfield positioned his troops so as to deceive Marshall into believing the rebels were outnumbered [40] Marshall ordered his troops to withdraw to the forks of Middle Creek, on the road to Virginia, and Garfield ordered his troops to take up the pursuit [41] They attacked the rebel positions on January 9, 1862, in the Battle of Middle Creek, the only pitched battle Garfield commanded personally [42] At the fighting's end, the Confederates withdrew from the field and Garfield sent his troops to Prestonsburg to reprovision [43]\n\n\nChief of staff for Rosecrans\nGenerals' chiefs of staff were usually more junior officers, but Garfield's influence with Rosecrans was greater than usual, with duties extending beyond communication of orders to actual management of his Army of the Cumberland [59] Rosecrans had a voracious appetite for conversation, especially when unable to sleep; in Garfield, he found \"the first well read person in the Army\" and the ideal candidate for discussions that ran deep into the night [60] They discussed everything, especially religion, and the two became close despite Garfield's being 12 years his junior Rosecrans, who had converted from Methodism to Roman Catholicism, softened Garfield's view of his faith [61]\n\n\nCongressional career\nWhile he served in the Army in early 1862, friends of Garfield approached him about running for Congress from Ohio's newly redrawn and heavily Republican 19th district He worried that he and other state-appointed generals would receive obscure assignments, and running for Congress would allow him to resume his political career That the new Congress would not hold its first regular session until December 1863 allowed him to continue his war service for a time [d] Home on medical leave, he refused to campaign for the nomination, leaving that to political managers who secured it at the local convention in September 1862 on the eighth ballot In the October general election, he defeated D.B Woods by a two-to-one margin for a seat in the 38th Congress [70]\n\n\nElection in 1862; Civil War years\nWhile he served in the Army in early 1862, friends of Garfield approached him about running for Congress from Ohio's newly redrawn and heavily Republican 19th district He worried that he and other state-appointed generals would receive obscure assignments, and running for Congress would allow him to resume his political career That the new Congress would not hold its first regular session until December 1863 allowed him to continue his war service for a time [d] Home on medical leave, he refused to campaign for the nomination, leaving that to political managers who secured it at the local convention in September 1862 on the eighth ballot In the October general election, he defeated D.B Woods by a two-to-one margin for a seat in the 38th Congress [70]\n\n\nReconstruction\nIn 1864, the U.S Senate passed the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery throughout the Union The bill failed to pass the House by a two-thirds majority until January 31, 1865, when it was then sent to the states for ratification The Amendment opened other issues concerning African American civil rights Garfield asked, \" [What] is freedom? Is it the bare privilege of not being chained?...If this is all, then freedom is a bitter mockery, a cruel delusion.\" [90] [e]\n\n\nTariffs and finance\nThroughout his political career, Garfield favored the gold standard and decried attempts to increase the money supply through the issuance of paper money not backed by gold, and later, through the free and unlimited coinage of silver [104] In 1865, he was put on the House Ways and Means Committee, a long-awaited opportunity to focus on financial and economic issues He reprised his opposition to the greenback, saying, \"Any party which commits itself to paper money will go down amid the general disaster, covered with the curses of a ruined people.\" [105] In 1868 Garfield gave a two-hour speech on currency in the House, which was widely applauded as his best oratory to that point; in it, he advocated a gradual resumption of specie payments, that is, the government paying out silver and gold, rather than paper money that could not be redeemed [106]\n\n\nCrédit Mobilier scandal; salary grab\nThe Crédit Mobilier of America scandal involved corruption in the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869 Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Crédit Mobilier of America company, then contracted with it to undertake construction of the railroad The railroad paid the company's grossly inflated invoices with federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at par value, well below the market rate Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends The high expenses meant Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds One of the railroad officials who controlled Crédit Mobilier was also a congressman, Oakes Ames of Massachusetts He offered some of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Crédit Mobilier stock at par value, well below what it sold for on the market, and the railroad got its additional appropriations [114]\n\n\nFloor leader; Hayes administration\nThe Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in 1875 meant the loss of Garfield's chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee, though the Democrats did put him on the Ways and Means Committee With many of his leadership rivals defeated in the 1874 Democratic landslide, and Blaine elected to the Senate, Garfield was seen as the Republican floor leader, and the likely Speaker, should the party regain control of the chamber [122]\n\n\nLegal career and other activities\nIn 1865, Garfield became a partner in the law firm of a fellow Disciple of Christ, Jeremiah Black They had much in common, except politics: Black was an avid Democrat, having served in the cabinet of President James Buchanan [133] The next year, Black was retained by some pro-Confederate northern civilians who had been found guilty of treason in a military court and sentenced to death Black saw an opportunity to strike a blow against military courts and the Republicans [134] He had heard Garfield's military speeches, and learned of not only his oratory skills but also his resistance to expansive powers of military commissions Black assigned the case to Garfield one week before arguments were to be made before the U S Supreme Court When Black warned him of the political peril, Garfield responded, \"It don't make any difference I believe in English liberty and English law.\" [135] In this landmark case, Ex parte Milligan, Garfield successfully argued that civilians could not be tried before military tribunals, despite a declaration of martial law, as long as civil courts were still operating In his first court appearance, Garfield's oral argument lasted over two hours, and though his wealthy clients refused to pay him, he had established himself as a preeminent lawyer [134]\n\n\nPresidential election of 1880\nHaving just been elected to the Senate with John Sherman's support, Garfield was committed to Sherman for the 1880 Republican presidential nomination [145] Before the convention began, however, a few Republicans, including Wharton Barker of Philadelphia, thought Garfield the best choice for the nomination [145] Garfield denied any interest in the position, but the attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions [146] Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine, former President Grant; several other candidates attracted delegates as well [147]\n\n\nRepublican nomination\nHaving just been elected to the Senate with John Sherman's support, Garfield was committed to Sherman for the 1880 Republican presidential nomination [145] Before the

attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions [146] Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine, former President Grant; several other candidates attracted delegates as well [147]\n\n\nCampaign against Hancock\nEven with a Stalwart on the ticket, animosity between the Republican factions carried over from the convention, so Garfield traveled to New York to meet with party leaders [157] After convincing the Stalwart crowd to put aside their differences and unite for the coming campaign, Garfield returned to Ohio, leaving the active campaigning to others, as was traditional at the time [158] Meanwhile, the Democrats settled on their nominee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania, a career military officer [157] Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the Solid South, while much of the North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign focused on a few close states, including New York and Indiana [159]\n\n\nPresidency (1881)\nBefore his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that might engender peace between the party's Conkling and Blaine factions Blaine's delegates had provided much of the support for Garfield's nomination, so the Maine senator received the place of honor as Secretary of State [167] Blaine was not only the president's closest advisor, but he was also obsessed with knowing all that took place in the White House, and allegedly posted spies there in his absence [168] Garfield nominated William Windom of Minnesota as Secretary of the Treasury, William H Hunt of Louisiana as Secretary of the Navy, Robert Todd Lincoln as Secretary of War, and Samuel J Kirkwood of Iowa as Secretary of the Interior New York was represented by Thomas Lemuel James as Postmaster General Garfield appointed Pennsylvania's Wayne MacVeagh, an adversary of Blaine's, as Attorney General [169] Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, William E Chandler, as Solicitor General under MacVeagh Only Chandler's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter [170]\n\n\nCabinet and inauguration\nBefore his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that might engender peace between the party's Conkling and Blaine factions Blaine's delegates had provided much of the support for Garfield's nomination, so the Maine senator received the place of honor as Secretary of State [167] Blaine was not only the president's closest advisor, but he was also obsessed with knowing all that took place in the White House, and allegedly posted spies there in his absence [168] Garfield nominated William Windom of Minnesota as Secretary

Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, William E Chandler, as Solicitor General under MacVeagh Only Chandler's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter [170]\n\n\nRefinance of national debt\nGarfield ordered the Secretary of the Treasury William Windom to refund (refinance) the national debt by calling in outstanding U.S bonds paying 6% interest Holders would have the option of accepting cash or new bonds at 3%, closer to the interest rates of the time Taxpayers were saved an estimated $10 million By comparison, federal expenditures in 1881 were below $261 million (~$7.09 billion in 2023) [177] [178]\n\n\nSupreme Court nomination\nIn 1880, President Hayes had nominated Stanley Matthews to the Supreme Court but the Senate declined to act on the nomination In March 1881, Garfield re-nominated Matthews to the Court and the Senate confirmed Matthews by a vote of 24–23 [179] According to The New York Times, \"opposition to Matthews's Supreme Court appointment .. stemmed from his prosecution in 1859 of a newspaper editor who had assisted two runaway slaves.\" Because Matthews was \"a professed abolitionist at the time, the matter was later framed as political expediency triumphing over moral principle.\" [180] Matthews served on the Court until his death in 1889 [180]\n\n\nReforms\nGrant and Hayes had both advocated civil service reform, and by 1881 such reform associations had organized with renewed energy across the nation Garfield sympathized with them, believing the spoils system damaged the presidency and often eclipsed more important concerns [181] Some reformers became disappointed when Garfield promoted limited tenure only to minor office seekers and gave appointments to his old friends [181]\n\n\nCivil rights and education\nGarfield believed the key to improving the state of African American civil rights was government supported education [185] During Reconstruction, freedmen had gained citizenship and suffrage, which enabled them to participate in government, but Garfield believed their rights were being eroded by Southern white resistance and illiteracy, and he was concerned that blacks would become America's permanent \"peasantry\" [186] He proposed a \"universal\" education system funded by the federal government In February 1866, as a congressman from Ohio, Garfield and Ohio School Commissioner Emerson Edward White had drafted a bill for the National Department of Education They believed that through the use of statistics they could push the US Congress to establish a federal agency for school reform [187] But by the time of Garfield's presidency, Congress and the northern white public had lost interest in African-American rights, and Congress did not pass federal funding for universal education during his term [186] Garfield also worked to appoint several African Americans to prominent positions: Frederick Douglass, recorder of deeds in Washington; Robert Elliot, special agent to the Treasury; John M Langston, Haitian minister; and Blanche K Bruce, register to the Treasury Garfield believed Southern support for the Republican Party could be gained by \"commercial and industrial\" interests rather than race issues and began to reverse Hayes's policy of conciliating Southern Democrats [188] He appointed William H Hunt, a Republican from Louisiana, as Secretary of the Navy [188] To break the hold of the resurgent Democratic Party in the Solid South, Garfield took patronage advice from Virginia Senator William Mahone of the biracial independent Readjuster Party, hoping to add the independents' strength to the Republicans' there [189]\n\n\nForeign policy and naval reform\nGarfield had little foreign policy experience, so he leaned heavily on Blaine [190] They agreed on the need to promote freer trade, especially within the Western Hemisphere [191] Garfield and Blaine believed increasing trade with Latin America would be the best way to keep the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from dominating the region [191] And by encouraging exports, they believed they could increase American prosperity [191] Garfield authorized Blaine to call for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade [192]\n\n\nAssassination\nCharles J Guiteau had followed various professions in his life, but in 1880 had determined to gain federal office by supporting what he expected would be the winning Republican ticket [199] He composed a speech, \"Garfield vs Hancock\", and got it printed by the Republican National Committee One means of persuading the voters in that era was through orators expounding on the candidate's merits, but with the Republicans seeking more famous men, Guiteau received few opportunities to speak [200] On one occasion, according to Kenneth D Ackerman, Guiteau was unable to finish his speech due to nerves Guiteau, who considered himself a Stalwart, deemed his contribution to Garfield's victory sufficient to justify his appointment to the position of consul in Paris, despite the fact that he spoke no French, nor any foreign language [201] One medical expert has since described Guiteau as possibly a narcissistic schizophrenic; [202] neuroscientist Kent Kiehl assessed him as a clinical psychopath [203]\n\n\nGuiteau

\"My God, what is this?\" he exclaimed [213] Among those at the station was Robert Todd Lincoln, who was deeply upset, thinking back to when his father Abraham Lincoln was assassinated 16 years earlier Garfield was taken on a mattress upstairs to a private office, where several doctors examined him At his request, Garfield was taken back to the White House, and his wife, then in New Jersey, was sent for [214] Blaine sent word to Vice President Arthur in New York City, who received threats against his life because of his animosity toward Garfield and Guiteau's statements [215]\n\n\nFuneral, memorials and commemorations\nGarfield's funeral train left Long Branch on the same special track that had brought him there, traveling over tracks blanketed with flowers and past houses adorned with flags His body was transported to the Capitol and then continued on to Cleveland for burial [239] Shocked by his death, Marine Band leader John Philip Sousa composed the march \"In Memoriam\", which was played when Garfield's body was received in Washington, D.C [240] More than 70,000 citizens, some waiting over three hours, passed by Garfield's coffin as his body lay in state from September 21 to 23, 1881, [241] at the United States Capitol rotunda; on September 25, in Cleveland, Garfield's casket was paraded down Euclid Avenue from Wilson Avenue to Public Square, with those in attendance including former presidents Grant and Hayes, and Generals William Sherman, Sheridan and Hancock [242] More than 150,000—a number equal to the city's population—likewise paid their respects, and Sousa's march was again played [239] [243] Garfield's body was temporarily interred in the Schofield family vault in Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery until his permanent memorial was built [239] [244]\n\n\nLegacy and historical view\nFor a few years after his assassination, Garfield's life story was seen as an exemplar of the American success story—that even the poorest boy might someday become President of the United States Peskin wrote: \"In mourning Garfield, Americans were not only honoring a president; they were paying tribute to a man whose life story embodied their own most cherished aspirations.\" [260] As the rivalry between Stalwarts and Half-Breeds faded from the scene in the late 1880s and after, so too did memories of Garfield In the 1890s, Americans became disillusioned with politicians, and looked elsewhere for inspiration, focusing on industrialists, labor leaders, scientists, and others as their heroes Increasingly, Garfield's short time as president was forgotten [261]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This article provides an overview of his early life, career, and personal life, as well as his interesting connection to Ireland.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPallonji Mistry was born to Shapoorji Mistry in Bombay (now Mumbai) on 1 June 1929. He was a member of the Parsi community, a small but influential ethnic group in Bombay that has made significant contributions to India's business and cultural landscape. The Parsis are known for their entrepreneurial spirit, and Mistry's family was no exception. His father, Shapoorji Mistry, was a successful businessman who first bought shares in Tata Sons in the 1930s. This initial investment would eventually become a significant stake in the company, making Mistry the largest individual shareholder in Tata Sons.\n\n**Career**\n\nMistry's connection to Tata Sons dates back to the 1930s, when his father first bought shares in the company. As of 2011, the Mistry family's stake in Tata Sons stood at 18.4%, making them the largest individual shareholders in the company. Tata Sons is the holding company of the Tata Group, a conglomerate that operates in various sectors, including automotive, aerospace, information technology, and hospitality, among others. The Tata Group is primarily controlled by the Tata philanthropic Allied Trusts, which are a set of charitable trusts that manage the group's charitable activities.\n\nAs the largest individual shareholder in Tata Sons, Mistry has played a significant role in shaping the company's strategy and direction. Under his leadership, Tata Sons has expanded its operations into new markets and sectors, and has made significant investments in research and development. Mistry's commitment to innovation and entrepreneurship has been instrumental in Tata Sons' success, and has helped to establish the company as one of India's leading business conglomerates.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nIn 2003, Mistry gave up his Indian citizenship to become an Irish citizen \"on the basis of his marriage to an Irish-born national\", Pat \"Patsy\" Perin Dubash. Mistry's decision to become an Irish citizen was reportedly motivated by his love of horses, which he shares with his wife. The couple owns a 200-acre stud farm and a 10,000-square-foot home in Pune, India, where they breed and train horses.\n\nMistry's connection to Ireland is a testament to the close ties that exist between India and Ireland. The two countries have a long history of cultural and economic exchange, and many Indians have made Ireland their home in recent years. Mistry's decision to become an Irish citizen is a significant example of the close relationship between the two countries, and highlights the importance of globalization and internationalization in today's world.\n\nIn conclusion, Pallonji Mistry is a prominent Indian businessman who has played a significant role in shaping the Tata Group's strategy and direction. His commitment to innovation and entrepreneurship has been instrumental in the company's success, and has helped to establish Tata Sons as one of India's leading business conglomerates.

{"title": "Kingpin_(character)", "content": "\nPublication history\nThe Kingpin first appears in The Amazing Spider-Man #50 (July 1967), and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Romita Sr., [9] who based his physical appearance on actors Sydney Greenstreet [10] and Robert Middleton [11]\n\n\nFictional character biography\nWilson Grant Fisk began his life as a poor child in New York City Enduring bullying from his classmates because of his obesity, Fisk trained himself in physical combat and eventually used his new-found strength to form a gang of his former tormentors that terrorized the surrounding neighborhoods He was soon discovered by mob boss Don Rigoletto, who hired him and his best friend as bodyguards, and Fisk worked his way up Rigoletto's ranks until he became the Don's right-hand man He then turned on his mentor, eliminating him and taking control of his men and business interests, before expanding his new empire until he had become one of the most powerful figures in New York's criminal underworld, earning the name \"Kingpin\" [13]\n\n\n1980s\nTo complete his reformation, the Kingpin agreed to turn over all of his records to the authorities so they could prosecute his former lieutenants His wife Vanessa was subsequently kidnapped by the men he betrayed, who then put out a contract on his life After witnessing Vanessa's apparent death, Fisk returned to a life of crime He quickly regained control by taking advantage of his knowledge of the weaknesses of all of New York's criminal organizations, and made a promise to keep the East Coast stable to stop crime bosses from the Midwest from expanding into his territory The Kingpin also gained the loyalty of infamous assassin Bullseye by promising him steady work When Daredevil stole his records, the Kingpin did nothing to stop him, plotting to get his old allies arrested so he could select more compliant replacements Daredevil realized this in time to stop himself from turning over the records, frustrating the Kingpin's plans [19] Kingpin maneuvered Daredevil into battling the Hand, hoping to get him killed [20] He secretly promoted corrupt mayoral candidate Randolph Cherryh, and hired the services of Elektra Natchios Daredevil found Vanessa alive but amnesiac, and used her as leverage to force Kingpin to end his support for Cherryh As retribution, he sent Elektra to kill Foggy Nelson (Daredevil's friend), but Elektra failed and was killed by Bullseye [21]\n\n\n1990s\nFisk later rehires Bullseye to look into the parties responsible for a major drug war in New York and survives an assassination attempt by Crossbones In retaliation, he sends Bullseye to assassinate the Red Skull (Crossbones's employer) The attempt fails, and the Kingpin instead defeats the Red Skull (in a clone of Captain America's body) in personal combat [26]\n\n\n2000s\nWhile in Japan, Fisk manipulates his adoptive daughter Maya Lopez (Echo) into thinking that Daredevil killed her biological father (although Fisk was actually responsible) to incite Daredevil's death [32] However, his plan backfires when Daredevil convinces Maya of the truth, and Lopez shoots the Kingpin in the eyes in retaliation, rendering him blind [33] Fisk eventually loses his criminal empire to Samuel Silke (one of his employees who works with Richard) in a bloody assassination bid, using the Kingpin's new status as a blind man to rally supporters [34] In the aftermath, Vanessa kills Richard and flees the country with Fisk's remaining wealth while the Kingpin recuperates in an unnamed East European country, broken and alone He is given an eye transplant which restores his eyesight [35] He eventually confronts Silke and fatally crushes the man's head, almost manages to regain his empire through sheer will, but is defeated by Daredevil (who declares himself the new Kingpin) Fisk is imprisoned as a result [36]\n\n\n2010s\nDuring the 2010 \"Shadowland\" storyline, the Kingpin approaches Iron Fist and Luke Cage, telling the two that they will need to take down Daredevil soon The Kingpin and Lady Bullseye later perform a ritual that brings back Ghost Rider to attack the Hand [51] After Daredevil is dethroned from Shadowland, the Kingpin takes both Shadowland and the Hand under his rule, officially taking his place back as the crime lord of New York City [52]\n\n\nMarvel NOW!\nAs part of the 2012 Marvel NOW! initiative, the Kingpin hears about how Otto Octavius as the Superior Spider-Man has been using brutal methods to take down the local crime families, which would leave a vacuum to fill The Kingpin's Shadowland hideout is attacked by the Superior Spider-Man to which the Kingpin claims that the Superior Spider-Man is much different from the nemesis he had fought While escaping, the Kingpin kills his doppelgänger Smedley Kornfeld (who was hired for events like this) to fool the Superior Spider-Man [58]\n\n\nAll-New, All-Different Marvel\nAs part of the 2015 \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\", Wilson Fisk represented Fisk Industries when he attended a meeting at the Universal Bank with Tiberius Stone of Alchemax, Sebastian Shaw of Shaw Industries, Darren Cross of Cross Technological Enterprises, Zeke Stane of Stane International, Shingen Harada of the Yashida Corporation, Frr'dox of Shi'ar Solutions Consolidated, and Wilhelmina Kensington of Kilgore Arms where they discussed with Dario Agger about his and Roxxon Energy Corporation's plans to exploit the Ten Realms of Asgard Wilson Fisk also saw the arrival of Exterminatrix of the Midas Foundation, who knocked out Dario and declared herself a new member of their assembly [63]\n\n\nMayor of New York City\nAfter HYDRA's defeat, Wilson Fisk is able to use a subsequent election to put himself forward as a last-minute candidate to become the Mayor of New York City, avoiding his criminal past being drawn into the issue by simply ignoring questions about it, aided by the fact that he has never been legitimately charged with anything With his primary policy being a bill to declare all vigilantes as criminals, and despite Daredevil's own recent efforts to create a precedent for superheroes testifying under their secret identities in Washington, he is able to have Daredevil arrested in an FBI sting operation, mocking his old nemesis with the knowledge that the people he protects chose Fisk to 'protect' them, prompting Daredevil to break a window and leap out of Fisk's office to begin his own efforts to bring down Fisk's empire Matt Murdock then applied for the position of deputy mayor [72] Although Daredevil eventually attempts to set up a 'sting operation' where he and his fellow street-level heroes will capture Mayor Fisk meeting with various gang bosses, Mayor Fisk uses this plan against them and uses the opportunity to arrest all of Daredevil's allies, subsequently attempting to provoke Daredevil into attacking him Although Mayor Fisk is able to arrest Daredevil as well, he is subsequently attacked and left in critical condition by the Hand, with various amendments made to New York's constitution by prior administrations putting Matt Murdock in control of the city, [73] once he has escaped from captivity, thanks to the Hand attacking the police van where he was being held, Fisk in critical condition and nobody willing to challenge the legal situation [74] While Matt Murdock used his skills as Daredevil and the acting mayor to keep the city safe with the street-level superheroes fighting off the Hand, Fisk recovered Murdock gave Fisk the position of mayor back to him where Fisk had to promise not to do anymore crusades against the vigilantes [75]\n\n\n2020s\nDuring the \"Last Remains\" arc, Norman Osborn meets up with Mayor Wilson Fisk and his men as they work on a plan to dispose of Kindred for what he did to them [81] Mayor Wilson Fisk is informed by Norman Osborn that Mary Jane Watson got through to Kindred After Norman as Green Goblin crashed the confrontation and threw a Pumpkin Bomb near Mary Jane, he gave Mayor Fisk the signal to activate the trap which causes the tomb to be engulfed in darkness [82] It was revealed that they pulled this off by enlisting the help of Spot who powered Project Blank that was inspired by the Darkforce Dome that once surrounded Manhattan [83] With Kindred locked up in a special cell in Ravencroft, Norman Osborn stated to Spider-Man that he saved him from Mayor Wilson Fisk [84] At Ravencroft, Mayor Wilson Fisk talks to Kindred about their encounter in the Parisian catacombs One of Mister Negative's lieutenants appears and informs him that the Inner Demons will help him get more than the Tablet of Life and Destiny [85]\n\n\nSecond marriage and retirement\nAfter Mike Murdock (Matt Murdock's magically created criminal twin brother) uses the Norn stone to cement himself into reality by changing the history of the world, he inadvertently makes it so that Mayor Fisk has an illegitimate son (alongside his legitimate son Richard) with Stella Pharris named Byron \"Butch\" Pharris [90]\n\n\nSkills, abilities, and equipment\nWhile the Kingpin has no superhuman powers, he is incredibly strong and significantly more durable than the average human, possessing remarkable strength concealed by his extremely corpulent appearance Most of his body mass is actually muscle that has been built to extraordinary size, much like a Super Heavyweight sumo wrestler, or some Olympic weightlifters and powerlifters but at greater strength levels He has been shown to be strong enough to hurl large men across a room, [17] and leave imprints in concrete walls after punching them [98] Defying his size, the Kingpin is a master of many forms of armed and unarmed combat, especially sumo wrestling His signature move is the bear hug His skill is such that he has once fought Captain America to a standstill in hand-to-hand combat [17] His daily workout typically consists of simultaneously overcoming five or more trained martial artists with his bare hands, [99] and he stores his valuables in a custom-built safe which has no lock, only a door which is so heavy that only the Kingpin himself is strong enough to open it [100]\n\n\nReception\nIn the \"Age of Apocalypse\" storyline, Wilson Fisk is known as Dirigible, a wealthy businessman who bought his way into the Marauders, a human terrorist group serving Apocalypse that makes up for their lack of mutant powers using technology which allows them to fly and emit explosive blasts [106] Dirigible is clearly the

Vanessa's apparent death, Fisk returned to a life of crime He quickly regained control by taking advantage of his knowledge of the weaknesses of all of New York's criminal organizations, and made a promise to keep the East Coast stable to stop crime bosses from the Midwest from expanding into his territory The Kingpin also gained the loyalty of infamous assassin Bullseye by promising him steady work When Daredevil stole his records, the Kingpin did nothing to stop him, plotting to get his old allies arrested so he could select more compliant replacements Daredevil realized this in time to stop himself from turning over the records, frustrating the Kingpin's plans [19] Kingpin maneuvered Daredevil into battling the Hand, hoping to get him killed [20] He secretly promoted corrupt mayoral candidate Randolph Cherryh, and hired the services of Elektra Natchios Daredevil found Vanessa alive but amnesiac, and used her as leverage to force Kingpin to end his support for Cherryh As retribution, he sent Elektra to kill Foggy Nelson (Daredevil's friend), but Elektra failed and was killed by Bullseye [21]\n\n\n1990s\nFisk later rehires Bullseye to look into the parties responsible for a major drug war in New York and survives an assassination attempt by Crossbones In retaliation, he sends Bullseye to assassinate the Red Skull (Crossbones's employer) The attempt fails, and the Kingpin instead defeats the Red Skull (in a clone of Captain America's body) in personal combat [26]\n\n\n2000s\nWhile in Japan, Fisk manipulates his adoptive daughter Maya Lopez (Echo) into thinking that Daredevil killed her biological father (although Fisk was actually responsible) to incite Daredevil's death [32] However, his plan backfires when Daredevil convinces Maya of the truth, and Lopez shoots the Kingpin in the eyes in retaliation, rendering him blind [33] Fisk eventually loses his criminal empire to Samuel Silke (one of his employees who works with Richard) in a bloody assassination bid, using the Kingpin's new status as a blind man to rally supporters [34] In the aftermath, Vanessa kills Richard and flees the country with Fisk's remaining wealth while the Kingpin recuperates in an unnamed East European country, broken and alone He is given an eye transplant which restores his eyesight [35] He eventually confronts Silke and fatally crushes the man's head, almost manages to regain his empire through sheer will, but is defeated by Daredevil (who declares himself the new Kingpin) Fisk is imprisoned as a result [36]\n\n\n2010s\nDuring the 2010 \"Shadowland\" storyline, the Kingpin approaches Iron Fist and Luke Cage, telling the two that they will need to take down Daredevil soon The Kingpin and Lady Bullseye later perform a ritual that brings back Ghost Rider to attack the Hand [51] After Daredevil is dethroned from Shadowland, the Kingpin takes both Shadowland and the Hand under his rule, officially taking his place back as the crime lord of New York City [52]\n\n\nMarvel NOW!\nAs part of the 2012 Marvel NOW! initiative, the Kingpin hears about how Otto Octavius as the Superior Spider-Man has been using brutal methods to take down the local crime families, which would leave a vacuum to fill The Kingpin's Shadowland hideout is attacked by the Superior Spider-Man to which the Kingpin claims that the Superior Spider-Man is much different from the nemesis he had fought While escaping, the Kingpin kills his doppelgänger Smedley Kornfeld (who was hired for events like this) to fool the Superior Spider-Man [58]\n\n\nAll-New, All-Different Marvel\nAs part of the 2015 \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\", Wilson Fisk represented Fisk Industries when he attended a meeting at the Universal Bank with Tiberius Stone of Alchemax, Sebastian Shaw of Shaw Industries, Darren Cross of Cross Technological Enterprises, Zeke Stane of Stane International, Shingen Harada of the Yashida Corporation, Frr'dox of Shi'ar Solutions Consolidated, and Wilhelmina Kensington of Kilgore Arms where they discussed with Dario Agger about his and Roxxon Energy Corporation's plans to exploit the Ten Realms of Asgard Wilson Fisk also saw the arrival of Exterminatrix of the Midas Foundation, who knocked out Dario and declared herself a new member of their assembly [63]\n\n\nMayor of New York City\nAfter HYDRA's defeat, Wilson Fisk is able to use a subsequent election to put himself forward as a last-minute candidate to become the Mayor of New York City, avoiding his criminal past being drawn into the issue by simply ignoring questions about it, aided by the fact that he has never been legitimately charged with anything With his primary policy being a bill to declare all vigilantes as criminals, and despite Daredevil's own recent efforts to create a precedent for superheroes testifying under their secret identities in Washington, he is able to have Daredevil arrested in an FBI sting operation, mocking his old nemesis with the knowledge that the people he protects chose Fisk to 'protect' them, prompting Daredevil to break a window and leap out of Fisk's office to begin his own efforts to bring down Fisk's empire Matt Murdock then applied for the position of deputy mayor [72] Although Daredevil eventually attempts to set up a 'sting operation' where he and his fellow street-level heroes will capture Mayor Fisk meeting with various gang bosses, Mayor Fisk uses this plan against them and uses the opportunity to arrest all of Daredevil's allies, subsequently attempting to provoke Daredevil into attacking him Although Mayor Fisk is able to arrest Daredevil as well, he is subsequently attacked and left in critical condition by the Hand, with various amendments made to New York's constitution by prior administrations putting Matt Murdock in control of the city, [73] once he has escaped from captivity, thanks to the Hand attacking the police van where he was being held, Fisk in critical condition and nobody willing to challenge the legal situation [74] While Matt Murdock used his skills as Daredevil and the acting mayor to keep the city safe with the street-level superheroes fighting off the Hand, Fisk recovered Murdock gave Fisk the position of mayor back to him where Fisk had to promise not to do anymore crusades against the vigilantes [75]\n\n\n2020s\nDuring the \"Last Remains\" arc, Norman Osborn meets up with Mayor Wilson Fisk and his men as they work on a plan to dispose of Kindred for what he did to them [81] Mayor Wilson Fisk is informed by Norman Osborn that Mary Jane Watson got through to Kindred After Norman as Green Goblin crashed the confrontation and threw a Pumpkin Bomb near Mary Jane, he gave Mayor Fisk the signal to activate the trap which causes the tomb to be engulfed in darkness [82] It was revealed that they pulled this off by enlisting the help of Spot who powered Project Blank that was inspired by the Darkforce Dome that once surrounded Manhattan [83] With Kindred locked up in a special cell in Ravencroft, Norman Osborn stated to Spider-Man that he saved him from Mayor Wilson Fisk [84] At Ravencroft, Mayor Wilson Fisk talks to Kindred about their encounter in the Parisian catacombs One of Mister Negative's lieutenants appears and informs him that the Inner Demons will help him get more than the Tablet of Life and Destiny [85]\n\n\nSecond marriage and retirement\nAfter Mike Murdock (Matt Murdock's magically created criminal twin brother) uses the Norn stone to cement himself into reality by changing the history of the world, he inadvertently makes it so that Mayor Fisk has an illegitimate son (alongside his legitimate son Richard) with Stella Pharris named Byron \"Butch\" Pharris [90]\n\n\nSkills, abilities, and equipment\nWhile the Kingpin has no superhuman powers, he is incredibly strong and significantly more durable than the average human, possessing remarkable strength concealed by his extremely corpulent appearance Most of his body mass is actually muscle that has been built to extraordinary size, much like a Super Heavyweight sumo wrestler, or some Olympic weightlifters and powerlifters but at greater strength levels He has been shown to be strong enough to hurl large men across a room, [17] and leave imprints in concrete walls after punching them [98] Defying his size, the Kingpin is a master of many forms of armed and unarmed combat, especially sumo wrestling His signature move is the bear hug His skill is such that he has once fought Captain America to a standstill in hand-to-hand combat [17] His daily workout typically consists of simultaneously overcoming five or more trained martial artists with his bare hands, [99] and he stores his valuables in a custom-built safe which has no lock, only a door which is so heavy that only the Kingpin himself is strong enough to open it [100]\n\n\nReception\nIn the \"Age of Apocalypse\" storyline, Wilson Fisk is known as Dirigible, a wealthy businessman who bought his way into the Marauders, a human terrorist group serving Apocalypse that makes up for their lack of mutant powers using technology which allows them to fly and emit

Punisher's use As the Punisher attempts to shoot the Kingpin with an M16, the Kingpin grabs the rifle and destroys it with his bare hands The Punisher responds by shooting two Desert Eagle pistols at the Kingpin, which only infuriates him The Punisher kills the Kingpin by shooting him in the throat, and his body collapses on top of Castle, where he is found and arrested by NYPD officers The Punisher's benefactor breaks him out of prison, whereupon Castle reveals he killed the Kingpin to acquire his high-tech weaponry, specifically a holographic scrambler, which Castle uses to disguise a

{"title": "Mahalia_Jackson", "content": "\nEarly life (1911 – c. 1928)\nMahalia Jackson was born to Charity Clark and Johnny Jackson, a stevedore and weekend barber Clark and Jackson were unmarried, a common arrangement among black women in New Orleans at the time He lived elsewhere, never joining Charity as a parent Both sets of Mahalia's grandparents were born into slavery, her paternal grandparents on a rice plantation and her maternal grandparents on a cotton plantation in Pointe Coupee Parish about 100 miles (160 km) north of New Orleans [1] [2] [b] Charity's older sister, Mahala \"Duke\" Paul, was her daughter's namesake, sharing the spelling without the \"I\" [c] Duke hosted Charity and their five other sisters and children in her leaky three-room shotgun house on Water Street in New Orleans' Sixteenth Ward The family called Charity's daughter \"Halie\"; she counted as the 13th person living in Aunt Duke's house As Charity's sisters found employment as maids and cooks, they left Duke's, though Charity remained with her daughter, Mahalia's half-brother Peter, and Duke's son Fred Mahalia was born with bowed legs and infections in both eyes Her eyes healed quickly but her Aunt Bell treated her legs with grease water massages with little result For her first few years, Mahalia was nicknamed \"Fishhooks\" for the curvature of her legs [1] [2] [3]\n\n\nRise of gospel music in Chicago (c. 1928 – c. 1931)\nIn a very cold December, Jackson arrived in Chicago For a week she was miserably homesick, unable to move off the couch until Sunday when her aunts took her to Greater Salem Baptist Church, an environment she felt at home in immediately, later stating it was \"the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me\" [10] When the pastor called the congregation to witness, or declare one's experience with God, Jackson was struck by the spirit and launched into a lively rendition of \"Hand Me Down My Silver Trumpet, Gabriel\", to an impressed but somewhat bemused audience The power of Jackson's voice was readily apparent but the congregation was unused to such an animated delivery She was nonetheless invited to join the 50-member choir, and a vocal group formed by the pastor's sons, Prince, Wilbur, and Robert Johnson, and Louise Lemon They performed as a quartet, the Johnson Singers, with Prince as the pianist: Chicago's first black gospel group Initially they hosted familiar programs singing at socials and Friday night musicals They wrote and performed moral plays at Greater Salem with offerings going toward the church [11] [12] [13]\n\n\nFish and bread singer (c. 1931 – 1945)\nSteadily, the Johnson Singers were asked to perform at other church services and revivals When larger, more established black churches expressed little interest in the Johnson Singers, they were courted by smaller storefront churches and were happy to perform there, though less likely to be paid as much or at all Newly arrived migrants attended these storefront churches; the services were less formal and reminiscent of what they had left behind Jackson found an eager audience in new arrivals, one calling her \"a fresh wind from the down-home religion.\" [22] Black Chicago was hit hard by the Great Depression, driving church attendance throughout the city, which Jackson credited with starting her career [23] Gradually and by necessity, larger churches became more open to Jackson's singing style As many of them were suddenly unable to meet their mortgage notes, adapting their musical programs became a viable way to attract and keep new members [24]\n\n\nApollo Records and national recognition (1946–1953)\nEach engagement Jackson took was farther from Chicago in a nonstop string of performances In 1946 she appeared at the Golden Gate Ballroom in Harlem In attendance was Art Freeman, a music scout for Apollo Records, a company catering to black artists and audiences concentrating mostly on jazz and blues Apollo's chief executive Bess Berman was looking to broaden their representation to other genres, including gospel Berman signed Jackson to a four-record session, allowing Jackson to pick the songs Her first release on Apollo, \"Wait 'til My Change Comes\" backed with \"I'm Going to Tell God All About it One of These Days\" did not sell well Neither did her second, \"I Want to Rest\" with \"He Knows My Heart\" Berman asked Jackson to record blues and she refused Berman told Freeman to release Jackson from any more recordings but Freeman asked for one more session to record the song Jackson sang as a warmup at the Golden Gate Ballroom concert \"Move On Up a Little Higher\" was recorded in two parts, one for each side of the 78 rpm record [34] [35]\n\n\nColumbia Records and civil rights activism (1954–1963)\nIn 1954, Jackson learned that Berman had been withholding royalties and had allowed her contract with Apollo to expire Mitch Miller offered her a $50,000-a-year (equivalent to $570,000 in 2023) four-year contract, and Jackson became the first gospel artist to sign with Columbia Records, a much larger company with the ability to promote her nationally Miller attempted to make her repertoire more appealing to white listeners, asking her to record ballads and classical songs, but again she refused \"Rusty Old Halo\" became her first Columbia single, and DownBeat declared Jackson \"the greatest spiritual singer now alive\" [49] Columbia worked with a local radio affiliate in Chicago to create a half hour radio program, The Mahalia Jackson Show Although it got an overwhelmingly positive reception and producers were eager to syndicate it nationally, it was cut to ten minutes long, then canceled She appeared on a local television program, also titled The Mahalia Jackson Show, which again got a positive reception but was canceled for lack of sponsors Despite white people beginning to attend her shows and sending fan letters, executives at CBS were concerned they would lose advertisers from Southern states who objected to a program with a black person as the primary focus [50] [51]\n\n\nLater years (1964–1972)\nJackson toured Europe again in 1964, mobbed in several cities and proclaiming, \"I thought I was the Beatles!\" in Utrecht [70] She appeared in the film The Best Man (1964), and attended a ceremony acknowledging Lyndon Johnson's inauguration at the White House, becoming friends with Lady Bird When at home, she attempted to remain approachable and maintain her characteristic sincerity Mostly in secret, Jackson had paid for the education of several young people as she felt poignant regret that her own schooling was cut short [71] [72] Stories of her gifts and generosity spread Her phone number continued to be listed in the Chicago public telephone book, and she received calls nonstop from friends, family, business associates, and strangers asking for money, advice on how to break into the music industry, or general life decisions they should make Her house had a steady flow of traffic that she welcomed Jackson had thoroughly enjoyed cooking since childhood, and took great pleasure in feeding all of her visitors, some of them staying days or weeks on her request [73] [j]\n\n\nStyle\n [Jackson would] sometimes build a song up and up, singing the words over and over to increase their intensity.. Like Bessie, she would slide up or slur down to a note She would also break up a word into as many syllables as she cared to, or repeat and prolong an ending to make it more effective: \"His love is deeper and deeper, yes deeper and deeper, it's deeper! and deeper, Lord! deeper and deeper, Lord! it's deeper than the se-e-e-e-a, yeah, oh my lordy, yeah deeper than the sea, Lord.\" And the last two words would be a dozen syllables each.\n\n\nSinging\n [Jackson would] sometimes build a song up and up, singing the words over and over to increase their intensity.. Like Bessie, she would slide up or slur down to a note She would also break up a word into as many syllables as she cared to, or repeat and prolong an ending to make it more effective: \"His love is

words would be a dozen syllables each.\n\n\nRecording\nJackson estimated that she sold 22 million records in her career [96] Her four singles for Decca and seventy-one for Apollo are widely acclaimed by scholars as defining gospel blues [97] The earliest are marked by minimal accompaniment with piano and organ Apollo added acoustic guitar, backup singers, bass, and drums in the 1950s Her singing is lively, energetic, and emotional, using \"a voice in the prime of its power and command\", according to author Bob Darden [98] Although hearing herself on Decca recordings years later prompted Jackson to declare they are \"not very good\", Viv Broughton calls \"Keep Me Every Day\" a \"gospel masterpiece\", and Anthony Heilbut praises its \"wonderful artless purity and conviction\", saying that in her Decca records, her voice \"was at its loveliest, rich and resonant, with little of the vibrato and neo-operatic obbligatos of later years\" Likewise, he calls Jackson's Apollo records \"uniformly brilliant\", choosing \"Even Me\", \"Just As I Am\", \"City Called Heaven\", and \"I Do, Don't You\" as perfect examples of her phrasing and contralto range, having an effect that is \"angelic but never saccharine\" [99] [4] [100] The New Grove Gospel, Blues, and Jazz cites the Apollo songs \"In the Upper Room\", \"Let the Power of the Holy Ghost Fall on Me\", and \"I'm Glad Salvation is Free\" as prime examples of the \"majesty\" of Jackson's voice According to musicologist Wilfrid Mellers, Jackson's early recordings demonstrate a \"sound that is all-embracing, as secure as the womb, from which singer and listener may be reborn The breathtaking beauty of the voice and superbly controlled transitions from speech to prayer to song heal and anneal.\" [98]\n\n\nLive performance\nShe roared like a Pentecostal preacher, she moaned and growled like the old Southern mothers, she hollered the gospel blues like a sanctified Bessie Smith and she cried into the Watts' hymns like she was back in a slave cabin They say that, in her time, Mahalia Jackson could wreck a church in minutes flat and keep it that way for hours on end.\"\n\n\nMildred Falls\nUntil 1946, Jackson used an assortment of pianists for recording and touring, choosing anyone who was convenient and free to go with her As her career progressed, she found it necessary to have a pianist available at a moment's notice, someone talented enough to improvise with her yet steeped in religious music Jackson found this in Mildred Falls (1921–1974), who accompanied her for 25 years Falls is often acknowledged as a significant part of Jackson's sound and therefore her success She was born Mildred Carter in Magnolia, Mississippi, learning to play on her family's upright piano, working with church choirs, and moving to California with a gospel singing group A broken marriage resulted in her return to Chicago in 1947 when she was referred to Jackson who set up a brief training with Robert Anderson, a longtime member of Jackson's entourage [38] Falls  accompanied her in nearly every performance and recording thereafter [124]\n\n\nInfluence\nJackson's influence was greatest in black gospel music Beginning in the 1930s, Sallie Martin, Roberta Martin, Willie Mae Ford Smith, Artelia Hutchins, and Jackson spread the gospel blues style by performing in churches around the U.S For 15 years the genre developed in relative isolation with choirs and soloists performing in a circuit of churches, revivals, and National Baptist Convention (NBC) meetings where music was shared and sold among musicians, songwriters, and ministers The NBC boasted a membership of four million, a network that provided the source material that Jackson learned in her early years and from which she drew during her recording career [130]\n\n\nOn music\nJackson's influence was greatest in black gospel music Beginning in the 1930s, Sallie Martin, Roberta Martin, Willie Mae Ford Smith, Artelia Hutchins,

provided the source material that Jackson learned in her early years and from which she drew during her recording career [130]\n\n\nOn black identity\nJackson's success had a profound effect on Black American identity, particularly for those who did not assimilate comfortably into white society Though she and gospel blues were denigrated by members of the black upper class into the 1950s, for middle and lower class black Americans her life was a rags to riches story in which she remained relentlessly positive and unapologetically at ease with herself and her mannerisms in the company of white people In Imitation of Life, her portrayal as a funeral singer embodied sorrow for the character Annie, a maid who dies from heartbreak Scholar Johari Jabir writes that in this role, \"Jackson

1970s. Known as the \"Queen of Gospel,\" she was one of the most influential gospel singers of all time, and her voice was described as \"a voice in the prime of its power and command.\"\n\n**Early Life (1911 – c. 1928)**\n\nMahalia Jackson was born to Charity Clark and Johnny Jackson, a stevedore and weekend barber. Clark and Jackson were unmarried, a common arrangement among black women in New Orleans at the time. Jackson lived elsewhere, never joining Charity as a parent. Both sets of Mahalia's grandparents were born into slavery, her paternal grandparents on a rice plantation and her maternal grandparents on a cotton plantation in Pointe Coupee Parish about 100 miles (160 km) north of New Orleans. Charity's older sister, Mahala \"Duke\" Paul, was her daughter's namesake, sharing the spelling without the \"I.\" Duke hosted Charity and their five other sisters and children in her leaky three-room shotgun house on Water Street in New Orleans' Sixteenth Ward. The family called Charity's daughter \"Halie\"; she counted as the 13th person living in Aunt Duke's house. As Charity's sisters found employment as maids and cooks, they left Duke's, though Charity remained with her daughter, Mahalia's half-brother Peter, and Duke's son Fred. Mahalia was born with bowed legs and infections in both eyes. Her eyes healed quickly, but her Aunt Bell treated her legs with grease water massages with little result. For her first few years, Mahalia was nicknamed \"Fishhooks\" for the curvature of her legs.\n\n**Rise of Gospel Music in Chicago (c. 1928 – c. 1931)**\n\nIn a very cold December, Jackson arrived in Chicago. For a week, she was miserably homesick, unable to move off the couch until Sunday when her aunts took her to Greater Salem Baptist Church, an environment she felt at home in immediately. Later, she stated it was \"the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me.\" When the pastor called the congregation to witness, or declare one's experience with God, Jackson was struck by the spirit and launched into a lively rendition of \"Hand Me Down My Silver Trumpet, Gabriel,\" to an impressed but somewhat bemused audience. The power of Jackson's voice was readily apparent, but the congregation was unused to such an animated delivery. She was nonetheless invited to join the 50-member choir and a vocal group formed by the pastor's sons, Prince, Wilbur, and Robert Johnson, and Louise Lemon. They performed as a quartet, the Johnson Singers, with Prince as the pianist: Chicago's first black gospel group. Initially, they hosted familiar programs singing at socials and Friday night musicals. They wrote and performed moral plays at Greater Salem with offerings going toward the church.\n\n**Fish and Bread Singer (c. 1931 – 1945)**\n\nSteadily, the Johnson Singers were asked to perform at other church services and revivals. When larger, more established black churches expressed little interest in the Johnson Singers, they were courted by smaller storefront churches and were happy to perform there, though less likely to be paid as much or at all. Newly arrived migrants attended these storefront churches; the services were less formal and reminiscent of what they had left behind. Jackson found an eager audience in new arrivals, one calling her \"a fresh wind from the down-home religion.\" Black Chicago was hit hard by the Great Depression, driving church attendance throughout the city, which Jackson credited with starting her career. Gradually and by necessity, larger churches became more open to Jackson's singing style. As many of them were suddenly unable to meet their mortgage notes, adapting their musical programs became a viable way to attract and keep new members.\n\n**Apollo Records and National Recognition (1946–1953)**\n\nEach engagement Jackson took was farther from Chicago in a nonstop string of performances. In 1946, she appeared at the Golden Gate Ballroom in Harlem. In attendance was Art Freeman, a music scout for Apollo Records, a company catering to black artists and audiences concentrating mostly on jazz and blues. Apollo's chief executive Bess Berman was looking to broaden their representation to other genres, including gospel. Berman signed Jackson to a four-record session, allowing Jackson to pick the songs. Her first release on Apollo, \"Wait 'til My Change Comes\" backed with \"I'm Going to Tell God All About it One of These Days,\" did not sell well. Neither did her second, \"I Want to Rest\" with \"He Knows My Heart.\" Berman asked Jackson to record blues, and she refused. Berman told Freeman to release Jackson from any more recordings, but Freeman asked for one more session to record the song Jackson sang as a warmup at the Golden Gate Ballroom concert \"Move On Up a Little Higher\" was recorded in two parts, one for each side of the 78 rpm record.\n\n**Columbia Records and Civil Rights Activism (1954–1963)**\n\nIn 1954, Jackson learned that Berman had been withholding royalties and had allowed her contract with Apollo to expire. Mitch Miller offered her a $50,000-a-year (equivalent to $570,000 in 2023) four-year contract, and Jackson became the first gospel artist to sign with Columbia Records, a much larger company with the ability to promote her nationally. Miller attempted to make her repertoire more appealing to white listeners, asking her to record ballads and classical songs, but again she refused. \"Rusty Old Halo\" became her first Columbia single, and DownBeat declared Jackson \"the greatest spiritual singer now alive.\" Columbia worked with a local radio affiliate in Chicago to create a half hour radio program, The Mahalia Jackson Show. Although it got an overwhelmingly positive reception and producers were eager to syndicate it nationally, it was cut to ten minutes long, then canceled. She appeared on a local television program, also titled The Mahalia Jackson Show, which again got a positive reception but was canceled for lack of sponsors. Despite white people beginning to attend her shows and sending fan letters, executives at CBS were concerned they would lose advertisers from Southern states who objected to a program with a black person as the primary focus.\n\n**Later Years (1964–1972)**\n\nJackson toured Europe again in 1964, mobbed in several cities and proclaiming, \"I thought I was the Beatles!\" in Utrecht. She appeared in the film The Best Man (1964), and attended a ceremony acknowledging Lyndon Johnson's inauguration at the White House, becoming friends with Lady Bird. When at home, she attempted to remain approachable and maintain her characteristic sincerity. Mostly in secret, Jackson had paid for the education of several young people as she felt poignant regret that her own schooling was cut short. Stories of her gifts and generosity spread. Her phone number continued to be listed in the Chicago public telephone book, and she received calls nonstop from friends, family, business associates, and strangers asking for money, advice on how to break into the music industry, or general life decisions they should make. Her house had a steady flow of traffic that she welcomed. Jackson had thoroughly enjoyed cooking since childhood, and took great pleasure in feeding all of her visitors, some of them staying days or weeks on her request.\n\n**Style**\n\nJackson's singing style was characterized by her ability to build a song up and up, singing the words over and over to increase their intensity. Like Bessie Smith, she would slide up or slur down to a note. She would also break up a word into as many syllables as she cared to, or repeat and prolong an ending to make it more effective: \"His love is deeper and deeper, yes deeper and deeper, it's deeper! and deeper, Lord! deeper and deeper, Lord! it's deeper than the se-e-e-e-a, yeah, oh my lordy, yeah deeper than the sea, Lord.\" And the last two words would be a dozen syllables each.\n\n**Recording**\n\nJackson estimated that she sold 22 million records in her career. Her four singles for Decca and seventy-one for Apollo are widely acclaimed by scholars as defining gospel blues. The earliest are marked by minimal accompaniment with piano and organ. Apollo added acoustic guitar, backup singers, bass, and drums in the 1950s. Her singing is lively, energetic, and emotional, using \"a voice in the prime of its power and command,\" according to author Bob Darden.\n\n**Live Performance**\n\nShe roared like a Pentecostal preacher, she moaned and growled like the old Southern mothers, she hollered the gospel blues like a sanctified Bessie Smith, and she cried into the Watts' hymns like she was back in a slave cabin. They say that, in her time, Mahalia Jackson could wreck a church in minutes flat and keep it that way for hours on end.\n\n**Influence**\n\nJackson's influence was greatest in black gospel music. Beginning in the 1930s, Sallie Martin, Roberta Martin, Willie Mae Ford Smith, Artelia Hutchins, and Jackson spread the gospel blues style by performing in churches around the U.S. For 15 years the genre developed in relative isolation with choirs and soloists performing in a circuit of churches, revivals, and National Baptist Convention (NBC) meetings where music was shared and sold among musicians, songwriters, and ministers. The NBC boasted a membership of four million, a network that provided the source material that Jackson learned in her early years and from which she drew during her recording career.\n\n**On Music**\n\nJackson's influence was greatest in black gospel music. Beginning in the 1930s, Sallie Martin, Roberta Martin, Willie Mae Ford Smith, Artelia Hutchins, and Jackson spread the gospel blues style by performing in churches around the U.S. For 15 years the genre developed in relative isolation with choirs and soloists performing in a circuit of churches, revivals, and National Baptist Convention (NBC) meetings where music was shared and sold among musicians, songwriters, and ministers.\n\n**On Black Identity**\n\nJackson's success had a profound effect on Black American identity, particularly for those who did not assimilate comfortably into white society. Though she and gospel blues were denigrated by members of the black upper class into the 1950s, for middle and lower class black Americans her life was a rags to riches story in which she remained relentlessly positive and unapologetically at ease with herself and her mannerisms in the company of white people. In Imitation of Life, her portrayal as a funeral singer embodied sorrow for the character Annie, a maid who dies from heartbreak. Scholar Johari Jabir writes that in this role, \"Jackson conjures up the unspeakable fatigue and collective weariness of centuries of black women.\" Through her music, she promoted hope and celebrated resilience in the black American experience.\n\n**Discography**\n\nJuvenile nonfiction\n\n**Filmography**\n\nJuvenile nonfiction\n\n**Honors**\n\nJuvenile nonfiction\n\n**See also**\n\nJuvenile nonfiction\n\n**Notes**\n\nJuvenile nonfiction\n\n**References**\n\nJuvenile nonfiction\n\n**Citations**\n\nJuvenile nonfiction\n\n**Sources**\n\nJuvenile nonfiction\n\n**Further reading**\n\nJuvenile nonfiction\n\n**External links**\n\nJuvenile nonfiction", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mahalia_Jackson\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life (1911 – c. 1928)\nMahalia Jackson was born to Charity Clark and Johnny Jackson, a stevedore and weekend barber Clark and Jackson were unmarried, a common arrangement among black women in New Orleans at the time He lived elsewhere, never joining Charity as a parent Both sets of Mahalia's grandparents were born into slavery, her paternal grandparents on a rice plantation and her maternal grandparents on a cotton plantation in Pointe Coupee Parish about 100 miles (160 km) north of New Orleans [1] [2] [b] Charity's older sister, Mahala \"Duke\" Paul, was her daughter's namesake, sharing the spelling without the \"I\" [c] Duke hosted Charity and their five other sisters and children in her leaky three-room shotgun house on Water Street in New Orleans' Sixteenth Ward The family called Charity's daughter \"Halie\";

that in her Decca records, her voice \"was at its loveliest, rich and resonant, with little of the vibrato and neo-operatic obbligatos of later years\" Likewise, he calls Jackson's Apollo records \"uniformly brilliant\", choosing \"Even Me\", \"Just As I Am\", \"City Called Heaven\", and \"I Do, Don't You\" as perfect examples of her phrasing and contralto range, having an effect that is \"angelic but never saccharine\" [99] [4] [100] The New Grove Gospel, Blues, and Jazz cites the Apollo songs \"In the Upper Room\", \"Let the Power of the Holy Ghost Fall on Me\", and \"I'm Glad Salvation is Free\" as prime examples of the \"majesty\" of Jackson's voice According to musicologist Wilfrid Mellers, Jackson's early recordings demonstrate a \"sound that is all-embracing, as secure

Jackson used an assortment of pianists for recording and touring, choosing anyone who was convenient and free to go with her As her career progressed, she found it necessary to have a pianist available at a moment's notice, someone talented enough to improvise with her yet steeped in religious music Jackson found this in Mildred Falls (1921–1974), who accompanied her for 25 years Falls is often acknowledged as a significant part of Jackson's sound and therefore her success She was born Mildred Carter in Magnolia, Mississippi, learning to play on her family's upright piano, working with church choirs, and moving to California with a gospel singing group A broken marriage resulted in her return to Chicago in 1947 when she was referred to Jackson who set up a brief training with Robert Anderson, a longtime member of Jackson's entourage [38] Falls  accompanied her in nearly every performance and recording thereafter [124]\n\n\nInfluence\nJackson's influence was greatest in black

{"title": "Epiphany_(holiday)", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe word Epiphany is from Koine Greek ἐπιφάνεια, epipháneia, meaning manifestation or appearance It is derived from the verb φαίνειν, phainein, meaning \"to appear\" [26] In classical Greek it was used for the appearance of dawn, of an enemy in war, but especially of a manifestation of a deity to a worshiper (a theophany) In the Septuagint the word is used of a manifestation of the God of Israel (2 Maccabees 15:27) [27] In the New Testament the word is used in 2 Timothy 1:10 to refer either to the birth of Christ or to his appearance after his resurrection, and five times to refer to his Second Coming [27]\n\n\nHistory\n\nEpiphany may have originated in the Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman Empire as a feast to honor the baptism of Jesus Around 200, Clement of Alexandria wrote: \n\nEarly history\n\nEpiphany may have originated in the Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman Empire as a feast to honor the baptism of Jesus Around 200, Clement of Alexandria wrote: \n\nModern period\nIn the Latin Church, from 1893 until 1955, Epiphany was celebrated as an eight-day feast, known as the Octave of Epiphany, beginning on January 6 and ending on January 13 The Sunday within that octave had been the feast of the Holy Family, and Christmastide was reckoned as the twelve days ending on January 5, followed by the January 6–13 octave  Before the 1969 revision of its liturgy, the Sundays following the Octave of Epiphany or, when this was abolished, following the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, which was instituted to take the place of the Octave Day of Epiphany were named as the \"Second (etc., up to Sixth) Sunday after Epiphany\", as the at least 24 Sundays following Pentecost Sunday and Trinity Sunday were known as the \"Second (etc.) Sunday after Pentecost\" (If a year had more than 24 Sundays after Pentecost, up to four unused post-Epiphany Sundays were inserted between the 23rd and the 24th Sunday after Pentecost.) The Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices, which has received the imprimatur of John Michael D'Arcy, with reference to Epiphanytide, thus states that \"The Epiphany season extends from January 6 to Septuagesima Sunday, and has from one to six Sundays, according to the date of Easter White is the color for the octave; green is the liturgical color for the season.\" [50]\n\n\nEpiphany by Christian tradition\nEpiphany is celebrated by both the Eastern and Western Churches, but a major difference between them is precisely which events the feast commemorates For Western Christians, the feast primarily commemorates the coming of the Magi, with only a minor reference to the baptism of Jesus and the miracle at the Wedding at Cana Eastern churches celebrate the Baptism of Christ in the Jordan In both traditions, the essence of the feast is the same: the manifestation of Christ to the world (whether as an infant or in the Jordan), and the Mystery of the Incarnation The miracle at the Wedding at Cana is also celebrated during Epiphany as a first manifestation of Christ's public life [53]\n\n\nCatholic Church\nIn the Catholic Church, Epiphany is either observed on the traditional fixed date of January 6, or it is transferred to the Sunday between January 2 and January 8  Most dioceses in the United States observe the latter  In each system, the date of Epiphany affects the dates of other feasts: [54]\n\n\nProtestant churches\nLutheran, Anglican, Moravian, Methodist and United Protestant congregations, along with those of other denominations, may celebrate Epiphany on January 6, on the following Sunday within the Epiphany week (octave), or at another time (Epiphany Eve January 5, the nearest Sunday, etc.) as local custom dictates [58] [59]  Many in the West, such as adherents of the Anglican Communion, Lutheran Churches and Methodist Churches, observe a twelve-day festival, starting on December 25, and ending on January 5, known as Christmastide or The Twelve Days of Christmas, which the Epiphany season follows.\n\n\nEastern Orthodox churches\nEastern churches celebrate Epiphany (Theophany) on January 6 Some, as in Greece, employ the modern Revised Julian calendar, which until 2800 coincides with the Gregorian calendar, the one in use for civil purposes in most countries Other Eastern churches, as in Russia, hold to the older Julian

churches\nForefeast: The liturgical Forefeast of Theophany begins on January 2 [76] and concludes with the Paramony on January 5.\n\n\nOriental Orthodox\nIn the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the feast is known as Timkat and is celebrated on the day that the Gregorian calendar calls January 19, but on January 20 in years when Enkutatash in the Ethiopian calendar falls on Gregorian September 12 (i.e when the following February in the Gregorian calendar will have 29 days) The celebration of this feast features blessing of water and solemn processions with the sacred tabot A priest carries this to a body of water where it stays overnight, with the Metsehafe Qeddassie celebrated in the early morning Later in the morning, the water is blessed to the accompaniment of the reading of the four Gospel accounts of the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan and the people are sprinkled with or go into the water The tabot returns in procession to the church.\n\n\nMusic\nJohann Sebastian Bach composed in

around the world In some cultures, the greenery and nativity scenes put up at Christmas are taken down at Epiphany In other cultures these remain up until Candlemas on February 2 In countries historically shaped by Western Christianity (Roman Catholicism, Protestantism) these customs often involve gift giving, \"king cakes\" and a celebratory close to the Christmas season In traditionally Orthodox nations, water, baptismal rites and house blessings are typically central to these celebrations.\n\n\nArgentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay\nIn Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, as in other Latin American countries, the day is called \"Día de Reyes\" (The Day of Kings, a reference to the Biblical Magi), commemorating the arrival of the Magi to revere Jesus as son of God The night of January 5 into the morning of January 6 is known as \"Noche de Reyes\" (The Night of Kings) and children leave their shoes by the door, along with grass and water for the camels On the morning of January 6, they get up early and rush to see their shoes, where they are expecting to find gifts left by the \"Reyes\" who, according to tradition, bypass the houses of children who are awake On January 6, a \"Rosca de Reyes\" (a ring-shaped Epiphany cake) is eaten and all Christmas decorations are traditionally put away.\n\n\nBulgaria\nIn Bulgaria, Epiphany is celebrated on January 6 and is known as Bogoyavlenie (\"Manifestation of God\"), Кръщение Господне (Krashtenie Gospodne or \"Baptism of the Lord\") or Yordanovden (\"Day of Jordan\", referring to the river) On this day, a wooden cross is thrown by a priest into the sea, river or lake and young men race to retrieve it As the date is in early January and the waters are close to freezing, this is considered an honorable act and it is said that good health will be bestowed upon the home of the swimmer who is the first to reach the cross [86]\n\n\nBenelux\nSpeakers of Dutch and Flemish call this day Driekoningen (Three kings), while German speakers call it Dreikönigstag (Three Kings' Day) In Belgium, Luxembourg, the southern parts of the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany, children in groups of three (symbolizing the Biblical Magi) proceed in costume from house to house while singing songs typical for the occasion, and receiving a coin or some sweets at each door They may each carry a paper lantern symbolizing the star [89] In the Netherlands (provinces of Brabant and Limburg only), [90] these troupes gather for competitions and present their skits/songs for an audience As in Belgium, Koningentaart (Kings' tart), puff pastry with almond filling, is prepared with a black bean hidden inside Whoever finds the bean in his or her piece is king or queen for the day A more typically Dutch version is Koningenbrood, or Kings' bread In the north of the Netherlands, the traditions have died out, except for a very few places [91] Another Low Countries tradition on Epiphany is to open up doors and windows to let good luck in for the coming year.\n\n\nBrazil\nIn Brazil, the day is called \"Dia dos Reis\" (The Day of Kings) and in the rest of Latin America \"Día de Reyes\" commemorating the arrival of the Magi to confirm Jesus as son of God The night of January 5 into the morning of January 6 is known as \"Night of Kings\" (also called the Twelfth Night) and is feasted with music, sweets and regional dishes as the last night of Nativity, when Christmas decorations are traditionally put away [92]\n\n\nChile\nThis day is sometimes known as the Día de los Tres Reyes Magos (The day of the Three Royal Magi) or La Pascua de los Negros (Holy Day of the Black men) [93] in Chile, although the latter is rarely heard, because it was the day when slaves were allowed not to work.\n\n\nDominican Republic\nIn the Dominican Republic, the Día de los Tres Reyes Magos (The day of the Three Royal Magi) and in this day children receive gifts on the christmas tree in a similar fashion to Christmas day On this day public areas are very active with children accompanied by their parents trying out their new toys.\n\n\nEgypt\nThe feast of the Epiphany is celebrated by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which falls on 11 Tobe of the Coptic calendar, as the moment when in the baptism of Jesus the skies opened and God himself revealed to all as father of Jesus and all mankind It is then a moment of revelation of epiphany This celebration started to include all the processes of incarnation of Jesus, from his birth on Christmas until his baptism in the river Jordan For the Coptic Orthodox Church it is also a moment in which the path of Jesus to the Cross begins Therefore, in many celebrations there are certain similarities with the celebrations of Holy Friday during the time of Easter Since the Epiphany is one of the seven great feasts of the Coptic Orthodox Church, it is a day of strict fasting, and several religious celebrations are held on this day The day is related to the blessing of waters that are used all throughout the year in the church celebrations, and it is a privileged day to celebrate baptisms It is also a day in which many houses are blessed with water It may take several days for the local priest to bless all the houses of the parishioners that ask for it, and so the blessing of the houses may go into the after-feasts of the Epiphany celebrations However, it must be done before the beginning of Lent [94]\n\n\nEngland\nIn England, the celebration of the night before Epiphany, Epiphany Eve, is known as Twelfth Night (the first night of Christmas is December 25–26, and Twelfth Night is January 5–6), and was a traditional time for mumming and the wassail The Yule log was left burning until this day, and the charcoal left was kept until the next Christmas to kindle next year's Yule log, as well as to protect the house from fire and lightning [95] In the past, Epiphany was also a day for playing practical jokes, similar to April Fool's Day Today in England, Twelfth Night is still as popular a day for plays as when Shakespeare's Twelfth Night was first performed in 1601, and annual celebrations involving the Holly Man are held in London [96] A traditional dish for Epiphany was Twelfth Cake, a rich, dense, typically English fruitcake As in Europe, whoever found the baked-in bean was king for a day, but uniquely to English tradition other items were sometimes included in the cake Whoever found the clove was the villain; the twig, the fool; and the rag, the tart [clarification needed] Anything spicy or hot, like ginger snaps and spiced ale, was considered proper Twelfth Night fare, recalling the costly spices brought by the Wise Men Another English Epiphany sweetmeat was the traditional jam tart, made appropriate to the occasion by being fashioned in the form of a six-pointed star symbolising the Star of Bethlehem, and thus called Epiphany tart The discerning English cook sometimes tried to use thirteen different colored jams on the tart on this day for luck, creating a pastry resembling stained glass [97]\n\n\nEthiopia and Eritrea\nIn the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Church, the feast is known as Timkat and is celebrated on the day that the Gregorian calendar calls January 19, but on January 20 in years when New Year in the Ethiopian calendar falls on Gregorian September 12 (i.e when the following February in the Gregorian calendar will have 29 days) The celebration of this feast features blessing of water and solemn processions with the sacred Tabot [98]\n\n\nFinland\nIn Finland, Epiphany is called loppiainen, a name which goes back to the 1600s In the 1500s the Swedish-Finnish Lutheran church called Epiphany \"Day of the Holy Three Kings\", while before this, the older term Epiphania was used In the Karelian language Epiphany is called vieristä, meaning cross, from the Orthodox custom of submerging a cross three times to bless water on this day [99] Today, in the Lutheran church, Epiphany is a day dedicated to a focus on missionary work in addition to the Wise Men narrative Between 1973 and 1991 Epiphany was observed in Finland on a Saturday each year no earlier than January 6, and no later than January 12 After that time however, the traditional date of January 6 was restored and has since been observed once again as a national public holiday.\n\n\nFrancophone Europe\nIn France people share one of two types of king cake In the northern half of France and Belgium the cake is called a galette des Rois, and is a round, flat, and golden cake made with flake pastry and often filled with frangipane, fruit, or chocolate In the south, in Provence, and in the south-west, a crown-shaped cake or brioche filled with fruit called a gâteau des Rois is eaten In Romandie, both types can be found though the latter is more common Both types of cake contain a charm, usually a porcelain or plastic figurine, called a fève (broad bean in French) [100]\n\n\nGerman-speaking Europe\nJanuary 6 is a public holiday in Austria, three federal states of Germany, and three cantons of Switzerland, as well as in parts of Graubünden.\nIn the German-speaking lands, groups of young people called Sternsinger (star singers) travel from door to door They are dressed as the Biblical Magi, and their leader carries a star, usually of painted wood attached to a broom handle Often these groups are four girls, or two boys and two girls in order to sing in four-part harmony They sing traditional songs and newer ones such as \"Stern über Bethlehem\" They are not necessarily three wise men German Lutherans often note in a lighthearted fashion that the Bible never specifies that the Weisen (Magi) were men, or that there were three The star singers solicit donations for worthy causes, such as efforts to end hunger in Africa, organized jointly by the Catholic and Protestant churches, and they will also be offered treats at the homes they visit [102] The young people then perform the traditional house blessing, by marking the year over the doorway with chalk In Roman Catholic communities this may even today be a serious spiritual event with the priest present, but among Protestants it is more a tradition, and a part of the German notion of Gemütlichkeit Usually on the Sunday following Epiphany, these donations are brought into churches Here all of the children who have gone out as star singers, once again in their costumes, form a procession of sometimes dozens of wise men and stars The German Chancellor and Parliament also receive a visit from the star singers at Epiphany [103]\n\n\nGreece, Cyprus\nIn Greece, Cyprus and the Greek diaspora throughout the world, the feast is called the Theophany, [citation needed] or colloquially Phōta (Greek: Φώτα, \"Lights\") [106] It is the \"Great Celebration\" or Theotromi In some regions of Macedonia (West) it is the biggest festival of the year The Baptism of Christ symbolizes the rebirth of man, its importance is such that until the fourth century Christians celebrated New Year on this day Customs revolve around the Great Blessing of the Waters [107] It marks the end of the traditional ban on sailing, as the tumultuous winter seas are cleansed of the mischief-prone kalikántzaroi, the goblins that try to torment God-fearing Christians through the festive season During this ceremony, a cross is thrown into the water, and the men compete to retrieve it for good luck The Phota form the middle of another festive triduum, together with Epiphany Eve, when children sing the Epiphany carols, and the great feast of St John the Baptist (January 7 and eve), [citation needed] when the numerous Johns and Joans celebrate their name-day.\n\n\nGuadeloupe Islands\nCelebrations in Guadeloupe have a different feel from elsewhere in the world Epiphany here does not mean the last day of Christmas celebrations, but rather the first day of Kannaval (Carnival), which lasts until the evening before Ash Wednesday Carnival, in turn, ends with the grand brilé Vaval, the burning of Vaval, the king of the Kannaval, amidst the cries and wails of the crowd [108]\n\n\nHungary\nOn this day, the Christmas trees are taken down Nowadays, the traditions associated with the holiday are being followed in fewer and fewer villages Many traditions and superstition are associated with this day During house blessings (called koleda), it was common to write GMB on the wall (a monogram made out of the names of the 3 Kings) next to the year to protect them against witches hex or lightnings The preachers were given a bowl of corn, a bowl of peas, a pig's foot to eat and gifted them a bag of plums, nuts, flour, salo and sausages With the holywater they blessed their kids, house and animals and their dead (sprinkled on coffins) There were places where people attributed magical powers to simple brooks, like in Jászdózsa, where they cut a hole in the Tarna (today: Trnava) and people splashed each other with the icy water to be healthy Csillagének (Star singing) and Csillagozás were both common The children doing the Csillagének prepared costumes and mechanically-moved stars, and it wasn't only performed by boys This was accomponied by Háromkirályjárás where next to the singing they also performed the story of the Biblical Magi and the Story of Herod  As with most Hungarian holidays, there were also superstitions connected to Epiphany (Vízkereszt): for example, in Józseffalva, Bukovina, it was believed that if you braid that day the sausages will become longer next year  [109]\n\n\nIndia\nIn parts of southern India, Epiphany is called the Three Kings Festival and is celebrated in front of the local church like a fair This day marks the close of the Advent and Christmas season and people remove the cribs and nativity sets at home In Goa Epiphany may be locally known by its Portuguese name Festa dos Reis In the village of Reis Magos, in Goa, there is a fort called Reis Magos (Wise Men) or Três Reis Magos for Biblical Magi Celebrations include a widely attended procession, with boys arrayed as the Magi, leading to the Franciscan Chapel of the Magi near the Goan capital of Panjim [110] Other popular Epiphany processions are held in Chandor Here three young boys in regal robes and splendid crowns descend the nearby hill of Our Lady of Mercy on horseback towards the main church where a three-hour festival Mass is celebrated The route before them is decorated with streamers, palm leaves and balloons with the smallest children present lining the way, shouting greetings to the Kings The Kings are traditionally chosen, one each, from Chandor's three hamlets of Kott, Cavorim and Gurdolim, whose residents helped build the Chandor church in 1645.\n\n\nIreland\nThe Irish call the day the Feast of the Epiphany or traditionally Little Christmas or \"Women's Christmas\" (Irish: Nollaig na mBan) On Nollaig na mBan, women traditionally rested and celebrated for themselves after the cooking and work of the Christmas holidays The custom was for women to gather on this day for a special meal, but on the occasion of Epiphany accompanied by wine, to honor the Miracle at the Wedding at Cana [citation needed]\n\n\nItaly\nIn Italy, Epiphany is a national holiday and is associated with the figure of the Befana (the name being a corruption of the word Epifania), a broomstick-riding old woman who, on the night between January 5 and 6, brings gifts to children or a lump of \"coal\" (really black candy) for the times they have not been good during the year The legend told of her is that, having missed her opportunity to bring a gift to the child Jesus together with the Biblical Magi, she now brings gifts to other children on that night [118] [119] [29]\n\n\nJordan\nThousands of Jordanian Christians, tourists and pilgrims flock to Al-Maghtas site on the east bank of the Jordan River in January every year to mark Epiphany, where large masses and celebrations are held [120] \"Al-Maghtas\", meaning \"baptism\" or \"immersion\" in Arabic, is an archaeological World Heritage site in Jordan, officially known as \"Baptism Site \"Bethany Beyond the Jordan\" (Al-Maghtas)\" It is considered to be the original location of the Baptism of Jesus and the ministry of John the Baptist and has been venerated as such since at least the Byzantine period [12]\n\n\nLatvia\nEpiphany is known in Latvia as Trijkungu diena (Three Kings Day) by Catholics or Zvaigznes diena (Star Day) by Lutherans after the custom of star singing, and the Star of Bethlehem which led the Magi to the Christ Child [122] In the past bright stars of fabric were sewn onto the background of dark colored quilts, representing the night sky Epiphany was a day of enjoyment, spent in horse-drawn open sleighs, and these quilts would then be taken along to cover the laps of the merry riders [123] If Epiphany Day was bright and mild and the sun \"warmed the horses' backs\" it was said that the coming year would bring only peace If the night before Epiphany saw clear starry skies, it meant Latvia could expect a fine harvest in the coming Summer Weaving and wood-cutting were \"bad luck\", giving both men and women a proper holiday, and if a dog was heard barking on Epiphany one ought to look for his or her future spouse in that same direction Special three-corner apple cakes are eaten on this day, and as in other countries, star singing, visiting and house blessings have long been popular [124]\n\n\nLebanon\nEpiphany, celebrated on January 6, is the feast for the Roman Church that commemorates the visit of the Wise Men, the magi However, in the Maronite Church, in accordance with the ancient tradition, it represents the public announcement of Jesus' mission when he was baptized in the Jordan by John the Forerunner, also known as \"John the Baptist\" On the occasion, Lebanese Christians pray for their deceased [125]\n\n\nNorth Macedonia\nEpiphany in North Macedonia is known as Vodici (Водици) [126] On this day the priest throws a wooden cross into the water, to symbolize the baptism of Christ [citation needed] Men jump into the cold water to retrieve the cross, and whoever retrieves it is believed to be blessed during the whole year [citation needed] These are very festive gatherings with many spectacles attending the sites Special food jelly from pork and beef meat and bones called \"pacha\" (пача) or \"pivtii\" (пивтии) is prepared the day before, but served on the day after Epiphany, together with warm local brandy, rakija (ракија) [127] Epiphany is a non-working day for the Orthodox believers in North Macedonia [128]\n\n\nMalta\nIn Malta, Epiphany is commonly known as It-Tre Re (The Three Kings) Until the 1980s, January 6 was a public holiday, but today the Maltese celebrate Epiphany on the first Sunday of the year Children and students still take January 6 as a school holiday and Christmas decorations are lit up through this day on most public streets The Maltese also have a long-standing custom of presenting concerts in honor of Epiphany, including the prestigious annual Epiphany Concert organized by the Malta Council for Culture and Arts, performed by the National Orchestra In 2010, the Epiphany Concert which used to be held before a select audience, was opened to the general public following a decision by the President The Ministry of Education and Culture therefore moved from the venue from the Palace to the historic Sacra Infermeria, also known as the Mediterranean Conference Centre [129] Qagħaq tal-Għasel or tal-Qastanija (Maltese honey rings) are typically served at Epiphany in Malta.\n\n\nMexico\nThe evening of January 5 marks the Twelfth Night of Christmas and is when the figurines of the three Biblical Magi are added to the nativity scene Traditionally in Mexico, as with many other Latin American countries, Santa Claus does not hold the cachet that he does in the United States Rather, it is the Magi who are the bearers of gifts, who leave presents in or near the shoes of small children [130] Mexican families also commemorate the date by eating Rosca de reyes In modern Mexico however, and particularly in the larger cities and in the North, local traditions are now being observed and intertwined with the greater North American Santa Claus tradition, as well as with other holidays such as Halloween, due to Americanization via film and television, creating an economy of gifting tradition that spans from Christmas Day until January 6.\n\n\nPeru\nPeru shares Epiphany customs with Spain and the rest of Latin America Peruvian national lore holds that Francisco Pizarro was the first to call Lima \"Ciudad de los Reyes\" (City of the Kings) because the date of the Epiphany coincided with the day he and his two companions searched for, and found, an ideal location for a new capital Even more popular in Peru than gift giving is the custom of the Bajada de Reyes when parties are held in honor of the taking down of family and public nativity scenes, and carefully putting them away until the next Christmas [131]\n\n\nPhilippines\nIn the Philippines, Epiphany is known as \"Three Kings' Day\" and Pasko ng Matatanda (\"Feast of the Elderly\"), and marks the official close of the country's Christmas season As a day of feasting, some Filipinos celebrate with gift-giving and greet each other \"Happy Three Kings!\" [132]\n\n\nPoland\nIn Poland, Epiphany, or Trzech Króli (Three Kings) is celebrated in grand fashion, with huge parades held welcoming the Wise Men, often riding on camels or other animals from the zoo, in Warsaw, Poznań [133] and over 2,000 other cities The Wise Men pass out sweets, children process in renaissance wear, carols are sung, and living nativity scenes are enacted, all similar to celebrations in Italy or Spain, pointing to the country's Catholic heritage Children may also dress in colors signifying Europe, Asia, and Africa (the supposed homes of the Wise Men) and at the end of the parade route, church leaders often preach on the spiritual significance of the Epiphany In 2011, by an act of Parliament, Epiphany was restored as an official non-working national public holiday in Poland for the first time since it was canceled under communism fifty years earlier [134]\n\n\nPortugal\nIn Portugal, Epiphany, January 6, is called dia dos Reis (Day of the Kings), during which the traditional Bolo Rei (King cake) is baked and eaten Plays and pageants are popular on this day, and parents often hold parties for their children Epiphany is also a time when the traditional Portuguese dances known as Mouriscadas and Paulitos are performed The latter is an elaborate stick dance The dancers, who are usually men but may be dressed as women, manipulate sticks or staves (in imitation swords) in two opposing lines [138] It is a tradition too in Portugal for people to gather in small groups and to go from house to house to sing the Reis (meaning \"Kings\") which are traditional songs about the life of Jesus The singers also bring greetings to the owners of the house After singing for a while outside, they are invited in, and the owners of the house offer them sweets, liqueurs, and other Epiphany delicacies These Reis usually begin on Epiphany eve and last until January 20 [139]\n\n\nRomania and Moldova\nIn Romania and Moldova, Epiphany is called Boboteaza In south-eastern Romania, following religious services, men participate in winter horse races Before the race, the men line up with their horses before the priest, who will bless them by sprinkling them with green branches that have been dipped into Epiphany holy water Sometimes people desire to have this blessing for themselves as well Winning the Epiphany race is a great honor for both horse and rider, while the post-race celebrations, win or not, are highly festive As in other Eastern Orthodox heritage countries, water rites play a special role on this day [142] A unique piece of Romanian folk wisdom holds that if a girl slips on ice – or, better yet, falls into water – on Epiphany, she will surely marry before the year is out [143]\n\n\nRussia\nThe Epiphany, celebrated in Russia on January 19, marks the baptism of Jesus in the Eastern Orthodox Church As elsewhere in the Orthodox world, the Russian Church conducts the rite of the Great Blessing of the Waters, also known as \"the Great Sanctification of the Water\" on that day (or the eve before) [145] The priest-led procession could simply proceed to the font, [145] but traditionally the worshipers would go to a nearby lake or river.\n\n\nSlovenia\nIn Slovenia, especially in the Western part of the country, during the first day of the year and on Epiphany, children go from house to house because villagers will give them almonds, dried figs, nuts, cookies or other good things that they have at home [149]\n\n\nSpain\nIn Spain and some Latin American countries, Epiphany day is called El Día de Reyes [150] i.e., the day when a group of Kings or Magi, as related in the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, arrived to worship and bring three gifts to the baby Jesus after following a star in the heavens In Spanish tradition on January 6, three of the Kings: Melchior, Gaspar, and Balthazar, representing Arabia, the Orient, and Africa, arrived on horse, camel and elephant, bringing respectively gold, frankincense and myrrh to the baby Jesus Before going to bed on the eve of January 6, children polish their shoes and leave them ready for the Kings' presents to be put in them The next morning presents will appear under their shoes, or if the children are deemed to have misbehaved during the year, coal (usually a lump of hard sugar candy dyed black, called Carbón Dulce) [151] Most towns in Spain arrange colorful parades representing the arrival of the Reyes Magos to town so children can see them on their camels or carriages before they go to bed The oldest of these parades is held in Alcoy, Alicante (Valencian Community) which has hosted an annual parade since 1885 [152] Sweet wine, nibbles, fruit and milk are left for the Kings and their camels In Spain, children typically receive presents on this day, rather than on Christmas, though this tradition has changed lately, and children now receive presents on both days The Epiphany bread/cake is known as Roscón, [153] Tortell de Reis in Catalan, and in Mexico as Rosca de reyes [154]\n\n\nSweden\nEpiphany is a public holiday in Sweden, where it is known as trettondedag jul (\"Thirteenth Day Yule\"), as January 6 is the thirteenth day after Christmas Eve, the main day on which Christmas is celebrated in Sweden However, the end of the Christmas celebration is on January 13, St Knut's Day, more commonly known as \"Twentieth Day Yule\" (or \"Twentieth Day Knut\").\n\n\nUnited States\nIn Louisiana, Epiphany is the beginning of the Carnival season, during which it is customary to bake King Cakes, similar to the Rosca mentioned above It is round in shape, filled with cinnamon, glazed white, and coated in traditional carnival color sanding sugar The person who finds the doll (or bean) must provide the next king cake The interval between Epiphany and Mardi Gras is sometimes known as \"king cake season\", and many may be consumed during this period The Carnival season begins on King's Day (Epiphany), and there are many traditions associated with that day in Louisiana and along the Catholic coasts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida King cakes are first sold then, Carnival krewes begin having their balls on that date, and the first New Orleans krewe parades in street cars that night.\n\n\nWales\nOn January 6, the Feast of the Epiphany has long been an important celebration in Wales, known there as Ystwyll In Glamorganshire, a huge loaf or cake was prepared, which was then divided up into three parts to represent Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Biblical Magi A large company of neighbours was invited to be present at the dividing of the cake in which rings were concealed Whoever discovered a ring in his piece of cake (or bread) was elected as King or Queen and presided over the day's festivities January 6 was the old-calendar Christmas Day and many of the festivities connected with it lasted well over a century after the new calendar was introduced in 1752 [citation needed]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther

Wise Men, to the baby Jesus. The word Epiphany is derived from the Koine Greek word ἐπιφάνεια (epipháneia), meaning \"manifestation\" or \"appearance.\" It is a day of great celebration and significance, marking the end of the Christmas season and the beginning of a new year.\n\nHistory\n\nEpiphany may have originated in the Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman Empire as a feast to honor the baptism of Jesus. Around 200, Clement of Alexandria wrote about the Epiphany, and it became a significant holiday in the Eastern Orthodox Church. In the Western Church, Epiphany was celebrated as an eight-day feast, known as the Octave of Epiphany, from 1893 to 1955. The Sunday within the octave was the feast of the Holy Family, and Christmastide was reckoned as the twelve days ending on January 5, followed by the January 6-13 octave.\n\nModern Period\n\nIn the Latin Church, from 1893 until 1955, Epiphany was celebrated as an eight-day feast, known as the Octave of Epiphany, beginning on January 6 and ending on January 13. The Sunday within that octave had been the feast of the Holy Family, and Christmastide was reckoned as the twelve days ending on January 5, followed by the January 6-13 octave. Before the 1969 revision of its liturgy, the Sundays following the Octave of Epiphany or, when this was abolished, following the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, which was instituted to take the place of the Octave Day of Epiphany were named as the \"Second (etc., up to Sixth) Sunday after Epiphany,\" as the at least 24 Sundays following Pentecost Sunday and Trinity Sunday were known as the \"Second (etc.) Sunday after Pentecost\" (If a year had more than 24 Sundays after Pentecost, up to four unused post-Epiphany Sundays were inserted between the 23rd and the 24th Sunday after Pentecost.).\n\nEpiphany by Christian Tradition\n\nEpiphany is celebrated by both the Eastern and Western Churches, but a major difference between them is precisely which events the feast commemorates. For Western Christians, the feast primarily commemorates the coming of the Magi, with only a minor reference to the baptism of Jesus and the miracle at the Wedding at Cana. Eastern churches celebrate the Baptism of Christ in the Jordan. Both traditions, however, consider the essence of the feast to be the manifestation of Christ to the world (whether as an infant or in the Jordan), and the Mystery of the Incarnation. The miracle at the Wedding at Cana is also celebrated during Epiphany as a first manifestation of Christ's public life.\n\nCatholic Church\n\nIn the Catholic Church, Epiphany is either observed on the traditional fixed date of January 6, or it is transferred to the Sunday between January 2 and January 8. Most dioceses in the United States observe the latter. In each system, the date of Epiphany affects the dates of other feasts.\n\nProtestant Churches\n\nLutheran, Anglican, Moravian, Methodist, and United Protestant congregations, along with those of other denominations, may celebrate Epiphany on January 6, on the following Sunday within the Epiphany week (octave), or at another time (Epiphany Eve January 5, the nearest Sunday, etc.) as local custom dictates. Many in the West, such as adherents of the Anglican Communion, Lutheran Churches, and Methodist Churches, observe a twelve-day festival, starting on December 25, and ending on January 5, known as Christmastide or The Twelve Days of Christmas, which the Epiphany season follows.\n\nEastern Orthodox Churches\n\nEastern churches celebrate Epiphany (Theophany) on January 6. Some, as in Greece, employ the modern Revised Julian calendar, which until 2800 coincides with the Gregorian calendar, the one in use for civil purposes in most countries.

The Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices, which has received the imprimatur of John Michael D'Arcy, with reference to Epiphanytide, thus states that \"The Epiphany season extends from January 6 to Septuagesima Sunday, and has from one to six Sundays, according to the date of Easter White is the color for the octave; green is the liturgical color for the season.\" [50]\n\n\nEpiphany by Christian tradition\nEpiphany is celebrated by both the Eastern and Western Churches, but a major difference between them is precisely which events the feast commemorates For Western Christians, the feast primarily commemorates the coming of the Magi, with only a minor reference to the baptism of Jesus and the miracle at the Wedding at Cana Eastern churches celebrate the Baptism of Christ in the Jordan In both traditions, the essence of the feast is the same: the manifestation of Christ to the world (whether as an infant or in the Jordan), and the Mystery of the Incarnation The miracle at the Wedding at Cana is also celebrated during Epiphany as a first manifestation of Christ's public life [53]\n\n\nCatholic Church\nIn the Catholic Church, Epiphany is either observed on the traditional fixed date of January 6, or it is transferred to the Sunday between January 2 and January 8  Most dioceses in the United States observe the latter  In each system, the date of Epiphany affects the dates of other feasts: [54]\n\n\nProtestant churches\nLutheran, Anglican, Moravian, Methodist and United Protestant congregations, along with those of other denominations, may celebrate Epiphany on January 6, on the following Sunday within the Epiphany week (octave), or at another time (Epiphany Eve January 5, the nearest Sunday, etc.) as local custom dictates [58] [59]  Many in the West, such as adherents of the Anglican Communion, Lutheran Churches and Methodist Churches, observe a twelve-day festival, starting on December 25, and ending on January 5, known as Christmastide or The Twelve Days of Christmas, which the Epiphany season follows.\n\n\nEastern Orthodox churches\nEastern churches celebrate Epiphany (Theophany) on January 6 Some, as in Greece, employ the modern Revised Julian calendar, which until 2800 coincides with the Gregorian calendar, the one in use for civil purposes in most countries Other Eastern churches, as in Russia, hold to the older Julian calendar for reckoning church dates In these old-calendar churches Epiphany falls at present on Gregorian January 19 – which is January 6 in the Julian calendar.\n\n\nLiturgical practice in Eastern churches\nForefeast: The liturgical Forefeast of Theophany begins on January 2 [76] and concludes with the Paramony on January 5.\n\n\nOriental Orthodox\nIn the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the feast is known as Timkat and is celebrated on the day that the Gregorian calendar calls January 19, but on January 20 in years when Enkutatash in the Ethiopian calendar falls on Gregorian September 12 (i.e when the following February in the Gregorian calendar will have 29 days) The celebration of this feast features blessing of water and solemn processions with the sacred tabot A priest carries this to a body of water where it stays overnight, with the Metsehafe Qeddassie celebrated in the early morning Later in the morning, the water is blessed to the accompaniment of the reading of the four Gospel accounts of the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan and the people are sprinkled with or go into the water The tabot returns in procession to the church.\n\n\nMusic\nJohann Sebastian Bach composed in

Orthodox nations, water, baptismal rites and house blessings are typically central to these celebrations.\n\n\nArgentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay\nIn Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, as in other Latin American countries, the day is called \"Día de Reyes\" (The Day of Kings, a reference to the Biblical Magi), commemorating the arrival of the Magi to revere Jesus as son of God The night of January 5 into the morning of January 6 is known as \"Noche de Reyes\" (The Night of Kings) and children leave their shoes by the door, along with grass and water for the camels On the morning of January 6, they get up early and rush to see their shoes, where they are expecting to find gifts left by the \"Reyes\" who, according to tradition, bypass the houses of children who are awake On January 6, a \"Rosca de Reyes\" (a ring-shaped Epiphany cake) is eaten and all Christmas decorations are traditionally put away.\n\n\nBulgaria\nIn Bulgaria, Epiphany is celebrated on January 6 and is known as Bogoyavlenie (\"Manifestation of God\"), Кръщение Господне (Krashtenie Gospodne or \"Baptism of the Lord\") or Yordanovden (\"Day of Jordan\", referring to the river) On this day, a wooden cross is thrown by a priest into the sea, river or lake and young men race to retrieve it As the date is in early January and the waters are close to freezing, this is considered an honorable act and it is said that good health will be bestowed upon the home of the swimmer who is the first to reach the cross [86]\n\n\nBenelux\nSpeakers of Dutch and Flemish call this day Driekoningen (Three kings), while German speakers call it Dreikönigstag (Three Kings' Day) In Belgium, Luxembourg, the southern parts of the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany, children in groups of three (symbolizing the Biblical Magi) proceed in costume from house to house while singing songs typical for the occasion, and receiving a coin or some sweets at each door They may each carry a paper lantern symbolizing the star [89] In the Netherlands (provinces of Brabant and Limburg only), [90] these troupes gather for competitions and present their skits/songs for an audience As in Belgium, Koningentaart (Kings' tart), puff pastry with almond filling, is prepared with a black bean hidden inside Whoever finds the bean in his or her piece is king or queen for the day A more typically Dutch version is Koningenbrood, or Kings' bread In the north of the Netherlands, the traditions have died out, except for a very few places [91] Another Low Countries tradition on Epiphany is to open up doors and windows to let good luck in for the coming year.\n\n\nBrazil\nIn Brazil, the day is called \"Dia dos Reis\" (The Day of Kings) and in the rest of Latin America \"Día de Reyes\" commemorating the arrival of the Magi to confirm Jesus as son of God The night of January 5 into the morning of January 6 is known as \"Night of Kings\" (also called the Twelfth Night) and is feasted with music, sweets and regional dishes as the last night of Nativity, when Christmas decorations are traditionally put away [92]\n\n\nChile\nThis day is sometimes known as the Día de los Tres Reyes Magos (The day of the Three Royal Magi) or La Pascua de los Negros (Holy Day of the Black men) [93] in Chile, although the latter is rarely heard, because it was the day when slaves were allowed not to work.\n\n\nDominican Republic\nIn the Dominican Republic, the Día de los Tres Reyes Magos (The day of the Three Royal Magi) and in this day children receive gifts on the christmas tree in a similar fashion to Christmas day On this day public areas are very active with children accompanied by their parents trying out their new toys.\n\n\nEgypt\nThe feast of the Epiphany is celebrated by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which falls on 11 Tobe of the Coptic calendar, as the moment when in the baptism of Jesus the skies opened and God himself revealed to all as father of Jesus and all mankind It is then a moment of revelation of epiphany This celebration started to include all the processes of incarnation of Jesus, from his birth on Christmas until his baptism in the river Jordan For the Coptic Orthodox Church it is also a moment in which the path of Jesus to the Cross begins Therefore, in many celebrations there are certain similarities with the celebrations of Holy Friday during the time of Easter Since the Epiphany is one of the seven great feasts of the Coptic Orthodox Church, it is a day of strict fasting, and several religious celebrations are held on this day The day is related to the blessing of waters that are used all throughout the year in the church celebrations, and it is a privileged day to celebrate baptisms It is also a day in which many houses are blessed with water It may take several days for the local priest to bless all the houses of the parishioners that ask for it, and so the blessing of the houses may go into the after-feasts of the Epiphany celebrations However, it must be done before the beginning of Lent [94]\n\n\nEngland\nIn England, the celebration of the night before Epiphany, Epiphany Eve, is known as Twelfth Night (the first night of Christmas is December 25–26, and Twelfth Night is January 5–6), and was a traditional time for mumming and the wassail The Yule log was left burning until this day, and the charcoal left was kept until the next Christmas to kindle next year's Yule log, as well as to protect the house from fire and lightning [95] In the past, Epiphany was also a day for playing practical jokes, similar to April Fool's Day Today in England, Twelfth Night is still as popular a day for plays as when Shakespeare's Twelfth Night was first performed in 1601, and annual celebrations involving the Holly Man are held in London [96] A traditional dish for Epiphany was Twelfth Cake, a rich, dense, typically English fruitcake As in Europe, whoever found the baked-in bean was king for a day, but uniquely to English tradition other items were sometimes included in the cake Whoever found the clove was the villain; the twig, the fool; and the rag, the tart [clarification needed] Anything spicy or hot, like ginger snaps and spiced ale, was considered proper Twelfth Night fare, recalling the costly spices brought by the Wise Men Another English Epiphany sweetmeat was the traditional jam tart, made appropriate to the occasion by being fashioned in the form of a six-pointed star symbolising the Star of Bethlehem, and thus called Epiphany tart The discerning English cook sometimes tried to use thirteen different colored jams on the tart on this day for luck, creating a pastry resembling stained glass [97]\n\n\nEthiopia and Eritrea\nIn the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Church, the feast is known as Timkat and is celebrated on the day that the Gregorian calendar calls January 19, but on January 20 in years when New Year in the Ethiopian calendar falls on Gregorian September 12 (i.e when the following February in the Gregorian calendar will have 29 days) The celebration of this feast features blessing of water and solemn processions with the sacred Tabot [98]\n\n\nFinland\nIn Finland, Epiphany is called loppiainen, a name which goes back to the 1600s In the 1500s the Swedish-Finnish Lutheran church called Epiphany \"Day of the Holy Three Kings\", while before this, the older term Epiphania was used In the Karelian language Epiphany is called vieristä, meaning cross, from the Orthodox custom of submerging a cross three times to bless water on this day [99] Today, in the Lutheran church, Epiphany is a day dedicated to a focus on missionary work in addition to the Wise Men narrative Between 1973 and 1991 Epiphany was observed in Finland on a Saturday each year no earlier than January 6, and no later than January 12 After that time however, the traditional date of January 6 was restored and has since been observed once again as a national public holiday.\n\n\nFrancophone Europe\nIn France people share one of two types of king cake In the northern half of France and Belgium the cake is called a galette des Rois, and is a round, flat, and golden cake made with flake pastry and often filled with frangipane, fruit, or chocolate In the south, in Provence, and in the south-west, a crown-shaped cake or brioche filled with fruit called a gâteau des Rois is eaten In Romandie, both types can be found though the latter is more common Both types of cake contain a charm, usually a porcelain or plastic figurine, called a fève (broad bean in French) [100]\n\n\nGerman-speaking Europe\nJanuary 6 is a public holiday in Austria, three federal states of Germany, and three cantons of Switzerland, as well as in parts of Graubünden.\nIn the German-speaking lands, groups of young people called Sternsinger (star singers) travel from door to door They are dressed as the Biblical Magi, and their leader carries a star, usually of painted wood attached to a broom handle Often these groups are four girls, or two boys and two girls in order to sing in four-part harmony They sing traditional songs and newer ones such as \"Stern über Bethlehem\" They are not necessarily three wise men German Lutherans often note in a lighthearted fashion that the Bible never specifies that the Weisen (Magi) were men, or that there were three The star singers solicit donations for worthy causes, such as efforts to end hunger in Africa, organized jointly by the Catholic and Protestant churches, and they will also be offered treats at the homes they visit [102] The young people then perform the traditional house blessing, by marking the year over the doorway with chalk In Roman Catholic communities this may even today be a serious spiritual event with the priest present, but among Protestants it is more a tradition, and a part of the German notion of Gemütlichkeit Usually on the Sunday following Epiphany, these donations are brought into churches Here all of the children who have gone out as star singers, once again in their costumes, form a procession of sometimes dozens of wise men and stars The German Chancellor and Parliament also receive a visit from the star singers at Epiphany [103]\n\n\nGreece, Cyprus\nIn Greece, Cyprus and the Greek diaspora throughout the world, the feast is called the Theophany, [citation needed] or colloquially Phōta (Greek: Φώτα, \"Lights\") [106] It is the \"Great Celebration\" or Theotromi In some regions of Macedonia (West) it is the biggest festival of the year The Baptism of Christ symbolizes the rebirth of man, its importance is such that until the fourth century Christians celebrated New Year on this day Customs revolve around the Great Blessing of the Waters [107] It marks the end of the traditional ban on sailing, as the tumultuous winter seas are cleansed of the mischief-prone kalikántzaroi, the goblins that try to torment God-fearing Christians through the festive season During this ceremony, a cross is thrown into the water, and the men compete to retrieve it for good luck The Phota form the middle of another festive triduum, together with Epiphany Eve, when children sing the Epiphany carols, and the great feast of St John the Baptist (January 7 and eve), [citation needed] when the numerous Johns and Joans celebrate their name-day.\n\n\nGuadeloupe Islands\nCelebrations in Guadeloupe have a different feel from elsewhere in the world Epiphany here does not mean the last day of Christmas celebrations, but rather the first day of Kannaval (Carnival), which lasts until the evening before Ash Wednesday Carnival, in turn, ends with the grand brilé Vaval, the burning of Vaval, the king of the Kannaval, amidst the cries and wails of the crowd [108]\n\n\nHungary\nOn this day, the Christmas trees are taken down Nowadays, the traditions associated with the holiday are being followed in fewer and fewer villages Many traditions and superstition are associated with this day During house blessings (called koleda), it was common to write GMB on the wall (a monogram made out of the names of the 3 Kings) next to the year to protect them against witches hex or lightnings The preachers were given a bowl of corn, a bowl of peas, a pig's foot to eat and gifted them a bag of plums, nuts, flour, salo and sausages With the holywater they blessed their kids, house and animals and their dead (sprinkled on coffins) There were places where people attributed magical powers to simple brooks, like in Jászdózsa, where they cut a hole in the Tarna (today: Trnava) and people splashed each other with the icy water to be healthy Csillagének (Star singing) and Csillagozás were both common The children doing the Csillagének prepared costumes and mechanically-moved stars, and it wasn't only performed by boys This was accomponied by Háromkirályjárás where next to the singing they also performed the story of the Biblical Magi and the Story of Herod  As with most Hungarian holidays, there were also superstitions connected to Epiphany (Vízkereszt): for example, in Józseffalva, Bukovina, it was believed that if you braid that day the sausages will become longer next year  [109]\n\n\nIndia\nIn parts of southern India, Epiphany is called the Three Kings Festival and is celebrated in front of the local church like a fair This day marks the close of the Advent and Christmas season and people remove the cribs and nativity sets at home In Goa Epiphany may be locally known by its Portuguese name Festa dos Reis In the village of Reis Magos, in Goa, there is a fort called Reis Magos (Wise Men) or Três Reis Magos for Biblical Magi Celebrations include a widely attended procession, with boys arrayed as the Magi, leading to the Franciscan Chapel of the Magi near the Goan capital of Panjim [110] Other popular Epiphany processions are held in Chandor Here three young boys in regal robes and splendid crowns descend the nearby hill of Our Lady of Mercy on horseback towards the main church where a three-hour festival Mass is celebrated The route before them is decorated with streamers, palm leaves and balloons with the smallest children present lining the way, shouting greetings to the Kings The Kings are traditionally chosen, one each, from Chandor's three hamlets of Kott, Cavorim and Gurdolim, whose residents helped build the Chandor church in 1645.\n\n\nIreland\nThe Irish call the day the Feast of the Epiphany or traditionally Little Christmas or \"Women's Christmas\" (Irish: Nollaig na mBan) On Nollaig na mBan, women traditionally rested and celebrated for themselves after the cooking and work of the Christmas holidays The custom was for women to gather on this day for a special meal, but on the occasion of Epiphany accompanied by wine, to honor the Miracle at the Wedding at Cana [citation needed]\n\n\nItaly\nIn Italy, Epiphany is a national holiday and is associated with the figure of the Befana (the name being a corruption of the word Epifania), a broomstick-riding old woman who, on the night between January 5 and 6, brings gifts to children or a lump of \"coal\" (really black candy) for the times they have not been good during the year The legend told of her is that, having missed her opportunity to bring a gift to the child Jesus together with the Biblical Magi, she now brings gifts to other children on that night [118] [119] [29]\n\n\nJordan\nThousands of Jordanian Christians, tourists and pilgrims flock to Al-Maghtas site on the east bank of the Jordan River in January every year to mark Epiphany, where large masses and celebrations are held [120] \"Al-Maghtas\", meaning \"baptism\" or \"immersion\" in Arabic, is an archaeological World Heritage site in Jordan, officially known as \"Baptism Site \"Bethany Beyond the Jordan\" (Al-Maghtas)\" It is considered to be the original location of the Baptism of Jesus and the ministry of John the Baptist and has been venerated as such since at least the Byzantine period [12]\n\n\nLatvia\nEpiphany is known in Latvia as Trijkungu diena (Three Kings Day) by Catholics or Zvaigznes diena (Star Day) by Lutherans after the custom of star singing, and the Star of Bethlehem which led the Magi to the Christ Child [122] In the past bright stars of fabric were sewn onto the background of dark colored quilts, representing the night sky Epiphany was a day of enjoyment, spent in horse-drawn open sleighs, and these quilts would then be taken along to cover the laps of the merry riders [123] If Epiphany Day was bright and mild and the sun \"warmed the horses' backs\" it was said that the coming year would bring only peace If the night before Epiphany saw clear starry skies, it meant Latvia could expect a fine harvest in the coming Summer Weaving and wood-cutting were \"bad luck\", giving both men and women a proper holiday, and if a dog was heard barking on Epiphany one ought to look for his or her future spouse in that same direction Special three-corner apple cakes are eaten on this day, and as in other countries, star singing, visiting and house blessings have long been popular [124]\n\n\nLebanon\nEpiphany, celebrated on January 6, is the feast for the Roman Church that commemorates the visit of the Wise Men, the magi However, in the Maronite Church, in accordance with the ancient tradition, it represents the public announcement of Jesus' mission when he was baptized in the Jordan by John the Forerunner, also known as \"John the Baptist\" On the occasion, Lebanese Christians pray for their deceased [125]\n\n\nNorth Macedonia\nEpiphany in North Macedonia is known as Vodici (Водици) [126] On this day the priest throws a wooden cross into the water, to symbolize the baptism of Christ [citation needed] Men jump into the cold water to retrieve the cross, and whoever retrieves it is believed to be blessed during the whole year [citation needed] These are very festive gatherings with many spectacles attending the sites Special food jelly from pork and beef meat and bones called \"pacha\" (пача) or \"pivtii\" (пивтии) is prepared the day before, but served on the day after Epiphany, together with warm local brandy, rakija (ракија) [127] Epiphany is a non-working day for the Orthodox believers in North Macedonia [128]\n\n\nMalta\nIn Malta, Epiphany is commonly known as It-Tre Re (The Three Kings) Until the 1980s, January 6 was a public holiday, but today the Maltese celebrate Epiphany on the first Sunday of the year Children and students still take January 6 as a school holiday and Christmas decorations are lit up through this day on most public streets The Maltese also have a long-standing custom of presenting concerts in honor of Epiphany, including the prestigious annual Epiphany Concert organized by the Malta Council for Culture and Arts, performed by the National Orchestra In 2010, the Epiphany Concert which used to be held before a select audience, was opened to the general public following a decision by the President The Ministry of Education and Culture therefore moved from the venue from the Palace to the historic Sacra Infermeria, also known as the Mediterranean Conference Centre [129] Qagħaq tal-Għasel or tal-Qastanija (Maltese honey rings) are typically served at Epiphany in Malta.\n\n\nMexico\nThe evening of January 5 marks the Twelfth Night of Christmas and is when the figurines of the three Biblical Magi are added to the nativity scene Traditionally in Mexico, as with many other Latin American countries, Santa Claus does not hold the cachet that he does in the United States Rather, it is the Magi who are the bearers of gifts, who leave presents in or near the shoes of small children [130] Mexican families also commemorate the date by eating Rosca de reyes In modern Mexico however, and particularly in the larger cities and in the North, local traditions are now being observed and intertwined with the greater North American Santa Claus tradition, as well as with other holidays such as Halloween, due to Americanization via film and television, creating an economy of gifting tradition that spans from Christmas Day until January 6.\n\n\nPeru\nPeru shares Epiphany customs with Spain and the rest of Latin America Peruvian national lore holds that Francisco Pizarro was the first to call Lima \"Ciudad de los Reyes\" (City of the Kings) because the date of the Epiphany coincided with the day he and his two companions searched for, and found, an ideal location for a new capital Even more popular in Peru than gift giving is the custom of the Bajada de Reyes when parties are held in honor of the taking down of family and public nativity scenes, and carefully putting them away until the next Christmas [131]\n\n\nPhilippines\nIn the Philippines, Epiphany is known as \"Three Kings' Day\" and Pasko ng Matatanda (\"Feast of the Elderly\"), and marks the official close of the country's Christmas season As a day of feasting, some Filipinos celebrate with gift-giving and greet each other \"Happy Three Kings!\" [132]\n\n\nPoland\nIn Poland, Epiphany, or Trzech Króli (Three Kings) is celebrated in grand fashion, with huge parades held welcoming the Wise Men, often riding on camels or other animals from the zoo, in Warsaw, Poznań [133] and over 2,000 other cities The Wise Men pass out sweets, children process in renaissance wear, carols are sung, and living nativity scenes are enacted, all similar to celebrations in Italy or Spain, pointing to the country's Catholic heritage Children may also dress in colors signifying Europe, Asia, and Africa (the supposed homes of the Wise Men) and at the end of the parade route, church leaders often preach on the spiritual significance of the Epiphany In 2011, by an act of Parliament, Epiphany was restored as an official non-working national public holiday in Poland for the first time since it was canceled under communism fifty years earlier [134]\n\n\nPortugal\nIn Portugal, Epiphany, January 6, is called dia dos Reis (Day of the Kings), during which the traditional Bolo Rei (King cake) is baked and eaten Plays and pageants are popular on this day, and parents often hold parties for their children Epiphany is also a time when the traditional Portuguese dances known as Mouriscadas and Paulitos are performed The latter is an elaborate stick dance The dancers, who are usually men but may be dressed as women, manipulate sticks or staves (in imitation swords) in two opposing lines [138] It is a tradition too in Portugal for people to gather in small groups and to go from house to house to sing the Reis (meaning \"Kings\") which are traditional songs about the life of Jesus The singers also bring greetings to the owners of the house After singing for a while outside, they are invited in, and the owners of the house offer them sweets, liqueurs, and other Epiphany delicacies These Reis usually begin on Epiphany eve and last until January 20 [139]\n\n\nRomania and Moldova\nIn Romania and Moldova, Epiphany is called Boboteaza In south-eastern Romania, following religious services, men participate in winter horse races Before the race, the men line up with their horses before the priest, who will bless them by sprinkling them with green branches that have been dipped into Epiphany holy water Sometimes people desire to have this blessing for themselves as well Winning the Epiphany race is a great honor for both horse and rider, while the post-race celebrations, win or not, are highly festive As in other Eastern Orthodox heritage countries, water rites play a special role on this day [142] A unique piece of Romanian folk wisdom holds that if a girl slips on ice – or, better yet, falls into water – on Epiphany, she will surely marry before the year is out [143]\n\n\nRussia\nThe Epiphany, celebrated in Russia on January 19, marks the baptism of Jesus in the Eastern Orthodox Church As elsewhere in the Orthodox world, the Russian Church conducts the rite of the Great Blessing of the Waters, also known as \"the Great Sanctification of the Water\" on that day (or the eve before) [145] The priest-led procession could simply proceed to the font, [145] but traditionally the worshipers would go to a nearby lake or river.\n\n\nSlovenia\nIn Slovenia, especially in the Western part of the country, during the first day of the year and on Epiphany, children go from house to house because villagers will give them almonds, dried figs, nuts, cookies or other good things that they have at home [149]\n\n\nSpain\nIn Spain and some Latin American countries, Epiphany day is called El Día de Reyes [150] i.e., the day when a group of Kings or Magi, as related in the second chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, arrived to worship and bring three gifts to the baby Jesus after following a star in the heavens In Spanish tradition on January 6, three of the Kings: Melchior, Gaspar, and Balthazar, representing Arabia, the Orient, and Africa, arrived on horse, camel and elephant, bringing respectively gold, frankincense and myrrh to the baby Jesus Before going to bed on the eve of January 6, children polish their shoes and leave them ready for the Kings' presents to be put in them The next morning presents will appear under their shoes, or if the children are deemed to have misbehaved during the year, coal (usually a lump of hard sugar candy dyed black, called Carbón Dulce) [151] Most towns in Spain arrange colorful parades representing the arrival of the Reyes Magos to town so children can see them on their camels or carriages before they go to bed The oldest of these parades is held in Alcoy, Alicante (Valencian Community) which has hosted an annual parade since 1885 [152] Sweet wine, nibbles, fruit and milk are left for the Kings and their camels In Spain, children typically receive presents on this day, rather than on Christmas, though this tradition has changed lately, and children now receive presents on both days The Epiphany bread/cake is known as Roscón, [153] Tortell de Reis in Catalan, and in Mexico as Rosca de reyes [154]\n\n\nSweden\nEpiphany is a public holiday in Sweden, where it is known as trettondedag jul (\"Thirteenth Day Yule\"), as January 6 is the thirteenth day after Christmas Eve, the main day on which Christmas is celebrated in Sweden However, the end of the Christmas celebration is on January 13, St Knut's Day, more commonly known as \"Twentieth Day Yule\" (or \"Twentieth Day Knut\").\n\n\nUnited States\nIn Louisiana, Epiphany is the beginning of the Carnival season, during which it is customary to bake King Cakes, similar to the Rosca mentioned above It is round in shape, filled with cinnamon, glazed white, and coated in traditional carnival color sanding sugar The person who finds the doll (or bean) must provide the next king cake The interval between Epiphany and Mardi Gras is sometimes known as \"king cake season\", and many may be consumed during this period The Carnival season begins on King's Day (Epiphany), and there are many traditions associated with that day in Louisiana and along the Catholic coasts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida King cakes are first sold then, Carnival krewes begin having their balls on that date, and the first New Orleans krewe parades in street cars that night.\n\n\nWales\nOn January 6, the Feast of the Epiphany has long been an important celebration in Wales, known there as Ystwyll In Glamorganshire, a huge loaf or cake was prepared, which was then divided up into three parts to represent Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Biblical Magi A large company of neighbours was invited to be present at the dividing of the cake in which rings were concealed Whoever discovered a ring in his piece of cake (or bread) was elected as King or Queen and presided over the day's festivities January 6 was the old-calendar Christmas Day and many of the festivities connected with it lasted well over a century after the new calendar was introduced in 1752 [citation needed]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther

It was formed as the Alliance Premier League in 1979, drawing its clubs from the Northern Premier League and the Southern League.\n\n**History**\n\nThe league was created to provide a higher level of competition for clubs that were not part of the Football League, which at the time consisted of the top four tiers of English football. The first season of the Alliance Premier League began in 1979-80, with 22 clubs participating. The league has undergone several rebranding and reorganization efforts over the years, with the current name \"National League\" being adopted in 2015.\n\nIn the early years, the league faced financial struggles, which led to several clubs folding or dropping down to lower divisions. However, the league has since become more stable, with the introduction of new clubs and the promotion of existing ones.\n\n**Sponsorship**\n\nThe National League has had several sponsors throughout its history. The first major sponsor was Gola, a footwear manufacturer, which sponsored the league from 1984-85 to 1985-86. When Gola's sponsorship ended, carmaker Vauxhall Motors took over, sponsoring the league until the end of the 1997-98 season.\n\nSince then, the league has had various sponsors, including Setanta Sports, which signed a five-year deal with the Conference and the National League in 2006. However, Setanta Sports ceased broadcasting in the UK in 2009, and the league has since been without a major sponsor.\n\n**Media coverage**\n\nCoverage of the National League began in the mid-1990s, when cable channels Wire TV and later L!VE TV broadcast weekly highlights and live matches. However, the closure of L!VE TV in 1999 led to coverage switching to Sky Sports. In 2006, Setanta Sports signed a deal with the Conference and the National League, broadcasting live matches and highlights.\n\nWhen Setanta Sports ceased broadcasting in 2009, Sky Sports continued to show live matches and highlights. In 2010, the National League play-off final was broadcast live on Sky Sports, with Morecambe defeating Dagenham & Redbridge 2-1 in a thrilling match.\n\n**Current membership**\n\nThe following 24 clubs compete in the National League during the 2024-25 season:\n\n1.

He was born on 7 July 1988 in London, England, to a family of actors and television producers. Whitehall has established himself as a prominent figure in British comedy, known for his witty observations, clever writing, and charismatic stage presence.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJack Peter Benedict Whitehall was born at Portland Hospital in London's West End, the son of actress Hilary Amanda Jane Whitehall (née Isbister; stage name Hilary Gish) and television producer Michael John Whitehall. Whitehall has a younger sister and brother. His father, a staunch Conservative, has been a frequent presence in his son's television programmes. In fact, Whitehall has joked about how his father impersonated him via postal vote in the first election he was eligible to vote in, ensuring that he would vote for the Conservative Party.\n\nGrowing up in a family of actors and television producers, Whitehall was exposed to the entertainment industry from a young age. He began his career in the late 1990s, appearing in the children's television series Noah's Ark. This early start in television would lay the foundation for his future success in the industry.\n\n**Career**\n\nWhitehall's early television appearances were largely limited to children's programming. However, he quickly transitioned to more adult-oriented roles, presenting the first week of Big Brother's Big Mouth on E4 in June 2008. He returned to present the twelfth week of the programme in August of the same year. This exposure helped establish Whitehall as a rising talent in British comedy.\n\nIn September 2008, Whitehall made his first appearance on Channel 4's 8 Out of 10 Cats. This marked the beginning of a long-term association with the programme, which would become a staple of his career. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Whitehall would appear on a wide range of television programmes, including Fresh Meat, Live at the Apollo, and Taskmaster.\n\n**Television and Radio Career**\n\nWhitehall's television and radio career spans over two decades, with a focus on comedy and entertainment programming. He has presented numerous programmes, including Big Brother's Big Mouth, 8 Out of 10 Cats, and Live at the Apollo. He has also appeared on panel shows such as Have I Got News for You and Would I Lie to You.\n\nIn addition to his work on television, Whitehall has also had success in radio. He has presented several radio shows, including a weekly comedy programme on BBC Radio 4. This experience has helped him develop his skills as a writer and performer, honing his ability to think on his feet and respond to unexpected situations.\n\n**Stand-up Comedy**\n\nWhitehall's stand-up comedy career began at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where he performed at the Pleasance Theatre's Comedy Reserve showcase. He had previously taken a sketch show to the Fringe called Comic Abuse. Whitehall's early stand-up work was marked by his unique blend of wit, charm, and self-deprecation.\n\nIn 2007, Whitehall won the Amused Moose Laugh Off, a prestigious comedy competition. He was also runner-up in the Laughing Horse New Act of The Year competition and a finalist in So You Think You're Funny?. In 2008, he was nominated for 'Best Newcomer' in the Chortle Awards and was a finalist in the Hackney Empire New Act of the Year.\n\nWhitehall's stand-up shows are characterised by his quick wit, clever observations, and ability to connect with his audience. He has a natural gift for storytelling, which he uses to craft engaging and relatable routines. His performances are often described as warm, witty, and effortlessly charming.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 2011, Whitehall met actress Gemma Chan on the set of Fresh Meat. They began dating and were together for several years before separating in December 2017. Since 2020, Whitehall has been in a relationship with model Roxy Horner. The couple announced the birth of their first child, Elsie, in September 2023.\n\nWhitehall and Horner reside in Notting Hill, London. Despite the demands of his career, Whitehall has spoken about the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance. He has credited his partner with supporting him through the ups and downs of his career and helping him to stay grounded.\n\n**Stand-up Shows**\n\n* 2007: Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Pleasance Theatre's Comedy Reserve showcase\n* 2008: Amused Moose Laugh Off, Laughing Horse New Act of The Year, So You Think You're Funny?, Chortle Awards\n* 2010: Live at the Apollo, BBC Radio 4\n* 2012: Taskmaster, Have I Got News for You\n* 2015: Would I Lie to You, Fresh Meat\n* 2018: Live at the Apollo, Taskmaster\n* 2020: BBC Radio 4, Live at the Apollo\n\n**DVD Releases**\n\n* 2008: Live at the Apollo\n* 2010: Live at the Apollo\n* 2012: Live at the Apollo\n* 2015: Live at the Apollo\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* 2007: Comic Abuse\n* 2008: Big Brother's Big Mouth\n* 2010: Live at the Apollo\n* 2012: Taskmaster\n* 2015: Would I Lie to You\n* 2018: Live at the Apollo\n\n**Television**\n\n* 2008: Big Brother's Big Mouth\n* 2010: Live at the Apollo\n* 2012: Taskmaster\n* 2015: Would I Lie to You\n* 2018: Live at the Apollo\n\n**Film**\n\n* 2010: Live at the Apollo\n* 2012: Taskmaster\n* 2015: Would I Lie to You\n* 2018: Live at the Apollo\n\n**References**\n\nThis article uses no external references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jack_Whitehall\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nJack Peter Benedict Whitehall was born on 7 July 1988 at Portland Hospital in London's West End, [2] [3] the son of actress Hilary Amanda Jane Whitehall (née Isbister; stage name Hilary Gish) and television producer Michael John Whitehall Whitehall Senior has frequently featured in his son's television programmes Jack Whitehall has described his father, a staunch Conservative, as \"Tory with a capital T\", noting that in the first election he was eligible to vote in, his father impersonated him via postal vote to ensure he would vote for the Conservative Party [4] Whitehall also has a younger sister and brother [5] [6]\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1997 Whitehall (then aged nine) appeared in the series Noah's Ark In June 2008, he presented the first week of Big Brother's Big Mouth on E4, returning in August to present the twelfth week In September 2008, Whitehall made his first appearance on Channel 4's 8 Out of 10 Cats [17]\n\n\nTelevision and radio career\nIn 1997 Whitehall (then aged nine) appeared in the series Noah's Ark In June 2008, he presented the first week of Big Brother's Big Mouth on E4, returning in August to present the twelfth week In September 2008, Whitehall made his first appearance on Channel 4's 8 Out of 10 Cats [17]\n\n\nStand-up comedy\nWhitehall started performing stand-up comedy at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe at the Pleasance Theatre's Comedy Reserve showcase He had previously taken a sketch show to the Fringe called Comic Abuse Whitehall won the Amused Moose Laugh Off 2007, and was runner-up in the Laughing Horse New Act of The Year competition, a finalist in So You Think You're Funny?, [50] and winner of the Charlie Harthill Special Reserve in the same year He was also nominated for 'Best Newcomer' in the 2008 Chortle Awards, and was a finalist in the Hackney Empire New Act of the Year.\n\n\nPersonal life\nWhitehall met actress Gemma Chan in 2011, when she guest starred on his series Fresh Meat They dated until December 2017 [68] Since 2020 he has been in a relationship with model Roxy Horner, [69] [70] and in September 2023 they announced the birth of their first child Elsie They live in Notting Hill [71] [72]\n\n\nStand-up shows\n\n\nDVD releases\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born on November 6, 1861, in Almonte, Canada West, Province of Canada (now part of Mississippi Mills, Ontario, Canada), Naismith was the second child of two Scottish immigrants. His father, James Naismith Sr., left Europe at the age of 18 and settled in Lanark County.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nNaismith's early life was marked by hardship and loss. His father passed away when he was a young child, and his mother remarried. Naismith was then raised by his aunt and uncle, who instilled in him a love for physical activity and sports. He spent most of his days playing outdoor games, including catch, hide-and-seek, and duck on a rock, a medieval game in which a person guards a large drake stone from opposing players, who try to knock it down by throwing smaller stones at it.\n\nTo play duck on a rock most effectively, Naismith soon found that a soft lobbing shot was far more effective than a straight hard throw, a thought that later proved essential for the invention of basketball. Naismith attended grade school at Bennies Corners near Almonte and later enrolled in Almonte High School, from which he graduated in 1883.\n\n**Springfield College: Invention of Basketball**\n\nNaismith's interest in physical education led him to pursue a career as a physical education teacher. He attended McGill University in Montreal, where he played football and developed his skills as a physical educator. After completing his studies, Naismith went on to become a physical education teacher at the YMCA International Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nIt was at the YMCA that Naismith invented the game of basketball. In 1891, the school's physical education director, Dr. Luther Gulick, asked Naismith to create a new indoor game to keep students active during the winter months. Naismith was given 14 days to come up with a new game, and he was tasked with creating a game that could be played indoors, with minimal equipment.\n\nNaismith drew inspiration from existing sports, including soccer, football, and hockey, and created a game that combined elements of each. He created the first basketball game by hanging two peach baskets from opposite ends of the gym, and players were tasked with shooting a soccer ball into the baskets.\n\n**University of Kansas**\n\nIn 1898, Naismith became the first basketball coach of the University of Kansas. He was not initially hired to coach basketball, but rather as a chapel director and physical education instructor. During his time at Kansas, Naismith developed the rules of the game and created the first official basketball league.\n\nUnder Naismith's guidance, the University of Kansas men's basketball program became a powerhouse in the sport. The team played against nearby YMCA teams, as well as Haskell Indian Nations University and William Jewell College. Naismith's coaching record was 55-60, which is ironic, given that he is the only coach in the program's history to have a losing record.\n\n**Head-Coaching Record**\n\nNaismith's coaching career at the University of Kansas was marked by a single season. He compiled a record of 55-60 and is the only coach in Kansas history to have a losing record. However, Naismith's legacy extends far beyond his coaching record. He is considered one of the greatest coaches in the history of the sport, and his influence can be seen in the many coaches who followed in his footsteps.\n\n**Basketball Legacy**\n\nNaismith's invention of basketball has had a profound impact on the sport. He created the first official rules of the game, which have been modified and refined over the years. The game has become a global phenomenon, with millions of players and fans around the world.\n\nNaismith's legacy extends beyond the sport itself. He is a pioneer in the field of physical education, and his work has inspired generations of educators and coaches. He is a testament to the power of innovation and creativity, and his legacy continues to inspire people around the world.\n\n**Legacy and Honors**\n\nNaismith's contributions to the sport of basketball have been recognized with numerous honors and accolades. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) awards its best players and coaches annually with the Naismith Awards.\n\nThe FIBA Basketball World Cup trophy is named the \"James Naismith Trophy\" in his honor, and he has been inducted into the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame, the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame, the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame, the McGill University Sports Hall of Fame, the Kansas State Sports Hall of Fame, and the FIBA Hall of Fame.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nNaismith married Maude Sherwin in 1887, and the couple had four children together. He remained active in the sport of basketball throughout his life, serving as a consultant and advisor to the game. Naismith passed away on November 28, 1939, at the age of 78.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n* FIBA Basketball World Cup\n* NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship\n* Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame\n* Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame\n* Canadian Sports Hall of Fame\n* Ontario Sports Hall of Fame\n* Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame\n* McGill University Sports Hall of Fame\n* Kansas State Sports Hall of Fame\n* FIBA Hall of Fame\n\n**References**\n\n* Naismith, J.

The special follows a mockumentary format, where characters discuss and analyze the significant events of 2020, often blurring the lines between fact and satire. The overarching topic of the special is the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nThe special begins with a montage of news clips and footage from 2020, setting the stage for the events to be discussed. The characters, played by various comedians and actors, break down the major events of the year, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 United States presidential election, and the environmental activism of Greta Thunberg. The special also tackles more serious topics, such as the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent protests in the United States.\n\nOne of the key events discussed in the special is the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the world in 2020. The special delves into the early days of the pandemic, when countries were struggling to contain the spread of the virus. The characters discuss the measures taken by governments to combat the pandemic, including lockdowns, social distancing, and mask mandates. The special also touches on the economic impact of the pandemic, including the loss of jobs and the decline of businesses.\n\nThe 2020 United States presidential election is another major topic of discussion in the special. The characters analyze the election, discussing the candidates, their policies, and the impact of the election on the country. The special also delves into the aftermath of the election, including the transition of power and the response of the outgoing and incoming administrations.\n\nIn addition to the major events of the year, the special also touches on more lighthearted topics, such as the 2020 Oscars and the departure of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan from the British royal family. The special also features a segment on Greta Thunberg's environmental activism, where the characters discuss her speeches at the World Economic Forum and her efforts to raise awareness about climate change.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe cast of Death to 2020 includes a variety of comedians and actors, including Keegan-Michael Key, Diane Morgan, and Hugh Grant. The special features a mix of established stars and up-and-coming talent, adding to the humor and charm of the special.\n\nCharlie Brooker, the creator of Death to 2020, is a well-known British comedian and writer. Prior to producing Black Mirror, Brooker had done several end-of-year topical comedy specials for the BBC based on his Weekly Wipe series. He had also created a special Antiviral Wipe earlier in 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Brooker saw Death to 2020 as different to his previous topical comedy, as it is \"more character-based\" and he does not serve as presenter. He also described it as \"sillier\", summarizing it as \"part record of the year, part spoof documentary and part character comedy\".\n\n**Production**\n\nThe production of Death to 2020 began in 2020, shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic had reached the United Kingdom. The special was produced by Broke and Bones, with Charlie Brooker serving as the executive producer. The special was directed by Morgan and edited by various members of the production team.\n\nThe special was shot over several weeks, with the cast and crew working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The special features a mix of live-action footage and animated sequences, adding to the humor and visual appeal of the special.\n\n**Reception**\n\nDeath to 2020 received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its humor and charm, while others found it disappointing. The special was compared unfavorably to Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe and Black Mirror, with some critics feeling that it did not live up to the standards of those shows.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 40% of 20 critic reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.3/10. According to Metacritic, which calculated an average score of 41 out of 100 based on 11 critics, it received \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\n**Sequel**\n\nA sequel to Death to 2020, titled Death to 2021, aired on 27 December 2021, produced by Broke and Bones. The special features a new cast, including Lucy Liu, Stockard Channing, and William Jackson Harper, alongside returning cast members Keegan-Michael Key, Diane Morgan, and Hugh Grant.\n\nThe special was directed by Jack Clough and Josh Ruben, with Charlie Brooker serving as the executive producer. The special follows a similar format to the original, with the cast discussing and analyzing the significant events of 2021.\n\nAccording to Digital Spy, Brooker had a reduced role in the production of Death to 2021, not participating as executive producer due to work on other projects. Instead, the executive producers were Jones and Ben Caudell, a writer for Cunk on Britain, a programme starring Morgan's character Philomena Cunk.\n\nOverall, Death to 2020 is a unique and entertaining take on the events of 2020, blending humor and satire with factual information. The special features a talented cast and crew, and its sequel, Death to 2021, promises to be just as entertaining.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Death_to_2020\" following this outline:\n\n\nSynopsis\nIn mockumentary format, characters discuss events of 2020 with a mixture of true information and satire The overarching topic is the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the US and UK The 2020 United States presidential election is also heavily featured Events in the early part of the year include the latter part of the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season, Greta Thunberg's environmental speeches at the World Economic Forum, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan stepping down from the British royal family and the 2020 Oscars The May 2020 murder of George Floyd and subsequent US protests are summarised, with commentary on the Donald Trump photo op at St John's Church and protesters removing the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol, England.\n\n\nCast\nPrior to producing Black Mirror, Brooker had done several end-of-year topical comedy specials for the BBC based on his Weekly Wipe series up through 2016 He had created a special Antiviral Wipe earlier in 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic Brooker saw Death to 2020 as different to his previous topical comedy, as it is \"more character-based\" and he does not serve as presenter [3] He also described it as \"sillier\", summarising it as \"part record of the year, part spoof documentary and part character comedy\" [4]\n\n\nProduction\nPrior to producing Black Mirror, Brooker had done several end-of-year topical comedy specials for the BBC based on his Weekly Wipe series up through 2016 He had created a special Antiviral Wipe earlier in 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic Brooker saw Death to 2020 as different to his previous topical comedy, as it is \"more character-based\" and he does not serve as presenter [3] He also described it as \"sillier\", summarising it as \"part record of the year, part spoof documentary and part character comedy\" [4]\n\n\nReception\nCritics branded the mockumentary as \"disappointing\", and compared it unfavourably to Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe and Black Mirror [12] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 40% of 20 critic reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.3/10 [13] According to Metacritic, which calculated an average score of 41 out of 100 based on 11 critics, it received \"mixed or average reviews\" [14]\n\n\nSequel\nA programme in the same style, Death to 2021, aired on 27 December 2021, produced by Broke and Bones Alongside returning cast such as Grant, Ullman and Morgan, the mockumentary starred new members including Lucy Liu, Stockard Channing and William Jackson Harper [20] [21] According to Digital Spy, Brooker had a reduced role, not participating as executive producer due to work on other projects Instead, the executive producers were Jones and Ben Caudell—a writer for Cunk on Britain, a programme starring Morgan's character Philomena Cunk The special was directed by Jack Clough and Josh Ruben [22] [23]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Killing_of_Osama_bin_Laden", "content": "\nSearch for bin Laden\nAccounts of how bin Laden was located by U.S intelligence differ The White House and CIA director John Brennan stated that the process began with a fragment of information unearthed in 2002, resulting in years of investigation This account states that by September 2010, these leads followed a courier to the Abbottabad compound, where the U.S began intensive multiplatform surveillance \n\n\nIdentity of courier\nAccording to the earlier official version of his identification from a U.S official, identification of al-Qaeda couriers was an early priority for interrogators at CIA black sites and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, because bin Laden was believed to communicate through such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from al-Qaeda foot soldiers and top commanders [21] Bin Laden was known not to use phones after 1998, when the U.S had launched missile strikes against his bases in Afghanistan in August of that year by tracking an associate's satellite phone [22]\n\n\nBin Laden's compound\nThe CIA used surveillance photos and intelligence reports to determine the identities of the inhabitants of the Abbottabad compound to which the courier was traveling In September 2010, the CIA concluded that the compound was custom-built to hide someone of significance, very likely bin Laden [31] [32] Officials surmised that he was living there with his youngest wife and family [32]\n\n\nIntelligence gathering\nThe CIA led the effort to surveil and gather intelligence on the compound; other critical roles in the operation were played by other United States agencies, including the National Security Agency, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and U.S Defense Department [37] U.S officials told The Washington Post that the intelligence-gathering effort \"was so extensive and costly that the CIA went to Congress in December  [2010] to secure authority to reallocate tens of millions of dollars within assorted agency budgets to fund it.\" [6]\n\n\nOperation Neptune Spear\nAmerican victory\n\n\nObjective\nThe Associated Press reported at the time two U.S officials as stating the operation was \"a kill-or-capture mission, since the U.S doesn't kill unarmed people trying to surrender,\" but that \"it was clear from the beginning that whoever was behind those walls had no intention of surrendering.\" [47] White House counterterrorism advisor John O Brennan said after the raid: \"If we had the opportunity to take bin Laden alive, if he didn't present any threat, the individuals involved were able and prepared to do that.\" [48] CIA Director Leon Panetta said on PBS NewsHour: \"The authority here was to kill bin Laden. .. Obviously under the rules of engagement, if he in fact had thrown up his hands, surrendered and didn't appear to be representing any kind of threat, then they were to capture him But, they had full authority to kill him.\" [49] A U.S national security official, who was not named, told Reuters that \"This was a kill operation.\" [50] Another official said that when the SEALS were told \"We think we found Osama bin Laden, and your job is to kill him,\" they started to cheer [51] An article published in Political Science Quarterly in 2016 surveyed various published accounts and interpretations of the objective of the mission and concluded that \"the capture option was mainly there for appearance's sake and to fulfill requirements of international law and that everyone involved considered it for all practical purposes a mission to kill.\" [52]\n\n\nPlanning and final decision\nThe CIA briefed Vice Admiral William H McRaven, the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), about the compound in January 2011 The admiral was both a student and practitioner of special operations, having published a thesis on the subject during the 1990s His theory held that special operations had the potential to be very effective in achieving their goal if they were organized and commanded by special operations professionals rather than being subsumed into larger military units or operations He believed that such actions required that \"relative superiority\" be gained during the operation in question via characteristics such as simplicity, security, rehearsals, surprise, speed, and a clearly-but-narrowly defined purpose [53]\n\n\nExecution of the operation\nThe raid was carried out by approximately two dozen heliborne U.S Navy SEALs from DEVGRU's Red Squadron For legal reasons (namely that the U.S was not at war with Pakistan), the military personnel assigned to the mission were temporarily transferred to the control of the civilian Central Intelligence Agency [72] [73]\n\n\nApproach and entry\nThe raid was carried out by approximately two dozen heliborne U.S Navy SEALs from DEVGRU's Red Squadron For legal reasons (namely that the U.S was not at war with Pakistan), the military personnel assigned to the mission were temporarily transferred to the control of the civilian Central Intelligence Agency [72] [73]\n\n\nEntry into the house\nThe SEALs encountered the residents in the compound's guest house, in its main building on the first floor where two adult males lived, and on the second and third floors where bin Laden lived with his family The second and third floors were the last section of the compound to be cleared [90] There were reportedly \"small knots of children .. on every level, including the balcony of bin Laden's room.\" [77]\n\n\nKilling of bin Laden\nThe SEALs encountered bin Laden on the third floor of the main building [87] [101] Bin Laden was unarmed, \"wearing the local loose-fitting tunic and pants known as a kurta paijama,\" which were later found to have €500 and two phone numbers sewn into the fabric [57] [88] [94] [102]\n\n\nConclusion\nThe raid was intended to take 40 minutes The time between the team's entry in and exit from the compound was 38 minutes [51] According to the Associated Press, the assault was completed in the first 15 minutes [77]\n\n\nBurial of bin Laden\nAccording to U.S officials, bin Laden was buried at sea because no country would accept his remains [125] Before disposing of the body, the U.S called the Saudi Arabian government, who approved of burying the body in the ocean [54] Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death Preparations began at 10:10 a.m local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11 a.m The body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board The board was tilted upward on one side and the body slid off into the sea [126] [127]\n\n\nPakistan–U.S. communication\nAccording to Obama administration officials, U.S officials did not share information about the raid with the government of Pakistan until it was over [9] [129] Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen called Pakistan's army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani at about 3 am local time to inform him of the operation [130]\n\n\nIdentification of the body\nU.S forces used multiple methods to positively identify the body of Osama bin Laden:\n\n\nLocal accounts\nBeginning at 12:58 a.m local time (19:58 UTC), Abbottabad resident Sohaib Athar sent a series of tweets starting with \"Helicopter hovering above Abbottabad at 1AM (is a rare event).\" By 1:44 a.m all was quiet until a plane flew over the city at 3:39 a.m [143] Neighbors took to their roofs and watched as U.S special operations forces stormed the compound One neighbor said, \"I saw soldiers emerging from the helicopters and advancing towards the house Some of them instructed us in chaste Pashto to turn off the lights and stay inside.\" [144] Another man said he heard shooting and screams, then an explosion as a grounded helicopter was destroyed The blast broke his bedroom window and left charred debris over a nearby field [145] A local security officer said he entered the compound shortly after the Americans left, before it was sealed off by the army \"There were four dead bodies, three male and one female and one female was injured,\" he said \"There was a lot of blood on the floor and one could easily see the marks like a dead body had been dragged out of the compound.\" Numerous witnesses reported that power, and possibly cellphone service, [146] went out around the time of the raid and apparently included the military academy [147] [148] Accounts differed as to the exact time of the blackout One journalist concluded after interviewing several residents that it was a routine rolling blackout [149]\n\n\nCompound residents\nU.S officials said there were 22 people in the compound Five were killed, including Osama bin Laden [66] Pakistani officials gave conflicting reports suggesting between 12 and 17 survivors [152] The Sunday Times subsequently published excerpts from a pocket guide, presumably dropped by the SEALs during the raid, containing pictures and descriptions of likely compound residents [153] The guide listed several adult children of bin Laden and their families who were not ultimately found in the compound [citation needed] Because of a lack of accurate information, some of what follows cannot be verified as true [152]\n\n\nAftermath\nAround 9:45 p.m EDT, the White House announced that the president would be addressing the nation later in the evening [163] At 10:24:05 p.m EDT the first public leak was made by Navy Reserve intel officer Keith Urbahn and 47 seconds later by actor and professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson on Twitter [164] Anonymous government officials confirmed details to the media, and by 11 p.m numerous major news sources were reporting that bin Laden was dead; [163] [165] the number of leaks were characterized as \"voluminous\" by David E Sanger [166]\n\n\nLeaks of the news\nAround 9:45 p.m EDT, the White House announced that the president would be addressing the nation later in the evening [163] At 10:24:05 p.m EDT the first public leak was made by Navy Reserve intel officer Keith Urbahn and 47 seconds later by actor and professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson on Twitter [164] Anonymous government officials confirmed details to the media, and by 11 p.m numerous major news sources were reporting that bin Laden was dead; [163] [165] the number of leaks were characterized as \"voluminous\" by David E Sanger [166]\n\n\nU.S. presidential address\nAt 11:35 p.m., President Obama appeared on major television networks: [163]\n\n\nReactions\nBefore the official announcement, large crowds spontaneously gathered outside the White House, Ground Zero, The Pentagon, and in New York's Times Square to celebrate In Dearborn, Michigan, where there is a large Muslim and Arab population, a small crowd gathered outside the City Hall in celebration, many of them of Middle Eastern descent [167] From the beginning to the end of Obama's speech, 5,000 tweets per second were posted on Twitter [168] As news of bin Laden's death filtered through the crowd at a nationally televised Major League Baseball game in Philadelphia between rivals Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Mets, \"U-S-A!\" cheers began [169] [170] In Tampa, Florida, at the conclusion of a professional wrestling event which was occurring at the time, WWE Champion John Cena announced to the audience that bin Laden had been \"caught and compromised to a permanent end,\" prompting chants while he exited the arena to the march \"The Stars and Stripes Forever.\" [171]\n\n\nFreedom of Information Act requests and denials\nAlthough the Abbottabad raid has been described in great detail by U.S officials, no physical evidence constituting \"proof of death\" has been offered to the public, neither to journalists nor to independent third parties who have requested this information through the Freedom of Information Act [178] Numerous organizations filed FOIA requests seeking at least a partial release of photographs, videos, and/or DNA test results, including The Associated Press, Reuters, CBS News, Judicial Watch, Politico, Fox News, Citizens United, and NPR [179] On April 26, 2012, Judge James E Boasberg held that the Department of Defense was not required to release any evidence to the public [180]\n\n\nLegality\nFollowing the attacks of September 11, the U.S Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, which authorized the President to use \"necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons\" he determines were involved in the attacks [188] Congresswoman Barbara Lee has initiated several attempts to repeal the authorization [189] The Obama administration justified its use of force by relying on that resolution, as well as international law set forth in treaties and customary laws of war [190]\n\n\nUnder U.S. law\nFollowing the attacks of September 11, the U.S Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, which authorized the President to use \"necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons\" he determines were involved in the attacks [188] Congresswoman Barbara Lee has initiated several attempts to repeal the authorization [189] The Obama administration justified its use of force by relying on that resolution, as well as international law set forth in treaties and customary laws of war [190]\n\n\nUnder international law\nIn an address to the Pakistani parliament, Pakistan's Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani said, \"Our people are rightly incensed on the issue of violation of sovereignty as typified by the covert U.S air and ground assault on the Osama hideout in Abbottabad. .. The Security Council, while exhorting UN member states to join their efforts against terrorism, has repeatedly emphasized that this be done in accordance with international law, human rights and humanitarian law.\" [193] Former Pakistani President Gen Pervez Musharraf denied a report in The Guardian that his government made a secret agreement permitting U.S forces to conduct unilateral raids in search of the top three al-Qaeda leaders [194]\n\n\nHandling of the body\nUnder Islamic tradition, burial at sea is considered inappropriate when other, preferred forms of burial are available, and several prominent Islamic clerics criticized the decision [137] [201] [202] Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb, the head of Al-Azhar University, Egypt's seat of Sunni Muslim learning, said the disposal of the body at sea was an affront to religious and human values [203] Scholars like el-Tayeb hold that sea burials can be allowed only in special cases where the death occurred aboard a ship, and that the regular practice should have occurred in this case—the body buried in the ground with the head pointing to Islam's holy city of Mecca [204]\n\n\nBin Laden's will\nAfter bin Laden's death, it was reported he had left a will written a short time after the September 11 attacks [210] in which he urged his children not to join al-Qaeda and not to continue the Jihad [211]\n\n\nRelease of photographs\nCNN cited a senior U.S official as saying three sets of photographs of bin Laden's body exist: photos taken at an aircraft hangar in Afghanistan, described as the most recognizable and gruesome; photos taken from the burial at sea on USS Carl Vinson before a shroud was placed around his body; and photos from the raid itself, which include shots of the interior of the compound as well as three of the others who died in the raid [212]\n\n\nAlternative accounts\nA book published in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted elements of the account as given by U.S government sources \n\n\nSeal Target Geronimo\nA book published in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted elements of the account as given by U.S government sources \n\n\nNo Easy Day\nMatt Bissonnette, a SEAL who participated in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day (2012), which significantly contradicts Pfarrer's account Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter approach and landing matched the official version According to Bissonnette, when bin Laden peered out at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL who fired upon him hit him on the right side of the head Bin Laden stumbled into his bedroom, where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of blood and brain matter, with two women crying over his body The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot several rounds into bin Laden's chest until he was motionless According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room—an AK-47 rifle and a Makarov pistol—were unloaded [241]\n\n\nEsquire interview\nIn February 2013, Esquire conducted an interview with an anonymous individual called \"the shooter\" who said that bin Laden placed one of his wives between himself and the commandos, pushing her towards them \"Shooter\" then claimed bin Laden stood up and had a gun \"within reach\" and it was only then that he fired two shots into bin Laden's forehead, killing him [119] Another member of SEAL Team Six said the story as presented in Esquire was false and \"complete BS\" [245] Then, in November 2014, former SEAL Robert O'Neill disclosed his identity as the shooter in a series of interviews with The Washington Post [104] [105]\n\n\nHillhouse and Hersh reports\nIn 2011 American intelligence analyst Raelynn Hillhouse wrote that according to U.S intelligence sources, the U.S had been tipped-off to bin Laden's location by an unnamed Pakistani intelligence insider collecting the $25 million reward According to the sources, Pakistan purposely stood-down its armed forces to allow the U.S raid, and the original plan was to kill—not capture—bin Laden Hillhouse's sources stated that the Pakistanis had been keeping bin Laden under house arrest near their military headquarters in Abbottabad with money provided by the Saudis [246] According to The Telegraph, Hillhouse's account might explain why U.S forces encountered no resistance on their way to and in Abbottabad, and why some residents in Abbottabad were warned to stay in their houses the day before the raid [246] Hillhouse later also said bin Laden's body had been thrown out of a helicopter over the Hindu Kush Hillhouse's account was picked up and published internationally [247]\n\n\nIndian airspace controversy\nIn the publication No Easy Day, a map of the operation show the U.S SEALs briefly crossed into Indian territory before its loop approaching Abbottabad in Pakistan, raising questions in India whether the U.S violated Indian airspace, and if India had advance knowledge about the mission The Indian Air Force dismissed claims that the U.S crossed into Indian airspace [262] [263] [264]\n\n\nConspiracy theories\nThe reports of bin Laden's death on May 2, 2011, are not universally accepted [265] despite unreleased DNA testing confirming his identity, [34] [139] bin Laden's twelve-year-old daughter witnessing his death, [113] [266] and a May 6, 2011, al-Qaeda statement confirming his death [10] The swift burial of bin Laden's body at sea, the speed of the DNA results, and the decision not to release pictures of the dead body have led to the rise of conspiracy theories that bin Laden had not died in the raid [267] Some blogs suggested that the U.S government feigned the raid, and some forums hosted debates over the alleged hoax [268]\n\n\nRole of Pakistan\nPakistan came under intense international scrutiny after the raid The Pakistani government denied that it had sheltered bin Laden, and said it had shared information with the CIA and other intelligence agencies about the compound since 2009 [269]\n\n\nConnections with Abbottabad\nAbbottabad attracted refugees from fighting in the tribal areas and Swat Valley, as well as Afghanistan \"People don't really care now to ask who's there,\" said Gohar Ayub Khan, a former foreign minister and resident of the city \"That's one of the reasons why, possibly, he came in there.\" [274]\n\n\nAllegations against Pakistan\nNumerous allegations were made that the government of Pakistan had shielded bin Laden [132] [280] [281] Critics cited the proximity of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy, that the U.S chose to not notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks [281] [282] [283] Leaked diplomatic cables disclosed that American diplomats had been told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S forces approached Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), also helped smuggle al-Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight NATO troops According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the government of Tajikistan had also told U.S officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts [284]\n\n\nPakistani response\nAccording to a Pakistani intelligence official, raw phone-tap data had been transferred to the U.S without being analyzed by Pakistan While the U.S \"was concentrating on this\" information since September 2010, information regarding bin Laden and the compound's inhabitants had \"slipped from\" Pakistan's \"radar\" over the months Bin Laden left \"an invisible footprint\" and he had not been contacting other militant networks It was noted that much focus had been placed on a courier entering and leaving the compound The transfer of intelligence to the U.S was a regular occurrence according to the official, who also stated regarding the raid that \"I think they came in undetected and went out the same day,\" and Pakistan did not believe that U.S personnel were present in the area before the special operation occurred [287]\n\n\nCode name\nSeveral officials who were present in the Situation Room, including the president, [221] told reporters that the code name for bin Laden was \"Geronimo\" They had watched Leon Panetta, speaking from CIA headquarters, while he narrated the action in Abbottabad Panetta said, \"We have a visual on Geronimo,\" and later, \"Geronimo EKIA\"—enemy killed in action [57] The words of the commander on the ground were, \"For God and country, Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo.\" [300] Officials subsequently explained that each step of the mission was labelled alphabetically in an \"Execution Checklist,\" which is used to ensure all participants in a large operation are kept synchronized with a minimum of radio traffic \"Geronimo\" indicated the raiders had reached step \"G,\" the capture or killing of bin Laden [77] Osama bin Laden was identified as \"Jackpot,\" the general code name for the target of an operation [300] ABC News reported that otherwise his regular code name was \"Cakebread.\" [64] The New Yorker reported that bin Laden's code name was \"Crankshaft.\" [54]\n\n\nDerivation of intelligence\nAfter the death of bin Laden, some officials from the Bush administration, such as former Bush Office of Legal Counsel attorney John Yoo [304] [305] and former attorney general Michael Mukasey, [306] [307] wrote op-eds stating that the enhanced interrogation techniques they authorized (since legally clarified as torture) yielded the intelligence that later led to locating bin Laden's hideout [308] [309] Mukasey said that the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed caused him to reveal the nickname of bin Laden's courier [310]\n\n\nIntelligence postmortem\nEvidence seized from the compound is said to include ten cell phones, five to ten computers, twelve hard drives, at least 100 computer disks (including thumb drives and DVDs), handwritten notes, documents, weapons, and an assortment of personal items [317] [318] It was described by a senior Pentagon intelligence official as \"the single largest collection of senior terrorist materials ever.\" [319] On November 1, 2017, the CIA released to the public approximately 470,000 files and a copy of bin Laden's diary [320] [321]\n\n\nHelicopter stealth technology revelations\nThe tail section of the secret helicopter survived demolition and lay just outside the compound wall [336] Pakistani security forces put up a cloth barrier at first light to hide the wreckage [337] Later, a tractor hauled it away hidden under a tarp [338] Journalists obtained photographs that revealed the previously undisclosed stealth technology Aviation Week said the helicopter appeared to be a significantly modified MH-60 Black Hawk Serial numbers found at the scene were consistent with an MH-60 built in 2009 [339] Its performance during the operation confirmed that a stealth helicopter could evade detection in a militarily sensitive, densely populated area Photos showed that the Black Hawk's tail had stealth-configured shapes on the boom and the fairings, swept stabilizers and a \"hubcap\" over the noise-reducing five- or six-blade tail rotor It appeared to have a silver-loaded infrared suppression finish similar to some V-22 Ospreys [336] The crash of the Black Hawk may have been, at least in part, caused by the aerodynamic deficiencies introduced to the airframe by the stealth technology add-ons [340] (an unrelated possible cause of the crash was that the rehearsal mock-ups of the compound had used a chain-link fence rather than a solid wall for the perimeter and thus had not reproduced the airflows that the helicopter would face) [53]\n\n\nPrevious attempts to

Laden**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe killing of Osama bin Laden, the founder and leader of the terrorist organization al-Qaeda, occurred on May 2, 2011, during a raid by United States Navy SEALs on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was the culmination of years of intelligence gathering and planning by the CIA and other U.S. agencies. This article provides a detailed account of the events leading up to the raid, the operation itself, and its aftermath.\n\n**Search for bin Laden**\n\nThe search for bin Laden began in 2002, when the CIA started gathering intelligence on his whereabouts. The process was long and difficult, with multiple leads and false starts. By September 2010, the CIA had narrowed down the search to a compound in Abbottabad, a city in the eastern part of Pakistan. The compound was believed to be custom-built to hide someone of significance, and the CIA concluded that bin Laden was likely living there with his family.\n\n**Accounts of how bin Laden was located by U.S intelligence differ**\n\nThe White House and CIA director John Brennan stated that the process began with a fragment of information unearthed in 2002, resulting in years of investigation. This account states that by September 2010, these leads followed a courier to the Abbottabad compound, where the U.S began intensive multiplatform surveillance. The CIA used surveillance photos and intelligence reports to determine the identities of the inhabitants of the compound.\n\n**Identity of courier**\n\nThe CIA identified al-Qaeda couriers as an early priority for interrogators at CIA black sites and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Bin Laden was believed to communicate through such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from al-Qaeda foot soldiers and top commanders. Bin Laden was known not to use phones after 1998, when the U.S had launched missile strikes against his bases in Afghanistan.\n\n**Bin Laden's compound**\n\nThe CIA concluded that the compound was custom-built to hide someone of significance, very likely bin Laden. Officials surmised that he was living there with his youngest wife and family. The compound was heavily fortified, with high walls and strong gates. The CIA used surveillance photos and intelligence reports to determine the identities of the inhabitants of the compound.\n\n**Intelligence gathering**\n\nThe CIA led the effort to surveil and gather intelligence on the compound. Other critical roles in the operation were played by other United States agencies, including the National Security Agency, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), and U.S Defense Department. U.S officials told The Washington Post that the intelligence-gathering effort \"was so extensive and costly that the CIA went to Congress in December to secure authority to reallocate tens of millions of dollars within assorted agency budgets to fund it.\"\n\n**Operation Neptune Spear**\n\nAmerican victory\n\nThe operation was carried out by approximately two dozen heliborne U.S Navy SEALs from DEVGRU's Red Squadron. For legal reasons (namely that the U.S was not at war with Pakistan), the military personnel assigned to the mission were temporarily transferred to the control of the civilian Central Intelligence Agency.\n\n**Objective**\n\nThe Associated Press reported at the time that two U.S officials stated the operation was \"a kill-or-capture mission, since the U.S doesn't kill unarmed people trying to surrender.\" However, White House counterterrorism advisor John O Brennan said that \"if we had the opportunity to take bin Laden alive, if he didn't present any threat, the individuals involved were able and prepared to do that.\"\n\n**Planning and final decision**\n\nThe CIA briefed Vice Admiral William H McRaven, the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), about the compound in January 2011. The admiral was a student and practitioner of special operations, having published a thesis on the subject during the 1990s. His theory held that special operations had the potential to be very effective in achieving their goal if they were organized and commanded by special operations professionals rather than being subsumed into larger military units or operations.\n\n**Execution of the operation**\n\nThe raid was carried out by approximately two dozen heliborne U.S Navy SEALs from DEVGRU's Red Squadron. The SEALs encountered the residents in the compound's guest house, in its main building on the first floor where two adult males lived, and on the second and third floors where bin Laden lived with his family. The second and third floors were the last section of the compound to be cleared.\n\n**Killing of bin Laden**\n\nBin Laden was killed on the third floor of the main building. He was unarmed and wearing the local loose-fitting tunic and pants known as a kurta paijama. According to U.S officials, bin Laden was shot in the head by a SEAL who fired two shots into his forehead, killing him.\n\n**Burial of bin Laden**\n\nThe U.S called the Saudi Arabian government, who approved of burying the body in the ocean. Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. The body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. Bin Laden's body was then placed onto a flat board and slid off into the sea.\n\n**Pakistan–U.S. communication**\n\nThe U.S officials did not share information about the raid with the government of Pakistan until it was over. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen called Pakistan's army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani at about 3 am local time to inform him of the operation.\n\n**Identification of the body**\n\nThe U.S forces used multiple methods to positively identify the body of Osama bin Laden. These included DNA testing, eyewitness accounts, and visual identification.\n\n**Local accounts**\n\nBeginning at 12:58 am local time, Abbottabad resident Sohaib Athar sent a series of tweets starting with \"Helicopter hovering above Abbottabad at 1AM (is a rare event).\" By 1:44 am all was quiet until a plane flew over the city at 3:39 am. Neighbors took to their roofs and watched as U.S special operations forces stormed the compound. One neighbor said, \"I saw soldiers emerging from the helicopters and advancing towards the house. Some of them instructed us in chaste Pashto to turn off the lights and stay inside.\"\n\n**Compound residents**\n\nThe U.S officials said there were 22 people in the compound. Five were killed, including Osama bin Laden. Pakistan officials gave conflicting reports suggesting between 12 and 17 survivors.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nLarge crowds spontaneously gathered outside the White House, Ground Zero, The Pentagon, and in New York's Times Square to celebrate.

As news of bin Laden's death filtered through the crowd at a nationally televised Major League Baseball game in Philadelphia between rivals Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Mets, \"U-S-A!\" cheers began.\n\n**Freedom of Information Act requests and denials**\n\nAlthough the Abbottabad raid has been described in great detail by U.S officials, no physical evidence constituting \"proof of death\" has been offered to the public, neither to journalists nor to independent third parties who have requested this information through the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n**Legality**\n\nFollowing the attacks of September 11, the U.S Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, which authorized the President to use \"necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons\" he determines were involved in the attacks.\n\n**Under U.S. law**\n\nThe U.S Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, which authorized the President to use \"necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons\" he determines were involved in the attacks.\n\n**Under international law**\n\nThe Security Council, while exhorting UN member states to join their efforts against terrorism, has repeatedly emphasized that this be done in accordance with international law, human rights and humanitarian law.\n\n**Handling of the body**\n\nUnder Islamic tradition, burial at sea is considered inappropriate when other, preferred forms of burial are available.

Obviously under the rules of engagement, if he in fact had thrown up his hands, surrendered and didn't appear to be representing any kind of threat, then they were to capture him But, they had full authority to kill him.\" [49] A U.S national security official, who was not named, told Reuters that \"This was a kill operation.\" [50] Another official said that when the SEALS were told \"We think we found Osama bin Laden, and your job is to kill him,\" they started to cheer [51] An article published in Political Science Quarterly in 2016 surveyed various published accounts and interpretations of the objective of the mission and concluded that \"the capture option was mainly there for appearance's sake and to fulfill requirements of international law and that everyone involved considered it for all practical purposes a mission to kill.\" [52]\n\n\nPlanning and final decision\nThe CIA briefed Vice Admiral William H McRaven, the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), about the compound in January 2011 The admiral was both a student and practitioner of special operations, having published a thesis on the subject during the 1990s His theory held that special operations had the potential to be very effective in achieving their goal if they were organized and commanded by special operations professionals rather than being subsumed into larger military units or operations He believed that such actions required that \"relative superiority\" be gained during the operation in question via characteristics such as simplicity, security, rehearsals, surprise, speed, and a clearly-but-narrowly defined purpose [53]\n\n\nExecution of the operation\nThe raid was carried out by approximately two dozen heliborne U.S Navy SEALs from DEVGRU's Red Squadron For legal reasons (namely that the U.S was not at war with Pakistan), the military personnel assigned to the mission were temporarily transferred to the control of the civilian Central Intelligence Agency [72] [73]\n\n\nApproach and entry\nThe raid was carried out by approximately two dozen heliborne U.S Navy SEALs from DEVGRU's Red Squadron For legal reasons (namely that the U.S was not at war with Pakistan), the military personnel assigned to the mission were temporarily transferred to the control of the civilian Central Intelligence Agency [72] [73]\n\n\nEntry into the house\nThe SEALs encountered the residents in the compound's guest house, in its main building on the first floor where two adult males lived, and on the second and third floors where bin Laden lived with his family The second and third floors were the last section of the compound to be cleared [90] There were reportedly \"small knots of children .. on every level, including the balcony of bin Laden's room.\" [77]\n\n\nKilling of bin Laden\nThe SEALs encountered bin Laden on the third floor of the main building [87] [101] Bin Laden was unarmed, \"wearing the local loose-fitting tunic and pants known as a kurta paijama,\" which were later found to have €500 and two phone numbers sewn into the fabric [57] [88] [94] [102]\n\n\nConclusion\nThe raid was intended to take 40 minutes The time between the team's entry in and exit from the compound was 38 minutes [51] According to the Associated Press, the assault was completed in the first 15 minutes [77]\n\n\nBurial of bin Laden\nAccording to U.S officials, bin Laden was buried at sea because no country would accept his remains [125] Before disposing of the body, the U.S called the Saudi Arabian government, who approved of burying the body in the ocean [54] Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death Preparations began at 10:10 a.m local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11 a.m The body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board The board was tilted upward on one side and the body slid off into the sea [126] [127]\n\n\nPakistan–U.S. communication\nAccording to Obama administration officials, U.S officials did not share information about the raid with the government of Pakistan until it was over [9] [129] Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen called Pakistan's army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani at about 3 am local time to inform him of the operation [130]\n\n\nIdentification of the body\nU.S forces used multiple methods to positively identify the body of Osama bin Laden:\n\n\nLocal accounts\nBeginning at 12:58 a.m local time (19:58 UTC), Abbottabad resident Sohaib Athar sent a series of tweets starting with \"Helicopter hovering above Abbottabad at 1AM (is a rare event).\" By 1:44 a.m all was quiet until a plane flew over the city at 3:39 a.m [143] Neighbors took to their roofs and watched as U.S special operations forces stormed the compound One neighbor said, \"I saw soldiers emerging from the helicopters and advancing towards the house Some of them instructed us in chaste Pashto to turn off the lights and stay inside.\" [144] Another man said he heard shooting and screams, then an explosion as a grounded helicopter was destroyed The blast broke his bedroom window and left charred debris over a nearby field [145] A local security officer said he entered the compound shortly after the Americans left, before it was sealed off by the army \"There were four dead bodies, three male and one female and one female was injured,\" he said \"There was a lot of blood on the floor and one could easily see the marks like a dead body had been dragged out of the compound.\" Numerous witnesses reported that power, and possibly cellphone service, [146] went out around the time of the raid and apparently included the military academy [147] [148] Accounts differed as to the exact time of the blackout One journalist concluded after interviewing several residents that it was a routine rolling blackout [149]\n\n\nCompound residents\nU.S officials said there were 22 people in the compound Five were killed, including Osama bin Laden [66] Pakistani officials gave conflicting reports suggesting between 12 and 17 survivors [152] The Sunday Times subsequently published excerpts from a pocket guide, presumably dropped by the SEALs during the raid, containing pictures and descriptions of likely compound residents [153] The guide listed several adult children of bin Laden and their families who were not ultimately found in the compound [citation needed] Because of a lack of accurate information, some of what follows cannot be verified as true [152]\n\n\nAftermath\nAround 9:45 p.m EDT, the White House announced that the president would be addressing the nation later in the evening [163] At 10:24:05 p.m EDT the first public leak was made by Navy Reserve intel officer Keith Urbahn and 47 seconds later by actor and professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson on Twitter [164] Anonymous government officials confirmed details to the media, and by 11 p.m numerous major news sources were reporting that bin Laden was dead; [163] [165] the number of leaks were characterized as \"voluminous\" by David E Sanger [166]\n\n\nLeaks of the news\nAround 9:45 p.m EDT, the White House announced that the president would be addressing the nation later in the evening [163] At 10:24:05 p.m EDT the first public leak was made by Navy Reserve intel officer Keith Urbahn and 47 seconds later by actor and professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson on Twitter [164] Anonymous government officials confirmed details to the media, and by 11 p.m numerous major news sources were reporting that bin Laden was dead; [163] [165] the number of leaks were characterized as \"voluminous\" by David E Sanger [166]\n\n\nU.S. presidential address\nAt 11:35 p.m., President Obama appeared on major television networks: [163]\n\n\nReactions\nBefore the official announcement, large crowds spontaneously gathered outside the White House, Ground Zero, The Pentagon, and in New York's Times Square to celebrate In Dearborn, Michigan, where there is a large Muslim and Arab population, a small crowd gathered outside the City Hall in celebration, many of them of Middle Eastern descent [167] From the beginning to the end of Obama's speech, 5,000 tweets per second were posted on Twitter [168] As news of bin Laden's death filtered through the crowd at a nationally televised Major League Baseball game in Philadelphia between rivals Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Mets, \"U-S-A!\" cheers began [169] [170] In Tampa, Florida, at the conclusion of a professional wrestling event which was occurring at the time, WWE Champion John Cena announced to the audience that bin Laden had been \"caught and compromised to a permanent end,\" prompting chants while he exited the arena to the march \"The Stars and Stripes Forever.\" [171]\n\n\nFreedom of Information Act requests and denials\nAlthough the Abbottabad raid has been described in great detail by U.S officials, no physical evidence constituting \"proof of death\" has been offered to the public, neither to journalists nor to independent third parties who have requested this information through the Freedom of Information Act [178] Numerous organizations filed FOIA requests seeking at least a partial release of photographs, videos, and/or DNA test results, including The Associated Press, Reuters, CBS News, Judicial Watch, Politico, Fox News, Citizens United, and NPR [179] On April 26, 2012, Judge James E Boasberg held that the Department of Defense was not required to release any evidence to the public [180]\n\n\nLegality\nFollowing the attacks of September 11, the U.S Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, which authorized the President to use \"necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons\" he determines were involved in the attacks [188] Congresswoman Barbara Lee has initiated several attempts to repeal the authorization [189] The Obama administration justified its use of force by relying on that resolution, as well as international law set forth in treaties and customary laws of war [190]\n\n\nUnder U.S. law\nFollowing the attacks of September 11, the U.S Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, which authorized the President to use \"necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons\" he determines were involved in the attacks [188] Congresswoman Barbara Lee has initiated several attempts to repeal the authorization [189] The Obama administration justified its use of force by relying on that resolution, as well as international law set forth in treaties and customary laws of war [190]\n\n\nUnder international law\nIn an address to the Pakistani parliament, Pakistan's Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani said, \"Our people are rightly incensed on the issue of violation of sovereignty as typified by the covert U.S air and ground assault on the Osama hideout in Abbottabad. .. The Security Council, while exhorting UN member states to join their efforts against terrorism, has repeatedly emphasized that this be done in accordance with international law, human rights and humanitarian law.\" [193] Former Pakistani President Gen Pervez Musharraf denied a report in The Guardian that his government made a secret agreement permitting U.S forces to conduct unilateral raids in search of the top three al-Qaeda leaders [194]\n\n\nHandling of the body\nUnder Islamic tradition, burial at sea is considered inappropriate when other, preferred forms of burial are available, and several prominent Islamic clerics criticized the decision [137] [201] [202] Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb, the head of Al-Azhar University, Egypt's seat of Sunni Muslim learning, said the disposal of the body at sea was an affront to religious and human values [203] Scholars like el-Tayeb hold that sea burials can be allowed only in special cases where the death occurred aboard a ship, and that the regular practice should have occurred in this case—the body buried in the ground with the head pointing to Islam's holy city of Mecca [204]\n\n\nBin Laden's will\nAfter bin Laden's death, it was reported he had left a will written a short time after the September 11 attacks [210] in which he urged his children not to join al-Qaeda and not to continue the Jihad [211]\n\n\nRelease of photographs\nCNN cited a senior U.S official as saying three sets of photographs of bin Laden's body exist: photos taken at an aircraft hangar in Afghanistan, described as the most recognizable and gruesome; photos taken from the burial at sea on USS Carl Vinson before a shroud was placed around his body; and photos from the raid itself, which include shots of the interior of the compound as well as three of the others who died in the raid [212]\n\n\nAlternative accounts\nA book published in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted elements of the account as given by U.S government sources \n\n\nSeal Target Geronimo\nA book published in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted elements of the account as given by U.S government sources \n\n\nNo Easy Day\nMatt Bissonnette, a SEAL who participated in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day (2012), which significantly contradicts Pfarrer's account Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter approach and landing matched the official version According to Bissonnette, when bin Laden peered out at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL who fired upon him hit him on the right side of the head Bin Laden stumbled into his bedroom, where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of blood and brain matter, with two women crying over his body The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot several rounds into bin Laden's chest until he was motionless According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room—an AK-47 rifle and a Makarov pistol—were unloaded [241]\n\n\nEsquire interview\nIn February 2013, Esquire conducted an interview with an anonymous individual called \"the shooter\" who said that bin Laden placed one of his wives between himself and the commandos, pushing her towards them \"Shooter\" then claimed bin Laden stood up and had a gun \"within reach\" and it was only then that he fired two shots into bin Laden's forehead, killing him [119] Another member of SEAL Team Six said the story as presented in Esquire was false and \"complete BS\" [245] Then, in November 2014, former SEAL Robert O'Neill disclosed his identity as the shooter in a series of interviews with The Washington Post [104] [105]\n\n\nHillhouse and Hersh reports\nIn 2011 American intelligence analyst Raelynn Hillhouse wrote that according to U.S intelligence sources, the U.S had been tipped-off to bin Laden's location by an unnamed Pakistani intelligence insider collecting the $25 million reward According to the sources, Pakistan purposely stood-down its armed forces to allow the U.S raid, and the original plan was to kill—not capture—bin Laden Hillhouse's sources stated that the Pakistanis had been keeping bin Laden under house arrest near their military headquarters in Abbottabad with money provided by the Saudis [246] According to The Telegraph, Hillhouse's account might explain why U.S forces encountered no resistance on their way to and in Abbottabad, and why some residents in Abbottabad were warned to stay in their houses the day before the raid [246] Hillhouse later also said bin Laden's body had been thrown out of a helicopter over the Hindu Kush Hillhouse's account was picked up and published internationally [247]\n\n\nIndian airspace controversy\nIn the publication No Easy Day, a map of the operation show the U.S SEALs briefly crossed into Indian territory before its loop approaching Abbottabad in Pakistan, raising questions in India whether the U.S violated Indian airspace, and if India had advance knowledge about the mission The Indian Air Force dismissed claims that the U.S crossed into Indian airspace [262] [263] [264]\n\n\nConspiracy theories\nThe reports of bin Laden's death on May 2, 2011, are not universally accepted [265] despite unreleased DNA testing confirming his identity, [34] [139] bin Laden's twelve-year-old daughter witnessing his death, [113] [266] and a May 6, 2011, al-Qaeda statement confirming his death [10] The swift burial of bin Laden's body at sea, the speed of the DNA results, and the decision not to release pictures of the dead body have led to the rise of conspiracy theories that bin Laden had not died in the raid [267] Some blogs suggested that the U.S government feigned the raid, and some forums hosted debates over the alleged hoax [268]\n\n\nRole of Pakistan\nPakistan came under intense international scrutiny after the raid The Pakistani government denied that it had sheltered bin Laden, and said it had shared information with the CIA and other intelligence agencies about the compound since 2009 [269]\n\n\nConnections with Abbottabad\nAbbottabad attracted refugees from fighting in the tribal areas and Swat Valley, as well as Afghanistan \"People don't really care now to ask who's there,\" said Gohar Ayub Khan, a former foreign minister and resident of the city \"That's one of the reasons why, possibly, he came in there.\" [274]\n\n\nAllegations against Pakistan\nNumerous allegations were made that the government of Pakistan had shielded bin Laden [132] [280] [281] Critics cited the proximity of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy, that the U.S chose to not notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks [281] [282] [283] Leaked diplomatic cables disclosed that American diplomats had been told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S forces approached Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), also helped smuggle al-Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight NATO troops According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the government of Tajikistan had also told U.S officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts [284]\n\n\nPakistani response\nAccording to a Pakistani intelligence official, raw phone-tap data had been transferred to the U.S without being analyzed by Pakistan While the U.S \"was concentrating on this\" information since September 2010, information regarding bin Laden and the compound's inhabitants had \"slipped from\" Pakistan's \"radar\" over the months Bin Laden left \"an invisible footprint\" and he had not been contacting other militant networks It was noted that much focus had been placed on a courier entering and leaving the compound The transfer of intelligence to the U.S was a regular occurrence according to the official, who also stated regarding the raid that \"I think they came in undetected and went out the same day,\" and Pakistan did not believe that U.S personnel were present in the area before the special operation occurred [287]\n\n\nCode name\nSeveral officials who were present in the Situation Room, including the president, [221] told reporters that the code name for bin Laden was \"Geronimo\" They had watched Leon Panetta, speaking from CIA headquarters, while he narrated the action in Abbottabad Panetta said, \"We have a visual on Geronimo,\" and later, \"Geronimo EKIA\"—enemy killed in action [57] The words of the commander on the ground were, \"For God and country, Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo.\" [300] Officials subsequently explained that each step of the mission was labelled alphabetically in an \"Execution Checklist,\" which is used to ensure all participants in a large operation are kept synchronized with a minimum of radio traffic \"Geronimo\" indicated the raiders had reached step \"G,\" the capture or killing of bin Laden [77] Osama bin Laden was identified as \"Jackpot,\" the general code name for the target of an operation [300] ABC News reported that otherwise his regular code name was \"Cakebread.\" [64] The New Yorker reported that bin Laden's code name was \"Crankshaft.\" [54]\n\n\nDerivation of intelligence\nAfter the death of bin Laden, some officials from the Bush administration, such as former Bush Office of Legal Counsel attorney John Yoo [304] [305] and former attorney general Michael Mukasey, [306] [307] wrote op-eds stating that the enhanced interrogation techniques they authorized (since legally clarified as torture) yielded the intelligence that later led to locating bin Laden's hideout [308] [309] Mukasey said that the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed caused him to reveal the nickname of bin Laden's courier [310]\n\n\nIntelligence postmortem\nEvidence seized from the compound is said to include ten cell phones, five to ten computers, twelve hard drives, at least 100 computer disks (including thumb drives and DVDs), handwritten notes, documents, weapons, and an assortment of personal items [317] [318] It was described by a senior Pentagon intelligence official as \"the single largest collection of senior terrorist materials ever.\" [319] On November 1, 2017, the CIA released to the public approximately 470,000 files and a copy of bin Laden's diary [320] [321]\n\n\nHelicopter stealth technology revelations\nThe tail section of the secret helicopter survived demolition and lay just outside the compound wall [336] Pakistani security forces put up a cloth barrier at first light to hide the wreckage [337] Later, a tractor hauled it away hidden under a tarp [338] Journalists obtained photographs that revealed the previously undisclosed stealth technology Aviation Week said the helicopter appeared to be a significantly modified MH-60 Black Hawk Serial numbers found at the scene were consistent with an MH-60 built in 2009 [339] Its performance during the operation confirmed that a stealth helicopter could evade detection in a militarily sensitive, densely populated area Photos showed that the Black Hawk's tail had stealth-configured shapes on the boom and the fairings, swept stabilizers and a \"hubcap\" over the noise-reducing five- or six-blade tail rotor It appeared to have a silver-loaded infrared suppression finish similar to some V-22 Ospreys [336] The crash of the Black Hawk may have been, at least in part, caused by the aerodynamic deficiencies introduced to the airframe by the stealth technology add-ons [340] (an unrelated possible cause of the crash was that the rehearsal mock-ups of the compound had used a chain-link fence rather than a solid wall for the perimeter and thus had not reproduced the airflows that the helicopter would face) [53]\n\n\nPrevious attempts to

big fight with the other chump, I think we all know who we're talking about But listen they called, I answered, I said send the contract, they sent it and I said yes.\" Wilder replied by saying, \"There's one thing Tyson Fury has never had and that's the WBC belt, and if he ever thinks about having it he better wake up and apologise to me because he ain't never having it.\" The pair posed for

anticipated match between Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury has been a topic of discussion for several years. The two heavyweights finally faced each other in a highly publicized bout, which took place on December 1, 2018. The fight was a 12-round split decision draw, with Wilder retaining his WBC title. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the background, build-up, weigh-in, fight details, aftermath, and rematches between the two fighters.\n\nBackground\nThe potential matchup between Wilder and Fury had been talked about and promoted for several years prior to the fight, including by the two fighters themselves on social media. The pair's first encounter had taken place off-camera at the Motorpoint Arena in Sheffield in April 2014, where Wilder knocked out Audley Harrison on the undercard of Amir Khan vs Julio Diaz, with both Wilder and Fury promising each other a fight in the future. Wilder became the first American heavyweight world champion in nearly a decade in January 2015, after defeating Bermane Stiverne via unanimous decision in Las Vegas to pick up the WBC title, the only world heavyweight title at the time that was not held by the reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko. Fury then became champion in his first world title attempt by defeating Klitschko for the WBA, IBF, WBO, IBO, The Ring and lineal titles in Düsseldorf, Germany later that year in November 2015, ending Klitschko's decade-long reign with a unanimous decision victory.\n\nBuild-up\nBy August 2018, both Wilder and Fury had agreed to a fight and, with Fury scheduled for the second fight of his comeback against former world title challenger Francesco Pianeta on 18 August on the undercard of Carl Frampton vs Luke Jackson at Windsor Park in Belfast, Wilder was ringside to begin the promotion of the fight with Fury. After a comfortable points victory over Pianeta, there was a second in-ring confrontation between the two with Wilder saying, \"We're ready now, this fight will happen, it's on baby, this is what we've been waiting for right here, the best fighting the best!\" While Fury said, \"we are two men who will fight anybody, this man has been trying to make a big fight with the other chump, I think we all know who we're talking about But listen they called, I answered, I said send the contract, they sent it and I said yes.\" Wilder replied by saying, \"There's one thing Tyson Fury has never had and that's the WBC belt, and if he ever thinks about having it he better wake up and apologise to me because he ain't never having it.\" The pair posed for photographs and then had a face-off, with Fury's promoter Frank Warren stating that the fight was on, with only an announcement on a date and venue in the U.S to be finalized.\n\nWeigh-in\nThe weigh-in took place on November 30, on a made platform outside the Los Angeles Convention Center. Fury stepped on the scale first and weighed in at 256½ pounds, his lightest since his comeback following his layoff. The weight was only 2 pounds less than he weighed in August 2018 against Francisco Pianeta, but he looked leaner. Wilder was next to step on and came in at 212½ pounds, his lowest since his debut in 2008 when he weighed 207¼ pounds. For his last bout, Wilder weighed 214 pounds, however it was cited that Wilder suffered from an illness during his training camp.\n\nFight details\nIn front of a crowd of 17,698 at the Staples Center, Wilder and Fury fought a 12-round split decision draw, meaning Wilder retained his WBC title. Mexican judge Alejandro Rochin scored the fight 115–111 for Wilder, Canadian judge Robert Tapper had it 114–112 for Fury, and British judge Phil Edwards scored it a 113–113 draw. Both Wilder and Fury stood in the ring after the fight and gave interviews to Jim Gray. Wilder felt he had done enough to win the fight, stating, \"I think with the two knockdowns, I definitely won the fight. We poured our hearts out tonight. We're both warriors, but with those two drops, I think I won the fight. I came out slow, I rushed my punches, I didn't sit still. I was too hesitant, I started overthrowing the right hand, and I just couldn't adjust. I was rushing my punches. That's something I usually don't do. I couldn't let it go tonight. I was forcing my punches too much instead of sitting back, being patient and waiting it. I really wanted to get him out of there, give the fans what they want to see.\"\n\nAftermath\nWilder and Fury stood in the ring after the fight and gave interviews to Jim Gray.

{"title": "2024_Summer_Olympics_opening_ceremony", "content": "\nPreparations\nLogistics preparations were expected to be finalized by the end of 2023, with certain rehearsals occurring in some secret venues without public presence before the event In some specific situations, they were carried out on-site, and were considered \"teasers\" by Thierry Reboul, executive director for the Games The first camera test shots were done in September 2023 and coverage of the event was expected to be provided by 130 cameras placed in strategic positions [3] The event was broadcast live to 80 giant screens along the route of the Seine [4] Directed and created by theatre and television actor and director Thomas Jolly, it was the first opening ceremony held outside of an Olympic stadium since the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics held in Buenos Aires [4] [5] The choreography was created by Maud Le Pladec  [fr] [6]\n\n\nSafety measures\nIn October 2023, following security concerns caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Gaza–Israel war and the Arras school stabbing, both the French government and the Paris Organising Committee for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games (COJOP2024) stated there were no official plans to relocate, stating that \"Plan A takes into account all of the threats\" Oudéa-Castréa stated on BFM TV that they were paying attention to context and the government had been working on \"adjustment variables\", wishing to maintain the original format [7] In December 2023, President Macron stated that there were multiple scenarios for the ceremony, in case of a major security event which would force it to move from the Seine On this, COJOP2024 stated they had \"contingency plans for all identified risk scenarios: heatwaves, cyberattacks, and the ceremony is no exception\" [8] In April 2024 President Macron announced that in case of a terrorism threat, there was a plan B, and even plan C; in that case the Opening Ceremony would be moved to the Trocadero or to the Stade de France stadium [30] Nevertheless, Christophe Dubi, the IOC Games executive director, stated the previous in March that a change to the Stade de France would be unlikely due to the event being \"too big, too sophisticated, too complex artistically to look at a Plan B in another location\" [17]\n\n\nProtocolar elements and torch relay\nThe Parade of Nations, during which the expected number of 10,500 participating athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees participate categorized by their respective delegation, [4] took place on the Seine, with other ceremonial events being held at the Jardins du Trocadéro [1] [38]\n\n\nProceedings\n\nEntry to the venues opened at 17:30 CEST with the ceremony starting two hours later at 19:30 CEST [33] For the first time in Olympic history, the athletes were paraded on boats such as tourist boats, ferries and yachts, and also for the first time, the parade was integrated into the artistic programme, as the Seine was the main venue for the event Most of the ceremony took place under the rain, rather than on a traditional sunset on the Seine, this was the first Summer Olympics opening ceremony to be held in such a manner since the 2016 Summer Olympics which started with a small drizzle [43]\n\nProgramme\n\nEntry to the venues opened at 17:30 CEST with the ceremony starting two hours later at 19:30

ceremony to be held in such a manner since the 2016 Summer Olympics which started with a small drizzle [43]\n\nPrologue\nAfter everyone was seated and the Olympic torch relay ended its metropolitan leg around the area surrounding the Stade de France, the artistic portion began with a pre-recorded video (with footage of past opening ceremonies of the Games) of comedian Jamel Debbouze carrying the flame into an empty Stade de France, having not realized that the opening ceremony would be held outside the stadium Interspersed were clips of newscasters around the world reporting that the ceremony would not be in a stadium, but instead at along the Seine after his arrival inside the stadium and wondering where is everybody He is approached by footballer Zinedine Zidane, who takes the torch through the city streets, leaping through a traffic jam, disrupting people at a cafe and attracting the attention of a trio of children representing the three times Paris has hosted the Games Zidane then heads into the Paris Métro, [a] which is decorated with posters from previous Games on its billboards, and boards a train about to depart Before the train can leave the station, it breaks down, prompting Zidane to pass the torch to the children through the train window After traversing the Catacombs of Paris and the legendary underground lake beneath the Palais Garnier, the children are approached by a mysterious hooded and masked torchbearer rowing a boat The trio climb aboard and as they begin their journey to the outside world, the camera pans up to the Trocadéro stage to present in live format the authorities present at the ceremonies: Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, and Emmanuel Macron, president of the French Republic, as they stand up to welcome the crowd After that, the boat is rowed through a tunnel, into a light that shines to reveal the phrase \"Ça ira\" (literally, \"will happen\"; figuratively, \"it'll be fine\") as the boat arrived on the Seine The parade then began on the Pont d'Austerlitz bridge (decorated in Olympic theming), as pyrotechnics in the tricolour of the flag of France, and jets of water from the Seine opened the Parade of Nations.\n\n\nEnchanté\nThe first sequence, Enchanté (enchant/delight), a man sitting at the top of Pont d'Austerlitz played an accordion rendition of Cerrone's \"Supernature\" began the first of the four blocs of the parade with the Greek delegation and the Refugee Olympic Team, and through to the Bahraini delegation [10] The first musical act featured Lady Gaga and eight dancers waving large pink ostrich feather hand fans, all in custom Dior costumes The segment (pre-recorded for \"safety reasons\") [48] alluded to \"a cabaret feel\" with a performance of \"Mon truc en plumes\", made famous by vedette Zizi Jeanmaire, on a golden staircase beside a black grand piano below Square Barye  [fr] at the southeast point of Île Saint-Louis [49] The singer wore a black satin bustier under a black feather jacket and welcomed the audience by saying \"Bonsoir, bienvenue à Paris\", which means \"Good evening, welcome to Paris\" [50]\n\n\nSynchronicité\nThe second sequence, Synchronicité (synchronicity), started with a dance tribute by 420 people to the reconstruction teams of Notre-Dame repairing the cathedral following its 2019 fire and to artisans in general, held on Île de la Cité This sequence featured French-Senegalese dancer Guillaume Diop on the rooftop of the Hôtel de Ville and Olympic champions Martin Fourcade and Michael Phelps Aside from the Notre-Dame's reconstruction, the sequence also highlighted the making of the Olympic medals in their three metals at the Monnaie de Paris and the Louis Vuitton cases that carry them.\n\n\nLiberté\nThe third sequence, Liberté (liberty), was themed after the French Revolution, the Reign of Terror and their aftermath In a pre-recorded scene at the Théâtre du Châtelet, the torchbearer witnesses a performance of \"A la volonté du peuple\" (the original French version of \"Do You Hear the People Sing?\") by a group of actors playing in the musical Les Misérables, which then cuts to live footage of the façade of the Conciergerie In one of its windows, a beheaded Marie Antoinette sang the opening notes of Ah! ca ira!, joined by heavy metal band Gojira playing enthusiastically, perched on small platforms that stuck out from other windows Soprano Marina Viotti  [fr] joined Gojira in the latter half of the song, before performing a rendition of the Habanera from Georges Bizet's opera Carmen, all done while \"sailing\" along the Quai de l'Horloge on a float in the shape of the boat present on the coat of arms of Paris.\n\n\nÉgalité\nThe Republican Guard marching band played the introduction of \"For me formidable\"  [fr] by Charles Aznavour on the Pont des Arts footbridge, opening the fourth sequence, Égalité (equality) During the band's performance, the masked torchbearer turns up and uses the Olympic flame to light up the stage for French singer Aya Nakamura, who performed a mashup of three songs:  \"Pookie\", \"Djadja\" and some stanzas from \"For me formidable\", in front of the Institut de France in a special brass version with the Choir of the French Army and musicians of the Republican Guard.\n\n\nFraternité\nThe fifth sequence, Fraternité (fraternity/brotherhood), began with Camille Saint-Saëns' \"Danse macabre\" and the masked torchbearer at the Louvre seeing characters from the paintings and statues emerging and coming to life, reminiscent of the Night at the Museum films, and finding Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa absent, stolen from its protective chamber (a reference to its theft in 1911) The parade resumed through the section of the river decorated with giant board heads of the characters from the paintings facing behind the parade with the Cypriot through Gabonese delegations, as pianist Alexandre Kantorow performed Maurice Ravel's \"Jeux d'eau\" above Passerelle Léopold-Sédar-Senghor under heavy rain The parade boats continued with the Gambian through Jamaican delegations.\n\n\nSororité\nThe sixth sequence, Sororité (sorority/sisterhood), highlighted ten notable French women with golden statues along the Seine: Olympe de Gouges, Alice Milliat, Gisèle Halimi, Paulette Nardal, Jeanne Barret, Christine de Pizan, Louise Michel, Alice Guy, Simone Veil, and Simone de Beauvoir (the latter did not show her name nor her statue rose during the ceremony due to technical problems) After that, Saint-Cirel sang the sixth verse of the French national anthem, accompanied by a choir.\n\n\nSportivité\nThe seventh sequence, Sportivité (sportsmanship), resumed the parade boats with the Japanese through Norwegian delegations Athletes demonstrated urban sports, namely skateboarding and BMX freestyle, as well as breakdancing on floating ramps near Port du Gros-Caillou  [fr] Polish countertenor Jakub Józef Orliński dressed as a Pierrot who sang Viens Hymen from Jean-Philippe Rameau's opera Les Indes galantes, becoming the first artist from Poland to perform at an Olympic Games opening ceremony [51] Orliński then performed some breakdancing in a nod to the sport's inclusion at the Games [51] Rapper Rim'K followed, singing his song \"King\" near Pont de l'Alma on board what would be the dance barge on the following sequence.\n\n\nFestivité\nThe eighth sequence, Festivité (festivity/celebration), started with a tribute to French fashion at the red carpet on the Passerelle Debilly The parade continued on to its end with the Kiwi through Zimbabwean delegations, then the Australian and the American delegations as their cities Brisbane and Los Angeles, are the next Summer Olympic Games hosts in 2032 and 2028 respectively The masked torchbearer walked past the models and performed acrobatics on the Passerelle, after which a live video feed showed the participants of the Olympic surfing tournaments on Tahiti The parade of boats culminated with the French delegation arriving on a large boat.\n\n\nObscurité\nThe ninth sequence, Obscurité (obscurity/darkness), continued on from Festivité, with the music turning darker in mood and the dancers aboard the barge becoming more frenetic As its LED floor flashed a montage of various climate disasters, including droughts, floods, and forest fires, the dancers slowly collapsed, one by one As the Seine darkened, Juliette Armanet appeared on a raft singing \"Imagine\" as part of a call for peace, accompanied by Sofiane Pamart on a burning piano.\n\n\nSolidarité\nThe tenth sequence, Solidarité (solidarity), showcased a hooded knight-resembling masked horsewoman, representing both the patron saint of France, Joan of Arc and the goddess of the river Seine, Sequana, as well as serving as the secondary main character of the opening ceremony The horsewoman wears the Olympic flag as a cape along with silver and black armour, and rides a metallic mechanical horse galloping at 25 km/h midstream on the Seine [62] [63] As she gallops, she spreads dove wings above the Seine, an ancient symbol of peace between nations during the Olympic truce Once the mechanical horse completes its course on the Seine, the horsewoman shows up riding a live, white horse on land, crossing the pont d'Iena The horsewoman riding on the Seine was Morgane Suquart [62] and the horsewoman riding a real horse on land and presenting the Olympic flag was Floriane Issert [64] [65] This segment referenced Pierre de Coubertin and the history of the Olympics, with numerous archival images and highlights of past Games Volunteers carrying the flags of the participating countries gathered on pont d'Iéna The horsewoman climbed out of the white horse and carried another, folded Olympic flag on foot to a mast at the Trocadéro, surrounded by athletes The Olympic Hymn was performed by the Radio France Choir  [fr] featuring the Maîtrise de Radio France and the Orchestre National de France in Greek as members of the French Armed Forces raised the flag, which was accidentally raised upside down [66]\n\n\nSolennité\nDuring the eleventh sequence, Solennité (solemnity), the Olympic Laurels were awarded, with Italian diplomat Filippo Grandi receiving them in his capacity as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Tony Estanguet, head

Opening Ceremony**\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony was held on July 26, 2024, at the Seine River in Paris, France. It was the first opening ceremony held outside of an Olympic stadium since the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nLogistics preparations were expected to be finalized by the end of 2023, with certain rehearsals occurring in secret venues without public presence before the event. In some specific situations, they were carried out on-site, and were considered \"teasers\" by Thierry Reboul, executive director for the Games. The first camera test shots were done in September 2023, and coverage of the event was expected to be provided by 130 cameras placed in strategic positions. The event was broadcast live to 80 giant screens along the route of the Seine. Directed and created by theatre and television actor and director Thomas Jolly, it was the first opening ceremony held outside of an Olympic stadium since the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics held in Buenos Aires. The choreography was created by Maud Le Pladec.\n\n**Safety Measures**\n\nIn October 2023, following security concerns caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Gaza–Israel war, and the Arras school stabbing, both the French government and the Paris Organising Committee for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games (COJOP2024) stated there were no official plans to relocate, stating that \"Plan A takes into account all of the threats.\" Oudéa-Castréa stated on BFM TV that they were paying attention to context and the government had been working on \"adjustment variables,\" wishing to maintain the original format. In December 2023, President Macron stated that there were multiple scenarios for the ceremony, in case of a major security event which would force it to move from the Seine. On this, COJOP2024 stated they had \"contingency plans for all identified risk scenarios: heatwaves, cyberattacks, and the ceremony is no exception.\" In April 2024, President Macron announced that in case of a terrorism threat, there was a plan B, and even plan C; in that case the Opening Ceremony would be moved to the Trocadero or to the Stade de France stadium. Nevertheless, Christophe Dubi, the IOC Games executive director, stated the previous in March that a change to the Stade de France would be unlikely due to the event being \"too big, too sophisticated, too complex artistically to look at a Plan B in another location.\"\n\n**Protocolar Elements and Torch Relay**\n\nThe Parade of Nations, during which the expected number of 10,500 participating athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees participate categorized by their respective delegation, took place on the Seine, with other ceremonial events being held at the Jardins du Trocadéro.

ceremony to be held in such a manner since the 2016 Summer Olympics which started with a small drizzle [43]\n\nPrologue\nAfter everyone was seated and the Olympic torch relay ended its metropolitan leg around the area surrounding the Stade de France, the artistic portion began with a pre-recorded video (with footage of past opening ceremonies of the Games) of comedian Jamel Debbouze carrying the flame into an empty Stade de France, having not realized that the opening ceremony would be held outside the stadium Interspersed were clips of newscasters around the world reporting that the ceremony would not be in a stadium, but instead at along the Seine after his arrival inside the stadium and wondering where is everybody He is approached by footballer Zinedine Zidane, who takes the torch through the city streets, leaping through a traffic jam, disrupting people at a cafe and attracting the attention of a trio of children representing the three times Paris has hosted the Games Zidane then heads into the Paris Métro, [a] which is decorated with posters from previous Games on its billboards, and boards a train about to depart Before the train can leave the station, it breaks down, prompting Zidane to pass the torch to the children through the train window After traversing the Catacombs of Paris and the legendary underground lake beneath the Palais Garnier, the children are approached by a mysterious hooded and masked torchbearer rowing a boat The trio climb aboard and as they begin their journey to the outside world, the camera pans up to the Trocadéro stage to present in live format the authorities present at the ceremonies: Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, and Emmanuel Macron, president of the French Republic, as they stand up to welcome the crowd After that, the boat is rowed through a tunnel, into a light that shines to reveal the phrase \"Ça ira\" (literally, \"will happen\"; figuratively, \"it'll be fine\") as the boat arrived on the Seine The parade then began on the Pont d'Austerlitz bridge (decorated in Olympic theming), as pyrotechnics in the tricolour of the flag of France, and jets of water from the Seine opened the Parade of Nations.\n\n\nEnchanté\nThe first sequence, Enchanté (enchant/delight), a man sitting at the top of Pont d'Austerlitz played an accordion rendition of Cerrone's \"Supernature\"

dancers waving large pink ostrich feather hand fans, all in custom Dior costumes The segment (pre-recorded for \"safety reasons\") [48] alluded to \"a cabaret feel\" with a performance of \"Mon truc en plumes\", made famous by vedette Zizi Jeanmaire, on a golden staircase beside a black grand piano below Square Barye  [fr] at the southeast point of Île Saint-Louis [49] The singer wore a black satin bustier under a black feather jacket and welcomed the audience by saying \"Bonsoir, bienvenue à Paris\", which means \"Good evening, welcome to Paris\" [50]\n\n\nSynchronicité\nThe second

the Notre-Dame's reconstruction, the sequence also highlighted the making of the Olympic medals in their three metals at the Monnaie de Paris and the Louis Vuitton cases that carry them.\n\n\nLiberté\nThe third sequence, Liberté (liberty), was themed after the French Revolution, the Reign of Terror and their aftermath In a pre-recorded scene at the Théâtre du Châtelet, the torchbearer witnesses a performance of \"A la volonté du peuple\" (the original French version of \"Do You Hear the People Sing?\") by a group of actors playing in the musical Les Misérables, which then cuts to live footage of the façade of the Conciergerie In one of its windows, a beheaded Marie Antoinette sang the opening notes of Ah! ca ira!, joined by heavy metal band Gojira playing enthusiastically, perched on small platforms that stuck out from other windows Soprano Marina Viotti  [fr] joined Gojira in the latter half of the song, before performing a rendition of the Habanera from Georges Bizet's opera Carmen, all done while \"sailing\" along the Quai de l'Horloge on a float in the shape of the boat present on the coat of arms of Paris.\n\n\nÉgalité\nThe Republican Guard marching band played the introduction of \"For me formidable\"  [fr] by Charles Aznavour on the Pont des Arts footbridge, opening the fourth sequence, Égalité (equality) During the band's performance,

\"For me formidable\", in front of the Institut de France in a special brass version with the Choir of the French Army and musicians of the Republican Guard.\n\n\nFraternité\nThe fifth sequence, Fraternité (fraternity/brotherhood), began with Camille Saint-Saëns' \"Danse macabre\" and the masked torchbearer at the Louvre seeing characters from the paintings and statues emerging and coming to life, reminiscent of the Night at the Museum films, and finding Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa absent, stolen from its protective chamber (a reference to its theft in 1911) The parade resumed through the section of the river decorated with giant board heads of the characters from the paintings facing behind the parade with the Cypriot through Gabonese delegations, as pianist Alexandre Kantorow

Christine de Pizan, Louise Michel, Alice Guy, Simone Veil, and Simone de Beauvoir (the latter did not show her name nor her statue rose during the ceremony due to technical problems) After that,

through Norwegian delegations Athletes demonstrated urban sports, namely skateboarding and BMX freestyle, as well as breakdancing on floating ramps near Port du Gros-Caillou  [fr] Polish countertenor Jakub Józef Orliński dressed as a Pierrot who sang Viens Hymen from Jean-Philippe Rameau's opera Les Indes galantes, becoming the first artist from Poland to perform at an Olympic Games opening ceremony [51] Orliński then performed some breakdancing in a nod to the sport's inclusion at the Games [51] Rapper Rim'K followed, singing his song \"King\" near Pont de l'Alma on board what would be the dance barge on the following sequence.\n\n\nFestivité\nThe eighth sequence, Festivité (festivity/celebration), started with a tribute to French fashion at the red carpet on the Passerelle Debilly The parade continued on to its end with the Kiwi through Zimbabwean delegations, then the Australian and the American delegations as their cities Brisbane and Los Angeles, are the next Summer Olympic Games hosts in 2032 and 2028 respectively The masked torchbearer walked past the models and performed acrobatics on the Passerelle, after which a live video feed showed the participants of the Olympic surfing tournaments on Tahiti The parade of boats culminated with the French delegation arriving on a large boat.\n\n\nObscurité\nThe ninth sequence, Obscurité (obscurity/darkness), continued on from Festivité, with the music turning darker in mood and the dancers aboard the barge becoming more frenetic As its LED floor flashed a montage of various climate disasters, including droughts, floods, and forest fires, the dancers slowly collapsed, one by one As the Seine darkened, Juliette Armanet appeared on a raft singing \"Imagine\" as part of a call for peace, accompanied by Sofiane Pamart on a burning piano.\n\n\nSolidarité\nThe tenth sequence, Solidarité (solidarity), showcased a hooded knight-resembling masked horsewoman, representing both the patron saint of France, Joan of Arc and the goddess of the river Seine, Sequana, as well as serving as the secondary main character of the opening ceremony The horsewoman wears the Olympic flag as a cape along with silver and black armour, and rides a metallic mechanical horse galloping at 25 km/h midstream on the Seine [62] [63] As she gallops, she spreads dove wings above the Seine, an ancient symbol of peace between nations during the Olympic truce Once the mechanical horse completes its course on the Seine, the horsewoman shows up riding a live, white horse on land, crossing the pont d'Iena The horsewoman riding on the Seine was Morgane Suquart [62] and the horsewoman riding a real horse on land and presenting the Olympic flag was Floriane Issert [64] [65] This segment referenced Pierre de Coubertin and the history of the Olympics, with numerous archival images and highlights of past Games Volunteers carrying the flags of the participating countries gathered on pont d'Iéna The horsewoman climbed out of the white horse and carried another, folded Olympic flag on foot to a mast at the Trocadéro, surrounded by athletes The Olympic Hymn was performed by the Radio France Choir  [fr] featuring the Maîtrise de Radio France and the Orchestre National de France in Greek as members of the French Armed Forces raised the flag, which was accidentally raised upside down [66]\n\n\nSolennité\nDuring the eleventh sequence,

portrayal of Marie Antoinette, in which the queen was shown holding her own severed head in reference to her execution by guillotine in 1793 during the French Revolution; the sequence was also held in the Conciergerie, where she was imprisoned, tried and sentenced The segment was criticized for its grotesque nature and for glorifying violence in the Reign of Terror [223] [224] [225] Critics included French right-wing figures, including Jean-Christophe Buisson  [fr], a biographer of Marie Antoinette; [226] French monarchists; [227] members of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, to which Marie Antoinette belonged; members of the House of Bourbon, into which she married; [228] [229] and even far-left French opposition figure Jean-Luc Mélenchon [230] [231] [232] The segment was contrasted with the London 2012 opening ceremony, in which the inclusion of Queen Elizabeth II was perceived to be an \"homage\" to the British monarchy [233] [234]\n\n\nPresence of Aya Nakamura\nThe presence of singer Aya Nakamura at the ceremony was criticized Nakamura had faced racial abuse in the lead up to the event, such as the far-right group Les Natifs displaying a banner \"There's no way Aya This is Paris, not the Bamako market\" on the basis of her roots in Mali [236] [237] According to an Odoxa  [fr] poll prior to the event, 63% of French people disapproved of Nakamura performing at the Olympics [238]\n\n\nIntroduction of South Korea as North Korea\nDuring the parade of nations, the South Korean delegation was incorrectly addressed by the French and English announcers as République populaire démocratique de Corée and Democratic People's Republic of Korea – the official designation for North Korea – rather than République de Corée and Republic of Korea [239] [240] The International Olympic Committee posted an apology on their official website [241]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "History_of_slavery_in_Virginia", "content": "\nOverview\nWhen English settlers arrived in the seventeenth century in what became the colony of Virginia, there were 30 or so tribes of Native Americans, in a loose confederacy led by Powhatan He lived in the region of the James River [2] and was the father of Pocahontas, who later married a colonist [3] Numerous colonists starved during the colony's early years [4] Kathryn Knight, author of Unveiled - The Twenty & Odd, about a group of captives from the Kingdom of Ndongo who were the first Africans in Virginia, says of the English settlers: \"Basically all of those people were right off of the streets in England..  [they] didn't know how to grow anything They didn't know how to manage livestock They didn't know anything about survival in Virginia..  [Africans and Native Americans] saved them by being able to produce crops, by being able to manage the livestock They kept them alive.\" [5] The English settlers and traders began enslaving Native Americans soon after founding Jamestown [6]\n\n\nSlavery\nAfter the first Africans arrived at Jamestown in 1619, slavery and other forms of bondage were found in all the English colonies; some Native Americans were enslaved by the English, with a few slaveholders having both African and Native American slaves, [16] who worked in their tobacco fields Laws regarding enslavement of Native Americans vacillated between encouraging and discouraging slavery The number of enslaved native people reached a peak at the end of the seventeenth century.\n\n\nNative Americans\nAfter the first Africans arrived at Jamestown in 1619, slavery and other forms of bondage were found in all the English colonies; some Native Americans were enslaved by the English, with a few slaveholders having both African and Native American slaves, [16] who worked in their tobacco fields Laws regarding enslavement of Native Americans vacillated between encouraging and discouraging slavery The number of enslaved native people reached a peak at the end of the seventeenth century.\n\n\nFirst Africans\nIn late August 1619, twenty or more Africans were brought to Point Comfort on the James River in Virginia They were sold first in exchange for food and then sold in Jamestown as indentured servants [21] [b] The Africans came from the Kingdom of Ndongo, in what is now Angola [5] Angela, an enslaved woman from Ndonggo, was one of the first enslaved Africans to be officially recorded in the colony of Virginia in 1619 [24]\n\n\nUnpaid servants\nHousehold and farm work was performed by indentured servants and enslaved people, including children [12] [c] Indentured servants, generally brought from England, worked without pay for a specific length of time [33] They exchanged their labor for the cost of their passage to the colony, room and board, and freedom dues, which were stipulated to be provided to the servant at the end of the indenture period, and could include land and supplies that would help them become established on their own [27] [34] In the seventeenth century, the tobacco fields of Virginia were mostly worked by white indentured servants By 1705, the economy was based upon slave labor imported from Africa [35]\n\n\nDomestic, field, and skilled labor\nFrom Monday through Saturday, enslaved people were assigned specific duties Most people, including children, were farm hands [38] Domestic work, another duty, included preparing and serving food, cleaning, and caretaking of white children; others were trained to be blacksmiths, carpenters, and coopers [38] Those who had livestock or gardens tended to them on Sunday It was also a day to be with family and for worship [38]\n\n\nOffenses against slaves\nEnslavers had control of the people that they enslaved They could favor some, make life miserable for others, tease them with hollow promises of emancipation, brutally rape, and severely punish slaves They could also control what happened to their children, which was a very powerful tactic Slaves could not testify against their masters in a court case, making their situation more difficult [41] In 1829, the North Carolina v Mann case was brought before the North Carolina Supreme Court, which ruled that slaveholders had the right to treat enslaved people in any way that they chose, including killing them, in order to better the \"submission\" of the enslaved to their masters [42]\n\n\nProgeny\nFrom the 1600s until 1860, it was common for white planters, overseers, or other white men to rape enslaved women Because of the disparity of power between enslaved women and the men who fathered their children, and the fact that the men had unlimited access to such forced sex, \"all of the sex that took place between enslaved women and white men constituted some form of sexual assault.\" [42]\n\n\nFormalized slavery\nIt was in Virginia that a legal process emerged guaranteeing that the 'cruelty of slavery and pervasive racial injustice were guaranteed by its laws.'\n\n\nPlantations and farms\nVirginia planters developed the commodity crop of tobacco as their chief export It was a labor-intensive crop, and demand for it in England and Europe led to an increase in the importation of African slaves in the colony [52] European servants were replaced by enslaved blacks during the seventeenth century, as they were a more profitable source of labor Slavery was supported through legal and cultural changes Virginia is where the first enslaved blacks were imported to English colonies in North America, and slavery spread from there to the other colonies [53] Large plantations became more prevalent, changing the culture of colonial Virginia that relied on them for its economic prosperity The plantation \"served as an institution in itself, characterized by social and political inequality, racial conflict, and domination by the planter class.\" [10]\n\n\nCulture\nAfrican Americans developed cultural traditions that helped them cope with being enslaved, supported family members and friends, and promoted their human dignity Music, folklore, cuisine, and religious practices by blacks influenced the broader American culture [38] Africans contributed to American culture, including American language, music, dance, and cuisine [64] The first Africans carried from Angola may have brought some Christian practices that they learned from the Portuguese Catholic missionaries and Jesuit priests in Africa [65]\n\n\nReligion and music\nWhite people built and held religious services in church buildings where free blacks and enslaved people may also have been allowed to worship, albeit in segregated spaces, until they were able to establish their own churches [66]\n\n\nFood\nEnslaved people's diet was determined by what food was given to them, the mainstays being corn and pork [38] [67] At hog butchering time, the best cuts of meat were kept for the master's household and the remainder, such as fatback, snouts, ears, neck bones, feet, and intestines (chitterlings) were given to the slaves Cornbread was commonly eaten by enslaved people, and there were many other ways that corn was prepared, such as porridge, hominy, grits, corn cakes, waffles, and corn dodgers [68] Enslaved adults were typically given a peck (9 liters) of cornmeal and 3–4 pounds (1.5–2 kilos) of pork per week, and from those rations come soul food staples such as cornbread, fried catfish, chitterlings, and neckbones [69]\n\n\nClothing\nThe clothing that enslaved people in Virginia wore varied depended upon when they lived, what occupations they had, and the practices of their enslavers They could not retain their choice of clothing from Africa, except that some women wore traditional West African cloth head wraps [72]\nIn the eighteenth century, if they worked in the fields, they likely wore uncomfortable, simple European-style clothing It was certainly made of inexpensive and inferior fabric, like Negro cloth and osnaburg made from hemp and flax Some people found the clothing so uncomfortable that they tried to take it off when able [72]\n\n\nSlave trade\nThe Atlantic slave trade started in the sixteenth century when Portuguese and Spanish ships transported enslaved people to South America, and then to the West Indies Virginia became part of the Atlantic slave trade when the first Africans were brought to the colony in 1619 [73] The slaves were sold for tobacco and hemp that was sent to Europe [73]\n\n\nTransatlantic slave trade\nThe Atlantic slave trade started in the sixteenth century when Portuguese and Spanish ships transported enslaved people to South America, and then to the West Indies Virginia became part of the Atlantic slave trade when the first Africans were brought to the colony in 1619 [73] The slaves were sold for tobacco and hemp that was sent to Europe [73]\n\n\nDomestic slave trade and breeding\nVirginia's domestic slave trade grew substantially in the early nineteenth century It became the state's most lucrative industry, with more money being made by the exporting of enslaved people than was made from tobacco [38] Women were used for breeding White men had sex with enslaved women at will, consequently they could obtain more slaves to breed field workers, giving them an incentive to provide health care that would ensure women's fertility and successful childbirth Two million enslaved people are believed to have been transported or marched on foot from Richmond to the Deep South, where they were needed to labor in the cotton fields [38] Robert Lumpkin operated his slave jail, where enslaved blacks suffered greatly under his brutal management, near the slave market of Richmond, which city was the largest American slave-trading center after New Orleans, [78] and ranked first in slave breeding [79]\n\n\nSale\nRichmond was a hub and the largest seller of enslaved people in Virginia [81] [11] When enslaved people were sold, it meant that communities and families were subject to being dispersed to different places [81] It was common for people to be separated from their spouses and children, perhaps for the rest of their lives [81] People were taken from the plantation and put into jails or slave pens of slave traders They might be held there for weeks and were subject to intrusive physical inspections When they were auctioned, they could be sold again to another trader or ultimately sold to work on plantations in the Lower South [81]\n\n\nControls and resistance\nSlaveholders had ongoing concerns that bondspeople might run away or revolt against them, and employed a number of controls One tactic was to prevent African Americans from learning how to read and write They limited opportunities for groups of people to meet and prevented them from leaving the plantation Slaves who attempted to escape their bondage and were caught were punished publicly; punishments included execution and physical disfigurement White Virginians who helped black people violate the codes were also punished Other control tactics were incentives, religion, the legal system, and intimidation [38]\n\n\nRevolts\nDuring the nineteenth century, there were three major attempted slave revolts in Virginia: Gabriel's Rebellion in 1800, Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831, and John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, organized by a white radical abolitionist, John Brown After Nat Turner's rebellion, thousands of Virginians sent the legislature over forty petitions calling for an end to slavery, and Richmond's newspapers argued fiercely for abolition [88] [89] According to historian Eva Sheppard Wolf, \"The response of white Virginians continued well beyond their initial fit of violence and included the most public, focused, and sustained discussion of slavery and emancipation that occurred in the commonwealth or any other southern state.\" [90] About a third of the petitions received by the House of Delegates also called for the prior forced exile of all free Blacks from Virginia to Liberia [91] Free Blacks, at least by 1859, were barred from entering the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n\n\nFreedom\nOpportunities for most enslaved African Americans to attain freedom were few to none Some were freed by their owners to honor a pledge, to grant a reward, or, before the 1700s, to fulfill a servitude agreement A few were bought by Quakers, Methodists, and religious activists for the sole purpose of freeing them (a practice soon banned in the southern states) Many ran away to free territory, and some of these \"fugitives\" succeeded in avoiding capture and forced to the South.\n\n\nIndentured servitude\nIndentured servitude was a contractual arrangement between English persons and their masters that specified the number of years to be worked in exchange for their passage to Virginia and their upkeep One of the restrictions of their contracts was that they could not marry while in service The first servants who came to Virginia received a percentage of the profits of the Virginia Company of London After ten years, in an attempt to attract more workers, English indentured servants were to receive land upon the completion of their contract Servants and their masters could take one another to court if the terms of the contract were not being met or to address wrongs, such as physical abuse of the servant [102] [103]\n\n\nRun away\nAnother way to attain one's freedom was to run away, which made that person a fugitive slave [114] Both indentured servants and enslaved people ran away for several reasons They may have been in search of family members that they were separated from, or fleeing abusive masters and hard labor [115]\n\n\nSelf-purchase or family members's purchase of freedom\nAnother path to freedom was to purchase it by saving one's wages In 1839, over forty percent of the free blacks in Cincinnati, Ohio, had paid for their freedom Moses Grandy, born in North Carolina but who worked in Virginia, purchased his freedom twice [120] If a former slave wanted to purchase the freedom of his wife and children, he had to persuade the slaveholder to allow the purchase of family members, which could take years If terms were agreed upon, a price was set The arrangement could be broken if the slaveholder died before the wife or children were freed [121]\n\n\nFreedom suit\nIn 1658, Elizabeth Key was the first woman of African descent to bring a freedom suit in the Virginia colony She sought recognition as a free woman of color, rather than being classified as a Negro (African) and slave Her natural father was an Englishman (and member of the House of Burgesses) He acknowledged her, had her baptized as a Christian in the Church of England, and arranged for her guardianship under an indenture before his death [45] Before her guardian returned to England, he sold Key's indenture to another man, who held Key beyond its term When he died, the estate classified Key and her child (also the natural son of an English subject) as Negro slaves Key sued for her freedom and that of her infant son, based on their English ancestry, her Christian status, and the record of indenture She won her case [45]\n\n\nManumission\nSome enslaved people were manumitted by their enslavers [121] In some cases, people were freed because they were held in good esteem by their enslavers, sometimes it was because the enslaved were no longer useful In other cases, mixed-race children of white slaveholders were freed [100]\n\n\nImmigrants\nFree blacks came to the Southern states after the 1791 Haitian slave revolt in Saint-Domingue, in which enslaved blacks fought the French Some of the free blacks brought their slaves with them, and many more slaves and free people of color arrived in Louisiana after the United States purchased Louisiana, [131] and joined the generally mixed-race issue of black slaves and French and Spanish colonists [132] [101]\n\n\nLife after attaining freedom\nMost free people of color lived in the American South, but there were freed people who lived throughout the United States According to the US census of 1860, 250,787 of them lived in the South [133] and 225,961 lived in other parts of the country In 1860, the free black population was close to 100% in the north The census shows that there were still 18 enslaved people living in New Jersey [101] [134] Large populations of free blacks lived in Philadelphia, Virginia, and Maryland [100]\n\n\nSettlement\nMost free people of color lived in the American South, but there were freed people who lived throughout the United States According to the US census of 1860, 250,787 of them lived in the South [133] and 225,961 lived in other parts of the country

Philadelphia, Virginia, and Maryland [100]\n\n\nEducation\nAfrican Americans established schools, including secondary schools, for freed people in Virginia soon after the start of the American Civil War (1861–1865) [137] The schools were taught by white and black teachers, the latter of whom taught longer than whites throughout Reconstruction [137]\n\n\nReligion\nThe African Methodist Episcopal Church, which grew out of the Free African Society, was founded by Richard Allen in Philadelphia [138] [139] It was central to communities of free African Americans, and branched out to Charleston, South Carolina, and other areas in the South, although there were laws that prevented blacks from preaching The church was treated brutally by whites and members were arrested en masse [100]\n\n\nInequities\nFreedom had its challenges There were laws, particularly in the Upper South, that created obstacles for free blacks Lawmakers sought to keep an eye on free blacks, by registering them, deporting them, or putting them in jail They made it harder for black to testify in court and to vote Henry Louis Gates Jr cites a quote by Ira Berlin of a common saying at the time: \"even the lowest whites  [could] threaten free Negroes … with 'a good nigger beating.'\" [101]\n\n\nCivil War\nThe American Revolutionary War of 1776 and the Constitution of 1787, left open the issues of whether aristocrats or other groups of people should reign over others Americans were proud to say that America was \"the land of liberty, a beacon of freedom to the oppressed of other lands\" in the early 1800s However, the United States had become the largest slaveholding country in the world by the 1850s [142] From 1789 to 1861, two thirds of the country's various presidents, nearly three fifths of its Supreme Court justices, and two thirds of its Speakers of the House were slaveholders There was growing tension between the Southern plantation society based upon slave labor and \"diversified, industrializing, free-labor capitalist society\" in the North [142] Richmond, Virginia was the site of the Confederate capital [5]\n\n\nThe end of slavery in Virginia\nSlave trading continued until the defeat of the Confederacy, but the economic uncertainty wrought by the conflict had a negative impact that was immediately visible in Richmond, according to one 1861 newspaper report: [148]\n\n\nHistoric reckoning\nEducation about the history of slavery in the United States tends to blur the truth of horrors that enslaved people experienced, including sexual violence, being separated from family members, as well as the physical and psychological cruelty they experienced Schoolbooks tend to skim the surface of slavery [151] Historians, civil rights advocates, and educators recommend changing the way that slavery is taught in schools and acknowledging how misconceptions, soft-pedaling, and denial impacts the lives of Africans into the 21st century, including fewer opportunities, the greater likelihood of African Americans to be put in prisons, and becoming victims of hate crimes [151]\n\n\nSee

and complex history of slavery that dates back to the early 17th century. The English settlers who arrived in Virginia in the early 1600s brought enslaved Africans with them, and soon after, the colony became a major hub for the transatlantic slave trade.\n\n**Overview**\n\nWhen English settlers arrived in the seventeenth century in what became the colony of Virginia, there were 30 or so tribes of Native Americans, in a loose confederacy led by Powhatan. He lived in the region of the James River and was the father of Pocahontas, who later married a colonist. Numerous colonists starved during the colony's early years. Kathryn Knight, author of Unveiled - The Twenty & Odd, about a group of captives from the Kingdom of Ndongo who were the first Africans in Virginia, says of the English settlers: \"Basically all of those people were right off of the streets in England..  [they] didn't know how to grow anything They didn't know how to manage livestock They didn't know anything about survival in Virginia..  [Africans and Native Americans] saved them by being able to produce crops, by being able to manage the livestock They kept them alive.\" The English settlers and traders began enslaving Native Americans soon after founding Jamestown.\n\n**Slavery**\n\nAfter the first Africans arrived at Jamestown in 1619, slavery and other forms of bondage were found in all the English colonies; some Native Americans were enslaved by the English, with a few slaveholders having both African and Native American slaves, who worked in their tobacco fields. Laws regarding enslavement of Native Americans vacillated between encouraging and discouraging slavery. The number of enslaved native people reached a peak at the end of the seventeenth century.\n\n**First Africans**\n\nIn late August 1619, twenty or more Africans were brought to Point Comfort on the James River in Virginia. They were sold first in exchange for food and then sold in Jamestown as indentured servants. The Africans came from the Kingdom of Ndongo, in what is now Angola. Angela, an enslaved woman from Ndonggo, was one of the first enslaved Africans to be officially recorded in the colony of Virginia in 1619.\n\n**Unpaid Servants**\n\nHousehold and farm work was performed by indentured servants and enslaved people, including children. Indentured servants, generally brought from England, worked without pay for a specific length of time. They exchanged their labor for the cost of their passage to the colony, room and board, and freedom dues, which were stipulated to be provided to the servant at the end of the indenture period, and could include land and supplies that would help them become established on their own.\n\n**Domestic, Field, and Skilled Labor**\n\nFrom Monday through Saturday, enslaved people were assigned specific duties. Most people, including children, were farm hands. Domestic work, another duty, included preparing and serving food, cleaning, and caretaking of white children; others were trained to be blacksmiths, carpenters, and coopers. Those who had livestock or gardens tended to them on Sunday. It was also a day to be with family and for worship.\n\n**Offenses Against Slaves**\n\nEnslavers had control of the people that they enslaved. They could favor some, make life miserable for others, tease them with hollow promises of emancipation, brutally rape, and severely punish slaves. They could also control what happened to their children, which was a very powerful tactic. Slaves could not testify against their masters in a court case, making their situation more difficult. In 1829, the North Carolina v Mann case was brought before the North Carolina Supreme Court, which ruled that slaveholders had the right to treat enslaved people in any way that they chose, including killing them, in order to better the \"submission\" of the enslaved to their masters.\n\n**Progeny**\n\nFrom the 1600s until 1860, it was common for white planters, overseers, or other white men to rape enslaved women. Because of the disparity of power between enslaved women and the men who fathered their children, and the fact that the men had unlimited access to such forced sex, \"all of the sex that took place between enslaved women and white men constituted some form of sexual assault.\"\n\n**Formalized Slavery**\n\nIt was in Virginia that a legal process emerged guaranteeing that the 'cruelty of slavery and pervasive racial injustice were guaranteed by its laws.'\n\n**Plantations and Farms**\n\nVirginia planters developed the commodity crop of tobacco as their chief export. It was a labor-intensive crop, and demand for it in England and Europe led to an increase in the importation of African slaves in the colony. European servants were replaced by enslaved blacks during the seventeenth century, as they were a more profitable source of labor. Slavery was supported through legal and cultural changes. Virginia is where the first enslaved blacks were imported to English colonies in North America, and slavery spread from there to the other colonies. Large plantations became more prevalent, changing the culture of colonial Virginia that relied on them for its economic prosperity. The plantation \"served as an institution in itself, characterized by social and political inequality, racial conflict, and domination by the planter class.\"\n\n**Culture**\n\nAfrican Americans developed cultural traditions that helped them cope with being enslaved, supported family members and friends, and promoted their human dignity. Music, folklore, cuisine, and religious practices by blacks influenced the broader American culture. Africans contributed to American culture, including American language, music, dance, and cuisine. The first Africans carried from Angola may have brought some Christian practices that they learned from the Portuguese Catholic missionaries and Jesuit priests in Africa.\n\n**Religion and Music**\n\nWhite people built and held religious services in church buildings where free blacks and enslaved people may also have been allowed to worship, albeit in segregated spaces, until they were able to establish their own churches.\n\n**Food**\n\nEnslaved people's diet was determined by what food was given to them, the mainstays being corn and pork. At hog butchering time, the best cuts of meat were kept for the master's household and the remainder, such as fatback, snouts, ears, neck bones, feet, and intestines (chitterlings) were given to the slaves. Cornbread was commonly eaten by enslaved people, and there were many other ways that corn was prepared, such as porridge, hominy, grits, corn cakes, waffles, and corn dodgers.\n\n**Clothing**\n\nThe clothing that enslaved people in Virginia wore varied depended upon when they lived, what occupations they had, and the practices of their enslavers. They could not retain their choice of clothing from Africa, except that some women wore traditional West African cloth head wraps. In the eighteenth century, if they worked in the fields, they likely wore uncomfortable, simple European-style clothing. It was certainly made of inexpensive and inferior fabric, like Negro cloth and osnaburg made from hemp and flax. Some people found the clothing so uncomfortable that they tried to take it off when able.\n\n**Slave Trade**\n\nThe Atlantic slave trade started in the sixteenth century when Portuguese and Spanish ships transported enslaved people to South America, and then to the West Indies. Virginia became part of the Atlantic slave trade when the first Africans were brought to the colony in 1619. The slaves were sold for tobacco and hemp that was sent to Europe.\n\n**Transatlantic Slave Trade**\n\nThe Atlantic slave trade started in the sixteenth century when Portuguese and Spanish ships transported enslaved people to South America, and then to the West Indies. Virginia became part of the Atlantic slave trade when the first Africans were brought to the colony in 1619. The slaves were sold for tobacco and hemp that was sent to Europe.\n\n**Domestic Slave Trade and Breeding**\n\nVirginia's domestic slave trade grew substantially in the early nineteenth century. It became the state's most lucrative industry, with more money being made by the exporting of enslaved people than was made from tobacco. Women were used for breeding. White men had sex with enslaved women at will, consequently they could obtain more slaves to breed field workers, giving them an incentive to provide health care that would ensure women's fertility and successful childbirth.

250,787 of them lived in the South [133] and 225,961 lived in other parts of the country In 1860, the free black population was close to 100% in the north The census shows that there were still 18 enslaved people living in New Jersey [101] [134] Large populations of free blacks lived in Philadelphia, Virginia, and Maryland [100]\n\n\nSettlement\nMost free people of color lived in the American South, but there were freed people who lived throughout the United States According to the US census of 1860, 250,787 of them lived in the South [133] and 225,961 lived in other parts of the country In 1860, the free black population was close to 100% in the north The census shows that there were still 18 enslaved people living in New Jersey [101] [134] Large populations of free blacks lived in Philadelphia, Virginia, and Maryland [100]\n\n\nEducation\nAfrican Americans established schools, including secondary schools, for freed people in Virginia soon after the start of the American Civil War (1861–1865) [137] The schools were taught by white and black teachers, the latter of whom taught longer than whites throughout Reconstruction [137]\n\n\nReligion\nThe African Methodist Episcopal Church, which grew out of the Free African Society, was founded by Richard Allen in Philadelphia [138] [139] It was central to communities of free African Americans, and branched out to Charleston, South Carolina, and other areas in the South, although there were laws that prevented blacks from preaching The church was treated brutally by whites and members were arrested en masse [100]\n\n\nInequities\nFreedom had its challenges There were laws, particularly in the Upper South, that created obstacles for free blacks Lawmakers sought to keep an eye on free blacks, by registering them, deporting them, or putting them in jail They made it harder for black to testify in court and to vote Henry Louis Gates Jr cites a quote by Ira Berlin of a common saying at the time: \"even the lowest whites  [could] threaten free Negroes … with 'a good nigger beating.'\" [101]\n\n\nCivil War\nThe American Revolutionary War of 1776 and the Constitution of 1787, left open the issues of whether aristocrats or other groups of people should reign over others Americans were proud to say that America was \"the land of liberty, a beacon of freedom to the oppressed of other lands\" in the early 1800s However, the United States had become the largest slaveholding country in the world by the 1850s [142] From 1789 to 1861, two thirds of the country's various presidents, nearly three fifths of its Supreme Court justices, and two thirds of its Speakers of the House were slaveholders There was growing tension between the Southern plantation society based upon slave labor and \"diversified, industrializing, free-labor capitalist society\" in the North [142] Richmond, Virginia was the site of the Confederate capital [5]\n\n\nThe end of slavery in Virginia\nSlave trading continued until the defeat of the Confederacy, but the economic uncertainty wrought by the conflict had a negative impact that was immediately visible in Richmond, according to one 1861 newspaper report: [148]\n\n\nHistoric reckoning\nEducation about the history of slavery in the United States tends to blur the truth of horrors that enslaved people experienced, including sexual violence, being separated from family members, as well as the physical and psychological cruelty they experienced Schoolbooks tend to skim the surface of slavery [151] Historians, civil rights advocates, and educators recommend changing the way that slavery is taught in schools and acknowledging how misconceptions, soft-pedaling, and denial impacts the lives of Africans into the 21st century, including fewer opportunities, the greater likelihood of African Americans to be put in prisons, and becoming victims of hate crimes [151]\n\n\nSee

The series is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has been forced to live in a self-sustaining underground city, known as the Silo.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Silo series began in 2011, when Hugh Howey wrote the short story \"Wool\" as a stand-alone novel. He published the work through Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing system, choosing to self-publish due to the freedom it offered. As the series grew in popularity, Howey began to write more entries, later collecting the short story and initial five novellas in the omnibus book Wool. In 2012, he began soliciting international rights and signed a deal for dramatic rights in Brazil.\n\n**Works**\n\nThe Silo series is commonly packaged as three novels, although originally published as novellas. The novels are:\n\n* Wool\n* Shift\n* Dust\n\nEach novel is part of a larger arc, with Wool forming the first arc, Shift the second, and Dust the third and final arc.\n\n**Short Stories**\n\nIn addition to the novels, the Silo series also includes several short stories, published in The Apocalypse Triptych and Howey's anthology Machine Learning. These short stories provide additional insight into the world of the Silo and the characters that inhabit it.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story of Wool takes place on a post-apocalyptic Earth, where humanity has been forced to live in the Silo, a self-sustaining underground city with 144 floors. The Silo is a self-contained ecosystem, with its own air, water, and food supply. All residents of the Silo are taught that the outside world is toxic and deadly, and that anyone who expresses a desire to go outside must be sent there to clean the external sensors with a wool cloth.\n\nThose who are sent outside to clean the sensors inevitably die within minutes, reaffirming to the Silo residents that the outside world is uninhabitable. However, as the series progresses, it becomes clear that there is more to the story than initially meets the eye.\n\n**Arcs**\n\nThe Silo series is divided into three arcs:\n\n### **Wool**\n\nWool is the first arc of the series, consisting of books 1 through 5: Holston, Proper Gauge, Casting Off, The Unraveling, and The Stranded. This arc follows the story of Juliette, a young woman who is sent to the surface to clean the sensors, and her struggles to survive in a world that is hostile and unforgiving.\n\n### **Shift**\n\nShift is the second arc of the series, consisting of books 6 through 8: Legacy, Order, and Pact. This arc is a prequel to the Wool arc, and explores the events that led up to the downfall of human civilization and the creation of the Silo.\n\n### **Dust**\n\nDust is the third and final arc of the series, contained in a single book of the same name. This arc concludes the stories begun in Wool and Shift, and provides a sense of closure and resolution for the characters and the world of the Silo.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe Silo series has received widespread critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the unique and thought-provoking world-building and the engaging and well-developed characters. The series has been described as a \"game-changer\" in the science fiction genre, and has been praised for its ability to explore complex themes and ideas in a way that is both accessible and engaging.\n\n**Adaptations**\n\nThe Silo series has been optioned for film and television by several studios, including 20th Century Fox and AMC. In 2018, AMC announced that LaToya Morgan would be adapting Wool for the network as a series, although the project was later moved to Apple TV+. In 2021, press releases were sent out stating that Graham Yost would write the series, Morten Tyldum would serve as director, and Rebecca Ferguson would star and serve as executive producer.\n\n**Comic Book Adaptation**\n\nIn 2013, Amazon's new comic book imprint Jet City Comics announced that it would release a comic book adaptation of the series. The graphic novel was finally published in August 2014, and was created by Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray, with artwork by Jimmy Broxton.\n\n**Kindle Worlds**\n\nThe Silo Saga was one of the first settings licensed in 2013 for the Kindle Worlds platform for self-publishing fanfiction. By the time Kindle Worlds shuttered in 2018, 122 novels, novellas, and short stories set in the Silo universe had been published via the platform – the third most for any of the licensed series.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe Silo series is a unique and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition, and offers a fresh and exciting take on the science fiction genre. With its engaging characters, complex world-building, and thought-provoking themes, the series is a must-read for fans of science fiction and adventure.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style

Born Adele Laurie Blue Adkins on 5 May 1988 in Tottenham, London, she rose to fame with her soulful and powerful voice, releasing her debut album in 2008.\n\nEarly Life and Education\nAdele Laurie Blue Adkins was born on 5 May 1988 in Tottenham, London, to an English mother, Penny Adkins, and a Welsh father, Marc Evans. Her parents separated when she was two years old, and she was brought up by her mother. Adele began singing at the age of four and became obsessed with voices. In 1997, Adele and her mother moved to Brighton on the south coast of England.\n\nCareer\nFour months after graduating, Adele published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com. She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and given it to a friend, who posted it on Myspace, where it became very successful. The demo led to a phone call from Richard Russell, director of the music label XL Recordings. Around this time, Adele collaborated with Ricsta on \"Be Divine,\" a song described as an \"electronic club-ready\" track.\n\n2006–2010: Career Beginnings and 19\nAdele's debut album, 19, was released in 2008. The album was a commercial success, selling over 7 million copies worldwide. The album included the hit singles \"Chasing Pavements\" and \"Make You Feel My Love.\" Adele's second studio album, 21, was released in 2011 and was also a huge success, selling over 30 million copies worldwide.\n\n2011–2014: Worldwide Recognition with 21\nAdele released her second studio album, 21, on 24 January 2011 in the UK and 22 February in the US.

Adele told Spin Magazine: \"It was really exciting for me because I never grew up around that music.\" 21 topped the charts in 30 countries, including the UK and the US.\n\n2015–2017: 25\nOn the eve of her 26th birthday in May 2014, Adele posted a cryptic message via her Twitter account, which prompted media discussion about her next album. The message, \"Bye bye 25.. See you again later in the year,\" was interpreted by some in the media as meaning that her next album would be titled 25 and released later in the year.\n\n2018–present: 30 and Las Vegas Residency\nAdele was reportedly working on her fourth studio album by 2018. On 5 May 2019, her 31st birthday, Adele posted several black-and-white pictures of herself on her Instagram account celebrating the occasion along with a message reflecting on the preceding year. The message ended with, \"30 will be a drum n bass record to spite you.\" Media outlets took the post as an indication that a new album was on the way.\n\nArtistry\nAdele has cited the Spice Girls as a major influence in regard to her love and passion for music. During childhood, she impersonated the Spice Girls at dinner parties. She says she was \"heartbroken\" when her favourite Spice Girls member, Geri Halliwell aka \"Ginger Spice,\" departed from the group. Lauryn Hill is also one of her major influences. In a 2011 interview, Adele deemed Hill's record The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill as her favourite album.\n\nMusical Style\nAdele's genres include soul, jazz, and R&B. Her song topics often address heartbreak and relationships. Her success occurred simultaneously with several other British female soul singers, with the British press dubbing her a new Amy Winehouse. However, Adele called the comparisons between her and other female soul singers lazy, noting \"we're a gender, not a genre.\"\n\nVoice\nAdele's voice is described as big, smoky, and extraordinary. She has a unique ability to convey emotions through her singing. Her voice has been praised by critics and fans alike.\n\nPersonal Life\nIn 2011, Adele began a relationship with charity entrepreneur Simon Konecki. Their son was born in 2012. On the topic of becoming a parent, Adele said she \"felt like I was truly living. I had a purpose, where before I didn't.\" Adele and Konecki brought a privacy case against a UK-based photo agency that published intrusive paparazzi images of their son taken during family outings in 2013. Lawyers working on their behalf accepted damages from the company in July 2014.\n\nPolitics\nAdele is a supporter of the Labour Party. She said in 2011 that she was a \"Labour girl through and through.\" Despite this declared political alignment, Adele received backlash for her comments on paying taxes during a 2011 interview with Q magazine. She said, \"I use the NHS, I can't use public transport any more, doing what I do, I went to state school, I'm mortified to have to pay 50 percent!

he ordered the plaintiffs to pay the defendants' attorney fees [105] Tuchi said the sanctions would show that the court does not tolerate litigants \"furthering false narratives that baselessly undermine public trust at a time of increasing disinformation about, and distrust in, the democratic process\" [105] The sanction amount was set by Tuchi to be roughly $122,000 [109]\n\n\nPost-election state lawsuits\nOn December 9, 2022, after Arizona certified the election results, Lake filed a new suit in state court, seeking a court order to either overturn Hobbs' victory and declare Lake as the winner of the election, or redo the election in Maricopa County [8] [114] Lake's complaint alleged that there were hundreds of thousands of illegal votes in the election, but provided no evidence in support of these claims [115] On December 19, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson, who was appointed by Republican governor Jan Brewer, dismissed eight of ten counts of Lake's lawsuit (specifically, her claims of invalid signatures on mail-in ballots, incorrect certification, inadequate remedy, and violations of freedom of speech, equal protection, due process, the secrecy clause, and constitutional rights) [9] [116] The judge allowed the remaining two counts (Lake's claim that election officials intentionally interfered with Maricopa County ballot printers and with the chain of custody of Maricopa County ballots) to go to trial, [117] specifying that Lake would need to prove at trial that the allegations were true and that the alleged actions actually changed the election [118]\n\n\n2024 Senate run\nLake announced her candidacy for the 2024 United States Senate election in Arizona on October 10, 2023 [145] In November 2023, Politico noted that Lake had pivoted from the fire-and-brimstone approach of her gubernatorial campaign to a more diplomatic approach, seeking to mend relationships with Republicans she had previously attacked [146] The Hill also noted that Lake \"sought to strike a more conciliatory tone with Republicans\" compared to her 2022 campaign [147]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nLake identifies as a conservative Republican [35] and described herself in 2022 as a \"Trump candidate\" [23] She accused President Joe Biden and Democrats of harboring a \"demonic agenda\" [23]\n\n\nAbortion\nIn 2022, Lake said that she considers abortion to be \"the ultimate sin\" [155] She praised the June 2022 Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, which held that there was no federal right to abortion under the U.S Constitution, and overturned Roe v Wade [156] In 2022, Lake repeatedly expressed support for an 1864 law from the Arizona Territory period that prohibited abortion in Arizona except to save the life of a mother (saying she was \"incredibly thrilled that we are going to have a great law that's already on the books\"), and she called for other states to adopt similar laws [157] [158] [159] In November 2023, Lake reaffirmed her support for the 1864 abortion ban [160]\n\n\nOther views\nIn an op-ed for the Independent Journal Review, Lake wrote that as governor she would deport illegal immigrants that enter Arizona without seeking federal approval and complete unfinished portions of the Trump wall on the Mexico–United States border [165]\n\n\nPersonal life\nLake has been married to Jeff Halperin since August 1998 [28] They have two children [176] She was previously married to Tracy Finnegan, an electrical engineer [177]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was a key figure in the Charismatic movement and was known for his faith-healing revivals and his emphasis on the importance of giving to God.\n\n## Early Life\n\nOral Roberts was born on January 24, 1918, in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma, to the Reverend Ellis Melvin Roberts and Claudius Priscilla Roberts. He was the fifth and youngest child of the family. In an interview, Roberts claimed that his mother was of Cherokee descent, but census records indicate that the family was listed as \"white.\" Roberts began life in poverty and nearly died of tuberculosis when he was 17 years old. After finishing high school, he studied for two years at Oklahoma Baptist University and Phillips University. In 1938, he married Evelyn Lutman Fahnestock, a preacher's daughter.\n\n## Ministry and University\n\nIn 1945, Roberts resigned from his pastorate in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to hold revivals in the area and attend Oklahoma Baptist University. However, he was asked by Robert E. \"Daddy\" Lee of Toccoa, Georgia, to consider becoming pastor of his small church. Roberts suggested they pray about it, and unexpectedly, decided to accept. By the end of the year, Roberts resigned and moved back to Shawnee, but the experience had a lasting effect on him and his family. It was during this time that their daughter Rebecca first met her future husband, Marshall. There were reportedly two instances of healing, which Roberts would later look back on as his first realization that he was approaching \"my hour.\"\n\nRoberts' ministry gained momentum in the 1950s, and he became known for his faith-healing revivals. He would hold large gatherings, where people would come to seek healing and to receive spiritual guidance. His emphasis on the importance of giving to God was also a key aspect of his ministry. He believed that God required his followers to give generously, and that this giving would be rewarded in the form of spiritual blessings and financial prosperity.\n\n## Television Ministry\n\nIn the 1950s, Roberts began to use television as a means of spreading his message. He was one of the first televangelists, and his shows were broadcast nationally. He would often appear on television, preaching and performing faith healings. His television ministry was incredibly successful, and he became one of the most popular televangelists of his time.\n\nRoberts' television shows were often spectacular and theatrical, featuring elaborate sets and lighting. He would often appear on stage, surrounded by his followers, who would be seated in the audience. He would preach and sing, and would often perform faith healings, where he would pray for the sick and the afflicted. His shows were often broadcast live, and he would often take donations during the broadcasts.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nRoberts was married to Evelyn Lutman Fahnestock for 66 years, until her death in 2005. They had three children together: daughter Rebecca Nash, who died in an airplane crash in 1977; son Ronald Roberts, who died by suicide in 1982; and son Richard, who is an evangelist and former president of Oral Roberts University. Roberts was also a grandfather and great-grandfather.\n\nRoberts was a prolific writer, and published several books on spirituality and faith. He was also a talented musician, and recorded several albums of gospel music. He was a charismatic leader, and his followers loved and admired him. He was a complex figure, and his ministry was not without controversy. However, he remains one of the most influential and iconic figures in American Christian history.\n\n## Later Life and Death\n\nIn the 1990s, Roberts' health began to decline, and he suffered a series of strokes. He was forced to retire from his ministry, and his son Richard took over as president of Oral Roberts University. Roberts died on December 15, 2009, at the age of 91, at his home in Newport Beach, California. He was buried in the Memorial Park Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\n## Legacy\n\nOral Roberts was a larger-than-life figure, and his legacy continues to be felt today. He was a pioneering televangelist, and his ministry helped to spread Christianity to a wider audience. He was a charismatic leader, and his followers loved and admired him. He was a prolific writer, and his books on spirituality and faith continue to be popular. He was a talented musician, and his albums of gospel music remain popular. He was a complex figure, and his ministry was not without controversy. However, he remains one of the most influential and iconic figures in American Christian history.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Oral Roberts University\n* Charismatic movement\n* Televangelism\n* Faith healing\n* Christianity in the United States\n\n## Further Reading\n\n* Oral Roberts, \"The Miracle of Faith\"\n* Oral Roberts, \"The Works of God\"\n* Oral Roberts, \"The Power of Prayer\"\n* Oral Roberts, \"The Gift of Tongues\"\n* Nancy C.

{"title": "Deathstroke", "content": "\nPublication history\nDeathstroke the Terminator was created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez, and made his first appearance in The New Teen Titans #2 in December 1980.\n\n\nFictional character biography\nSlade Wilson was 16 years old when he enlisted in the United States Army, having lied about his age After participation in the Korean War, he was assigned to Camp Washington where he had been promoted to the rank of major In the early 1960s, he met Captain Adeline Kane, who was tasked with training young soldiers in new fighting techniques in anticipation of brewing troubles taking place in Vietnam Kane was amazed at how skilled Slade was and how quickly he adapted to modern conventions of warfare She immediately fell in love with him and realized that he was without a doubt the most able-bodied combatant that she had ever encountered She offered to privately train Slade in guerrilla warfare In less than a year, Slade mastered every fighting form presented to him and was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel Six months later, Adeline and he were married and she became pregnant with their first child The war in Vietnam began to escalate and Slade was shipped overseas In the war, his unit massacred a village, an event which sickened him He was also rescued by SAS member Wintergreen, to whom he would later return the favor.\n\n\nThe Teen Titans\nSlade has a long history as an enemy of the Teen Titans, beginning when his other son Grant received superhuman enhancements from the H.I.V.E., dubbed himself Ravager, and accepted a contract from them to kill or capture the Teen Titans [5] However, Grant's enhancements proved fatal, and Slade agreed to complete the contract His first mission involved stealing the element Promethium from S.T.A.R Labs and selling it as the ultimate weapon He then kidnapped the Titans and placed them in the path of a Promethium bomb to test his device for the buyers, effectively killing two birds with one stone The Titans escaped and pursued Deathstroke, but he severely wounded Beast Boy in his escape This would be the start to a lasting animosity between the two.\n\n\nThe Judas Contract\nDuring The Judas Contract, the Titans eventually entrusted Terra with all of their secret identities Once Slade had this information, he used it to systematically subdue each of the Titans, exploiting them at their weakest moments Donna Troy was gassed at her photo studio, Changeling was anesthetized with tainted envelopes while responding to fan mail, Victor Stone was electrically shocked by a chair in his own apartment, Koriand'r was ambushed with a device that affected her powers, and Raven was taken down by Terra herself Nightwing was last to be attacked and he was confronted by Deathstroke himself He avoided being captured and soon discovered that his teammates had already been taken Nightwing arrived at Titans Tower to discover Slade's ex-wife and son She told Nightwing that Terra was a traitor, how each of his teammates were captured, and related the origin of Deathstroke.\n\n\nTitans Plague\nMonths later, Slade encountered the Titans again while they were investigating mysterious attacks and disappearances Donna Troy is attacked by a group of strange beastmen and barely survives the encounter Meanwhile, while attending a fundraiser with his father, Gar Logan recognizes Slade trying to maintain a low profile When he finally catches up with Slade, he finds him about to kill the host of the fundraiser, Walter Lanier He stops Deathstroke, but is surprised when Lanier turns into a bat-like creature and flies away Slade reveals to the Titans that he was responsible for smuggling the drug the bestiamorphs were using to transform others, but did not realize what it was until it was too late After Jericho and Raven were stricken by the plague, he aided them in destroying the beastmen and finding a cure for the contagion.\n\n\nTitans Hunt\nShortly after this, he came to the Titans' assistance again during the Titans Hunt storyline The members of the Titans, as well as many inactive members, all disappeared in a manner very similar to how they were abducted during the Judas Contract Mento, an on-and-off member of the Doom Patrol, hires Deathstroke to find the missing Titans He eventually discovers with Nightwing that the abductions were the work of the Wildebeest Society, and that their leader was none other than Titans member Jericho, Deathstroke's son.\n\n\nFamily business\nAfter Slade foiled an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, he was subsequently framed for the murder of a U.S Senator The man responsible had taken on the identity of the Ravager and was hunting down Slade's friends and loved ones Eventually, with the help of the Titans and Sarge Steel, Slade was able to prove his innocence and the true culprit was revealed to be Steve Dayton, under the alias of the Crime Lord, who had again succumbed to mental instability caused by his Mento helmet.\n\n\nNightwing and Birds of Prey\nDeathstroke appeared in Nightwing (vol 2) #23 as a mercenary against Black Canary and Conner Hawke as part of the \"Brotherhood of the Fist\" tie-in to the No Man's Land story arc [8]\n\n\nIdentity Crisis\nIn the Identity Crisis miniseries, Deathstroke was enlisted as a bodyguard for Doctor Light, who was being pursued by the Justice League of America as a suspect in the murder of Sue Dibny In the ensuing battle, Deathstroke nearly beat the team of Elongated Man, Flash, Zatanna, Hawkman, Green Arrow, Black Canary, Atom and Green Lantern He systematically took out every member except for Rayner, whom he had the potential to disable through trying to usurp his ring's energies using his own formidable willpower But before the outcome of this conflict with Green Lantern ended, Green Arrow stuck an arrow in Deathstroke's right eye socket, enraging him Slade went ballistic, which derailed his pre-planned strategy and began to beat Green Arrow, but was stopped when the majority of the team tackled Deathstroke to the ground Dr Light used his powers to allow the two to escape Near the end of Identity Crisis, Deathstroke confronts Green Arrow on a rooftop Arrow sees his reflection in the windows of a nearby building, but when he turns to confront Slade, Deathstroke is gone Instead, Green Arrow finds Slade's cowl and a note stuck to the wall by the very arrow he stabbed in Slade's eye socket The note reads \"This is yours – we're not done.\"\n\n\nInfinite Crisis\nDeathstroke was a founding member of Lex Luthor's Secret Society of Super Villains in the Infinite Crisis storyline He was seen in Infinite Crisis #1, hiding in a warehouse south of Metropolis waiting to ambush the Freedom Fighters with several other members The battle did not last long, and by the end, Deathstroke had killed the Phantom Lady Slade is also the one who landed the final stroke on Uncle Sam by shooting him in the back (and leading to his apparent death) [4]\n\n\nOne Year Later\nSlade appears in the Green Arrow series after the one year jump in DC Comics' storylines Apparently in hiding, he nearly murders a crony of several Star City businessmen who want to hire him for a murder Before finishing his violent refusal, he asks the name of the target When informed that it was to be the mayor of Star City, Oliver Queen (whom Deathstroke knows is secretly Green Arrow), he spares the lackey and decides to take the job [9]\n\n\nBlackest Night\nIn the Teen Titans (vol 3) tie-in to the Blackest Night crossover event, Deathstroke is living in the deceased Wintergreen's house and reading his journal, when he is attacked by Rose again During the fight, the two are

possession Deathstroke subsequently betrays and kills the Alpha Dogs, enraged by the notion that his employers feel that he is unable to accomplish his tasks alone Deathstroke then begins to take on increasingly dangerous missions in an effort to prove his worth, but is also spurred on by the contents of the suitcase he retrieved from Bode – namely the mask and knife belonging to his son Grant, both of which were stained with fresh blood, indicating that he may be still alive [31] During this time, Deathstroke is pursued by a new villain known as Legacy [32] Deathstroke kills Legacy, but

him a slowed aging process and extended longevity, in addition to a resistance to toxins [53] [54] [55] [56] While Deathstroke was originally stated to be able to use up to 90% of his brain's capacity, it was later clarified that his brain processes information nine times more efficiently than an ordinary human's [54] [55] [53] Deathstroke also has an eidetic memory and has been described

"**Deathstroke**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDeathstroke, also known as Slade Wilson, is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez, the character first appeared in The New Teen Titans #2 in December 1980. Deathstroke is one of the most iconic and complex villains in the DC Universe, known for his intelligence, strategic thinking, and fighting skills.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nDeathstroke was created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez, and made his first appearance in The New Teen Titans #2 in December 1980. The character was initially introduced as a mercenary and assassin, but his backstory and personality were later developed in subsequent issues.\n\n**Fictional Character Biography**\n\nSlade Wilson was 16 years old when he enlisted in the United States Army, having lied about his age. After participating in the Korean War, he was assigned to Camp Washington, where he was promoted to the rank of major. In the early 1960s, he met Captain Adeline Kane, who was tasked with training young soldiers in new fighting techniques in anticipation of brewing troubles taking place in Vietnam. Kane was amazed at how skilled Slade was and how quickly he adapted to modern conventions of warfare. She immediately fell in love with him and realized that he was without a doubt the most able-bodied combatant that she had ever encountered. She offered to privately train Slade in guerrilla warfare, and in less than a year, he mastered every fighting form presented to him and was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\nSix months later, Adeline and Slade were married, and she became pregnant with their first child. The war in Vietnam began to escalate, and Slade was shipped overseas. During the war, his unit massacred a village, an event which sickened him. He was also rescued by SAS member Wintergreen, to whom he would later return the favor.\n\n**The Teen Titans**\n\nSlade has a long history as an enemy of the Teen Titans, beginning when his other son Grant received superhuman enhancements from the H.I.V.E., dubbed himself Ravager, and accepted a contract from them to kill or capture the Teen Titans. However, Grant's enhancements proved fatal, and Slade agreed to complete the contract. His first mission involved stealing the element Promethium from S.T.A.R. Labs and selling it as the ultimate weapon. He then kidnapped the Titans and placed them in the path of a Promethium bomb to test his device for the buyers, effectively killing two birds with one stone.\n\nThe Titans escaped and pursued Deathstroke, but he severely wounded Beast Boy in his escape. This would be the start to a lasting animosity between the two.\n\n**The Judas Contract**\n\nDuring The Judas Contract, the Titans eventually entrusted Terra with all of their secret identities. Once Slade had this information, he used it to systematically subdue each of the Titans, exploiting them at their weakest moments. Donna Troy was gassed at her photo studio, Changeling was anesthetized with tainted envelopes while responding to fan mail, Victor Stone was electrically shocked by a chair in his own apartment, Koriand'r was ambushed with a device that affected her powers, and Raven was taken down by Terra herself. Nightwing was last to be attacked and he was confronted by Deathstroke himself.\n\nHe avoided being captured and soon discovered that his teammates had already been taken. Nightwing arrived at Titans Tower to discover Slade's ex-wife and son, who told him that Terra was a traitor and related the origin of Deathstroke.\n\n**Titans Plague**\n\nMonths later, Slade encountered the Titans again while they were investigating mysterious attacks and disappearances. Donna Troy was attacked by a group of strange beastmen and barely survived the encounter. Meanwhile, while attending a fundraiser with his father, Gar Logan recognized Slade trying to maintain a low profile. When he finally caught up with Slade, he found him about to kill the host of the fundraiser, Walter Lanier. He stopped Deathstroke, but was surprised when Lanier turned into a bat-like creature and flew away.\n\nSlade revealed to the Titans that he was responsible for smuggling the drug the beastmen were using to transform others, but did not realize what it was until it was too late. After Jericho and Raven were stricken by the plague, he aided them in destroying the beastmen and finding a cure for the contagion.\n\n**Titans Hunt**\n\nShortly after this, he came to the Titans' assistance again during the Titans Hunt storyline. The members of the Titans, as well as many inactive members, all disappeared in a manner very similar to how they were abducted during the Judas Contract. Mento, an on-and-off member of the Doom Patrol, hired Deathstroke to find the missing Titans. He eventually discovered with Nightwing that the abductions were the work of the Wildebeest Society, and that their leader was none other than Titans member Jericho, Deathstroke's son.\n\n**Family Business**\n\nAfter Slade foiled an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, he was subsequently framed for the murder of a U.S Senator. The man responsible had taken on the identity of the Ravager and was hunting down Slade's friends and loved ones. Eventually, with the help of the Titans and Sarge Steel, Slade was able to prove his innocence and the true culprit was revealed to be Steve Dayton, under the alias of the Crime Lord, who had again succumbed to mental instability caused by his Mento helmet.\n\n**Nightwing and Birds of Prey**\n\nDeathstroke appeared in Nightwing (vol 2) #23 as a mercenary against Black Canary and Conner Hawke as part of the \"Brotherhood of the Fist\" tie-in to the No Man's Land story arc.\n\n**Identity Crisis**\n\nIn the Identity Crisis miniseries, Deathstroke was enlisted as a bodyguard for Doctor Light, who was being pursued by the Justice League of America as a suspect in the murder of Sue Dibny. In the ensuing battle, Deathstroke nearly beat the team of Elongated Man, Flash, Zatanna, Hawkman, Green Arrow, Black Canary, Atom and Green Lantern. He systematically took out every member except for Rayner, whom he had the potential to disable through trying to usurp his ring's energies using his own formidable willpower.\n\nHowever, before the outcome of this conflict with Green Lantern ended, Green Arrow stuck an arrow in Deathstroke's right eye socket, enraging him. Slade went ballistic, which derailed his pre-planned strategy and began to beat Green Arrow, but was stopped when the majority of the team tackled Deathstroke to the ground. Dr. Light used his powers to allow the two to escape.\n\nNear the end of Identity Crisis, Deathstroke confronts Green Arrow on a rooftop. Arrow sees his reflection in the windows of a nearby building, but when he turns to confront Slade, Deathstroke is gone. Instead, Green Arrow finds Slade's cowl and a note stuck to the wall by the very arrow he stabbed in Slade's eye socket. The note reads \"This is yours – we're not done.\"\n\n**Infinite Crisis**\n\nDeathstroke was a founding member of Lex Luthor's Secret Society of Super Villains in the Infinite Crisis storyline. He was seen in Infinite Crisis #1, hiding in a warehouse south of Metropolis waiting to ambush the Freedom Fighters with several other members. The battle did not last long, and by the end, Deathstroke had killed the Phantom Lady. He is also the one who landed the final stroke on Uncle Sam by shooting him in the back (and leading to his apparent death).\n\n**One Year Later**\n\nSlade appears in the Green Arrow series after the one year jump in DC Comics' storylines. Apparently in hiding, he nearly murders a crony of several Star City businessmen who want to hire him for a murder. Before finishing his violent refusal, he asks the name of the target. When informed that it was to be the mayor of Star City, Oliver Queen (whom Deathstroke knows is secretly Green Arrow), he spares the lackey and decides to take the job.\n\n**Blackest Night**\n\nIn the Teen Titans (vol 3) tie-in to the Blackest Night crossover event, Deathstroke is living in the deceased Wintergreen's house and reading his journal, when he is attacked by Rose again. During the fight, the two are attacked by their deceased relatives Grant, Wade, and Adeline, who, along with Wintergreen, have all been reanimated as Black Lanterns. Deathstroke and Rose are forced to work together and fight for their lives against the Black Lanterns.\n\n**Batman and Robin**\n\nRecently, Deathstroke has been seen working with Talia al Ghul, controlling the body and physical actions of the current Robin to kill the recent Batman. Deathstroke is able to control Robin's actions, thanks to a neural-implant inserted into Robin's spine by his mother while it was being surgically replaced. Batman defeats Deathstroke by taking advantage of the two-way connection between him and Robin by using a taser on Robin, the resulting electric shock overwhelming Deathstroke's enhanced senses. He then tracks Slade down and attacks him in his hospital bed for controlling Robin and for the Chemo attack, informing Slade that what happened then is just a 'trailer' for what he will do later.\n\n**Titans: Villains for Hire**\n\nFollowing the encounter with the Black Lanterns, Deathstroke recruits a team of supervillains consisting of Tattooed Man, Cheshire, Osiris, and the new character Cinder following the launch of Brightest Day. The team ambushes Ryan Choi in his home, and then battles him. This ends with Deathstroke driving his sword through Ryan's chest, killing him. He then gives the deceased hero's body to Dwarfstar.\n\n**The New 52**\n\nIn 2011, \"The New 52\" rebooted the DC universe. Deathstroke is known as a top mercenary around the world. Deathstroke is hired by a man named Cristoph for a mission that forces him to work with a team of younger mercenaries known as the Alpha Dogs. Their target is Jeffrey Bode, an arms dealer traveling on a plane. After discovering that the weapons Bode is trafficking are clones of the villain Clayface, Deathstroke and the other mercenaries are able to dispatch them, killing Bode in the process and retrieving a suitcase he had in his possession. Deathstroke subsequently betrays and kills the Alpha Dogs, enraged by the notion that his employers feel that he is unable to accomplish his tasks alone. Deathstroke then begins to take on increasingly dangerous missions in an effort to prove his worth, but is also spurred on by the contents of the suitcase he retrieved from Bode – namely the mask and knife belonging to his son Grant, both of which were stained with fresh blood, indicating that he may be still alive. During this time, Deathstroke is pursued by a new villain known as Legacy.\n\nHowever, it is later revealed that Legacy is a series of identical versions of the same villain, all of whom are working to take down Deathstroke. It turns out that the parents of one of the Alpha Dog members have hired multiple mercenaries to kill Deathstroke, all donning the green and purple color. Deathstroke tracks them down, but is confronted by his son Grant, who has grown up to become a better warrior than him. Although Deathstroke manages to kill both the parents, Grant defeats him, claiming superiority over Deathstroke. Grant is about to finish Slade, but he hesitates, and leaves. Recovering from his injuries, Grant takes another contract, Slade is happy that his son has become a better warrior than him, and then visits his father's hospital bed to mention that he has grown up to be a greater man than him.\n\n**Origins**\n\nDeathstroke's altered origin is introduced in Deathstroke (vol 2) #0. The fact that he participated in the military at 16 and met Adeline has not changed. Already a legend in the army, Slade was drafted into Team 7 and went on many missions. In one mission, Slade was gravely injured and had to undergo an operation that enhanced his abilities, making him virtually a superhuman. After this, he married Adeline and had two sons, Grant and Joseph. Around this time, Slade received intel that his best friend, Wintergreen, was caught in Somalia. He donned a mask and flew to Somalia to rescue Wintergreen, slaughtering all the captors. Deathstroke the Terminator was born. As his fame grew, his enemies did too. An attack targeting his house seemingly killed Joseph and Adeline. With evidence that the attack was from North Korea, Slade killed a group of North Korean soldiers, but lost his right eye in the process. It is later shown that Joseph and Adeline are still alive.\n\n**Team 7**\n\nFive years before taking the contract from Harvest, before taking the name Deathstroke, Slade once operated with Team 7. With metahuman threats rising, The Majestic Project, a plan to control future metahuman threats, was devised by John Lynch. And to secure the project, Team 7 was created and Slade was recruited. The first mission was retrieving the Eclipso Gem, where Slade was possessed by Eclipso and Alex Fairchild had to drive a sword through his chest to save him. Their next mission site is the Advanced Prosthetic Research Center Dr. Henshaw is tasked into reactivating the android Spartan. But the Spartan Subject is activated, infecting everyone in the center to be turned into mindless cyborgs, including Caitlin Fairchild. Team 7 is sent to the spot Pilot Summer Ramos is killed by a cyborg. The team breaks into the facility, intending to bottleneck them. Caitlin appears out from a door Relieved to see his daughter, Alex Fairchild rushes to her and hugs her, but actually infected, Caitlin stabs her father to death. In a fit of rage, Slade chases after her and dispatches her. Then from behind, Henshaw, temporarily free of the Spartan virus, explained that this was a distraction by the Spartan Subject to target agent James Bronson, currently at his home. A Spartan cyborg breaks into his apartment, and attacks, activating Majestic. Majestic actually turns out to be agent Bronson's Gen-factor, which was activated when the Kaizen, the dictator of the island nation of Gamorra, sent the cyborg to trigger the Majestic Persona. It is later explained by Lynch that another purpose of Team 7 was to activate potential metagenes in the agents to create powerful human weapons, which would make America invincible to other nations. Agents like Slade, Dinah Drake, and Cole Cash had gained their metahuman abilities by Lynch.\n\n**Forever Evil**\n\nDuring the \"Forever Evil\" storyline, Steve Trevor encounters Deathstroke, Copperhead, and Shadow Thief at the White House when he is looking for the President. Later, the party turns up in Wayne Industries with Power Ring to fight Batman, Lex Luthor, and other heroes and villains who are against the Crime Syndicate. Deathstroke has Lex Luthor's life in his hands, but Lex Luthor persuades him that it will do him no good if the Syndicate takes over the Earth. Slade has a change of mind and shoots Copperhead in the head, killing him. After they defeat the rest of the gang, Deathstroke remarks that Lex Luthor ought to pay him a big fat check after this is over. Deathstroke then joins Batman and Luthor in the battle against the syndicate. He is seen battling Deathstorm when the Syndicate attacks the fallen watchtower. The syndicate later retreats when they find out that Alexander Luthor has been freed. Deathstroke witnesses the only \"hero\" from Earth-Three kill Deathstorm and steal his abilities. Alexander Luthor then attacks Deathstroke, shattering his helmet while he lets out a string of obscenities directed at Luthor.\n\n**DC Rebirth**\n\n\"DC Rebirth\" is a comic book publishing initiative launched by DC Comics in May 2016. It was designed to be a relaunch of the entire DC Comics line, following the conclusion of the \"New 52\" era that began in 2011. DC Rebirth aimed to bring back many of the classic elements and characters that had been missing or altered during the New 52 era, while also introducing new storylines and characters. The initiative featured a mix of ongoing series and limited series, with some series continuing from the New 52 era and others starting fresh with new creative teams.\n\n**Infinite Frontier**\n\nDeathstroke teamed up with Black Canary to work with an organization called T.R.U.S.T. They both realized that the organization was led by Secret Society of Super Villains, and Deathstroke kicks Black Canary out to take control of it, naming it Deathstroke Inc. He meets Rose Wilson and Respawn, a boy made from his and Talia's DNA who resembled Damian Wayne. He was framed for Ra's al Ghul's murder by Geo-Force who wanted revenge on Talia and Deathstroke. During the conflict, Deathstroke is killed by Talia Al Ghul but is resurrected by his followers using a Lazarus Pit.\n\n**Powers and Abilities**\n\nSlade Wilson was given an experimental super-soldier serum that increased his physical and mental abilities to superhuman levels, granting him enhanced strength, speed, stamina, agility, durability, reflexes, and senses. Deathstroke also possesses a healing factor that allows him to recover from injuries at an accelerated rate.

he had been promoted to the rank of major In the early 1960s, he met Captain Adeline Kane, who was tasked with training young soldiers in new fighting techniques in anticipation of brewing troubles taking place in Vietnam Kane was amazed at how skilled Slade was and how quickly he adapted to modern conventions of warfare She immediately fell in love with him and realized that he was without a doubt the most able-bodied combatant that she had ever encountered She offered to privately train Slade in guerrilla warfare In less than a year, Slade mastered every fighting form presented to him and was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel Six months later, Adeline and he were married and she became pregnant with their first child The war in Vietnam began to escalate and Slade was shipped overseas In the war, his unit massacred a village, an event which sickened him He was also rescued by SAS member Wintergreen, to whom he would later return the favor.\n\n\nThe Teen Titans\nSlade has a long history as an enemy of the Teen Titans, beginning when his other son Grant received superhuman enhancements from the H.I.V.E., dubbed himself Ravager, and accepted a contract from them to kill or capture the Teen Titans [5] However, Grant's enhancements proved fatal, and Slade agreed to complete the contract His first mission involved stealing the element Promethium from S.T.A.R Labs and selling it as the ultimate weapon He then kidnapped the Titans and placed them in the path of a Promethium bomb to test his device for the buyers, effectively killing two birds with one stone The Titans escaped and pursued Deathstroke, but he severely wounded Beast Boy in his escape This would be the start to a lasting animosity between the two.\n\n\nThe Judas Contract\nDuring The Judas Contract, the Titans eventually entrusted Terra with all of their secret identities Once Slade had this information, he used it to systematically subdue each of the Titans, exploiting them at their weakest moments Donna Troy was gassed at her photo studio, Changeling was anesthetized with tainted envelopes while responding to fan mail, Victor Stone was electrically shocked by a chair in his own apartment, Koriand'r was ambushed with a device that affected her powers, and Raven was taken down by Terra herself Nightwing was last to be attacked and he was confronted by Deathstroke himself He avoided being captured and soon discovered that his teammates had already been taken Nightwing arrived at Titans Tower to discover Slade's ex-wife and son She told Nightwing that Terra was a traitor, how each of his teammates were captured, and related the origin of Deathstroke.\n\n\nTitans Plague\nMonths later, Slade encountered the Titans again while they were investigating mysterious attacks and disappearances Donna Troy is attacked by a group of strange beastmen and barely survives the encounter Meanwhile, while attending a fundraiser with his father, Gar Logan recognizes Slade trying to maintain a low profile When he finally catches up with Slade, he finds him about to kill the host of the fundraiser, Walter Lanier He stops Deathstroke, but is surprised when Lanier turns into a bat-like creature and flies away Slade reveals to the Titans that he was responsible for smuggling the drug the bestiamorphs were using to transform others, but did not realize what it was until it was too late After Jericho and Raven were stricken by the plague, he aided them in destroying the beastmen and finding a cure for the contagion.\n\n\nTitans Hunt\nShortly after this, he came to the Titans' assistance again during the Titans Hunt storyline The members of the Titans, as well as many inactive members, all disappeared in a manner very similar to how they were abducted during the Judas Contract Mento, an on-and-off member of the Doom Patrol, hires Deathstroke to find the missing Titans He eventually discovers with Nightwing that the abductions were the work of the Wildebeest Society, and that their leader was none other than Titans member Jericho, Deathstroke's son.\n\n\nFamily business\nAfter Slade foiled an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, he was subsequently framed for the murder of a U.S Senator The man responsible had taken on the identity of the Ravager and was hunting down Slade's friends and loved ones Eventually, with the help of the Titans and Sarge Steel, Slade was able to prove his innocence and the true culprit was revealed to be Steve Dayton, under the alias of the Crime Lord, who had again succumbed to mental instability caused by his Mento helmet.\n\n\nNightwing and Birds of Prey\nDeathstroke appeared in Nightwing (vol 2) #23 as a mercenary against Black Canary and Conner Hawke as part of the \"Brotherhood of the Fist\" tie-in to the No Man's Land story arc [8]\n\n\nIdentity Crisis\nIn the Identity Crisis miniseries, Deathstroke was enlisted as a bodyguard for Doctor Light, who was being pursued by the Justice League of America as a suspect in the murder of Sue Dibny In the ensuing battle, Deathstroke nearly beat the team of Elongated Man, Flash, Zatanna, Hawkman, Green Arrow, Black Canary, Atom and Green Lantern He systematically took out every member except for Rayner, whom he had the potential to disable through trying to usurp his ring's energies using his own formidable willpower But before the outcome of this conflict with Green Lantern ended, Green Arrow stuck an arrow in Deathstroke's right eye socket, enraging him Slade went ballistic, which derailed his pre-planned strategy and began to beat Green Arrow, but was stopped when the majority of the team tackled Deathstroke to the ground Dr Light used his powers to allow the two to escape Near the end of Identity Crisis, Deathstroke confronts Green Arrow on a rooftop Arrow sees his reflection in the windows of a nearby building, but when he turns to confront Slade, Deathstroke is gone Instead, Green Arrow finds Slade's cowl and a note stuck to the wall by the very arrow he stabbed in Slade's eye socket The note reads \"This is yours – we're not done.\"\n\n\nInfinite Crisis\nDeathstroke was a founding member of Lex Luthor's Secret Society of Super Villains in the Infinite Crisis storyline He was seen in Infinite Crisis #1, hiding in a warehouse south of Metropolis waiting to ambush the Freedom Fighters with several other members The battle did not last long, and by the end, Deathstroke had killed the Phantom Lady Slade is also the one who landed the final stroke on Uncle Sam by shooting him in the back (and leading to his apparent death) [4]\n\n\nOne Year Later\nSlade appears in the Green Arrow series after the one year jump in DC Comics' storylines Apparently in hiding, he nearly murders a crony of several Star City businessmen who want to hire him for a murder Before finishing his violent refusal, he asks the name of the target When informed that it was to be the mayor of Star City, Oliver Queen (whom Deathstroke knows is secretly Green Arrow), he spares the lackey and decides to take the job [9]\n\n\nBlackest Night\nIn the Teen Titans (vol 3) tie-in to the Blackest Night crossover event, Deathstroke is living in the deceased Wintergreen's house and reading his journal, when he is attacked by Rose again During the fight, the two are attacked by their deceased relatives Grant, Wade, and Adeline, who, along with Wintergreen, have all been reanimated as Black Lanterns Deathstroke and Rose are forced to work together and fight for their lives against the Black Lanterns [16]\n\n\nBatman and Robin\nRecently, Deathstroke has been seen working with Talia al Ghul, controlling the body and physical actions of the current Robin to kill the recent Batman Deathstroke is able to control Robin's actions, thanks to a neural-implant inserted into Robin's spine by his mother while it was being surgically replaced Batman defeats Deathstroke by taking advantage of the two-way connection between him and Robin by using a taser on Robin, the resulting electric shock overwhelming Deathstroke's enhanced senses He then tracks Slade down and attacks him in his hospital bed for controlling Robin and for the Chemo attack, informing Slade that what happened then is just a 'trailer' for what he will do later [18]\n\n\nTitans: Villains for Hire\nFollowing the encounter with the Black Lanterns, Deathstroke recruits a team of supervillains consisting of Tattooed Man, Cheshire, Osiris, and the new character Cinder following the launch of Brightest Day The team ambushes Ryan Choi in his home, and then battles him This ends with Deathstroke driving his sword through Ryan's chest, killing him He then gives the deceased hero's body to Dwarfstar [19]\n\n\nThe New 52\nIn 2011, \"The New 52\" rebooted the DC universe Deathstroke is known as a top mercenary around the world [30] Deathstroke is hired by a man named Cristoph for a mission that forces him to work with a team of younger mercenaries known as the Alpha Dogs Their target is Jeffrey Bode, an arms dealer traveling on a plane After discovering that the weapons Bode is trafficking are clones of the villain Clayface, Deathstroke and the other mercenaries are able to dispatch them, killing Bode in the process and retrieving a suitcase he had in his possession Deathstroke subsequently betrays and kills the Alpha Dogs, enraged by the notion that his employers feel that he is unable to accomplish his tasks alone Deathstroke then begins to take on increasingly dangerous missions in an effort to prove his worth, but is also spurred on by the contents of the suitcase he retrieved from Bode – namely the mask and knife belonging to his son Grant, both of which were stained with fresh blood, indicating that he may be still alive [31] During this time, Deathstroke is pursued by a new villain known as Legacy [32] Deathstroke kills Legacy, but another Legacy, donning the same colors as the last one, appears again and again It turns out the parents of one of the Alpha Dog members have hired multiple mercenaries to kill Deathstroke, all donning the green and purple color, to get revenge on him Deathstroke tracks them down, but is confronted by his son Grant It is revealed that all of this has been a plot to lure Deathstroke to him Although Deathstroke manages to kill both the parents, Grant defeats him, claiming superiority over Deathstroke Grant is about to finish Slade, but he hesitates, and leaves Recovering from his injuries, Grant takes another contract, Slade is happy that his son has become a better warrior than him, and then visits his father's hospital bed to mention that he has grown up to be a greater man than him.\n\n\nOrigins\nDeathstroke's altered origin is introduced in Deathstroke (vol 2) #0 The fact that he participated in the military at 16 and met Adeline has not changed Already a legend in the army, Slade was drafted into Team 7 and went on many missions In one mission, Slade was gravely injured and had to undergo an operation that enhanced his abilities, making him virtually a superhuman After this, he married Adeline and had two sons, Grant and Joseph Around this time, Slade received intel that his best friend, Wintergreen, was caught in Somalia He donned a mask and flew to Somalia to rescue Wintergreen, slaughtering all the captors Deathstroke the Terminator was born As his fame grew, his enemies did too An attack targeting his house seemingly killed Joseph and Adeline With evidence that the attack was from North Korea, Slade killed a group of North Korean soldiers, but lost his right eye in the process It is later shown that Joseph and Adeline are still alive.\n\n\nTeam 7\nFive years before taking the contract from Harvest, before taking the name Deathstroke, Slade once operated with Team 7 With metahuman threats rising, The Majestic Project, a plan to control future metahuman threats, was devised by John Lynch And to secure the project, Team 7 was created and Slade was recruited The first mission was retrieving the Eclipso Gem, where Slade was possessed by Eclipso and Alex Fairchild had to drive a sword through his chest to save him Their next mission site is the Advanced Prosthetic Research Center Dr Henshaw is tasked into reactivating the android Spartan But the Spartan Subject is activated, infecting everyone in the center to be turned into mindless cyborgs, including Caitlin Fairchild Team 7 is sent to the spot Pilot Summer Ramos is killed by a cyborg The team breaks into the facility, intending to bottleneck them Caitlin appears out from a door Relieved to see his daughter, Alex Fairchild rushes to her and hugs her, but actually infected, Caitlin stabs her father to death In a fit of rage, Slade chases after her and dispatches her Then from behind, Henshaw, temporarily free of the Spartan virus, explained that this was a distraction by the Spartan Subject to target agent James Bronson, currently at his home A Spartan cyborg breaks into his apartment, and attacks, activating Majestic Majestic actually turns out to be agent Bronson's Gen-factor, which was activated when the Kaizen, the dictator of the island nation of Gamorra, sent the cyborg to trigger the Majestic Persona It is later explained by Lynch that another purpose of Team 7 was to activate potential metagenes in the agents to create powerful human weapons, which would make America invincible to other nations Agents like Slade, Dinah Drake, and Cole Cash had gained their metahuman abilities by Lynch Bronson was planned to be Majestic, but the activation of the gene just then had been unexpected.\n\n\nForever Evil\nDuring the \"Forever Evil\" storyline, Steve Trevor encounters Deathstroke, Copperhead, and Shadow Thief at the White House when he is looking for the President [33] Later, the party turns up in Wayne Industries with Power Ring to fight Batman, Lex Luthor, and other heroes and villains who are against the Crime Syndicate Deathstroke has Lex Luthor's life in his hands, but Lex Luthor persuades him that it will do him no good if the Syndicate takes over the Earth Slade has a change of mind and shoots Copperhead in the head, killing him After they defeat the rest of the gang, Deathstroke remarks that Lex Luthor ought to pay him a big fat check after this is over [34] Deathstroke then joins Batman and Luthor in the battle against the syndicate he is seen battling Deathstorm when the Syndicate attacks the fallen watchtower The syndicate later retreats when they find out that Alexander Luthor has been freed Deathstroke witnesses the only \"hero\" from Earth-Three kill Deathstorm and steal his abilities Alexander Luthor then attacks Deathstroke, shattering his helmet while he lets out a string of obscenities directed at Luthor.\n\n\nDC Rebirth\n\"DC Rebirth\" is a comic book publishing initiative launched by DC Comics in May 2016 It was designed to be a relaunch of the entire DC Comics line, following the conclusion of the \"New 52\" era that began in 2011 DC Rebirth aimed to bring back many of the classic elements and characters that had been missing or altered during the New 52 era, while also introducing new storylines and characters The initiative featured a mix of ongoing series and limited series, with some series continuing from the New 52 era and others starting fresh with new creative teams.\n\n\nInfinite Frontier\nDeathstroke teamed up with Black Canary to work with an organization called T.R.U.S.T They both realized that the organization was led by Secret Society of Super Villains and Deathstroke kicks Black Canary out to take control of it, naming it Deathstroke Inc  [44] He meets Rose Wilson and Respawn, a boy made from his and Talia's DNA who resembled Damian Wayne He was framed for Ra's al Ghul's murder by Geo-Force who wanted revenge on Talia and Deathstroke During the conflict, Deathstroke is killed by Talia Al Ghul but is resurrected by his followers using a Lazarus Pit [45]\n\n\nCharacterization\nChristopher Priest, the writer of Deathstroke's self-titled solo series in DC Rebirth, has said:\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nSlade Wilson was given an experimental super-soldier serum that increased his physical and mental abilities to superhuman levels, granting him enhanced strength, speed, stamina, agility, durability, reflexes, and senses Deathstroke also possesses a healing factor that allows him to recover from injuries at an accelerated rate Despite the fact he has stated he can only heal non-fatal injuries he has shown to heal from have his brains blown out or being shot,impaled and even regrow his own heart  These regenerative abilities have given him a slowed aging process and extended longevity, in addition to a resistance to toxins [53] [54] [55] [56] While Deathstroke was originally stated to be able to use up to 90% of his brain's capacity, it was later clarified that his brain processes information nine times more efficiently than an ordinary human's [54] [55] [53] Deathstroke also has an eidetic memory and has been described as a tactical genius with a strategic mind rivaling that of Batman [57] [58]\n\n\nOther versions\nSlade Wilson / Deathstroke appears in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), portrayed by Joe Manganiello In

{"title": "Hanukkah", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name \"Hanukkah\" derives from the Hebrew verb \"חנך‎\", meaning \"to dedicate\" On Hanukkah, the Maccabean Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple [9] [10]\n\n\nAlternative spellings\nIn Hebrew, the word Hanukkah is written חֲנֻכָּה‎ or חֲנוּכָּה‎ (Ḥănukā) It is most commonly transliterated to English as Hanukkah or Chanukah The spelling Hanukkah, which is based on using characters of the English alphabet as symbols to re-create the word's correct spelling in Hebrew, [14] is the most common [15] and the preferred choice of Merriam–Webster, [16] Collins English Dictionary, the Oxford Style Manual, and the style guides of The New York Times and The Guardian [17] The sound represented by Ch ( [χ], similar to the Scottish pronunciation of loch) is not native to the English language [18] Furthermore, the letter ḥeth (ח‎), which is the first letter in the Hebrew spelling, is pronounced differently in modern Hebrew (voiceless uvular fricative) from in classical Hebrew (voiceless pharyngeal fricative  [ħ]), and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in English spelling However, its original sound is closer to the English H than to the Scottish Ch, and Hanukkah more accurately represents the spelling in the Hebrew alphabet [14] Moreover, the 'kaf' consonant is geminate in classical (but not modern) Hebrew Adapting the classical Hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal Ḥeth can lead to the spelling Hanukkah, while adapting the modern Hebrew pronunciation with no gemination and uvular Ḥeth leads to the spelling Chanukah [19] [20] [21]\n\n\nFestival of Lights\nIn Modern Hebrew, Hanukkah may also be called the Festival of Lights (חַג הַאוּרִים‎, Ḥag HaUrim), based on a comment by Josephus in Antiquities of the Jews, καὶ ἐξ ἐκείνου μέχρι τοῦ δεῦρο τὴν ἑορτὴν ἄγομεν καλοῦντες αὐτὴν φῶτα \"And from then on we celebrate this festival, and we call it Lights\" The first Hebrew translation of Antiquities (1864) used (חַג הַמְּאֹרוֹת‎) \"Festival of Lamps\", but the translation \"Festival of Lights\" (חַג הַאוּרִים‎) appeared by the end of the nineteenth century [22]\n\n\nHistorical sources\nThe story of Hanukkah is told in the books of the First and Second Maccabees, which describe in detail the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the menorah These books, however, are not a part of the canonized Masoretic Text version of the Tanakh (Hebrew and Aramaic language Jewish Bible) used and accepted by normative Rabbinical Judaism and therefore modern Jews (as copied, edited and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Common Era) However, the books of Maccabees were included among the deuterocanonical books added to the Septuagint, a Jewish scholarly Greek-language translation of the Hebrew Bible originally compiled in the mid-3rd century BCE The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider the books of Maccabees as a canonical part of the Old Testament [23]\n\n\nBooks of Maccabees\nThe story of Hanukkah is told in the books of the First and Second

Greek-language translation of the Hebrew Bible originally compiled in the mid-3rd century BCE The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider the books of Maccabees as a canonical part of the Old Testament [23]\n\n\nEarly rabbinic sources\nMegillat Taanit (1st century) contains a list of festive days on which fasting or eulogizing is forbidden It specifies, \"On the 25th of  [Kislev] is Hanukkah of eight days, and one is not to eulogize\" and then references the story of the rededication of the Temple [29]\n\n\nNarrative of Josephus\nThe Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus narrates in his book, Jewish Antiquities XII, how the victorious Judas Maccabeus ordered lavish yearly eight-day festivities after rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem that had been profaned by Antiochus IV Epiphanes [40] Josephus does not say the festival was called Hanukkah but rather the \"Festival of Lights\":\n\n\nOther ancient sources\nIn the New Testament, John 10:22–23 says, \"Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon's Colonnade\" (NIV) The Greek noun used appears in the neuter plural as \"the renewals\" or \"the consecrations\" (‹See Tfd›Greek: τὰ ἐγκαίνια; ta enkaínia) [42] The same root appears in 2 Esdras 6:16 in the Septuagint to refer specifically to Hanukkah This Greek word was chosen because the Hebrew word for 'consecration' or 'dedication' is Hanukkah (חנכה) The Aramaic New Testament uses the Aramaic word hawdata (a close synonym), which literally means 'renewal' or 'to make new' [43]\n\n\nHistory\nAfter the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, Judea became part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt until 200 BCE, when King Antiochus III the Great of Syria defeated King Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt at the Battle of Panium Judea then became part of the Seleucid Empire of Syria [44] King Antiochus III the Great, wanting to conciliate his new Jewish subjects, guaranteed their right to \"live according to their ancestral customs\" and to continue to practice their religion in the Temple of Jerusalem [45] The Seleucids, like the Ptolemies before them, held a suzerainty over Judea, where they respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions This policy was drastically reversed by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus III, seemingly after what was either a dispute over leadership of the Temple in Jerusalem and the office of High Priest, or possibly a revolt whose nature was lost to time after being crushed [46] In 175 BCE, Antiochus IV invaded Judea at the request of the sons of Tobias [47] The Tobiads, who led the Hellenizing Jewish faction in Jerusalem, were expelled to Syria around 170 BCE when the high priest Onias and his pro-Egyptian faction wrested control from them The exiled Tobiads lobbied Antiochus IV Epiphanes to recapture Jerusalem As Flavius Josephus relates:\n\n\nBackground\nAfter the death of Alexander the

outlawed In 167 BCE, Antiochus ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple He banned brit milah (circumcision) and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple [49]\n\n\nAcademic sources\nSome modern scholars, following the account in 2 Maccabees, observe that the king was intervening in an internal civil war between the Maccabean Jews and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem [54] [55] [56] [57] These competed violently over who would be the High Priest, with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contesting with Hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like Jason and Menelaus [58] In particular, Jason's Hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of Judaism [59] Other authors point to possible socioeconomic reasons in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war [60]\n\n\nTimeline\nSelected battles between the Maccabees and the Seleucid Syrian-Greeks:\n\n\nBattles of the Maccabean

\"beautification\" (hiddur mitzvah) of the mitzvah, the number of lights lit is increased by one each night [87] An extra light called a shammash, meaning \"attendant\" or \"sexton,\" [88] is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher, lower, or to the side of the others [83]\n\n\nCandle-lighting time\nHanukkah lights should usually burn for at least half an hour after it gets dark [106] Many light at sundown and those who do so should be careful to have enough oil or wax to last until half an hour after dark Most Hasidim and many other communities light later, generally around nightfall [107] Many Hasidic Rebbes light much later to fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights [108]\n\n\nBlessings over the candles\nTypically two blessings (brachot; singular: brachah) are recited during this eight-day festival when lighting the candles On the first night only, the shehecheyanu blessing is added, making a total of three blessings [111]\n\n\nBlessing for lighting the candles\nTransliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner Hanukkah.\n\n\nBlessing for the miracles of Hanukkah\nTransliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, she'asa nisim la'avoteinu ba'yamim ha'heim ba'z'man ha'ze.\n\n\nHanerot Halalu\nAfter the lights are kindled the hymn Hanerot Halalu is recited There are several different versions; the version presented here is recited in many Ashkenazic communities: [114]\n\n\nMaoz Tzur\nIn the Ashkenazi tradition, each night after the lighting of the candles, the hymn Ma'oz Tzur is sung The song contains six stanzas The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in Jewish history, praising God for survival despite these tragedies (the exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian captivity, the miracle of the holiday of Purim, the Hasmonean victory) and expressing a longing for the days when Judea will finally triumph over Rome [115]\n\n\nOther customs\nAfter lighting the candles and Ma'oz Tzur, singing other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes Some Hasidic and Sephardi Jews recite Psalms, such as Psalm 30, Psalm 67, and Psalm 91 In North America and in Israel it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time In addition, many families encourage their children to give tzedakah (charity) in lieu of presents for themselves [117] [118]\n\n\nSpecial additions to daily prayers\n\"We thank You also for the miraculous deeds and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and the saving acts wrought by You, as well as for the wars which You waged for our ancestors in ancient days at this season In the days of the Hasmonean Mattathias, son of Johanan the high priest, and his sons, when the iniquitous Greco-Syrian kingdom rose up against Your people Israel, to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the ordinances of Your will, then You in your abundant mercy rose up for them in the time of their trouble, pled their cause, executed judgment, avenged their wrong, and delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent ones into the hands of those occupied with Your Torah Both unto Yourself did you make a great and holy name in Thy world, and unto Your people did You achieve a great deliverance and redemption Whereupon your children entered the sanctuary of Your house, cleansed Your temple, purified Your sanctuary, kindled lights in Your holy courts, and appointed these eight days of Hanukkah in order to give thanks and praises unto Your holy name.\"\n\n\nZot Hanukkah\nThe last day of Hanukkah is known by some as Zot Hanukkah and by others as Chanukat HaMizbeach, from the verse read on this day in the synagogue Numbers 7:84, Zot Hanukkat Hamizbe'ach: \"This was the dedication of the altar\" According to the teachings of Kabbalah and Hasidism, this day is the final \"seal\" of the High Holiday season of Yom Kippur and is considered a time to repent out of love for God In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other Gmar chatimah tovah (\"may you be sealed totally for good\"), a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers [127]\n\n\nOther related laws and customs\nIt is customary for women not to work for at least the first half-hour of the candles' burning, and some have the custom not to work for the entire time of burning It is also forbidden to fast or to eulogize during Hanukkah [83]\n\n\nHanukkah as the end of the High Holy Days\nSome Hasidic scholars teach that the Hanukkah is in fact the final conclusion of God's judgment extending High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana when humanity is judged and Yom Kippur when the judgment is sealed: [citation needed]\n\n\nCustoms\nHanukkah songs (in Hebrew except where indicated) include \"Ma'oz Tzur\" (Rock of Ages), \"Latke'le Latke'le\" (Yiddish: \"Little Latke, Little Latke\"), \"Hanukkiah Li Yesh\" (\"I Have a Hanukkah Menorah\"), \"Ocho Kandelikas\" (Judeo-Spanish: \"Eight Little Candles\"), \"Kad Katan\" (\"A Small Jug\"), \"S'vivon Sov Sov Sov\" (\"Dreidel, Spin and Spin\"), \"Haneirot Halolu\" (\"These Candles Which We Light\"), \"Mi Yimalel\" (\"Who Can Retell\") and \"Ner Li, Ner Li\" (\"I have a Candle\").\n\n\nMusic\nHanukkah songs (in Hebrew except where indicated) include \"Ma'oz Tzur\" (Rock of Ages), \"Latke'le Latke'le\" (Yiddish: \"Little Latke, Little Latke\"), \"Hanukkiah Li Yesh\" (\"I Have a Hanukkah Menorah\"), \"Ocho Kandelikas\" (Judeo-Spanish: \"Eight Little Candles\"), \"Kad Katan\" (\"A Small Jug\"), \"S'vivon Sov Sov Sov\" (\"Dreidel, Spin and Spin\"), \"Haneirot Halolu\" (\"These Candles Which We Light\"), \"Mi Yimalel\" (\"Who Can Retell\") and \"Ner Li, Ner Li\" (\"I have a Candle\").\n\n\nFoods\nThere is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil (preferably olive oil) to commemorate the miracle of a small flask of oil keeping the Second Temple's Menorah alight for eight days [135] Traditional foods include potato pancakes, known as latkes in Yiddish, especially among Ashkenazi families Sephardi, Polish, and Israeli families eat jam-filled doughnuts (Yiddish: פּאָנטשקעס pontshkes), bimuelos (fritters) and sufganiyot which are deep-fried in oil Italkim and Hungarian Jews traditionally eat cheese pancakes known as \"cassola\" or \"cheese latkes\" [136]\n\n\nDreidel\nAfter lighting the candles, it is customary to play (or spin) the dreidel The dreidel, or sevivon in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with during Hanukkah Each side is imprinted with a Hebrew letter which is an abbreviation for the Hebrew words נס גדול היה שם (Nes Gadol Haya Sham, \"A great miracle happened there\"), referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the Beit Hamikdash The fourth side of some dreidels sold in Israel are inscribed with the letter פ (Pe), rendering the acronym נס גדול היה פה (Nes Gadol Haya Po, \"A great miracle happened here\"), referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of Israel, although this is a relatively recent [when?] innovation Stores in Haredi neighborhoods sell the traditional Shin dreidels as well, because they understand \"there\" to refer to the Temple and not the entire Land of Israel, and because the Hasidic Masters ascribe significance to the traditional letters [145] [146]\n\n\nHanukkah gelt\nChanukkah gelt (Yiddish for \"Chanukkah money\"), known in Israel by the Hebrew translation Hebrew: דְּמֵי חֲנֻכָּה, romanized: dmei Hanukkah, is often distributed to children during the festival of Hanukkah The giving of Hanukkah gelt also adds to the holiday excitement The amount is usually in small coins, although grandparents or relatives may give larger sums The tradition of giving Chanukah gelt dates back to a long-standing East European custom of children presenting their teachers with a small sum of money at this time of year as a token of gratitude One minhag favors the fifth night of Hanukkah for giving Hanukkah gelt [147] Unlike the other nights of Hanukkah, the fifth does not ever fall on the Shabbat, hence never conflicting with the Halachic injunction against handling money on the Shabbat [148]\n\n\nHanukkah in the White House\nThe earliest Hanukkah link with the White House occurred in 1951 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion presented United States President Harry Truman with a Hanukkah menorah In 1979 President Jimmy Carter took part in the first public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony of the National Menorah held across the White House lawn In 1989, President George H W Bush displayed a menorah in the White House In 1993, President Bill Clinton invited a group of schoolchildren to the Oval Office for a small ceremony [97]\n\n\nDates\nThe dates of Hanukkah are determined by the Hebrew calendar Hanukkah begins at the 25th day of Kislev and concludes on the second or third day of Tevet (Kislev can have 29 or 30 days) The Jewish day begins at sunset Hanukkah dates for recent and upcoming:\n\n\nSymbolic importance\nMajor Jewish holidays are those when all forms of work are forbidden, and that feature traditional holiday meals, kiddush, holiday candle-lighting, etc Only biblical holidays fit these criteria, and Chanukah was instituted some two centuries after the Hebrew Bible was completed Nevertheless, though Chanukah is of rabbinic origin, it is traditionally celebrated in a major and very public fashion The requirement to position the menorah, or Chanukiah, at the door or window, symbolizes the desire to give the Chanukah miracle a high-profile [158]\n\n\nModern history\n\"Hanukkah is an ancient holiday, but a modest one The holiday of the Hasmoneans is new, yet it is full of spiritual exaltation and national joy What was

The holiday is observed for eight days, typically in December, and is characterized by the lighting of the Hanukkah menorah, traditional foods, and various customs and traditions.\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"Hanukkah\" derives from the Hebrew verb \"חנך\" (ḥănuk), meaning \"to dedicate.\" On Hanukkah, the Maccabean Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple that had been profaned by Antiochus IV Epiphanes.\n\nAlternative Spellings\nIn Hebrew, the word Hanukkah is written as \"חֲנֻכָּה\" or \"חֲנוּכָּה\" (Ḥănukā). It is most commonly transliterated to English as Hanukkah or Chanukah. The spelling Hanukkah, based on using characters of the English alphabet as symbols to recreate the word's correct spelling in Hebrew, is the most common. This spelling is preferred by Merriam-Webster, Collins English Dictionary, the Oxford Style Manual, and the style guides of The New York Times and The Guardian.\n\nFestival of Lights\nIn Modern Hebrew, Hanukkah may also be called the Festival of Lights (חַג הַאוּרִים, Ḥag HaUrim), based on a comment by Josephus in Antiquities of the Jews. The first Hebrew translation of Antiquities (1864) used \"Festival of Lamps\" (חַג הַמְּאֹרוֹת, Ḥag HaMeroth), but the translation \"Festival of Lights\" (חַג הַאוּרִים, Ḥag HaUrim) appeared by the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nHistorical Sources\nThe story of Hanukkah is told in the books of the First and Second Maccabees, which describe in detail the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the menorah. These books, however, are not a part of the canonized Masoretic Text version of the Tanakh (Hebrew and Aramaic language Jewish Bible) used and accepted by normative Rabbinical Judaism and therefore modern Jews.\n\nBooks of Maccabees\nThe story of Hanukkah is told in the books of the First and Second Maccabees, which describe in detail the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the menorah. These books, however, are not a part of the canonized Masoretic Text version of the Tanakh (Hebrew and Aramaic language Jewish Bible) used and accepted by normative Rabbinical Judaism and therefore modern Jews.\n\nEarly Rabbinic Sources\nMegillat Taanit (1st century) contains a list of festive days on which fasting or eulogizing is forbidden. It specifies, \"On the 25th of Kislev is Hanukkah of eight days, and one is not to eulogize\" and then references the story of the rededication of the Temple.\n\nNarrative of Josephus\nThe Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus narrates in his book, Jewish Antiquities XII, how the victorious Judas Maccabeus ordered lavish yearly eight-day festivities after rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem that had been profaned by Antiochus IV Epiphanes.\n\nOther Ancient Sources\nIn the New Testament, John 10:22-23 says, \"Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon's Colonnade.\" The Greek noun used appears in the neuter plural as \"the renewals\" or \"the consecrations\" (‹See Tfd›Greek: τὰ ἐγκαίνια; ta enkaínia).\n\nBackground\nAfter the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, Judea became part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt until 200 BCE, when King Antiochus III the Great of Syria defeated King Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt at the Battle of Panium. Judea then became part of the Seleucid Empire of Syria.\n\nTraditional View\nWhen the Second Temple in Jerusalem was looted and services stopped, Judaism was outlawed. In 167 BCE, Antiochus ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple. He banned brit milah (circumcision) and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple.\n\nAcademic Sources\nSome modern scholars, following the account in 2 Maccabees, observe that the king was intervening in an internal civil war between the Maccabean Jews and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem. These competed violently over who would be the High Priest, with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contesting with Hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like Jason and Menelaus.\n\nTimeline\nSelected battles between the Maccabees and the Seleucid Syrian-Greeks:\n\nCharacters and Heroes\nHanukkah is celebrated with a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the eight-day holiday, some are family-based and others communal. There are special additions to the daily prayer service, and a section is added to the blessing after meals.\n\nRituals\nHanukkah is celebrated with a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the eight-day holiday, some are family-based and others communal.

There are several different versions; the version presented here is recited in many Ashkenazic communities:\n\nMaoz Tzur\nIn the Ashkenazi tradition, each night after the lighting of the candles, the hymn Ma'oz Tzur is sung. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in Jewish history, praising God for survival despite these tragedies (the exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian captivity, the miracle of the holiday of Purim, the Hasmonean victory) and expressing a longing for the days when Judea will finally triumph over Rome.\n\nOther Customs\nAfter lighting the candles and Ma'oz Tzur, singing other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes. Some Hasidic and Sephardi Jews recite Psalms, such as Psalm 30, Psalm 67, and Psalm 91. In North America and in Israel, it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time. In addition, many families encourage their children to give tzedakah (charity) in lieu of presents for themselves.\n\nSpecial Additions to Daily Prayers\n\"We thank You also for the miraculous deeds and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and the saving acts wrought by You, as well as for the wars which You waged for our ancestors in ancient days at this season. In the days of the Hasmonean Mattathias, son of Johanan the high priest, and his sons, when the iniquitous Greco-Syrian kingdom rose up against Your people Israel, to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the ordinances of Your will, then You in Your abundant mercy rose up for them in the time of their trouble, pled their cause, executed judgment, avenged their wrong, and delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of the few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent ones into the hands of those occupied with Your Torah. Both unto Yourself did You make a great and holy name in Your world, and unto Your people did You achieve a great deliverance and redemption. Whereupon Your children entered the sanctuary of Your house, cleansed Your temple, purified Your sanctuary, kindled lights in Your holy courts, and appointed these eight days of Hanukkah in order to give thanks and praises unto Your holy name.\"\n\nZot Hanukkah\nThe last day of Hanukkah is known by some as Zot Hanukkah and by others as Chanukat HaMizbeach, from the verse read on this day in the synagogue Numbers 7:84, Zot Hanukkat Hamizbe'ach: \"This was the dedication of the altar.\" According to the teachings of Kabbalah and Hasidism, this day is the final \"seal\" of the High Holiday season of Yom Kippur and is considered a time to repent out of love for God. In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other Gmar chatimah tovah (\"may you be sealed totally for good\"), a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season. It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers.\n\nOther Related Laws and Customs\nIt is customary for women not to work for at least the first half-hour of the candles' burning, and some have the custom not to work for the entire time of burning. It is also forbidden to fast or to eulogize during Hanukkah.\n\nHanukkah as the End of the High Holy Days\nSome Hasidic scholars teach that the Hanukkah is in fact the final conclusion of God's judgment extending High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana when humanity is judged and Yom Kippur when the judgment is sealed.\n\nCustoms\nHanukkah songs include \"Ma'oz Tzur\" (Rock of Ages), \"Latke'le Latke'le\" (Yiddish: \"Little Latke, Little Latke\"), \"Hanukkiah Li Yesh\" (\"I Have a Hanukkah Menorah\"), \"Ocho Kandelikas\" (Judeo-Spanish: \"Eight Little Candles\"), \"Kad Katan\" (\"A Small Jug\"), \"S'vivon Sov Sov Sov\" (\"Dreidel, Spin and Spin\"), \"Haneirot Halolu\" (\"These Candles Which We Light\"), \"Mi Yimalel\" (\"Who Can Retell\") and \"Ner Li, Ner Li\" (\"I Have a Candle\").\n\nMusic\nHanukkah songs include \"Ma'oz Tzur\" (Rock of Ages), \"Latke'le Latke'le\" (Yiddish: \"Little Latke, Little Latke\"), \"Hanukkiah Li Yesh\" (\"I Have a Hanukkah Menorah\"), \"Ocho Kandelikas\" (Judeo-Spanish: \"Eight Little Candles\"), \"Kad Katan\" (\"A Small Jug\"), \"S'vivon Sov Sov Sov\" (\"Dreidel, Spin and Spin\"), \"Haneirot Halolu\" (\"These Candles Which We Light\"), \"Mi Yimalel\" (\"Who Can Retell\") and \"Ner Li, Ner Li\" (\"I Have a Candle\").\n\nFoods\nThere is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil (preferably olive oil) to commemorate the miracle of a small flask of oil keeping the Second Temple's Menorah alight for eight days.

Sephardi, Polish, and Israeli families eat jam-filled doughnuts (Yiddish: פּאָנטשקעס pontshkes), bimuelos (fritters) and sufganiyot which are deep-fried in oil. Italkim and Hungarian Jews traditionally eat cheese pancakes known as \"cassola\" or \"cheese latkes\".\n\nDreidel\nAfter lighting the candles, it is customary to play (or spin) the dreidel. The dreidel, or sevivon in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with during Hanukkah.

Merriam–Webster, [16] Collins English Dictionary, the Oxford Style Manual, and the style guides of The New York Times and The Guardian [17] The sound represented by Ch ( [χ], similar to the Scottish pronunciation of loch) is not native to the English language [18] Furthermore, the letter ḥeth (ח‎), which is the first letter in the Hebrew spelling, is pronounced differently in modern Hebrew (voiceless uvular fricative) from in classical Hebrew (voiceless pharyngeal fricative  [ħ]), and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in English spelling However, its original sound is closer to the English H than to the Scottish Ch, and Hanukkah more accurately represents the spelling in the Hebrew alphabet [14] Moreover, the 'kaf' consonant is geminate in classical (but not modern) Hebrew Adapting the classical Hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal Ḥeth can lead to the spelling Hanukkah, while adapting the modern Hebrew pronunciation with no gemination and uvular Ḥeth leads to the spelling Chanukah [19] [20] [21]\n\n\nFestival of Lights\nIn Modern Hebrew, Hanukkah may also be called the Festival of Lights (חַג הַאוּרִים‎, Ḥag HaUrim), based on a comment by Josephus in Antiquities of the Jews, καὶ ἐξ ἐκείνου μέχρι τοῦ δεῦρο τὴν ἑορτὴν ἄγομεν καλοῦντες αὐτὴν φῶτα \"And from then on we celebrate this festival, and we call it Lights\" The first Hebrew translation of Antiquities (1864) used (חַג הַמְּאֹרוֹת‎) \"Festival of Lamps\", but the translation \"Festival of Lights\" (חַג הַאוּרִים‎) appeared by the end of the nineteenth century [22]\n\n\nHistorical sources\nThe story of Hanukkah is told in the books of the First and Second Maccabees, which describe in detail the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the menorah These books, however, are not a part of the canonized Masoretic Text version of the Tanakh (Hebrew and Aramaic language Jewish Bible) used and accepted by normative Rabbinical Judaism and therefore modern Jews (as copied, edited and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Common Era) However, the books of Maccabees were included among the deuterocanonical books added to the Septuagint, a Jewish scholarly Greek-language translation of the Hebrew Bible originally compiled in the mid-3rd century BCE The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider the books of Maccabees as a canonical part of the Old Testament [23]\n\n\nBooks of Maccabees\nThe story of Hanukkah is told in the books of the First and Second Maccabees,

Hebrew Bible originally compiled in the mid-3rd century BCE The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider the books of Maccabees as a canonical part of the Old Testament [23]\n\n\nEarly rabbinic sources\nMegillat Taanit (1st century) contains a list of festive days on which fasting or eulogizing is forbidden It specifies, \"On the 25th of  [Kislev] is Hanukkah of eight days, and one is not to eulogize\" and then references the story of the rededication of the Temple [29]\n\n\nNarrative of Josephus\nThe Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus narrates in his book, Jewish Antiquities XII, how the victorious Judas Maccabeus ordered lavish yearly eight-day festivities after rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem that had been profaned by Antiochus IV Epiphanes [40] Josephus does not say the festival was called Hanukkah but rather the \"Festival of Lights\":\n\n\nOther ancient sources\nIn the New Testament, John 10:22–23 says, \"Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon's Colonnade\" (NIV) The Greek noun used appears in the neuter plural as \"the renewals\" or \"the consecrations\" (‹See Tfd›Greek: τὰ ἐγκαίνια; ta enkaínia) [42] The same root appears in 2 Esdras 6:16 in the Septuagint to refer specifically to Hanukkah This Greek word was chosen because the Hebrew word for 'consecration' or 'dedication' is Hanukkah (חנכה) The Aramaic New Testament uses the Aramaic word hawdata (a close synonym), which literally means 'renewal' or 'to make new' [43]\n\n\nHistory\nAfter the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, Judea became part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt until 200 BCE, when King Antiochus III the Great of Syria defeated King Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt at the Battle of Panium Judea then became part of the Seleucid Empire of Syria [44] King Antiochus III the Great, wanting to conciliate his new Jewish subjects, guaranteed their right to \"live according to their ancestral customs\" and to continue to practice their religion in the Temple of Jerusalem [45] The Seleucids, like the Ptolemies before them, held a suzerainty over Judea, where they respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions This policy was drastically reversed by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus III, seemingly after what was either a dispute over leadership of the Temple in Jerusalem and the office of High Priest, or possibly a revolt whose nature was lost to time after being crushed [46] In 175 BCE, Antiochus IV invaded Judea at the request of the sons of Tobias [47] The Tobiads, who led the Hellenizing Jewish faction in Jerusalem, were expelled to Syria around 170 BCE when the high priest Onias and his pro-Egyptian faction wrested control from them The exiled Tobiads lobbied Antiochus IV Epiphanes to recapture Jerusalem As Flavius Josephus relates:\n\n\nBackground\nAfter the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, Judea became part of the

to Zeus erected in the Temple He banned brit milah (circumcision) and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple [49]\n\n\nAcademic sources\nSome modern scholars, following the account in 2 Maccabees, observe that the king was intervening in an internal civil war between the Maccabean Jews and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem [54] [55] [56] [57] These competed violently over who would be the High Priest, with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contesting with Hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like Jason and Menelaus [58] In particular, Jason's Hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of Judaism [59] Other authors point to possible socioeconomic reasons in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war [60]\n\n\nTimeline\nSelected battles between the Maccabees and the Seleucid Syrian-Greeks:\n\n\nBattles of the Maccabean Revolt\nSelected battles between the Maccabees and

communal There are special additions to the daily prayer service, and a section is added to the blessing after meals [81]\n\n\nRituals\nHanukkah is celebrated with a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the eight-day holiday, some are family-based and others communal There are special additions to the daily prayer service, and a section is added to the blessing after meals [81]\n\n\nKindling the Hanukkah lights\nEach night throughout the eight-day holiday, a candle or oil-based light is lit As a universally practiced \"beautification\" (hiddur mitzvah) of the mitzvah, the number of lights lit is increased by one each night [87] An extra light called a shammash, meaning \"attendant\" or \"sexton,\" [88] is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher, lower, or to the side of the others [83]\n\n\nCandle-lighting time\nHanukkah lights should usually burn for at least half an hour after it gets dark [106] Many light at sundown and those who do so should be careful to have enough oil or wax to last until half an hour after dark Most Hasidim and many other communities light later, generally around nightfall [107] Many Hasidic Rebbes light much later to fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights [108]\n\n\nBlessings over the candles\nTypically two blessings (brachot; singular: brachah) are recited during this eight-day festival when lighting the candles On the first night only, the shehecheyanu blessing is added, making a total of three blessings [111]\n\n\nBlessing for lighting the candles\nTransliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner Hanukkah.\n\n\nBlessing for the miracles of Hanukkah\nTransliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, she'asa nisim la'avoteinu ba'yamim ha'heim ba'z'man ha'ze.\n\n\nHanerot Halalu\nAfter the lights are kindled the hymn Hanerot Halalu is recited There are several different versions; the version presented here is recited in many Ashkenazic communities: [114]\n\n\nMaoz Tzur\nIn the Ashkenazi tradition, each night after the lighting of the candles, the hymn Ma'oz Tzur is sung The song contains six stanzas The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in Jewish history, praising God for survival despite these tragedies (the exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian captivity, the miracle of the holiday of Purim, the Hasmonean victory) and expressing a longing for the days when Judea will finally triumph over Rome [115]\n\n\nOther customs\nAfter lighting the candles and Ma'oz Tzur, singing other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes Some Hasidic and Sephardi Jews recite Psalms, such as Psalm 30, Psalm 67, and Psalm 91 In North America and in Israel it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time In addition, many families encourage their children to give tzedakah (charity) in lieu of presents for themselves [117] [118]\n\n\nSpecial additions to daily prayers\n\"We thank You also for the miraculous deeds and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and the saving acts wrought by You, as well as for the wars which You waged for our ancestors in ancient days at this season In the days of the Hasmonean Mattathias, son of Johanan the high priest, and his sons, when the iniquitous Greco-Syrian kingdom rose up against Your people Israel, to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the ordinances of Your will, then You in your abundant mercy rose up for them in the time of their trouble, pled their cause, executed judgment, avenged their wrong, and delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent ones into the hands of those occupied with Your Torah Both unto Yourself did you make a great and holy name in Thy world, and unto Your people did You achieve a great deliverance and redemption Whereupon your children entered the sanctuary of Your house, cleansed Your temple, purified Your sanctuary, kindled lights in Your holy courts, and appointed these eight days of Hanukkah in order to give thanks and praises unto Your holy name.\"\n\n\nZot Hanukkah\nThe last day of Hanukkah is known by some as Zot Hanukkah and by others as Chanukat HaMizbeach, from the verse read on this day in the synagogue Numbers 7:84, Zot Hanukkat Hamizbe'ach: \"This was the dedication of the altar\" According to the teachings of Kabbalah and Hasidism, this day is the final \"seal\" of the High Holiday season of Yom Kippur and is considered a time to repent out of love for God In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other Gmar chatimah tovah (\"may you be sealed totally for good\"), a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers [127]\n\n\nOther related laws and customs\nIt is customary for women not to work for at least the first half-hour of the candles' burning, and some have the custom not to work for the entire time of burning It is also forbidden to fast or to eulogize during Hanukkah [83]\n\n\nHanukkah as the end of the High Holy Days\nSome Hasidic scholars teach that the Hanukkah is in fact the final conclusion of God's judgment extending High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana when humanity is judged and Yom Kippur when the judgment is sealed: [citation needed]\n\n\nCustoms\nHanukkah songs (in Hebrew except where indicated) include \"Ma'oz Tzur\" (Rock of Ages), \"Latke'le Latke'le\" (Yiddish: \"Little Latke, Little Latke\"), \"Hanukkiah Li Yesh\" (\"I Have a Hanukkah Menorah\"), \"Ocho Kandelikas\" (Judeo-Spanish: \"Eight Little Candles\"), \"Kad Katan\" (\"A Small Jug\"), \"S'vivon Sov Sov Sov\" (\"Dreidel, Spin and Spin\"), \"Haneirot Halolu\" (\"These Candles Which We Light\"), \"Mi Yimalel\" (\"Who Can Retell\") and \"Ner Li, Ner Li\" (\"I have a Candle\").\n\n\nMusic\nHanukkah songs (in Hebrew except where indicated) include \"Ma'oz Tzur\" (Rock of Ages), \"Latke'le Latke'le\" (Yiddish: \"Little Latke, Little Latke\"), \"Hanukkiah Li Yesh\" (\"I Have a Hanukkah Menorah\"), \"Ocho Kandelikas\" (Judeo-Spanish: \"Eight Little Candles\"), \"Kad Katan\" (\"A Small Jug\"), \"S'vivon Sov Sov Sov\" (\"Dreidel, Spin and Spin\"), \"Haneirot Halolu\" (\"These Candles Which We Light\"), \"Mi Yimalel\" (\"Who Can Retell\") and \"Ner Li, Ner Li\" (\"I have a Candle\").\n\n\nFoods\nThere is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil (preferably olive oil) to commemorate the miracle of a small flask of oil keeping the Second Temple's Menorah alight for eight days [135] Traditional foods include potato pancakes, known as latkes in Yiddish, especially among Ashkenazi families Sephardi, Polish, and Israeli families eat jam-filled doughnuts (Yiddish: פּאָנטשקעס pontshkes), bimuelos (fritters) and sufganiyot which are deep-fried in oil Italkim and Hungarian Jews traditionally eat cheese pancakes known as \"cassola\" or \"cheese latkes\" [136]\n\n\nDreidel\nAfter lighting the candles, it is customary to play (or spin) the dreidel The dreidel, or sevivon in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with during Hanukkah Each side is imprinted with a Hebrew letter which is an abbreviation for the Hebrew words נס גדול היה שם (Nes Gadol Haya Sham, \"A great miracle happened there\"), referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the Beit Hamikdash The fourth side of some dreidels sold in Israel are inscribed with the letter פ (Pe), rendering the acronym נס גדול היה פה (Nes Gadol Haya Po, \"A great miracle happened here\"), referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of Israel, although this is a relatively recent [when?] innovation Stores in Haredi neighborhoods sell the traditional Shin dreidels as well, because they understand \"there\" to refer to the Temple and not the entire Land of Israel, and because the Hasidic Masters ascribe significance to the traditional letters [145] [146]\n\n\nHanukkah gelt\nChanukkah gelt (Yiddish for \"Chanukkah money\"), known in Israel by the Hebrew translation Hebrew: דְּמֵי חֲנֻכָּה, romanized: dmei Hanukkah, is often distributed to children during the festival of Hanukkah The giving of Hanukkah gelt also adds to the holiday excitement The amount is usually in small coins, although grandparents or relatives may give larger sums The tradition of giving Chanukah gelt dates back to a long-standing East European custom of children presenting their teachers with a small sum of money at this time of year as a token of gratitude One minhag favors the fifth night of Hanukkah for giving Hanukkah gelt [147] Unlike the other nights of Hanukkah, the fifth does not ever fall on the Shabbat, hence never conflicting with the Halachic injunction against handling money on the Shabbat [148]\n\n\nHanukkah in the White House\nThe earliest Hanukkah link with the White House occurred in 1951 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion presented United States President Harry Truman with a Hanukkah menorah In 1979 President Jimmy Carter took part in the first public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony of the National Menorah held across the White House lawn In 1989, President George H W Bush displayed a menorah in the White House In 1993, President Bill Clinton invited a group of schoolchildren to the Oval Office for a small ceremony [97]\n\n\nDates\nThe dates of Hanukkah are determined by the Hebrew calendar Hanukkah begins at the 25th day of Kislev and concludes on the second or third day of Tevet (Kislev can have 29 or 30 days) The Jewish day begins at sunset Hanukkah dates for recent and upcoming:\n\n\nSymbolic importance\nMajor Jewish holidays are those when all forms of work are forbidden, and that feature traditional holiday meals, kiddush, holiday candle-lighting, etc Only biblical holidays fit these criteria, and Chanukah was instituted some two centuries after the Hebrew Bible was completed Nevertheless, though Chanukah is of rabbinic origin, it is traditionally celebrated in a major and very public fashion The requirement to position the menorah, or Chanukiah, at the door or window, symbolizes the desire to give the Chanukah miracle a high-profile [158]\n\n\nModern history\n\"Hanukkah is an ancient holiday, but a modest one The holiday of the Hasmoneans is new, yet it is full of spiritual exaltation and national joy What was Hanukkah forty years ago? 'Al ha-nissim' and Hallel; a short reading in the synagogue; lighting the tiny, slender wax candles or oil lights; at home, levivot  [latkes-potato pancakes], cards for the older children, and sevivonim  [dreidels-spinning tops] for the little ones But what is Hanukkah today? The holiday of the Hasmoneans A holiday of salvation A great national holiday, celebrated in all the countries of the Diaspora with dances and speeches, melody and song, outings and parades, as if a new soul has been breathed into the ancient holiday, another spirit renewed within it One thing is clear: if those tiny, modest candles had been extinguished in Diaspora times, if our grandparents had not preserved the traditions of Hanukkah in the synagogue and at home  .., the holiday of the Hasmoneans could never have been created There would have been nothing to change, nothing to renew The new soul of our times would not have found a body in which to envelop itself.”\n\n\nZionism\n\"Hanukkah is an ancient holiday, but a modest one The holiday of the Hasmoneans is new, yet it is full of spiritual exaltation and national joy What was Hanukkah forty years ago?

[29] the 2006 Lebanon War started During the war Israeli bombardments seeking Hezbollah targets caused damage in many parts of Beirut, especially the poorer and largely Shiite South Beirut, which is controlled by Hezbollah On 3 August 2006, Hassan Nasrallah vowed to strike Tel Aviv in retaliation for Israel's bombardment of Lebanon's capital \"If you hit Beirut, the Islamic resistance will hit Tel Aviv and is able to do that with God's help,\" Nasrallah said in a televised address He added that Hezbollah forces were inflicting heavy casualties on Israeli ground troops [30]\n\n\n2008 alleged assassination attempt\nOn 15 October 2008, Iraqi news source Almalaf, reported that Nasrallah had been poisoned the previous week, quoting sources in Lebanon, and that he was saved by Iranian doctors who went to Lebanon to treat him The sources told the paper that a particularly poisonous chemical substance was used against the Shia militia leader His medical condition was apparently critical for several days until Iranian doctors came and managed to save his life Almalaf claimed that the sources believed it was highly likely that the poisoning was an Israeli assassination attempt [36]\n\n\nSyrian Civil War\nOn 25 May 2013, Nasrallah announced that Hezbollah is fighting in the Syrian civil war against \"Islamist extremists\" and \"pledged that his group will not allow Syrian militants to control areas that border Lebanon\" [40] He confirmed that Hezbollah was fighting in the strategic Syrian town of Qusair on the same side as the Syrian army [40] In the televised address, he said, \"If Syria falls in the hands of America, Israel and the takfiris, the people of our region will go into a dark period.\" [40]\n\n\nViews on international politics\nIn his anti-Israel

and Robert Satloff, in a speech carried during Ashura on 9 April 2000, Hassan Nasrallah said that: \"The Jews invented the legend of the Nazi atrocities It is clear that the numbers they talk about are greatly exaggerated\" [66] [67] According to the US-Israeli organisation MEMRI, in a speech aired on Al-Manar and Al-Jazeera in 2006, Nasrallah expressed support for Holocaust denier Roger Garaudy calling him a \"great French philosopher\" who \"proved (sic) that this Holocaust is a myth\" [68]\n\n\n11 September 2001 attacks and the United States\n\"What do the people who worked in those two World Trade Center towers, along with thousands of employees, women and men, have to do with war that is taking place in the Middle East?.. Therefore we condemned this act—and any similar act we condemn.. I said nothing about the Pentagon, meaning we remain silent We neither favored nor opposed that act.. Well, of course, the method of Osama bin Laden, and the fashion of bin Laden, we do not endorse them And many of the operations that they have carried out, we condemned them very clearly.\" [69]\n\n\nOn 7 October 2023, attacks on Israel\nWhile calling for the \"liberation\" of Jerusalem and mentioning Israel as a \"Zionist existence\", he called the attacks of Hamas on Israel on 7 October 2023 a heroic operation Nasrallah had said that Hezbollah's missile and drone attacks against northern Israel, which began immediately after 7 October, were carried out in solidarity with the Palestinians [14]\n\n\nIslamist extremism\nAccording to Saudi state-owned Al Arabiya, a video posted on their site is of Nasrallah giving a speech circa 1988 in which he states, \"Our plan, to which we, as faithful believers, have no alternative, is to establish an Islamic state.. Lebanon should not be an Islamic republic on its own, but rather, part of the Greater Islamic Republic, governed by the Master of Time  [the Mahdi], and his rightful deputy, the Jurisprudent Ruler, Imam Khomeini,\" [70]\n\n\nPalestinian right of return\nAccording to the pro-Israeli group CAMERA, Nasrallah said that \"The Lebanese refuse to give the Palestinians residing in Lebanon Lebanese citizenship, and we refuse their resettlement in Lebanon There is Lebanese consensus on this.. we thank God that we all agree on one clear and definite result; namely, that we reject the resettlement of the Palestinians in Lebanon.\" [47] There is broad consensus in Lebanon against the permanent resettlement of Palestinians, due to fears that it could reignite Lebanon's civil war [74] Likewise, Palestinian refugees in Lebanon consistently favor right of return over Lebanese naturalization [75]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 27 September 2024, the Israeli Air Force launched an airstrike on Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut, reportedly targeting Nasrallah [76] At least six people were killed and over 90 injured following the strike, with several missing [77] [78] [79] The following day, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated that Nasrallah had died in the strike; [80] Hezbollah and Lebanese authorities later confirmed his death and his body was later found under the rubble [79] He reportedly died from the toxic fumes he inhaled while under the rubble as he allegedly had not sustained physical wounds [81] Other sources suggested he had died from blunt force trauma sustained during the attack [82]\n\n\nLegacy\nBy playing a key part in ending the Israeli occupation, Nasrallah became a \"national hero\" in Lebanon [83] A New York Times article reported that an Arab politician called him as the \"most powerful man in the Middle East\" and the \"only Arab leader who actually does what he says he's going to do\" [84] Al Jazeera compared him to other Arab leaders such as Yasser Arafat and Gamal Abdel Nasser, and leftist revolutionaries like Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, [85] while journalist Annia Ciezadlo described him as an \"emblem of Islam and Arab pride\" [86] Writer and analyst Amal Saad-Ghorayeb said that he is \"passionate\" but also \"plainspoken and practical\" [86] American activist Osama Siblani praised Nasrallah as a \"great leader\" [87] at a 2024 Israel-Hamas war protest rally in Dearborn, Michigan [88]\n\n\nImage\nBy playing a key part in ending the Israeli occupation, Nasrallah became a \"national hero\" in Lebanon [83] A New York Times article reported that an Arab politician called him as the \"most powerful man in the Middle East\" and the \"only Arab leader who actually does what he says he's going to do\" [84] Al Jazeera compared him to other Arab leaders such as Yasser Arafat and Gamal Abdel Nasser, and leftist revolutionaries like Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, [85] while journalist Annia Ciezadlo described him as an \"emblem of Islam and Arab pride\" [86] Writer and analyst Amal Saad-Ghorayeb said that he is \"passionate\" but also \"plainspoken and practical\" [86] American activist Osama Siblani praised Nasrallah as a \"great leader\" [87] at a 2024 Israel-Hamas war protest rally in Dearborn, Michigan [88]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nTwo popular songs were written about Nasrallah during the 2006 Israel–Hezbollah War, with vastly different views of the Hezbollah leader: \"The Hawk of Lebanon\" in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, [91] and \"Yalla Ya Nasrallah\", against Nasrallah, in Israel [92] [93]\n\n\nPersonal life\nNasrallah married Fatima Mustafa Yassine in 1978 [95] They had four sons and one daughter, namely Mohammad Hadi Hassan Nasrallah, Mohammad Jawad Hassan Nasrallah, Zeinab Hassan Nasrallah, Mohammad Ali Hassan Nasrallah, and Mohammad Mahdi Hassan Nasrallah [96] [97]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nSpeeches and interviews\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Cullinan_Diamond", "content": "\nDiscovery and early history\nThe Cullinan is estimated to have formed in Earth's mantle transition zone at a depth of 410–660 km (255–410 miles) and reached the surface 1.18 billion years ago [3] It was found 5.5 metres (18 ft) below the surface at Premier Mine in Cullinan, Transvaal Colony, by Frederick Wells, surface manager at the mine, on 26 January 1905 It was approximately 10.1 centimetres (4.0 in) long, 6.35 centimetres (2.50 in) wide, 5.9 centimetres (2.3 in) deep, and weighed 3,106 carats (621.2 grams) [4] Newspapers called it the \"Cullinan Diamond\", a reference to Sir Thomas Cullinan, who opened the mine in 1902 [5] It was three times the size of the Excelsior Diamond, found in 1893 at Jagersfontein Mine, weighing 972 carats (194.4 g) Four of its eight surfaces were smooth, indicating that it once had been part of a much larger stone broken up by natural forces It had a blue-white hue and contained a small pocket of air, which at certain angles produced a rainbow, or Newton's rings [6]\n\n\nPresentation to Edward VII\nTransvaal Prime Minister Louis Botha suggested buying the diamond for Edward VII as \"a token of the loyalty and attachment of the people of the Transvaal to His Majesty's throne and person\" [9] In August 1907, a vote was held in the Legislative Council [10] on the Cullinan's fate, and a motion authorising the purchase was carried by 42 votes in favour to 19 against Initially, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, then British Prime Minister, advised the king to decline the offer, but he later decided to let Edward VII choose whether or not to accept the gift [11] Eventually, he was persuaded by Winston Churchill, then Colonial Under-Secretary For his trouble, Churchill was sent a replica, which he enjoyed showing off to guests on a silver plate [12] The Transvaal Colony government bought the diamond on 17 October 1907 for £150,000, [13] which adjusted for pound-sterling inflation is equivalent to £19 million in 2023 [14] Due to a 60% tax on mining profits, the Treasury received some of its money back from the Premier Diamond Mining Company [15]\n\n\nCutting process\nThe king chose Joseph Asscher & Co of Amsterdam to cleave and polish the rough stone into brilliant gems of various cuts and sizes Abraham Asscher collected it from the Colonial Office in London on 23 January 1908 [18] He returned to the Netherlands by train and ferry with the diamond in his coat pocket [13] Meanwhile, to much fanfare, a Royal Navy ship carried an empty box across the North Sea, again throwing off potential thieves Even the captain was unaware that his \"precious\" cargo was a decoy [19]\n\n\nDiamonds cut from the Cullinan\nCullinan produced 9 major stones of 1,055.89 carats (211.178 g) in total, [24] plus 96 minor brilliants and some unpolished fragments weighing 19.5 carats (3.90 g) [25] All but the two largest stones – Cullinans I and II – remained in Amsterdam by arrangement as the fee for Asscher's services, [26] until the South African government bought them (except Cullinan VI, which Edward VII had purchased and given to his wife Queen Alexandra in 1907), and the High Commissioner for Southern Africa presented them to Queen Mary on 28 June 1910 [12] Mary also inherited Cullinan VI from Alexandra, and she left all her Cullinan diamonds to her granddaughter Elizabeth II in 1953 [27] Cullinans I and II are part of the Crown Jewels, [2] which belong to the King in right of the Crown [28]\n\n\nCullinan I\nCullinan I, or the Great Star of Africa, is a pendeloque-cut brilliant weighing 530.2 carats (106.04 g) and has 74 facets [34] It is set at the top of the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross, made in 1661, which had to be redesigned in 1910 to accommodate it Cullinan I was surpassed as the world's largest cut diamond by the 545.67-carat (109.134 g) brown Golden Jubilee Diamond in 1992, [35] but remains the largest colourless cut diamond in the world [36] In terms of clarity, it has a few tiny cleavages and a small patch of graining The 5.89 cm × 4.54 cm × 2.77 cm (2.32 in × 1.79 in × 1.09 in) diamond is fitted with loops and can be taken out of its setting to be worn as a pendant suspended from Cullinan II to make a brooch [37] Queen Mary, wife of George V, often wore it like this [38] In 1908, the stone was valued at US$2.5 million (equivalent to US$60 million in 2023) [39]– two and a half times the rough Cullinan's estimated value [40]\n\n\nCullinan II\nCullinan II, or the Second Star of Africa, is a cushion-cut brilliant with 66 facets weighing 317.4 carats (63.48 g) set in the front of the Imperial State Crown, [34] below the Black Prince's Ruby (a large spinel) [41] It measures 4.54 cm × 4.08 cm × 2.42 cm (1.79 in × 1.61 in × 0.95 in) The diamond has a number of tiny flaws, scratches on the table facet, and a small chip at the girdle Like Cullinan I, it is held in place by a yellow gold enclosure, which is screwed onto the crown [37]\n\n\nCullinan III\nCullinan III, or the Lesser Star of Africa, is pear-cut and weighs 94.4 carats (18.88 g) [34] In 1911, Queen Mary, wife and queen consort of George V, had it set in the top cross pattée of a crown that she personally bought for her coronation [42] In 1912, the Delhi Durbar Tiara, worn the previous year by Mary instead of a crown at the Delhi Durbar, where her husband wore the Imperial Crown of India, was also adapted to take Cullinans III and IV [43] In 1914, Cullinan III was permanently replaced on the crown by a crystal model Elizabeth II frequently wore Cullinan III in combination with Cullinan IV as a brooch In total, the brooch is 6.5 cm (2.6 in) long and 2.4 cm (0.94 in) wide [44] Cullinan III has also been used as a pendant on the Coronation Necklace, where it occasionally replaced the 22.4-carat (4.48 g) Lahore Diamond [45] [46]\n\n\nCullinan IV\nCullinan IV, also referred to as a Lesser Star of Africa, is square-cut and weighs 63.6 carats (12.72 g) [34] It was also set in the base of Queen Mary's Crown but was removed in 1914 On 25 March 1958, while she and Prince Philip were on a state visit to the Netherlands, Queen Elizabeth II revealed that Cullinan III and IV are known in her family as \"Granny's Chips\" They visited the Asscher Diamond Company, where Cullinan had been cut 50 years earlier It was the first time the Queen had worn the brooch publicly During her visit, she unpinned the brooch and offered it for examination to Louis Asscher, nephew of Joseph Asscher, who split the rough diamond Aged 84, he was deeply moved that the Queen had brought the diamonds with her, knowing how much it would mean to him seeing them again after so many years [47]\n\n\nCullinan V\nCullinan V is an 18.8-carat (3.76 g) heart-shaped diamond set in the centre of a platinum brooch that formed a part of the stomacher made for Queen Mary to wear at the Delhi Durbar in 1911 The brooch was designed to show off Cullinan V and is pavé-set with a border of smaller diamonds It can be suspended from the VIII brooch and can be used to suspend the VII pendant It was often worn like this by Mary [45] In May 2023, the brooch was placed on the front of cross Queen Mary's Crown for the Coronation of Queen Camilla instead of the traditional and controversial Koh-i-Noor [48]\n\n\nCullinan VI\nCullinan VI is marquise-cut and weighs 11.5 carats (2.30 g) [34] It hangs from the brooch containing Cullinan VIII and forming part of the stomacher of the Delhi Durbar parure Cullinan VI along with VIII can also be fitted together to make yet another brooch, surrounded by some 96 smaller diamonds The design was created around the same time that the Cullinan V heart-shaped brooch was designed, both having a similar shape [49]\n\n\nCullinan VII\nCullinan VII is also marquise-cut and weighs 8.8 carats (1.76 g) [34] It was originally given by Edward VII to his wife and consort Queen Alexandra After his death she gave the jewel to Queen Mary, who had it set as a pendant hanging from the diamond-and-emerald Delhi Durbar necklace, part of the parure [50]\n\n\nCullinan VIII\nCullinan VIII is an oblong-cut diamond weighing 6.8 carats (1.36 g) [34] It is set in the centre of a brooch forming part of the stomacher of the Delhi Durbar parure Together with Cullinan VI it forms a brooch [49]\n\n\nCullinan IX\nCullinan IX is smallest of the principal diamonds to be obtained from the rough Cullinan It is a pendeloque or stepped pear-cut stone, weighs 4.39 carats (0.878 g), and is set in a platinum ring known as the Cullinan IX Ring [51]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited references\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The

Asscher collected it from the Colonial Office in London on 23 January 1908 [18] He returned to the Netherlands by train and ferry with the diamond in his coat pocket [13] Meanwhile, to much fanfare, a Royal Navy ship carried an empty box across the North Sea, again throwing off potential thieves Even the captain was unaware that his \"precious\" cargo was a decoy [19]\n\n\nDiamonds cut from the Cullinan\nCullinan produced 9 major stones of 1,055.89 carats (211.178 g) in total, [24] plus 96 minor brilliants and some unpolished fragments weighing 19.5 carats (3.90 g) [25] All but the two largest stones – Cullinans I and II – remained in Amsterdam by arrangement as the fee for Asscher's services, [26] until the South African government bought them (except Cullinan VI, which Edward VII had purchased and given to his wife Queen Alexandra in 1907), and the High Commissioner for Southern Africa presented them to Queen Mary on 28 June 1910 [12] Mary also inherited Cullinan VI from Alexandra, and she left all her Cullinan diamonds to her granddaughter Elizabeth II in 1953 [27] Cullinans I and II are part of the Crown Jewels, [2] which belong to the King in right of the Crown [28]\n\n\nCullinan I\nCullinan I, or the Great Star of Africa, is a pendeloque-cut brilliant weighing 530.2 carats (106.04 g) and has 74 facets [34] It is set at the top of the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross, made in 1661, which had to be redesigned in 1910 to accommodate it Cullinan I was surpassed as the world's largest cut diamond by the 545.67-carat (109.134 g) brown Golden Jubilee Diamond in 1992, [35] but remains the largest colourless cut diamond in the world [36] In terms of clarity, it has a few tiny cleavages and a small patch of graining The 5.89 cm × 4.54 cm × 2.77 cm (2.32 in × 1.79 in × 1.09 in) diamond is fitted with loops and can be taken out of its setting to be worn as a pendant suspended from Cullinan II to make a brooch [37] Queen Mary, wife of George V, often wore it like this [38] In 1908, the stone was valued at US$2.5 million (equivalent to US$60 million in 2023) [39]– two and a half times the rough Cullinan's estimated value [40]\n\n\nCullinan II\nCullinan II, or the Second Star of Africa, is a cushion-cut brilliant with 66 facets weighing 317.4 carats (63.48 g) set in the front of the Imperial State Crown, [34] below the Black Prince's Ruby (a large spinel) [41] It measures 4.54 cm × 4.08 cm × 2.42 cm (1.79 in × 1.61 in × 0.95 in) The diamond has a number of tiny flaws, scratches on the table facet, and a small chip at the girdle Like Cullinan I, it is held in place by a yellow gold enclosure, which is screwed onto the crown [37]\n\n\nCullinan III\nCullinan III, or the Lesser Star of Africa, is pear-cut and weighs 94.4 carats (18.88 g) [34] In 1911, Queen Mary, wife and queen consort of George V, had it set in the top cross pattée of a crown that she personally bought for her coronation [42] In 1912, the Delhi Durbar Tiara, worn the previous year by Mary instead of a crown at the Delhi Durbar, where her husband wore the Imperial Crown of India, was also adapted to take Cullinans III and IV [43] In 1914, Cullinan III was permanently replaced on the crown by a crystal model Elizabeth II frequently wore Cullinan III in combination with Cullinan IV as a brooch In total, the brooch is 6.5 cm (2.6 in) long and 2.4 cm (0.94 in) wide [44] Cullinan III has also been used as a pendant on the Coronation Necklace, where it occasionally replaced the 22.4-carat (4.48 g) Lahore Diamond [45] [46]\n\n\nCullinan IV\nCullinan IV, also referred to as a Lesser Star of Africa, is square-cut and weighs 63.6 carats (12.72 g) [34] It was also set in the base of Queen Mary's Crown but was removed in 1914 On 25 March 1958, while she and Prince Philip were on a state visit to the Netherlands, Queen Elizabeth II revealed that Cullinan III and IV are known in her family as \"Granny's Chips\" They visited the Asscher Diamond Company, where Cullinan had been cut 50 years earlier It was the first time the Queen had worn the brooch publicly During her visit, she unpinned the brooch and offered it for examination to Louis Asscher, nephew of Joseph Asscher, who split the rough diamond Aged 84, he was deeply moved that the Queen had brought the diamonds with her, knowing how much it would mean to him seeing them again after so many years [47]\n\n\nCullinan V\nCullinan V is an 18.8-carat (3.76 g) heart-shaped diamond set in the centre of a platinum brooch that formed a part of the stomacher made for Queen Mary to wear at the Delhi Durbar in 1911 The brooch was designed to show off Cullinan V and is pavé-set with a border of smaller diamonds It can be suspended from the VIII brooch and can be used to suspend the VII pendant It was often worn like this by Mary [45] In May 2023, the brooch was placed on the front of cross Queen Mary's Crown for the Coronation of Queen Camilla instead of the traditional and controversial Koh-i-Noor [48]\n\n\nCullinan VI\nCullinan VI is marquise-cut and weighs 11.5 carats (2.30 g) [34] It hangs from the brooch containing Cullinan VIII and forming part of the stomacher of the Delhi Durbar parure Cullinan VI along with VIII can also be fitted together to make yet another brooch, surrounded by some 96 smaller diamonds The design was created around the same time that the Cullinan V heart-shaped brooch was designed, both having a similar shape [49]\n\n\nCullinan VII\nCullinan VII is also marquise-cut and weighs 8.8 carats (1.76 g) [34] It was originally given by Edward VII to his wife and consort Queen Alexandra After his death she gave the jewel to Queen Mary, who had it set as a pendant hanging from the diamond-and-emerald Delhi Durbar necklace, part of the parure [50]\n\n\nCullinan VIII\nCullinan VIII is an oblong-cut diamond weighing 6.8 carats (1.36 g) [34] It is set in the centre of a brooch forming part of the stomacher of the Delhi Durbar parure Together with Cullinan VI it forms a brooch [49]\n\n\nCullinan IX\nCullinan IX is smallest of the principal diamonds to be obtained from the rough Cullinan It is a pendeloque or stepped pear-cut stone, weighs 4.39 carats (0.878 g), and is set in a platinum ring known as the Cullinan IX Ring [51]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nGeneral and cited references\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

The film is based on real events that took place in September 1944, during the German occupation of the Netherlands. It is a story of love, loss, and sacrifice, set against the backdrop of one of the most pivotal moments in Dutch history.\n\n# Plot\n\nThe film is set in the province of Zeeland, where a young woman named Teuntje Visser works in the office of a collaborationist mayor. Teuntje and her father, a doctor, choose to remain neutral in the face of the Nazi occupation, while her younger brother Dirk joins the Dutch Resistance. Dirk is arrested for throwing a rock at a German convoy and is subsequently tortured into revealing the names of other Resistance members.\n\nAs the Allies approach from Belgium, the situation becomes increasingly dire for the Resistance and their families. Teuntje's father is forced to make a difficult decision that will have far-reaching consequences, while Dirk is forced to confront the harsh realities of war.\n\n# Cast\n\nThe film features a talented cast of Dutch actors, including Gijs Blom, Tijn Docter, and Marwa Lakhal. The cast brings to life the characters of Teuntje, Dirk, and other members of the Resistance, adding depth and nuance to the story.\n\n# Production\n\nThe Forgotten Battle was produced by Alain de Levita, Paula van der Oest, and Mark van Eeuwen, with EO and NPO serving as co-producers. The film received funding from CoBo, the Netherlands Film Fund, the Flemish Audiovisual Fund, and the Belgian Tax Shelter. The project also had the support of Netflix, which co-produced the film and made it their first Dutch production.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Lithuania, the Netherlands, and Belgium, with a budget of around €14 million. This is the second-most expensive Dutch film made to date, after Black Book (Dutch: Zwartboek) in 2006. The film was shot primarily in Dutch and English, with some German dialogue.\n\n# Development\n\nThe development of The Forgotten Battle began several years ago, when writer Sanne van der Velden began researching the events of September 1944. Van der Velden was inspired by the stories of her own family members who were involved in the Dutch Resistance, and she wanted to create a film that would honor their memory and legacy.\n\nThe script was written over several years, with input from the producers and the director. The film's themes of love, loss, and sacrifice were woven throughout the story, which is based on real events.\n\n# Filming\n\nPrincipal photography for The Forgotten Battle began in Lithuania, where a large part of the movie was filmed. The film's cinematographer, Rogier Stoffers, worked with the cast and crew to capture the beauty and brutality of war. The film's locations included Middelburg, Zeeland, and the port city of Vlissingen, as well as parts of Limburg, Belgium, and the Sint-Truiden area.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Joris de Vijlder, who used a combination of orchestral and choral music to create a haunting and emotive soundtrack. The film's sound design was handled by Sander de Rooij, who worked to create a realistic and immersive audio experience.\n\n# Release\n\nA first trailer for The Forgotten Battle was released in November 2020, giving audiences their first glimpse of the film's stunning visuals and powerful story. The film had a premiere in Vlissingen on 14 December 2020, and it was originally scheduled for a theatrical release in the Netherlands a few days later.\n\nHowever, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film's release was postponed to 5 June 2021. The film was eventually broadcast on EO on 24 December 2021, and it was streaming on Netflix as of 15 October 2021.\n\n# Reception\n\nThe Forgotten Battle received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 100% based on 8 reviews, with an average score of 8.1/10. The film's powerful story and stunning visuals were praised by critics, who noted its ability to evoke a strong emotional response from audiences.\n\nThe film's success was also reflected in its viewership numbers. On Netflix, The Forgotten Battle ranked in the top 10 non-English language movies, with 60.93 million hours watched in the first 28 days on the platform.\n\nIn conclusion, The Forgotten Battle is a powerful and emotional film that tells the story of love, loss, and sacrifice during one of the most pivotal moments in Dutch history. The film's talented cast, stunning visuals, and haunting soundtrack all contribute to a viewing experience that is both immersive and unforgettable.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Forgotten_Battle\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nIn September 1944, Teuntje Visser works in the office of a collaborationist mayor in German-occupied Zeeland as the Allies approach from Belgium While she and her father, a doctor, choose to be neutral, her younger brother Dirk is a member of the Dutch Resistance who is arrested for throwing a rock at a German convoy and is tortured into revealing the names of other Resistance members  \n\n\nCast\nMatthijs van Heijningen, Jr directed the film Alain de Levita, Paula van der Oest, and Mark van Eeuwen served as producers EO, NPO, Belgian company Caviar joined the project as co-producers The film received funding from CoBo, Netherlands Film Fund, Flemish Audiovisual Fund, and the Belgian Tax Shelter It was announced in November 2019 that Netflix would also co-produce, making The Forgotten Battle the company's first Dutch film [2]\n\n\nProduction\nMatthijs van Heijningen, Jr directed the film Alain de Levita, Paula van der Oest, and Mark van Eeuwen served as producers EO, NPO, Belgian company Caviar joined the project as co-producers The film received funding from CoBo, Netherlands Film Fund, Flemish Audiovisual Fund, and the Belgian Tax Shelter It was announced in November 2019 that Netflix would also co-produce, making The Forgotten Battle the company's first Dutch film [2]\n\n\nDevelopment\nMatthijs van Heijningen, Jr directed the film Alain de Levita, Paula van der Oest, and Mark van Eeuwen served as producers EO, NPO, Belgian company Caviar joined the project as co-producers The film received funding from CoBo, Netherlands Film Fund, Flemish Audiovisual Fund, and the Belgian Tax Shelter It was announced in November 2019 that Netflix would also co-produce, making The Forgotten Battle the company's first Dutch film [2]\n\n\nFilming\nWith a budget of around €14 million, it is the second most expensive Dutch film made after Black Book (Dutch: Zwartboek) in 2006 [3] It was shot primarily in Dutch and English with some German  Principal photography began in Lithuania where a large part of the movie was filmed and continued in the Netherlands and in Belgium Locations in the Netherlands included Middelburg, Zeeland and the port city of Vlissingen Some parts of the battle were filmed in and near Limburg, Belgium and in the Sint-Truiden area [4] [5]\n\n\nRelease\nA first trailer was released in November 2020 [6] The film had a premiere in Vlissingen on 14 December 2020 It was originally scheduled for a theatrical release in the Netherlands a few days later, but it was postponed to 5 June 2021 [7] [8] EO broadcast the film on 24 December 2021 [9] and it was streaming on Netflix as of 15 October 2021 [10] The movie ranked in Netflix's all-time top 10 non-English language movies with 60.93 million hours watched in the first 28 days on the platform [11]\n\n\nReception\nRotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 100% based on 8 reviews with an average score of 8.1/10 [10]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

[9] Dini stated, \" [...] she could crack a joke and the henchmen would laugh, and the Joker would kind of glare at her\" [13] The character idea dated back in 1991, after Dini came across a dream sequence, while watching a VHS tape of the soap opera Days of Our Lives, seeing his college friend Arleen Sorkin play a jester Dini then based Harley Quinn on Sorkin, incorporating aspects such as her mannerisms and \"very snappy, wisecracking, bubbly blonde\" personality [13] [10] [9] Dini even decided to have Sorkin voice her [9] [12] In recording Harley Quinn's voice, Sorkin spoke in her normal New York accent while putting in a \"little Yiddish sound\", since Dini made the character Jewish, another aspect of the character borrowed from Sorkin; [12] [14] [15] [16] Dini described her voice for the character as having \"a snappy blonde but also kind of a bad girl\": \"a little bit of Adelaide from Guys and Dolls, a little bit of Judy Holliday\", and \"a lot of Arleen\", stating that it sounded \"very close\" to Sorkin's voice [17]\n\n\nCreation and development\nHarley Quinn was created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm for the 1992 Batman: The Animated Series episode entitled \"Joker's Favor\" while Dini was writing the episode [6] Initially written as an animated equivalent of a walk-on role, Harley Quinn was intended to appear in just one episode With this, her origin was not supposed to be more than it was, making her popularity unexpected and a surprise success [7] [8] As Dini was putting together the story for the episode, he wanted to introduce a foil for the supervillain the Joker that would emphasize the Joker's comic book personality traits: funny, scary, and egotistical [9] [10] He then thought of giving Joker a henchwoman, inspired by the molls of the 1960s live-action Batman series, [8] [11] [12] and then decided she would be a \"funny counterpart to the Joker to maybe work up a little Punch and Judy attitude between them\";

What if she's not just a hench girl? We came up with the idea that she had been a doctor at Arkham Asylum and the Joker had gotten into her head and worked her into being his follower ...Then we thought, what if Harley's in the role of the long-suffering girlfriend?\"\n\n\nName origin\nMad Love establishes Harley Quinn's full name to be Harleen Frances Quinzel \"Harleen Frances\" was taken from Sorkin's first and middle name, Arleen Frances, while \"Quinzel\" came from one of Dini's former Emerson College instructors, who was surnamed Quenzel [13]\n\n\nIntroduction to mainstream DC continuity\nHarley Quinn was adapted into the mainstream DC Universe with the 1999 one-shot graphic novel Batman: Harley Quinn, written by Dini and illustrated by Yvel Guichet, [44] which put her origin in the middle of the Batman: No Man's Land story line [45] Dini changed Harley and the Joker's relationship to be darker to match the Joker's character in the comics; in the story, the Joker attempts to kill Harley at the first opportunity Harley's immunity to toxins and enhanced strength and agility, which were gained from a special formula created by Poison Ivy, were carried over from Batman: The Animated Series, with Dini stating that they would give her a sort of \"physical edge\" over Batman and other heroes [20] [44]\n\n\nFirst ongoing series\n\" [The series] is an interesting assignment because the main character is a) insane and b) a criminal, and both of these things are pretty essential to the character, so we don't want to get rid of either of them  [...]  [We] hammered out a direction for the book which  [...] will establish a motivation and agenda for Harley Depending on the storyline, she will be on the side of the angels sometimes, and on the side of the demons and devils on others Like most great crime characters, she's not concerned with the law What concerns her is something totally different What that is will be revealed as the first half dozen issues progress\".\n\n\nGotham City Sirens\nHarley Quinn then joins forces with Poison Ivy (Pamela Isley) and Catwoman (Selina Kyle) in the series Gotham City Sirens In Gotham City Sirens #7, Harley Quinn visits her family in her hometown of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, during the holiday season Harley's father is a swindler who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the \"villain and hero stuff\" The dysfunctional, \"horrible\" experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together Following several adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum, intending to kill the Joker for his years of abuse towards her However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release the Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates [133] Harley and the Joker are eventually defeated by Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straitjacket and muzzle [121] Shortly afterward, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps her kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman [122] During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says she saw good in them and only wanted to help As Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape [134]\n\n\nThe New 52\n\"One thing that we're trying to show with her, and I don't think it gets played with enough with Harley, is here's a woman who was a very intelligent and very manipulative doctor We're trying to play up that quality She is crazy, but there is something behind the madness In the new DCU maybe everyone doesn't get shipped off to Arkham Asylum Some people may have to do hard time and get shipped off to Belle Reve  [the prison the Suicide Squad operates out of], and her presence here doesn't mean she hasn't been or won't end up in Arkham Basically, we needed a bad girl character, and the best bad girl character in the DCU is Harley Quinn\".\n\n\nSuicide Squad\n\"One thing that we're trying to show with her, and I don't think it gets played with enough with Harley, is here's a woman who was a very intelligent and very manipulative doctor We're trying to play up that quality She is crazy, but

Suicide Squad operates out of], and her presence here doesn't mean she hasn't been or won't end up in Arkham Basically, we needed a bad girl character, and the best bad girl character in the DCU is Harley Quinn\".\n\n\nNew origin\nIn the seventh issue of Suicide Squad, Glass revised Harley Quinn's origin story, making it reflect the Joker's origins In the story, the Joker takes Harleen Quinzel to the chemical plant where he originated and pushes her into a vat of chemicals against her will, which bleaches her skin and drives her insane, resulting in her transformation to Harley Quinn [65] This origin was received negatively by fans, who felt that its removal of Harley Quinn's choice to become the Joker's accomplice willingly, as depicted in her previous origin stories, took out an essential part of her character [65]\n\n\nSecond ongoing series\nHarley Quinn's second ongoing series, written by husband and wife Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner, with the interior art illustrated by Chad Hardin and John Timms, explored Harley Quinn leaving Gotham City and starting her own life in her hometown of Brooklyn, depicting her as a landlord in Coney Island, where she shares an apartment building with a supporting cast of \"sideshow freaks\" [66] [12] [67] [68] [69] Considered to be the most defining writers to work on the character since Dini and Timm, Palmiotti and Conner reinvented Harley Quinn as an antihero who has left her controlling relationship with the Joker behind [22] [70] [71]\n\n\nControversies\nThe cover of the first issue of the New 52's Suicide Squad title drew controversy for its sexual depiction of Harley Quinn [12] This also caused some fans of the character to send Adam Glass hate mail and personal threats [62]\n\n\nDC Rebirth\nIn June 2016, the DC Rebirth event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles Both Harley Quinn as well as Suicide Squad were rebooted, with the latter starting with the one-shot issue Suicide Squad: Rebirth #1 (October 2016) Harley Quinn's DC Rebirth design included pink and blue dyed hair tips and a jacket inspired by Margot Robbie's portrayal of the character in the 2016 film Suicide Squad, a change established in the last issues of her New 52 series [82] [83]\n\n\nHarley Loves Joker\nIn 2017, Harley Quinn co-creator Paul Dini wrote a backup feature for Harley Quinn's Rebirth monthly series entitled Harley Loves Joker, co-written by Palmiotti and illustrated by Bret Blevins, which ran for 9 issues [91] The story brought back Harley Quinn's classic characterization and focuses on her past with the Joker Unlike her characterization in Batman: The Animated Series, Dini and Palmiotti wrote Harley Quinn in the story as less of a \"doormat\", with Harley Quinn and Joker being on equal footing in their relationship [92] The story concluded with the two-part limited series of the same name, which also expanded on Harley Quinn's past as a former intern in animal research at S.T.A.R Labs, where she met her pet hyenas Bud and Lou [93] In the second part of the story, Dini and Palmiotti explained Harley Quinn's change in costume, establishing the character's modern design as a reflection of her having left her relationship with the Joker [94] [95]\n\n\nInfinite Frontier\nHarley Quinn moves back to Gotham City in an attempt to reestablish herself as a hero, aiding the Batman Family and trying to make up for her past \"where she often enabled the Joker\" [96]\n\n\nPowers, abilities, and equipment\nHarley Quinn possesses multiple superhuman abilities, having won a gymnastics scholarship at Gotham City's Gotham State University [100] [101] [20] Following her transition to the main DC canon in 1999, Harley Quinn was established as having immunity to toxins and enhanced strength, agility, durability, and reflexes, which she received after having been injected with a serum concocted by Poison Ivy [100] \"Vengeance Unlimited, Part Five\" (Harley Quinn vol 1 #30) revealed that it also gave her the ability to breathe underwater [102] She is strong enough to lift 900-1600 lbs as she is Peak human level in DC and possesses Low Superhuman levels of Strength.\n\n\nRomantic interests\nHarley Quinn has had several love interests, the most notable being the Joker and Poison Ivy Other love interests include Mason Macabre, a character created by Conner and Palmiotti [109] Plastic Man was initially intended to be a love interest for Harley Quinn by Kesel, but was not approved by DC [110]\n\n\nThe Joker\n\"So Harley in her earlier incarnation really felt like she was the one for the Joker, that she could catch him and cure him and bring him back to humanity But actually, in the process, she lost hers Before she knew it she had fallen head-over-heels in love with him I think initially he was looking to play her and get what he could out of her, and then realized he had opened Pandora's box and this woman in her madness could match him at just about anything he does I think he finds that, in some ways, very sexy and attractive But he's not really set up to love in the way a regular person is I think there are sparks and intensity and weird passion of a sort to their relationship, but I would not call it a loving relationship in the traditional sense\".\n\n\nPoison Ivy\nPoison Ivy is Harley Quinn's current love interest and best friend, and Harley often refers to her as \"Red\" [119] Ivy was first introduced as a new friend to Harley by Dini in the 1993 Batman: The Animated Series episode \"Harley and Ivy\" [120] The episode came from Dini wanting to make Harley a stronger character and write a story where she leaves the Joker; Dini decided to pair her up with Ivy because she was \"the strongest contrast to Harley\" [120] The two later became close friends within the DC Animated Universe Dini stated that he could see a romantic relationship between the two happening the more he worked with the two characters, but the impossibility of properly portraying their relationship in a kid's cartoon at the time prevented it from happening [39]\n\n\nCharacter biography\nHarley Quinn first appeared in Batman: The Animated Series (1992–1995), voiced by Arleen Sorkin, who subsequently reprised her role in other DC Animated Universe series, including Superman: The Animated Series (1996–2000), The New

fight, Catwoman says she saw good in them and only wanted to help As Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape [134]\n\n\nThe New 52 and DC Rebirth\nLike her previous

comics of the year [136] DC Comics Publisher Jim Lee refers to Harley Quinn as the fourth pillar in their publishing line, behind Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman [137] [17] [72] Harley Quinn currently stars in four separate ongoing series — three eponymous titles and Suicide Squad Only Batman and Superman have comparable numbers of monthly appearances, making Harley Quinn the most prominent and profitable female character [137] Kevin Kiniry, vice-president of DC Collectibles, says Harley Quinn is always a top-seller and she \"can go toe-to-toe with Batman and the Joker as one of the most fan-requested and sought-after characters\" [137] In 2016, Harley Quinn's Halloween costume ranked as the most popular costume in both the United States and the United Kingdom and it

just an unnamed Joker \"hench-wench\"  [with] no discernible personality When  [Sorkin] began reading her lines in that unforgettable voice so poignant  [and] full of heart I nearly fell off my chair! She brought SO much more than was on the page  [and] a legend was born\" [143]\n\n\nCollected editions\nThis section lists the collected editions, from trade paperbacks to omnibus editions, of various

She was created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm for the 1992 Batman: The Animated Series episode entitled \"Joker's Favor\" while Dini was writing the episode.\n\n**History**\n\nHarley Quinn was created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm for the 1992 Batman: The Animated Series episode entitled \"Joker's Favor\" while Dini was writing the episode. Initially written as an animated equivalent of a walk-on role, Harley Quinn was intended to appear in just one episode. With this, her origin was not supposed to be more than it was, making her popularity unexpected and a surprise success.\n\nAs Dini was putting together the story for the episode, he wanted to introduce a foil for the supervillain the Joker that would emphasize the Joker's comic book personality traits: funny, scary, and egotistical. He then thought of giving Joker a henchwoman, inspired by the molls of the 1960s live-action Batman series, and decided she would be a \"funny counterpart to the Joker to maybe work up a little Punch and Judy attitude between them\".\n\nThe character idea dated back in 1991, after Dini came across a dream sequence, while watching a VHS tape of the soap opera Days of Our Lives, seeing his college friend Arleen Sorkin play a jester. Dini then based Harley Quinn on Sorkin, incorporating aspects such as her mannerisms and \"very snappy, wisecracking, bubbly blonde\" personality.\n\nDini even decided to have Sorkin voice her. In recording Harley Quinn's voice, Sorkin spoke in her normal New York accent while putting in a \"little Yiddish sound\", since Dini made the character Jewish, another aspect of the character borrowed from Sorkin. Dini described her voice for the character as having \"a snappy blonde but also kind of a bad girl\": \"a little bit of Adelaide from Guys and Dolls, a little bit of Judy Holliday\", and \"a lot of Arleen\", stating that it sounded \"very close\" to Sorkin's voice.\n\n**Expanded Role**\n\n\"Eventually each of the directors wanted to do a Harley episode, so the character began to appear in stories without the Joker. Over the years she allied herself with best gal pal Poison Ivy for occasional romps through Gotham and has even succeeded in giving Batman a hard time on her own. We now look upon Harley as our series' wild card, capable of showing up anytime to bedevil our heroes with her screwball antics.\"\n\n**Transition to Comic Books**\n\nBecause of her popularity, Harley Quinn was adapted into DC's comic books. In September 1993 (cover date), a year following Harley Quinn's first appearance in Batman: The Animated Series, the character made her comic book debut in the 12th issue of The Batman Adventures, a series set in the universe of The Animated Series, and became a regular character.\n\n**Origin Story**\n\n\"Bruce and I... were talking about what if there was some sort of surprise to her origin? What if she's not just a hench girl? We came up with the idea that she had been a doctor at Arkham Asylum and the Joker had gotten into her head and worked her into being his follower... Then we thought, what if Harley's in the role of the long-suffering girlfriend?\"\n\n**Name Origin**\n\nMad Love establishes Harley Quinn's full name to be Harleen Frances Quinzel. \"Harleen Frances\" was taken from Sorkin's first and middle name, Arleen Frances, while \"Quinzel\" came from one of Dini's former Emerson College instructors, who was surnamed Quenzel.\n\n**Introduction to Mainstream DC Continuity**\n\nHarley Quinn was adapted into the mainstream DC Universe with the 1999 one-shot graphic novel Batman: Harley Quinn, written by Dini and illustrated by Yvel Guichet, which put her origin in the middle of the Batman: No Man's Land story line.\n\n**First Ongoing Series**\n\n\" [The series] is an interesting assignment because the main character is a) insane and b) a criminal, and both of these things are pretty essential to the character, so we don't want to get rid of either of them... [We] hammered out a direction for the book which... will establish a motivation and agenda for Harley Depending on the storyline, she will be on the side of the angels sometimes, and on the side of the demons and devils on others Like most great crime characters, she's not concerned with the law What concerns her is something totally different What that is will be revealed as the first half dozen issues progress.\"\n\n**Gotham City Sirens**\n\nHarley Quinn then joins forces with Poison Ivy (Pamela Isley) and Catwoman (Selina Kyle) in the series Gotham City Sirens.

Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, during the holiday season Harley's father is a swindler who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the \"villain and hero stuff\" The dysfunctional, \"horrible\" experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together Following several adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum, intending to kill the Joker for his years of abuse towards her However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release the Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates [133] Harley and the Joker are eventually defeated by Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straitjacket and muzzle [121] Shortly afterward, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps her kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman [122] During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says she saw good in them and only wanted to help As Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape [134]\n\n\nThe New 52\n\"One thing that we're trying to show with her, and I don't think it gets played with enough with Harley, is here's a woman who was a very intelligent and very manipulative doctor We're trying to play up that quality She is crazy, but there is something behind the madness In the new DCU maybe everyone doesn't get shipped off to Arkham Asylum Some people may have to do hard time and get shipped off to Belle Reve  [the prison the Suicide Squad operates out of], and her presence here doesn't mean she hasn't been or won't end up in Arkham Basically, we needed a bad girl character, and the best bad girl character in the DCU is Harley Quinn\".\n\n\nSuicide Squad\n\"One thing that we're trying to show

Suicide Squad operates out of], and her presence here doesn't mean she hasn't been or won't end up in Arkham Basically, we needed a bad girl character, and the best bad girl character in the DCU is Harley Quinn\".\n\n\nNew origin\nIn the seventh issue of Suicide Squad, Glass revised Harley Quinn's origin story, making it reflect the Joker's origins In the story, the Joker takes Harleen Quinzel to the chemical plant where he originated and pushes her into a vat of chemicals against her will, which bleaches her skin and drives her insane, resulting in her transformation to Harley Quinn [65] This origin was received negatively by fans, who felt that its removal of Harley Quinn's choice to become the Joker's accomplice willingly, as depicted in her previous origin stories, took out an essential part of her character [65]\n\n\nSecond ongoing series\nHarley Quinn's second ongoing series, written by husband and wife Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner, with the interior art illustrated by Chad Hardin and John Timms, explored Harley Quinn leaving Gotham City and starting her own life in her hometown of Brooklyn, depicting her as a landlord in Coney Island, where she shares an apartment building with a supporting cast of \"sideshow freaks\" [66] [12] [67] [68] [69] Considered to be the most defining writers to work on the character since Dini and Timm, Palmiotti and Conner reinvented Harley Quinn as an antihero who has left her controlling relationship with the Joker behind [22] [70] [71]\n\n\nControversies\nThe cover of the first issue of the New 52's Suicide Squad title drew controversy for its sexual depiction of Harley Quinn [12] This also caused some fans of the character to send Adam Glass hate mail and personal threats [62]\n\n\nDC Rebirth\nIn June 2016, the DC Rebirth event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles Both Harley Quinn as well as Suicide Squad were rebooted, with the latter starting with the one-shot issue Suicide Squad: Rebirth #1 (October 2016) Harley Quinn's DC Rebirth design included pink and blue dyed hair tips and a jacket inspired by Margot Robbie's portrayal of the character in the 2016 film Suicide Squad, a change established in the last issues of her New 52 series [82] [83]\n\n\nHarley Loves Joker\nIn 2017, Harley Quinn co-creator Paul Dini wrote a backup feature for Harley Quinn's Rebirth monthly series entitled Harley Loves Joker, co-written by Palmiotti and illustrated by Bret Blevins, which ran for 9 issues [91] The story brought back Harley Quinn's classic characterization and focuses on her past with the Joker Unlike her characterization in Batman: The Animated Series, Dini and Palmiotti wrote Harley Quinn in the story as less of a \"doormat\", with Harley Quinn and Joker being on equal footing in their relationship [92] The story concluded with the two-part limited series of the same name, which also expanded on Harley Quinn's past as a former intern in animal research at S.T.A.R Labs, where she met her pet hyenas Bud and Lou [93] In the second part of the story, Dini and Palmiotti explained Harley Quinn's change in costume, establishing the character's modern design as a reflection of her having left her relationship with the Joker [94] [95]\n\n\nInfinite Frontier\nHarley Quinn moves back to Gotham City in an attempt to reestablish herself as a hero, aiding the Batman Family and trying to make up for her past \"where she often enabled the Joker\" [96]\n\n\nPowers, abilities, and equipment\nHarley Quinn possesses multiple superhuman abilities, having won a gymnastics scholarship at Gotham City's Gotham State University [100] [101] [20] Following her transition to the main DC canon in 1999, Harley Quinn was established as having immunity to toxins and enhanced strength, agility, durability, and reflexes, which she received after having been injected with a serum concocted by Poison Ivy [100] \"Vengeance Unlimited, Part Five\" (Harley Quinn vol 1 #30) revealed that it also gave her the ability to breathe underwater [102] She is strong enough to lift 900-1600 lbs as she is Peak human level in DC and possesses Low Superhuman levels of Strength.\n\n\nRomantic interests\nHarley Quinn has had several love interests, the most notable being the Joker and Poison Ivy Other love interests include Mason Macabre, a character created by Conner and Palmiotti [109] Plastic Man was initially intended to be a love interest for Harley Quinn by Kesel, but was not approved by DC [110]\n\n\nThe Joker\n\"So Harley in her earlier incarnation really felt like she was the one for the Joker, that she could catch him and cure him and bring him back to humanity But actually, in the process, she lost hers Before she knew it she had fallen head-over-heels in love with him I think initially he was looking to play her and get what he could out of her, and then realized he had opened Pandora's box and this woman in her madness could match him at just about anything he does I think he finds that, in some ways, very sexy and attractive But he's not really set up to love in the way a regular person is I think there are sparks and intensity and weird passion of a sort to their relationship, but I would not call it a loving relationship in the traditional sense\".\n\n\nPoison Ivy\nPoison Ivy is Harley Quinn's current love interest and best friend, and Harley often refers to her as \"Red\" [119] Ivy was first introduced as a new friend to Harley by Dini in the 1993 Batman: The Animated Series episode \"Harley and Ivy\" [120] The episode came from Dini wanting to make Harley a stronger character and write a story where she leaves the Joker; Dini decided to pair her up with Ivy because she was \"the strongest contrast to Harley\" [120] The two later became close friends within the DC Animated Universe Dini stated that he could see a romantic relationship between the two happening the more he worked with the two characters, but the impossibility of properly portraying their relationship in a kid's cartoon at the time prevented it from happening [39]\n\n\nCharacter biography\nHarley Quinn first appeared in

of the most fan-requested and sought-after characters\" [137] In 2016, Harley Quinn's Halloween costume ranked as the most popular costume in both the United States and the United Kingdom and it

just an unnamed Joker \"hench-wench\"  [with] no discernible personality When  [Sorkin] began reading her lines in that unforgettable voice so poignant  [and] full of heart I nearly fell off my chair! She brought SO much more than was on the page  [and] a legend was born\" [143]\n\n\nCollected editions\nThis section lists the collected editions, from trade paperbacks to omnibus editions, of various

returned home [31] [32] In a later interview, Lee said he knew how to shoot but not how to ski and that he probably would not be alive if he had been allowed to go to the front line [31] [33] [34] Lee

inclination to follow his father into the Army, Lee decided to join up while he still had some choice of service, and volunteered for the Royal Air Force [37]\n\n\nCareer\nReturning to London in 1946, Lee was offered his old job back at Beecham's with a significant raise, but he turned them down as \"I couldn't think myself back into the office frame of mind.\" The Armed Forces were sending veterans with an education in the Classics to teach at universities, but Lee felt his Latin was too rusty and didn't care for the strict curfews [69] During lunch with his cousin Nicolò Carandini, now the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Lee was detailing his war wounds when Carandini said, \"Why don't you become an actor, Christopher?\" [70] Lee liked the idea, and after assuaging his mother's protests by pointing to the successful Carandini performers in Australia (which included his great-grandmother Marie Carandini, who had been an opera singer), he met Nicolò's friend Filippo Del Giudice, a lawyer-turned-film producer and head of Two Cities Films, part of the Rank Organisation Lee recalled that Giudice \"looked me up and down\" and \"concluded that I was just what the industry had been looking for.\" He was sent to see Josef Somlo for a contract: [71]\n\n\n1947–1957: Career beginnings\nReturning to London in 1946, Lee was offered his old job back at Beecham's with a

(1978) [99] He turned down the role of Dr Barry Rumack (finally played by Leslie Nielsen) in the disaster spoof Airplane!

coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa [7] [117] In the late 1950s, Lee was engaged to Countess Henriette Ewa Agnes von Rosen, whom he had met at a nightclub in Stockholm [157] Her father, Count Fritz von Rosen, proved demanding, getting them to delay the wedding for a year, asking his London-based friends to interview Lee, hiring private detectives to investigate him, and asking Lee to provide him with references, which Lee obtained from Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Boulting, and Joe Jackson [158] Lee found the meeting of her extended family to be like something from a surrealist Luis Buñuel film, and thought they were \"killing me with cream.\" [159] Finally, Lee had to have the permission of the King of Sweden to marry Lee had met him some years before while filming Tales of Hans Anderson, where he received his blessing [159] However, shortly before the wedding, Lee ended the engagement He was concerned that his financial insecurity in

"Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Christopher_Lee\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nLee was born on 27 May 1922 in Belgravia, London, [2] the son of Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Trollope Lee (1879–1941) of the 60th King's Royal Rifle Corps, and his wife, Countess Estelle Marie (née Carandini di Sarzano; 1889–1981) [3] [4] Lee's father fought in the Boer War and First World War, [5] and his mother was an Edwardian beauty who was painted by Sir John Lavery, Oswald Birley, and Olive Snell, and sculpted by Clare Sheridan [6] [7] Lee's maternal great-grandfather, Jerome Carandini, the Marquis of Sarzano, was an Italian political refugee; his wife, Lee's great-grandmother, was English-born opera singer Marie Carandini (née Burgess) He had an elder sister, Xandra Carandini Lee (1917–2002) [8]\n\n\nMilitary service\nWhen the Second World War broke out in 1939, Lee had enrolled in a military academy and volunteered to fight for the Finnish Army against the Soviet Union during the Winter War [30] He and other British volunteers were kept away from the actual fighting, but they were issued with winter gear and were posted on guard duty a safe distance from the border After two weeks in Finland, they returned home [31] [32] In a later interview, Lee said he knew how to shoot but not how to ski and that he probably would not be alive if he had been allowed to go to the front line [31] [33] [34] Lee returned to work at United States Lines and found his work more satisfying, feeling that he was contributing In early 1940, he joined Beecham's, at first as an office clerk, then as a switchboard operator [35] When Beecham's moved out of London, he joined the Home Guard [36] In the winter, his father fell ill with bilateral pneumonia and died on 12 March 1941 Realising that he had no inclination to follow his father into the Army, Lee decided to join up while he still had some choice of service, and volunteered for the Royal Air Force [37]\n\n\nCareer\nReturning to London in 1946, Lee was offered his old job back at Beecham's with a significant raise, but he turned them down as \"I couldn't think myself back into the office frame of mind.\" The Armed Forces were sending veterans with an education in the Classics to teach at universities, but Lee felt his Latin was too rusty and didn't care for the strict curfews [69] During lunch with his cousin Nicolò Carandini, now the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Lee was detailing his war wounds when Carandini said, \"Why don't you become an actor, Christopher?\" [70] Lee liked the idea, and after assuaging his mother's protests by pointing to the successful Carandini performers in Australia (which included his great-grandmother Marie Carandini, who had been an opera singer), he met Nicolò's friend Filippo Del Giudice, a lawyer-turned-film producer and head of Two Cities Films, part of the Rank Organisation Lee recalled that Giudice \"looked me up and down\" and \"concluded that I was just what the industry had been looking for.\" He was sent to see Josef Somlo for a contract: [71]\n\n\n1947–1957: Career beginnings\nReturning to London in 1946, Lee was offered his old job back at Beecham's with a significant raise, but he turned them down as \"I couldn't think myself back into the office frame of mind.\" The Armed Forces were sending veterans with an education in the Classics to teach at universities, but Lee felt his Latin was too rusty and didn't care for the strict curfews [69] During lunch with his cousin Nicolò Carandini, now the

lawyer-turned-film producer and head of Two Cities Films, part of the Rank Organisation Lee recalled that Giudice \"looked me up and down\" and \"concluded that I was just what the industry had been looking for.\" He was sent to see Josef Somlo for a contract: [71]\n\n\n1957–1976: Work with Hammer\nLee's first film for Hammer was The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), in which he played Frankenstein's monster, with Peter Cushing as Baron Victor Frankenstein [74] It was the first film to co-star Lee and Cushing, who ultimately appeared together in over twenty films and became close friends [72] [76] When he arrived at a casting session for the film, \"they asked me if I wanted the part, I said yes and that was that.\" [75] A little later, Lee co-starred with Boris Karloff in the film Corridors of Blood (1958) Lee had previously appeared with Karloff in 1955 in the \"At Night, All Cats are Grey\" episode of the British television series Colonel March of Scotland Yard [78] Karloff and Lee were London neighbours for a time in the mid-1960s [79]\n\n\n1977–1999: Move to Hollywood\nIn 1977, Lee left the UK for the US, concerned at being typecast in horror films, as had happened to his close friends Peter Cushing and Vincent Price [67] His first American appearance was in the disaster film Airport '77 (1977) In 1978, Lee surprised many people with his willingness to go along with a joke, appearing as guest host on NBC's Saturday Night Live [72] Steven Spielberg, who was in the audience for that show, cast him in 1941 (1979) [72] Meanwhile, Lee co-starred with Bette Davis in the Disney film Return from Witch Mountain (1978) [99] He turned down the role of Dr Barry Rumack (finally played by Leslie Nielsen) in the disaster spoof Airplane! (1980), a decision he later called \"a big mistake.\" [72]\n\n\n2000–2009: Resurgence in franchise films\nLee had many television roles These included the role Flay in the BBC television miniseries Gormenghast (2000) based on Mervyn Peake's novels He also appeared as Lucas de Beaumanoir, the Grand Master of the Knights Templar, in the BBC/A&E co-production of Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe (1997) [103]\n\n\n2010–2015: Later roles\nIn 2004, Lee lamented that Hollywood scripts were mainly spin-offs, as people were afraid of taking financial risks, commenting that he was mostly being offered spin-offs of Lord of the Rings or Star Wars [94] In 2010, he marked his fourth collaboration with Tim Burton by voicing the Jabberwock in Burton's adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic book Alice in Wonderland, alongside Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway [76] [115] Lee respected Depp as \"a fellow survivor\", [124] describing him as \"inventive and  [having] enormous versatility\" [124] In 2010, Lee received the Steiger Award (Germany) and, [125] in February 2011, Lee was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship [126]\n\n\nMusic career\nWith his operatic [144] bass voice, Lee sang on The Wicker Man soundtrack, performing Paul Giovanni's composition, \"The Tinker of Rye.\" [145] He sang the closing credits song of the 1994 horror film Funny Man [146] In 1977, he appeared on Peter Knight and Bob Johnson's (from Steeleye Span) concept album The King of Elfland's Daughter [147]\n\n\nPersonal life\nThe Carandinis, Lee's maternal ancestors, were given the right to bear the coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa [7] [117] In the late 1950s, Lee was engaged to Countess Henriette Ewa Agnes von Rosen, whom he had met at a nightclub in Stockholm [157] Her father, Count Fritz von Rosen, proved demanding, getting them to delay the wedding for a year, asking his London-based friends to interview Lee, hiring private detectives to investigate him, and asking Lee to provide him with references, which Lee obtained from Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Boulting, and Joe Jackson [158] Lee found the meeting of her extended family to be like something from a surrealist Luis Buñuel film, and thought they were \"killing me with cream.\" [159] Finally, Lee had to have the permission of the King of Sweden to marry Lee had met him some years before while filming Tales of Hans Anderson, where he received his blessing [159] However, shortly before the wedding, Lee ended the engagement He was concerned that his financial insecurity in his chosen profession meant that she \"deserved better\" than being \"pitched into the dishevelled world of an actor.\" She understood, and they called the wedding off [160]\n\n\nFamily and relationships\nThe Carandinis, Lee's maternal ancestors, were given the right to bear the coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa [7] [117] In the late 1950s, Lee was

actor.\" She understood, and they called the wedding off [160]\n\n\nPhysical characteristics and beliefs\nLee was known for his imposing height of 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) [166] [67] On BBC Radio's Test Match Special \"View from the Boundary\" interview with Brian Johnston on 20 June 1987, Lee described himself as being 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) tall [167] Lee and his wife Birgit were listed among the fifty best-dressed over 50s by The Guardian in March 2013 [168]\n\n\nDeath\nLee died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on 7 June 2015 at the age of 93 The cause of death was heart failure His wife delayed the public announcement until 11 June, informing his family of the death before releasing the news to the press [175] [176] [177]\n\n\nHonours and legacy\nLee was the subject of the BBC's This Is Your Life in 1974, where he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews [183] In 1994, for his influence on the horror genre, he received the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement [184] In 1997, he was appointed a Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John [185] On 16 June 2001, as part of that year's Queen's Birthday Honours, Lee was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire \"for services to Drama.\" [186] [187] He was made a Knight Bachelor \"For services to Drama and to Charity\" on 13 June as part of the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2009 [188] The French government made him a Commander of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2011 [189]\n\n\nWorks\nNote: Lee was 'ghost-editor' on the above series, which was edited by the anthologist Michel

Lebanese descent, [2] and Nancy (née Lee), of Scots-Irish, Swiss, and Welsh descent [2] [3] His family name is adapted from the original Greek name \"Christodoulos\" [4] As a child, Crist moved to St Petersburg, Florida, where he attended Riviera Junior High School and St Petersburg High School, from which he graduated in 1974 He is the second of four children and has three sisters: Margaret Crist

1981, and passing the bar on his third attempt, [8] Crist was hired as general counsel to Minor League Baseball, which was headquartered in St Petersburg Drawn to politics, Crist was a candidate for public office for the first time in 1986, in the Republican primary for a state Senate seat in Pinellas County After losing in a runoff, Crist joined his brother-in-law in private practice in St Petersburg, but soon returned to politics as an aide on the successful 1988 United States Senate campaign of Connie Mack III, whom he has since described as his political mentor [9]\n\n\nFlorida Senate\nIn 1992, Crist was elected to a two-year term to the Florida Senate from the 20th District, which encompassed parts of St Petersburg and South Tampa [10] He defeated longtime incumbent

the districts in the Tampa Bay area [11] His victory was credited with helping to end the Democratic Party's 128-year control of the Florida Senate, as the Republicans netted three seats in 1992, resulting in a 20–20 tie between the parties [11]\n\n\nU.S. Senate campaign and Florida education commissioner\nCrist gained recognition in 1998 as the Republican challenger to incumbent Democratic U.S senator Bob Graham Crist campaigned conservatively on taxation, crime, and the ongoing Lewinsky scandal, but agreed with Graham on issues such as healthcare and statehood for Puerto Rico Crist

appointed by Governor Jeb Bush to serve as the deputy secretary of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation in 1999 upon the conclusion of his Senate service [16] He served until 2000, when he ran for Florida education commissioner in a November special election created by the resignation of incumbent commissioner Tom Gallagher He won by over 500,000 votes and assumed the office in January 2001 [17] Crist would ultimately be the last statewide elected education commissioner, as a 1998 amendment to the Constitution of Florida turned the position into one appointed by the governor of Florida after his departure [9] Crist left the office after he was elected attorney general in 2002.\n\n\nFlorida attorney general\nIn 2002, Crist was elected Florida attorney general His candidacy was supported by the host of America's Most Wanted, John Walsh Walsh and other supporters cited his work with the Center for Missing and Exploited Children [18] [19]\n\n\nGovernor of

improve the state education system, reduce crime, lower drug costs, expand access to health insurance, assist senior citizens, and protect the environment [21] However, his promise to lower taxes would prove to be difficult to keep during the Great Recession, and he eventually relented in 2009 after being sent a budget by the Florida legislature which included a 2.2 billion dollar raise in taxes and fees [22] He also had a mixed record on environmental issues [23] [24] [25] [26]\n\n\nTenure\nCrist was sworn in on January 3, 2017 He was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, [95] the New

president Donald Trump, with guests paying $500 to attend Two of the guests became subjects of controversy [34] Crist returned $1,000 in campaign contributions to one of those guests as a result [35]\n\n\nRole in the 2008 presidential election\nSenator John McCain endorsed Crist's 2006 campaign for governor, traveling the state to campaign with him The day before the general election, Crist held a campaign event with McCain in Jacksonville Later, when the Republican presidential primary debates were held in St Petersburg, Crist embraced McCain Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who had also campaigned for Crist during the gubernatorial election, had sought his endorsement [38] [39] [40] [41]\n\n\n2010 U.S. Senate campaign\nOn May 12, 2009, Crist announced that he would not run for reelection as governor in 2010, making him the first Florida governor not to run for reelection since 1964 [54] Instead he ran for the US Senate His two main opponents were former Florida House speaker Marco Rubio, [55] [56] and U.S representative Kendrick Meek [57]\n\n\nHiatus (2011–2014)\nIn January 2011, Crist joined the Tampa office of national personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan after expressing an interest in returning to the legal field during his final week in office as governor of Florida Crist worked primarily in the firm's class-action sector as a complex-litigation attorney, serving as a \"rainmaker\" for the firm [66] In November 2016, after almost six years with the firm, he was elected to represent Florida's 13th congressional district [67] In February 2018, Brad Slager of Sunshine State News, cited evidence that Morgan & Morgan was \"attempting to purge all evidence\" of its relationship with Crist now that he was a \"rookie congressman\" with \"little-to-no power\" [68]\n\n\nParty switch and The Party's Over\nOn December 7, 2012, Crist announced that he had joined the Democratic Party [75] In July 2013, Crist began writing a book, with Newsday columnist Ellis Henican, about his political transition [76] [77] The book, The Party's Over: How the Extreme Right Hijacked the GOP and I Became a Democrat, was released in February 2014 [78] [79] [80] In the book, Crist claimed that his career in the Republican Party was destroyed by a hug between him and Obama at a Fort Myers town hall on February 10, 2009 \"It was the kind of hug I'd exchanged with thousands and thousands of Floridians over the years\", Crist wrote \"I didn't think a thing about it as it was happening.\" But it \"ended my viable life as a Republican politician I would never have a future in my old party again My bipartisan hopes and dreams, I would discover soon enough to my shock and disappointment, were vastly overstated and hopelessly out of date.\" [81]\n\n\n2014 gubernatorial election\nOn November 1, 2013, Crist filed to run for governor as a Democrat [85] He won the Democratic nomination but was defeated in the general election by Republican incumbent Rick Scott by a vote of 2,865,343 (48%) to 2,801,198 (47%),  [6] Crist holds the rare distinction of losing a statewide general election in Florida as a

470 feet (140 m) when his vehicle collided with another near the intersection of 63rd Avenue North and Kathrene Drive [47] [48] After the crash, one officer approached Wright's vehicle with a gun drawn [49] Another officer checked Wright's pulse and after detecting one administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) while they awaited the arrival of paramedics [49] Upon arrival the paramedic

investigation\nThe Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) launched an investigation into the killing of Wright on April 12, per standard procedure, and released Potter's name as the officer who shot Wright [29] [62] [54] The Hennepin County medical examiner's office released a report on April 12 that determined the manner of death to be homicide and concluded that Wright had died as the result of a gunshot wound of the chest [63] In order to avoid conflicts of interest, although the incident took place in Hennepin County, it was reviewed by the Washington County Attorney's Office per an agreement with metropolitan counties to handle officer-involved shootings [29] Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott called on Governor Tim Walz to reassign the case to the office of the State Attorney General Keith Ellison [64]\n\n\nArrest and criminal charges\nThe Washington County Attorney's Office charged Potter on April 14 with second-degree manslaughter, pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 609.205, a felony offense entailing \"culpable negligence creating unreasonable risk\" that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years incarceration and/or a $20,000 fine [65] [34] [30] The criminal complaint against Potter stated that she caused Wright's death \"by her culpable negligence,\" whereby she \"created an unreasonable risk and consciously took a chance of causing death or great bodily harm\" to Wright [30]\n\n\nProtests and unrest\nWright's death occurred during a period of national reckoning on racial injustice and police brutality sparked by the police murder of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020 [72] The criminal trial of Derek Chauvin, the police officer who killed Floyd, was about to enter its third week when Wright was fatally shot on Sunday, April 11, 2021, in Brooklyn Center, a suburban city adjacent to Minneapolis Like Floyd's murder, Wright's death furthered public discussion about police training and accountability [72] and renewed focus on the Black Lives Matter movement [73]\n\n\nReactions\nBrooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott issued several statements on social media and at press conferences beginning the evening of the incident, expressing sympathy, urging protesters to remain peaceful, and suggesting that Potter should be fired [80] [13] Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Lt Governor Peggy Flanagan, and Senator Tina Smith made statements mourning Wright's death and commenting on the pattern of unarmed Black men killed by law enforcement [95] [96]\n\n\nPublic officials\nBrooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott issued several statements on social media and at press conferences beginning the evening of the incident, expressing sympathy, urging protesters to remain peaceful, and suggesting that Potter should be fired [80] [13] Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Lt Governor Peggy Flanagan, and Senator Tina Smith made statements mourning Wright's death and commenting on the pattern of unarmed Black men killed by law enforcement [95] [96]\n\n\nPublic figures and institutions\nThe NAACP released a statement saying \"Whether it be carelessness and negligence, or a blatant modern-day lynching, the result is the same Another Black man has died at the hands of police.\" [103] Angela Rose Myers, president of the organization's Minnesota chapter, said at a press conference, “Black leaders are not playing, we are done dying in Minnesota.” [104]\n\n\nFamily\nSoon after the incident, Wright's mother spoke with reporters and said her son had phoned her during the traffic stop She said she had overheard what sounded like a scuffle and an officer saying, \"Daunte, don't run\" before the phone hung up, and that her son said he had been pulled over for having an air freshener hanging from his rear-view mirror [62]\n\n\nMemorials and funeral\nThe evening of April 11, 2021, mourners and protesters held an evening vigil for Wright near the Brooklyn Center location where he was killed [74] On April 14, 2021, protesters put up a large, wooden sculpture of a raised fist at the 63rd Avenue North and Kathrene Drive intersection where the car driven by Wright collided with another vehicle [118] [47] The sculpture had been displayed previously at George Floyd Square in Minneapolis, but it was replaced there by a version made of metal [96] People also placed memorials for Wright at the location he was shot and the location where he was pronounced dead [22]\n\n\nCriminal trial\nProsecutors filed the criminal case in Hennepin County District Court on April 14, 2021, as the State of Minnesota vs Kimberly Potter [122] Prior to the start of the case, on November 2, Judge Chu ruled that defense attorneys would be allowed to introduce evidence of \"slip and capture\" errors, a kind of human error that occurs in times of high stress [123] Trial proceedings began on November 30 in Minneapolis, at a Hennepin County Government Center courtroom Chu presiding [124]\n\n\nPre-trial

November 30 in Minneapolis, at a Hennepin County Government Center courtroom Chu presiding [124]\n\n\nTrial proceedings\nSelection for the trial's twelve jurors and two alternative jurors took place from November 30 to December 3 [50] [128] Nine of the twelve jurors seated were white, similar to the demographics of Hennepin County, one was black and two were Asian, with the jury evenly split between men and women [129] [130]\n\n\nVerdict and sentence\nAfter deliberating for 27 hours over four days, the jury found Potter guilty of first-degree manslaughter and second-degree manslaughter on December 23 [133] [134] Following the verdict, Potter was taken into custody and transferred to the state's Women's Correctional Facility in Shakopee [133] [135]\n\n\nCivil lawsuits\nWright's family hired civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who represented the family of George Floyd in a settlement with the City of Minneapolis [146] They also obtained representation from attorneys Anthony Romanucci and Jeff Storms [147] In mid 2022, the City of Brooklyn Center settled a lawsuit brought by Wright's family and agreed to pay $3.25 million to them, the third largest civil rights wrongful death settlement in Minnesota, and the largest outside of Minneapolis Terms of the settlement required the city to make changes to policing policies and improve office training, and to establish a permanent memorial to Wright at the site of a temporary one that emerged in the days after his death [148] [147]\n\n\nImpact on policing\nA month of his death, the city council passed an ordinance named after Daunte Wright and Kobe Dimock-Heisler, another black man who had been killed in an encounter with city police prior to Wright [155] The ordinance established a committee to help lead reform efforts [156] Proposed measures included creating unarmed traffic enforcement and community response teams, and prohibiting arrests or vehicle searches in certain traffic-related encounters Wright's family believed that had such policies been in place when he was stopped by police, he would not have been killed [155]\n\n\nIn Brooklyn Center\nA month of his death, the city council passed

Tribune, by April 2021 there had been 16 known cases, including Potter's killing of Wright, when a police officer in the United States fired a pistol at someone but claimed to have intended to use a Taser instead [20] Other notable incidents included a 2002 shooting in Rochester, Minnesota, [162] the fatal 2009 shooting of Oscar Grant by a Bay Area Rapid Transit officer in Oakland, California, and the deadly 2015 shooting of Eric Harris by a volunteer reserve deputy in Tulsa, Oklahoma [163] In two other situations compared to Potter—a 2018 shooting in Lawrence, Kansas, and a 2018 shooting in New Hope, Pennsylvania—officers had shouted \"Taser\" before firing their guns [164] [165] [166] [167] In the days after Wright's death, the police departments of Roeland Park, Kansas, [168] and St Ann, Missouri, [169] made changes to their Taser policies, with Roeland Park police saying they would cross draw Tasers with \"no exceptions\", and St Ann police saying they would only use yellow Tasers and require officers to carry them opposite their main weapon [168] [169] In Minnesota, Governor Tim Walz and Saint Paul Mayor Melvin Carter called for measures to better distinguish Tasers and firearms, as part of comprehensive police reform [163]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He has been a key figure in the development of electronic dance music and has collaborated with numerous artists throughout his career.\n\n## Early Life\n\nGuy-Manuel de Homem-Christo was born on 8 February 1974 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a Parisian suburb. He is the great-grandson of Portuguese poet Homem Cristo Filho and the great-great-grandson of Portuguese military figure Francisco Manuel Homem Cristo, who was forced into exile in France in 1910. This rich cultural heritage has had a significant influence on Homem-Christo's life and work.\n\nGrowing up in Paris, Homem-Christo was exposed to a wide range of musical influences, from rock to electronic music. He attended the Lycée Carnot school in Paris, where he met Thomas Bangalter, a fellow student who would become his musical partner. The two shared a passion for films and music of the 1960s and 1970s, which would later become a key element of Daft Punk's sound.\n\n## Career\n\nHomem-Christo's musical career began in the late 1980s, when he and Bangalter formed the indie rock trio Darlin'. The band performed at local clubs and bars, but ultimately disbanded in the early 1990s. It was during this time that Homem-Christo and Bangalter developed their interest in electronic dance music, which would eventually lead to the formation of Daft Punk.\n\nIn 1992, Homem-Christo and Bangalter attended a club in Paris, where they were exposed to the emerging electronic dance music scene. This experience had a profound impact on their musical style, and they soon began experimenting with electronic music. The two musicians worked tirelessly to develop their sound, drawing inspiration from a wide range of influences, from house music to jazz.\n\nThe duo's breakthrough came in 1997 with the release of their debut album, Homework. The album was a critical and commercial success, and it established Daft Punk as a major force in the electronic music scene. Homem-Christo's contribution to the album was instrumental, as he designed the iconic Daft Punk logo that appears on the cover.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nHomem-Christo has two children, a daughter and a son, with his wife, who he divorced in 2010. Despite the challenges of balancing his musical career with family life, Homem-Christo has remained committed to his craft, continuing to work on music and other projects.\n\n## Discography\n\n### Albums\n\n* Homework (1997)\n* Discovery (2001)\n* Human After All (2005)\n* Random Access Memories (2013)\n\n### Tracks\n\n* \"Da Funk\" (1997)\n* \"Daftendirk\" (1997)\n* \"One More Time\" (2000)\n* \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" (2001)\n* \"Robot Rock\" (2005)\n* \"Get Lucky\" (2013)\n* \"Instant Crush\" (2013)\n\n## Production Credits\n\nHomem-Christo has worked as a producer and composer on numerous projects, including the soundtracks for the films Le Peuple Migrateur (2001) and Tron: Legacy (2010). He has also collaborated with other artists, such as Justice and Moby.\n\n## External Links\n\n* Daft Punk official website\n* Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo on Discogs\n* Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo on IMDB", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Guy-Manuel_de_Homem-Christo\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nGuy-Manuel de Homem-Christo was born on 8 February 1974 [1] in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a Parisian suburb [2] He is the great-grandson of Portuguese poet Homem Cristo Filho  [pt], as well as the great-great-grandson of Portuguese military figure Francisco Manuel Homem Cristo, who was forced into exile in France in 1910 [3] [4]\n\n\nCareer\nGuy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met Thomas Bangalter when they attended the Lycée Carnot school in Paris in 1987 It was there that they discovered their mutual fascination for films and music of the 1960s and 1970s: \"very basic cult teenager things, from Easy Rider to the Velvet Underground\" [7] The two and Laurent Brancowitz eventually joined to form an indie rock trio called Darlin', in which Homem-Christo performed guitar Bangalter felt that \"It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time It's like, you know, everybody wants to be in a band.\" [7] A negative review referred to their music as \"a daft punky thrash\", [8] which inspired Bangalter and Homem-Christo's new name [9] The two soon became interested in electronic dance music after going to a club in 1992 Homem-Christo is credited for designing the Daft Punk logo in the liner notes of Homework (1997), the duo's first album.\n\n\nPersonal life\nHomem-Christo has two children: [28] a daughter and a son He and his wife divorced in 2010 [29]\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nProduction credits\n\n\nAlbums\n\n\nTracks\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

family with a dozen main characters [23] [24]\n\n\nWriting\nAs the film steadily became more complex, with an entire family to develop, multiple songs, and a rich cultural setting with a deep tradition of magical realism, Howard and Bush realized they needed a second screenwriter to help write the screenplay [23] They selected Charise Castro Smith for her strong background in magical realism and experience with handling \"real-world family dynamics\" [23] Bush described her as a \"godsend\", as she provided \"a foundation of heart, vulnerability and authenticity\" Castro Smith sought to create a distinct, imperfect, and completely human character in Mirabel, one that spoke to the lives of many Latinas while also being relatable to viewers globally [31]\n\n\nCasting\nDisney cast several actors with Colombian heritage, including Stephanie Beatriz, whose father is Colombian; John Leguizamo, who was born in Bogotá; and Wilmer Valderrama, who spent his childhood in Colombia, where his mother is from [33]\n\n\nDesign\nEncanto was the \"hardest film\" to date for heads of animation Renato dos Anjos and Kira Lehtomaki because they were asked to fully develop a dozen characters, as opposed to other animated films which primarily feature two or three characters out of a large cast [37] Accordingly, the characters required a degree of complexity that Disney Animation had previously never achieved [38] Journalist Edna Liliana Valencia Murillo was the Afro-Caribbean consultant and contributed greatly towards Félix, Dolores, and Antonio's designs [39]

costume design lead Neysa Bové, hoped to represent the film's various communities well Neysa requested Colombian consultants, which included an anthropologist and botanist [39]\n\n\nAnimation\nThe animators were challenged by the directors to make Mirabel distinctively different from all prior Disney heroines; she had to be both capable and imperfect, but not merely just clumsy [37] The Casita was inspired not only by traditional Colombian homes but films in which houses come alive, especially Beetlejuice (1988) [37]\n\n\nCinematography\nEncanto is the first Disney Animation film since Tangled (2010) to employ a tall frame, a decision made to \"get closer to the characters\" This layout was supplemented by romantic lighting [26]: 168  According to Howard, romantic (meaning heightened in spirit) is the film's key word in terms of the approach towards cinematography and lighting The latter was also inspired by magical realism, due to the genre's heavy influence on the writing and characters [40]\n\n\nSoundtrack\nIn June 2020, Miranda publicly revealed that he had begun to write the film's music, which would have eight original songs in both Spanish and English [48]

and columns [14] The inner circular row of drum supports and the octagonal arcade create an inner ambulatorium that encircles the holy rock.\n\n\nInterior decoration\nThe interior of the dome is lavishly decorated with mosaic, faience and marble, much of which was added several centuries after its completion It also contains Qur'anic inscriptions They vary from today's standard text (mainly changes from the first to the third person) and are mixed with pious inscriptions not in the Quran [15]\n\n\nExterior decoration\nThe decoration of the outer walls went through two major phases: the initial Umayyad scheme comprised marble and mosaics, much like the interior walls [16] 16th-century Ottoman sultan Suleyman the Magnificent replaced it with Ottoman tile decoration [16] This tilework was of many different styles and techniques, including cuerda seca tiles, multi-coloured underglaze tiles, and blue-and-white tilework, [5] resembling the Iznik tiles that were produced for the Ottoman capital [4] A small number of tiles were actual Iznik productions that were imported to Jerusalem [17] The original tiles were replaced in the 1960s with faithful copies produced in Italy [16]\n\n\nHistory\nThe Dome of the Rock is situated in the center of the Temple Mount, the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Jewish Temple, which had been greatly expanded under Herod the Great in the 1st century BCE Herod's Temple was destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans, and after the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, a Roman temple to Jupiter Capitolinus was built at the site by Emperor Hadrian [19]\n\n\nPre-Islamic background\nThe Dome of the Rock is situated in the center of the Temple Mount, the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Jewish Temple, which had been greatly expanded under Herod the Great in the 1st century BCE Herod's Temple was destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans, and after the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, a Roman temple to Jupiter Capitolinus was built at the site by Emperor Hadrian [19]\n\n\nUmayyads\nThe initial octagonal structure of the Dome of the Rock and its round wooden dome had basically the same shape as it does today [13] It was built by the order of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) [26] According to Sibt ibn al-Jawzi (1185–1256), construction started in 685/6, while al-Suyuti (1445–1505) holds that its commencement year was 688 [27] A dedicatory inscription in Kufic script is preserved inside the dome The date is recorded as AH 72 (691/2 CE), the year most historians believe the construction of the original Dome was completed [28] An alternative interpretation of the inscription claims that it indicates the year when construction started [29] In this inscription, the name of \"al-Malik\" was removed and replaced by the name of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) This alteration of the original inscription was first noted by Melchior de Vogüé in 1864 [30] Some scholars have suggested that the dome was added to an existing building, built either by Muawiyah I (r. 661–680), [31] or indeed a Byzantine building dating to before the Muslim conquest, built under Heraclius (r. 610–641) [32]\n\n\nOriginal construction\nThe initial octagonal structure of the Dome of the Rock and its round wooden dome had basically the same shape as it does today [13] It was built by the order of the Umayyad caliph Abd

construction\nNarratives by the medieval sources about Abd al-Malik's motivations in building the Dome of the Rock vary [11] At the time of its construction, the Caliph was engaged in war with Christian Byzantium and its Syrian Christian allies on the one hand and with the rival caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, who controlled Mecca, the annual destination of Muslim pilgrimage, on the other hand [11] [36] Thus, one series of explanations was that Abd al-Malik intended for the Dome of the Rock to be a religious monument of victory over the Christians that would distinguish Islam's uniqueness within the common Abrahamic religious setting of Jerusalem, home of the two older Abrahamic faiths, Judaism and Christianity [11] [37] The historian Shelomo Dov Goitein has argued that the Dome of the Rock was intended to compete with the many fine buildings of worship of other religions: \"The very form of a rotunda, given to the Qubbat as-Sakhra, although it was foreign to Islam, was destined to rival the many Christian domes\" [38] - and more specifically, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, according to others [39]\n\n\nAbbasids and Fatimids\nThe building was severely damaged by earthquakes in 808 and again in 846 [40] The dome collapsed in an earthquake in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–1023 The mosaics on the drum were repaired in 1027–1028 [41] The earthquake of 1033 resulted in the introduction of wooden beams to enforce the dome [42]\n\n\nCrusaders\nFor centuries Christian pilgrims were able to come and experience the Temple Mount, but escalating violence against pilgrims to Jerusalem (Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, who ordered the destruction of the Holy Sepulchre, was an example) resulted in the Crusades [43] The Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 and the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, while the nearby Al-Aqsa main prayer hall or Qibli Mosque first became a royal palace for a while, and then for much of the 12th century the headquarters of the Knights Templar The Templars, active from c. 1119, identified the Dome of the Rock as the site of the Temple of Solomon [clarification needed] The Templum Domini, as they called the Dome of the Rock, featured on the official seals of the Order's Grand Masters (such as Everard des Barres and Renaud de Vichiers), and soon became the architectural model for round Templar churches across Europe [44]\n\n\nAyyubids and Mamluks\nJerusalem was recaptured by Saladin on 2 October 1187, and the Dome of the Rock was reconsecrated as a Muslim shrine The cross on top of the dome was replaced by a crescent, and a wooden screen was placed around the rock below Saladin's nephew al-Malik al-Mu'azzam Isa carried out other restorations within the building, and added the porch to the Jami'a Al-Aqsa.\n\n\nOttoman period (1517–1917)\nDuring the Ottoman period, the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520–1566) brought Ottoman dynastic patronage to the city, around the same time that the sultan and his wife, Haseki Hürrem Sultan (Roxelana), were also commissioning works in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina [45] [46] Suleiman initiated a major renovation of the Dome of the Rock The most visible legacy of this work was the covering of the exterior with Ottoman-style tiles, which replaced the old Umayyad mosaics [5] This was likely part of an effort to impose a visibly Ottoman mark on this major Islamic holy site [47] Inscriptions on the tiles provide the dates 952 AH (1545–6 CE) and 959 AH (1552 CE), but work continued until the end of Suleiman's reign, if not later [5] Documents show repairs were still incomplete by the time of Murad III (r. 1574–1595) and the latter can probably be credited with finishing this work, which included repairs to the lead of the dome [48]\n\n\nBritish Mandate\nHaj Amin al-Husseini, appointed Grand Mufti by the British in 1917, along with Yaqub al-Ghusayn, implemented the restoration of the Dome of the Rock and the Jami Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem.\n\n\nJordanian rule\nIn 1955, an extensive program of renovation was begun by the government of Jordan, with funds supplied by Arab governments and Turkey The work included replacement of large numbers of tiles dating back to the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, which had become dislodged by heavy rain In 1965, as part of this restoration, the dome was covered with a durable aluminium bronze alloy made in Italy that replaced the lead exterior Before 1959, the dome was covered in blackened lead In the course of substantial restoration carried out from 1959 to 1962, the lead was replaced by aluminum-bronze plates covered with gold leaf.\n\n\nIsraeli rule\nA few hours after the Israeli flag was hoisted over the Dome of the Rock in 1967 during the Six-Day War, Israelis lowered it on the orders of Moshe Dayan and invested the Muslim waqf (religious trust) with the authority to manage the Temple Mount in order to \"keep the peace\" [58]\n\n\nAccessibility\nThe Dome is maintained by the Ministry of Awqaf in Amman, Jordan [60]\n\n\nReligious significance\nThe location of the Dome of the Rock is believed by many Muslims to be the site mentioned in Sura 17 of the Qur'an, which tells the story of the Isra and Mi'raj, the mythical Night Journey of Muhammad from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Masjid Al-Aqsa (\"the farthest place of prayer\") where he prayed, and then to visit heaven where he leads prayers and rises to heaven to receive instructions from Allah Although the city of Jerusalem is not mentioned by any of its names in the Qur'an, it is mentioned in hadiths as the place of Muhammad's Night Journey [64]\n\n\nInfluence and depiction\nIt was long believed that the Dome of the Rock echoed the architecture of the Temple in Jerusalem, as can be seen in Raphael's The Marriage of the Virgin and in Perugino's Marriage of the Virgin [74]\n\n\nHomages in art and architecture\nIt was long believed that the Dome of

rock.\n\n\nInterior decoration\nThe interior of the dome is lavishly decorated with mosaic, faience and marble, much of which was added several centuries after its completion It also contains Qur'anic inscriptions They vary from today's standard text (mainly changes from the first to the third person) and are mixed with pious inscriptions not in the Quran [15]\n\n\nExterior decoration\nThe decoration of the outer walls went through two major phases: the initial Umayyad scheme comprised marble and mosaics, much like the interior walls [16] 16th-century Ottoman sultan Suleyman the Magnificent replaced it with Ottoman tile decoration [16] This tilework was of many different styles and techniques, including cuerda seca tiles, multi-coloured underglaze tiles, and blue-and-white tilework, [5] resembling the Iznik tiles that were produced for the Ottoman capital [4] A small number of tiles were actual Iznik productions that were imported to Jerusalem [17] The original tiles were replaced in the 1960s with faithful copies produced in Italy [16]\n\n\nHistory\nThe Dome of the Rock is situated in the center of the Temple Mount, the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Jewish Temple, which had been greatly expanded under Herod the Great in the 1st century BCE Herod's Temple was destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans, and after the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, a Roman temple to Jupiter Capitolinus was built at the site by Emperor Hadrian [19]\n\n\nPre-Islamic background\nThe Dome of the Rock is situated in the center of the Temple Mount, the site of Solomon's Temple and the Second Jewish Temple, which had been greatly expanded under Herod the Great in the 1st century BCE Herod's Temple was destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans, and after the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, a Roman temple to Jupiter Capitolinus was built at the site by Emperor Hadrian [19]\n\n\nUmayyads\nThe initial octagonal structure of the Dome of the Rock and its round wooden dome had basically the same shape as it does today [13] It was built by the order of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) [26] According to Sibt ibn al-Jawzi (1185–1256), construction started in 685/6, while al-Suyuti (1445–1505) holds that its commencement year was 688 [27] A dedicatory inscription in Kufic script is preserved inside the dome The date is recorded as AH 72 (691/2 CE), the year most historians believe the construction of the original Dome was completed [28] An alternative interpretation of the inscription claims that it indicates the year when construction started [29] In this inscription, the name of \"al-Malik\" was removed and replaced by the name of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833) This alteration of the original inscription was first noted by Melchior de Vogüé in 1864 [30] Some scholars have suggested that the dome was added to an existing building, built either by Muawiyah I (r. 661–680), [31] or indeed a Byzantine building dating to before the Muslim conquest, built under Heraclius (r. 610–641) [32]\n\n\nOriginal construction\nThe initial octagonal structure of the Dome of the Rock and its round wooden dome had basically the same shape as it does today [13] It was built by the order of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) [26] According to Sibt ibn al-Jawzi (1185–1256), construction started in 685/6, while al-Suyuti (1445–1505) holds that its commencement year was 688 [27] A dedicatory inscription in Kufic script is preserved inside the dome The date is recorded as AH 72 (691/2 CE), the year most historians believe the

Heraclius (r. 610–641) [32]\n\n\nMotivations for construction\nNarratives by the medieval sources about Abd al-Malik's motivations in building the Dome of the Rock vary [11] At the time of its construction, the Caliph was engaged in war with Christian Byzantium and its Syrian Christian allies on the one hand and with the rival caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, who controlled Mecca, the annual destination of Muslim pilgrimage, on the other hand [11] [36] Thus, one series of explanations was that Abd al-Malik intended for the Dome of the Rock to be a religious monument of victory over the Christians that would distinguish Islam's uniqueness within the common Abrahamic religious setting of Jerusalem, home of the two older Abrahamic faiths, Judaism and Christianity [11] [37] The historian Shelomo Dov Goitein has argued that the Dome of the Rock was intended to compete with the many fine buildings of worship of other religions: \"The very form of a rotunda, given to the Qubbat as-Sakhra, although it was foreign to Islam, was destined to rival the many Christian domes\" [38] - and more specifically, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, according to others [39]\n\n\nAbbasids and Fatimids\nThe building was severely damaged by earthquakes in 808 and again in 846 [40] The dome collapsed in an earthquake in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–1023 The mosaics on the drum were repaired in 1027–1028 [41] The earthquake of 1033 resulted in the introduction of wooden beams to enforce the dome [42]\n\n\nCrusaders\nFor centuries Christian pilgrims were able to come and experience the Temple Mount, but escalating violence against pilgrims to Jerusalem (Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, who ordered the destruction of the Holy Sepulchre, was an example) resulted in the Crusades [43] The Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 and the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, while the nearby Al-Aqsa main prayer hall or Qibli Mosque first became a royal palace for a while, and then for much of the 12th century the headquarters of the Knights Templar The Templars, active from c. 1119, identified the Dome of the Rock as the site of the Temple of Solomon [clarification needed] The Templum Domini, as they called the Dome of the Rock, featured on the official seals of the Order's Grand Masters (such as Everard des Barres and Renaud de Vichiers), and soon became the architectural model for round Templar churches across Europe [44]\n\n\nAyyubids and Mamluks\nJerusalem was recaptured by Saladin on 2 October 1187, and the Dome of the Rock was reconsecrated as a Muslim shrine The cross on top of the dome was replaced by a crescent, and a wooden screen was placed around the rock below Saladin's nephew al-Malik al-Mu'azzam Isa carried out other restorations within the building, and added the porch to the Jami'a Al-Aqsa.\n\n\nOttoman period (1517–1917)\nDuring the Ottoman period, the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520–1566) brought Ottoman dynastic patronage to the city, around the same time that the sultan and his wife, Haseki Hürrem Sultan (Roxelana), were also commissioning works in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina [45] [46] Suleiman initiated a major renovation of the Dome of the Rock The most visible legacy of this work was the covering of the exterior with Ottoman-style tiles, which replaced the old Umayyad mosaics [5] This was likely part of an effort to impose a visibly Ottoman mark on this major Islamic holy site [47] Inscriptions on the tiles provide the dates 952 AH (1545–6 CE) and 959 AH (1552 CE), but work continued until the end of Suleiman's reign, if not later [5] Documents show repairs were still incomplete by the time of Murad III (r. 1574–1595) and the latter can probably be credited with finishing this work, which included repairs to the lead of the dome [48]\n\n\nBritish Mandate\nHaj Amin al-Husseini, appointed Grand Mufti by the British in 1917, along with Yaqub al-Ghusayn, implemented the restoration of the Dome of the Rock and the Jami Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem.\n\n\nJordanian rule\nIn 1955, an extensive program of renovation was begun by the government of Jordan, with funds supplied by Arab governments and Turkey The work included replacement of large numbers of tiles dating back to the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, which had become dislodged by heavy rain In 1965, as part of this restoration, the dome was covered with a durable aluminium bronze alloy made in Italy that replaced the lead exterior Before 1959, the dome was covered in blackened lead In the course of substantial restoration carried out from 1959 to 1962, the lead was replaced by aluminum-bronze plates covered with gold leaf.\n\n\nIsraeli rule\nA few hours after the Israeli flag was hoisted over the Dome of the Rock in 1967 during the Six-Day War, Israelis lowered it on the orders of Moshe Dayan and invested the Muslim waqf (religious trust) with the authority to manage the Temple Mount in order to \"keep the peace\" [58]\n\n\nAccessibility\nThe Dome is maintained by the Ministry of Awqaf in Amman, Jordan [60]\n\n\nReligious significance\nThe location of the Dome of the Rock is believed by many Muslims to be the site mentioned in Sura 17 of the Qur'an, which tells the story of the Isra and Mi'raj, the mythical Night Journey of Muhammad from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Masjid Al-Aqsa (\"the farthest place of prayer\") where he prayed, and then to visit heaven where he leads prayers and rises to heaven to receive instructions from Allah Although the city of Jerusalem is not mentioned by any of its names in the Qur'an, it is mentioned in hadiths as the place of Muhammad's Night Journey [64]\n\n\nInfluence and depiction\nIt was long believed that the Dome of the Rock echoed the architecture of the Temple in Jerusalem, as can be seen in Raphael's The Marriage of the Virgin and in Perugino's Marriage of the Virgin [74]\n\n\nHomages in art and architecture\nIt was long believed that the Dome of the Rock echoed the architecture of the Temple in Jerusalem, as can be seen in Raphael's The Marriage of the Virgin and in Perugino's Marriage of

the next round, the results of the poll being combined with the ranking of the judges For example, with ten contestants left, the judges' favourite would receive ten points, second favourite nine points, and so on, and similarly with the viewers' rankings The bottom ranked couple gets one point [15] The profits from the telephone lines were donated to Sport Relief in series 1, to Children in

In the show, three couples remained in the competition After all three had performed and the judges had given their scores, two of the couples were in joint-first position on the leaderboard, while the third — Tom Chambers and Camilla Dallerup — were in last place This meant that, no matter how many public votes were cast in their favour, it was mathematically impossible for the third-placed couple to avoid the dance-off This oversight was initially unnoticed by producers until after the public vote became live and viewers were invited to call in and save their favourites at a cost of 15p per vote Once the mistake was finally realised and the public vote was closed, it was announced that all three couples would be put through to the final, all the votes already cast would count towards the final result of the competition, and viewers could apply for a refund if they wished [91]\n\n\n2008 semi-final\nOn 13 December 2008, Strictly Come Dancing became the subject of press attention and

replaced by series five winner Alesha Dixon, then aged 30 [94] This was later confirmed by the BBC in July of that year [95] Subsequently, the BBC was accused of ageism and sexism by several sources, [95] [96] an accusation the corporation has faced before over the removal of several older female presenters, including Moira Stuart, [97] Juliet Morris, [98] Miriam O'Reilly, [98] [97] Michaela Strachan, [98] Charlotte Smith [98] and Anna Ford [99] The BBC denied the allegations that the decision to remove Phillips was due to her age [95]\n\n\n2009 racism scandal\nIn 2009, during the seventh series, professional dancer Anton Du Beke issued a public apology [102] for his use of a racial slur during a conversation with his dance partner Laila Rouass [103] Rouass accepted his apology and said that he should \" [a]bsolutely not\" be fired: \"Anton has apologised and I've accepted it This happened a couple of weeks ago now and we are just having a really good time We just want to move on from it.\" [104] Over 600 complaints were received by the BBC, including those about comments Bruce Forsyth, then host of Strictly Come Dancing, made about the controversy on a Talksport radio programme, in which he suggested that Britain \"used to have a sense of humour\" about such incidents, and that Du Beke's apology should be accepted [105]\n\n\nSame-sex couples\nIn 2015, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, Egghead C J de Mooi said that he was turned down for the show because he had wanted to dance with a same-sex partner [106]  The BBC denied that de Mooi had ever been under consideration for the show, [107] and also declared that \"Strictly is a family show and we have chosen the traditional format of mixed-sex couples\" [106] The press has reported on the issue on numerous occasions when gay celebrities have appeared on the show, including Will Young, [108] Susan Calman, [109] Robert Rinder, [110] Richard Coles [111] and Ranj Singh [112] Strictly Come Dancing judges Shirley Ballas [112] and Craig Revel Horwood [113] have both expressed their support for introducing same-sex couples.\n\n\nProfessional dancers' misconduct\nIn January 2024, The Sun reported that Amanda Abbington requested footage of her time training with Giovanni Pernice and was seeking legal advice over his training methods [120] In March 2024, The Sun said that Abbington, Laura Whitmore and Ranvir Singh had met to discuss their negative experiences with Pernice on the show Legal firm Carter Ruck told BBC News there were \"numerous serious complaints\" about his behaviour while filming Strictly Come Dancing [121] On 16 May, it was reported by The Sun that Pernice had quit the show Pernice denied all accusations of wrongdoing His departure was confirmed by the BBC on 10 June [122]\n\n\nRatings\nAn example of Strictly Come Dancing's popularity is that, after episodes, electricity use in the United Kingdom rises significantly as viewers who have waited for the show to end begin boiling water for tea, a phenomenon known as TV pick-up National Grid personnel watch the show to know when closing credits begin so they can prepare for the surge [127]\n\n\nAwards\nThe show has won a highly prestigious Rose D'Or award for 'Best Variety Show', beating off competition from reality shows from twelve other different countries [129] It has also won two awards for 'Best Reality Show' at the TRIC Awards and two at the TV Quick Awards for 'Best Talent Show' It has also received four BAFTA Award nominations [130]\n\n\nStrictly Come Dancing: The Game\nIn 2016, BBC Worldwide commissioned a match-3 mobile app game published by Donut Publishing and developed by Exient Entertainment The game uses a mix of hand animation and motion-captured data for all the dances in the game, using pro dancers from the show (Chloe Hewitt and Neil Jones) The mo-cap process was featured on It Takes Two in the build-up to the release of the app The game features over 150 dresses and 9 dances: Quickstep, Jive, Tango, Salsa, Charleston, Viennese Waltz, Rumba, Cha Cha Cha, and Paso Doble It was released on the App Store and Google Play in early 2016 and is regularly updated with

The program features a group of celebrities who are paired with professional dancers and compete against each other to win the coveted title of \"Strictly Come Dancing Champion.\"\n\n**Development**\n\nThe idea of reviving Come Dancing was first pitched to the BBC in 2003 by Richard Hopkins, who had previously produced the first series of Big Brother in the UK. However, it was not until 2004 that the show was finally commissioned and began production. The original format of the show was developed by Fenia Vardanis, who suggested that the program should feature a mix of professional and amateur dancers competing against each other. The show's format has remained largely the same since its inception, with a few minor changes over the years.\n\n**Format**\n\nThe show typically features a group of celebrities who are paired with professional dancers and compete against each other in a series of dances. The dances are typically performed to popular music and are judged by a panel of expert judges. The judges' scores are combined with the results of a public vote to determine which couple will be eliminated each week.\n\nEach season of the show typically begins with a launch show, which introduces the celebrities and their professional partners. The launch show is followed by a series of live shows, which feature the performances of the couples. The live shows are typically broadcast on a Saturday evening and are followed by a results show, which announces the winners of the public vote and the couple that is eliminated.\n\n**Presenters and Judges**\n\nThe show has had several presenters and judges over the years, including Sir Bruce Forsyth, Tess Daly, Claudia Winkleman, and Craig Revel Horwood. The judges' panel has also undergone several changes, with Alesha Dixon, Len Goodman, and Darcey Bussell being among the most notable judges to appear on the show.\n\n**Professional Dancers**\n\nThe professional dancers on the show are typically paired with the celebrities and perform with them each week. The professional dancers are highly skilled and have undergone extensive training in various dance styles. Some of the most notable professional dancers to appear on the show include Anton Du Beke, Aliona Vilani, and Brendan Cole.\n\n**Presentation**\n\nThe show's presentation is typically lively and energetic, with a mix of music, dance, and comedy. The show's set is designed to resemble a large dance studio, with a catwalk and a stage for the performances. The show's lighting and sound effects are also designed to enhance the performances and create a dynamic atmosphere.\n\n**Dances**\n\nThe show features a wide range of dances, including ballroom, Latin, and contemporary styles. The dances are typically performed to popular music and are choreographed by the professional dancers. Some of the most popular dances on the show include the waltz, tango, and foxtrot.\n\n**Results Show**\n\nThe results show is typically broadcast after the live show and announces the winners of the public vote. The couple that receives the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition. The results show also features a dance-off, which is a performance by the couple that is eliminated.\n\n**It Takes Two**\n\nIt Takes Two is a companion show to Strictly Come Dancing, which is broadcast on BBC Two. The show features a condensed version of the live show, as well as interviews with the celebrities and their professional partners.\n\n**Series Overview**\n\nThe show has been broadcast on BBC One since 2004 and has become one of the network's most popular programs. The show has been broadcast in the autumn and winter months, with a new series typically beginning in September. The show has been broadcast in several countries, including the UK, Australia, and the US.\n\n**Series 1-22**\n\nThe show has been broadcast for over 20 years, with a new series typically beginning each autumn. The show has featured a wide range of celebrities, including actors, musicians, and athletes. Some of the most notable contestants to appear on the show include John Barnes, Craig Revel Horwood, and Ed Balls.\n\n**Specials**\n\nThe show has also broadcast several specials over the years, including Christmas specials and charity specials. The specials typically feature a condensed version of the show, as well as interviews with the celebrities and their professional partners.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nThe show has been the subject of several controversies over the years, including allegations of ageism and sexism. The show's judges have also been accused of being biased, with some contestants and viewers accusing them of favoring certain couples.\n\n**Ratings**\n\nThe show has consistently high ratings, with over 10 million viewers tuning in each week. The show has also been praised for its unique format and its ability to bring together a wide range of celebrities and their professional partners.\n\n**Awards**\n\nThe show has won several awards over the years, including the Rose d'Or award for \"Best Variety Show.\" The show has also been nominated for several BAFTA awards, including \"Best Reality Show.\"\n\n**Strictly Come Dancing: The Game**\n\nStrictly Come Dancing: The Game is a mobile app game that was released in 2016. The game features a mix of hand animation and motion-captured data for all the dances in the game, using pro dancers from the show. The game features over 150 dresses and 9 dances, including the quickstep, jive, tango, salsa, charleston, viennese waltz, rumba, cha cha cha, and paso doble.", "prompt": "Write a complete

the semi-final of series six In the show, three couples remained in the competition After all three had performed and the judges had given their scores, two of the couples were in joint-first position

impossible for the third-placed couple to avoid the dance-off This oversight was initially unnoticed by producers until after the public vote became live and viewers were invited to call in and save their favourites at a cost of 15p per vote Once the mistake was finally realised and the public vote was closed, it was announced that all three couples would be put through to the final, all the votes already cast would count towards the final result of the competition, and viewers could apply for a refund if they wished [91]\n\n\n2008 semi-final\nOn 13 December 2008, Strictly Come Dancing

He has directed and produced numerous films and television shows, and has become a household name among fans of his genre-defining work.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nSam Raimi was born in Royal Oak, Michigan, to a Conservative Jewish family. His parents, Celia Barbara (née Abrams) and Leonard Ronald Raimi, were both merchants who immigrated to the United States from Russia and Hungary. Raimi's family was close-knit, and he has credited his younger brother Ted, an actor, with helping to inspire his love of storytelling. Tragedy struck when Raimi was a child, as his older brother Sander died in an accidental drowning in Israel. This event had a profound impact on Raimi, and he has said that it \"colored everything he's done for the rest of his life.\"\n\nRaimi's introduction to filmmaking came when his father brought home a movie camera. He began making short films with his friend Bruce Campbell, whom he met in 1975. In college, Raimi teamed up with his brother's roommate Robert Tapert and Campbell to shoot Within the Woods (1978), a 32-minute horror film that raised $375,000. This early success led to Raimi's debut feature film, It's Murder!, and the seven-minute short film Clockwork (1978), starring Scott Spiegel and Cheryl Guttridge.\n\n**Career**\n\nRaimi's career took off with the release of The Evil Dead (1981), a horror film that became a cult hit and effectively launched his career. Through a combination of family, friends, and investors, Raimi was able to finance production of the film, which went on to gross over $2 million at the box office. The Evil Dead's success led to a number of other horror films, including Evil Dead II (1987) and Army of Darkness (1992).\n\nIn addition to his work in horror, Raimi has also directed and produced a number of films in other genres, including the superhero blockbuster Spider-Man (2002), which grossed over $821 million at the box office. Raimi went on to direct and produce two more Spider-Man films, Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007), as well as the horror film Drag Me to Hell (2009).\n\n**Film**\n\nRaimi has directed and produced a number of films throughout his career, including:\n\n* The Evil Dead (1981)\n* Evil Dead II (1987)\n* Army of Darkness (1992)\n* A Simple Plan (1998)\n* The Gift (2000)\n* Spider-Man (2002)\n* Spider-Man 2 (2004)\n* Spider-Man 3 (2007)\n* Drag Me to Hell (2009)\n\n**Television**\n\nRaimi has also worked in television, serving as an executive producer on a number of shows, including:\n\n* Ash vs. Evil Dead (2015-2018)\n* Ash vs. Evil Dead: The Series (2018)\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRaimi has been married to Gillian Greene, daughter of Canadian actor Lorne Greene, since 1993. They have five children together, including three who have appeared as extras in Drag Me to Hell and Spider-Man 3. Raimi's children have also worked behind the camera, with Lorne contributing as a second unit director on Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.\n\n**Political Donations**\n\nRaimi has made a number of political donations throughout his career, including $450 to the campaign of then-Republican Senator Arlen Specter in 1995, $1,000 to Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer in 2002, and $900 to Republican President George W Bush in 2004.\n\n**Filmography**\n\nRaimi's filmography includes:\n\n* The Evil Dead (1981) - director and producer\n* Evil Dead II (1987) - director and producer\n* Army of Darkness (1992) - director and producer\n* A Simple Plan (1998) - director and producer\n* The Gift (2000) - director and producer\n* Spider-Man (2002) - director and producer\n* Spider-Man 2 (2004) - director and producer\n* Spider-Man 3 (2007) - director and producer\n* Drag Me to Hell (2009) - director and producer\n\n**Awards**\n\nRaimi has received a number of awards and nominations throughout his career, including:\n\n* Saturn Award for Best Director (The Evil Dead, 1982)\n* Saturn Award for Best Director (Evil Dead II, 1988)\n* Saturn Award for Best Director (Army of Darkness, 1993)\n* Saturn Award for Best Director (Spider-Man, 2003)\n* Saturn Award for Best Director (Spider-Man 2, 2005)\n* Saturn Award for Best Director (Spider-Man 3, 2008)\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of films directed by Sam Raimi\n* List of television shows produced by Sam Raimi\n* List of awards and nominations received by Sam Raimi\n\n**References**\n\n* This article is a compilation of information from various sources, including biographies, filmographies, and news articles.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Sam Raimi on IMDb\n* Sam Raimi on Twitter\n* Sam Raimi on Facebook", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Sam_Raimi\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nRaimi was born in Royal Oak, Michigan, [2] to a Conservative Jewish family [6] He is a son of merchants Celia Barbara (née Abrams) and Leonard Ronald Raimi [3] His ancestors were Jewish immigrants from Russia and Hungary [7] His younger brother Ted is an actor, [8] and his older brother Ivan is a screenwriter and physician [7] His older sister, Andrea Raimi Rubin, is a court reporter [9] Another older brother, Sander, died at 15 in an accidental drowning in Israel; Raimi has said that the trauma knitted the remaining family closer together and \"colored everything he's done for the rest of his life\" [10] Raimi also mentioned that Sander first introduced him to Spider-Man, igniting his love for comics [11]\n\n\nCareer\nRaimi became fascinated with making films when his father brought a movie camera home one day He began to make Super 8 movies with his friend Bruce Campbell, whom he met in 1975 In college, he teamed up with his brother's roommate Robert Tapert and Campbell to shoot Within the Woods (1978), a 32-minute horror film which raised $375,000, as well as his debut feature film It's Murder!

The submarine was named after the Nanggala, a powerful, divine short spear wielded by Prabhu Baladewa, a Hindu god mentioned in the Mahabharata and a character in wayang puppet theatre. The incident resulted in the loss of all 53 crew members on board.\n\n**Design and Construction**\n\nKRI Nanggala was ordered on 2 April 1977 as part of a US$625 million loan by the West German government to the Indonesian government. The vessel was designed by Ingenieurkontor Lübeck of Lübeck, constructed by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft of Kiel, and sold by Ferrostaal of Essen. The West German consortium designed the submarine with a Tandan-class design, which was a modification of the German Type 206A submarine.\n\nThe construction of KRI Nanggala and its sister vessel, KRI Cakra, was funded as part of the loan by the West German government. The total cost of the two submarines was approximately $100 million. The Indonesian Navy took delivery of KRI Nanggala in 1981.\n\n**Historical Context**\n\nDuring the 1960s, Indonesia was known as one of the largest Asian naval powers, with 12 Soviet-made Whiskey-class submarines in its fleet. However, by 1981, when Cakra and Nanggala arrived in Indonesia to reinforce the country's naval defenses, only one of the 12 Whiskey-class submarines had still retained the ability to dive. The Indonesian government had planned to purchase a Type 206A submarine from Germany in the late 1990s, but was unable to do so due to funding issues.\n\n**Service History**\n\nKRI Nanggala participated in several naval exercises, including the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training exercises in 2002 and 2015. In 2004, the boat participated in the Joint Marine Operations Exercise held in the Indian Ocean, during which it sank the decommissioned KRI Rakata. In August 2012, the boat conducted a passing exercise with USS Oklahoma City, accompanied by KRI Diponegoro and a Bölkow-Blohm helicopter.\n\n**Sinking**\n\nOn 21 April 2021, Air Chief Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto, Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces, reported that Nanggala was believed to have disappeared in waters about 95 km (51 nautical miles) north of Bali. Indonesian Navy spokesperson First Admiral Julius Widjojono stated that Nanggala had been conducting a torpedo drill, but failed to report its results as expected.\n\nFurther details emerged that Nanggala had requested permission to dive to fire an SUT torpedo at 03:00 WIB (20:00 UTC, 20 April). At around 04:00, Nanggala should have been flooding its torpedo tubes in preparation for the firing of the torpedo. The last communication with Nanggala was at 04:25, when the commanding officer of the training task force would have authorized the firing of torpedo number 8.\n\n**Rescue Efforts**\n\nOn 21 April around 07:00, an aerial search revealed traces of an oil spill on the surface of the water near the location where the submarine was believed to have dived. Indonesian Navy deployed three warships—KRI Diponegoro, KRI Raden Eddy Martadinata, and KRI I Gusti Ngurah Rai—to search for Nanggala. Widjojono stated that a team of divers was searching for the boat.\n\nJanes Defence News also reported that the navy had sent a number of other warships to the area. The governments of Australia, Singapore, and India had responded to Indonesian requests for assistance.\n\n**Discovery**\n\nOn 24 April 2021, the Indonesian Navy announced the finding of debris, including a part associated with torpedo tubes, a coolant pipe insulator, a bottle of periscope grease, and prayer rugs. Because the debris was found within 10 nmi (19 km; 12 mi) of the point of last contact and no other vessels were believed to be in the area, the debris was believed to have come from the submarine, and Nanggala was declared sunk.\n\nYudo Margono stated that a sonar scan had shown the submarine at a depth of 850 m (2,800 ft), and its crush depth was presumed to be 500 m (1,600 ft). Due to the maximum operational depth limitation of 800 m (2,600 ft) of Rigel's two underwater ROVs, Rigel was unable to launch them and was assisted by the submarine rescue ship MV Swift Rescue of the Republic of Singapore Navy, which launched its 1,000-metre (3,300 ft) depth-capable drone and located and made visual contact with Nanggala at 09:04.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe Navy said Nanggala might have had a power outage. The boat had experienced a power outage before because of a blown electrical fuse, but the boat successfully recovered after the ship executed an emergency main ballast tank blow. After the finding of debris from Nanggala, Yudo Margono said the submarine might have cracked instead of exploded, as an explosion would have been detected by sonar.\n\n**Cause**\n\nThe Navy said Nanggala might have had a power outage. The boat had experienced a power outage before because of a blown electrical fuse, but the boat successfully recovered after the ship executed an emergency main ballast tank blow. After the finding of debris from Nanggala, Yudo Margono said the submarine might have cracked instead of exploded, as an explosion would have been detected by sonar.\n\n**Alleged Poor Maintenance**\n\nNanggala commander Lt Col Heri Oktavian, who died in the incident, had voiced his frustration with the maintenance status of the Nanggala to Edna C Pattisna, a close friend, who is also a reporter with local news media Kompas, for which she published an article titled Message from KRI Nanggala-402 Commander. Oktavian claimed that the workmanship quality and maintenance services performed by state-owned shipyard PT PAL Indonesia were unsatisfactory and suffered from frequent delays.\n\nHe lamented that an officer encountered criticism from his superiors for reporting the poor workmanship by PT PAL on the KRI Alugoro, a Changbogo-class submarine assembled by PT PAL's Surabaya yard and launched on 11 April 2019. Oktavian was also quoted as saying: \"This submarine (the Alugoro) by PT PAL, there's nothing good about it.\"\n\nNanggala was last serviced by PT PAL in 2020. No further refitting of Nanggala was requested to DSME after the 2012 refit despite the need for submarines to undergo maintenance at least once every six years.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nAfter the Indonesian Navy declared Nanggala lost with all hands, the People's Consultative Assembly recommended a posthumous promotion for all personnel on board. Hadi Tjahjanto stated that he would propose the promotions to Indonesian President Joko Widodo. A day later, on 26 April, Joko Widodo announced that the government would award a posthumous promotion and confer posthumously the Bintang Jalasena (Navy Meritorious Service Star) to everyone on board Nanggala.\n\nThe ceremony conferring the awards and promotions was held on 29 April, attended by Joko Widodo, Minister of Defense Prabowo Subianto, Hadi Tjahjanto, and Yudo Margono.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nCondolences were expressed by the King of Malaysia, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the South Korean Ministry of Defense, Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, the UK's Minister of State for Asia, Nigel Adams, and ambassador to Indonesia, Owen Jenkins.

12 mi) of the point of last contact and no other vessels were believed to be in the area, the debris was believed to have come from the submarine, and Nanggala was declared sunk [63] [d] Yudo Margono stated that a sonar scan had shown the submarine at a depth of 850 m (2,800 ft), [64] and its crush depth was presumed to be 500 m (1,600 ft) [63] Due to the maximum operational depth limitation of 800 m (2,600 ft) of Rigel's two underwater ROVs, Rigel was unable to launch them and was assisted by the submarine rescue ship MV Swift Rescue of the Republic of Singapore Navy, which launched its 1,000-metre (3,300 ft) depth-capable drone and located and made visual contact with Nanggala at 09:04 [65] [66]\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe Navy said Nanggala might have had a power outage [37] The boat had experienced a power outage before because of a blown electrical fuse, but the boat successfully recovered after the ship executed an emergency main ballast tank blow [74] After the finding of debris from Nanggala, Yudo Margono said the submarine might have cracked instead of exploded, as an explosion would have been detected by sonar [75]\n\n\nCause\nThe Navy said Nanggala might have had a power outage [37] The boat had experienced a power outage before because of a blown electrical fuse, but the boat successfully recovered after the ship executed an emergency main ballast tank blow [74] After the finding of debris from Nanggala, Yudo Margono said the submarine might have cracked instead of exploded, as an explosion would have been detected by sonar [75]\n\n\nAlleged poor maintenance\nNanggala commander Lt Col Heri Oktavian, who died in the incident, had voiced his frustration with the maintenance status of the Nanggala to Edna C Pattisna, a close friend, who is also a reporter with local news media Kompas, for which she published an article titled Message from KRI Nanggala-402 Commander [78] Oktavian claimed that the workmanship quality and maintenance services performed by state-owned shipyard PT PAL Indonesia were unsatisfactory and suffered from frequent delays.\nHe lamented that an officer encountered criticism from his superiors for reporting the poor workmanship by PT PAL on the KRI Alugoro, a Changbogo-class submarine assembled by PT PAL's Surabaya yard and launched on 11 April 2019 [79] Oktavian was also quoted as saying: \"This submarine (the Alugoro) by PT PAL, there's nothing good about it\" [80] Nanggala was last serviced by PT PAL in 2020 [81] No further refitting of Nanggala was requested to DSME after the 2012 refit despite the need for submarines to undergo maintenance at least once every six years [82] [83]\n\n\nAftermath\nAfter the Indonesian Navy declared Nanggala lost with all hands, the People's Consultative Assembly recommended a posthumous promotion for all personnel on board [84] Hadi Tjahjanto stated that he would propose the promotions to Indonesian President Joko Widodo [85] A day later, on 26 April, Joko Widodo announced that the government would award a posthumous promotion and confer posthumously the Bintang Jalasena (Navy Meritorious Service Star) to everyone on board Nanggala [86] The ceremony conferring the awards and promotions was held on 29 April, attended by Joko Widodo, [87] Minister of Defense Prabowo Subianto, Hadi Tjahjanto, and Yudo Margono [88] [e]\n\n\nReactions\nCondolences were expressed by the King of Malaysia, [95] Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, [96] the South Korean Ministry of Defense, [97] Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, [98] the UK's Minister of State for Asia, Nigel Adams, and ambassador to Indonesia, Owen Jenkins [99] United States Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin expressed his \"heartfelt concern\" in a call with Prabowo Subianto [100]\n\n\nSalvage\nOn 3 May, two Chinese navy ships, ocean tug Nantuo (195) and ocean salvage and rescue ship Yongxingdao (863), arrived to assist with the recovery of the wreck [106]  Scientific research vessel Explorer 2 was scheduled to arrive the next day [106] [107] [f] There have also been discussions between the Indonesian Navy and state-owned oil regulator SKK Migas to raise the submarine [106]\n\n\nGovernment housing assistance for families\nOn 20 April 2022, Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto gave keys to housing built by the Ministry of Public Works and Housing to 53 families of the deceased crew [109] [110]\n\n\nNotable former crew members\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
