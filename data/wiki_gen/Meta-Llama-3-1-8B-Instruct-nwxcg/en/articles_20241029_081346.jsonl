The name \"Pishdadian\" is derived from the Persian word \"Pishdād,\" meaning \"one who precedes\" or \"forefather.\" The dynasty is primarily known through the 10th-century epic poem, the Shahnameh, written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi.\n\n**Origins, Etymology, and Sources**\n\nThe origins of the Pishdadian Dynasty are shrouded in myth and legend, making it difficult to separate fact from fiction. The Shahnameh and other traditional sources provide the primary accounts of this dynasty, while modern scholars have sought to reconstruct the historical context and significance of the Pishdadian Kings.\n\nThe Shahnameh, written in the 10th century, is a comprehensive epic poem that narrates the mythological and historical events of ancient Iran. The poem is divided into several sections, each dealing with a specific period of Iranian history, including the Pishdadian Dynasty. The Shahnameh provides a detailed account of the Pishdadian Kings, their lives, reigns, and conflicts, which will be discussed in the following sections.\n\n**The Shahnameh and Zoroastrian Tradition**\n\nThe Shahnameh is not only a historical account but also a deeply rooted work of Zoroastrian tradition. The poem reflects the Zoroastrian worldview, emphasizing the struggle between good and evil, light and darkness, and the importance of reason and justice. The Pishdadian Dynasty is an integral part of this narrative, serving as a bridge between the primordial creation myths and the Kayanian Dynasty.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Pishdadian Dynasty is said to have ruled for approximately 600 years, with the first king, Keyumars, believed to have lived around 5000 BCE. The dynasty is characterized by a series of monarchs who faced numerous challenges, including conflicts with the forces of darkness, led by the great demon Iblis, and wars with neighboring tribes.\n\n### The Kings\n\nThe Shahnameh lists seven Pishdadian kings:\n\n1. Keyumars, the first king, who is said to have established the first human settlement and the institution of monarchy.\n2. Hushang, who fought against the forces of darkness and established the first temple dedicated to the god of fire, Atar.\n3. Tahmuras, who is said to have created the first human being and the first animal.\n4. Jamshid, who is believed to have created the first calendar and established the institution of government.\n5. Dej, who is said to have discovered the first metal, copper.\n6. Zar, who is believed to have invented the first wheel and established the first postal system.\n7. Zaw, who is said to have fought against the Turks and established the first laws.\n\n**Tabari and the Muslim Narratives**\n\nThe Tabari, a 9th-century Persian historian, provides an alternative account of the Pishdadian Dynasty. According to Tabari, the Pishdadian Kings were not only rulers but also prophets, who were sent to guide humanity. This narrative is contrasted with the Shahnameh's account, which portrays the Pishdadian Kings as mere mortals.\n\n### The First Pishdadian Kings and the Conflict with Iblis\n\nTabari's account begins with Keyumars, who is described as a prophet and a king. Keyumars is said to have faced numerous challenges, including the conflict with Iblis, the great demon. According to Tabari, Iblis was a powerful and cunning foe who sought to destroy humanity and the institution of monarchy. Keyumars, with the help of his successor, Hushang, was able to defeat Iblis and establish the first temple dedicated to the god of fire, Atar.\n\n### From Jam al-Shidh to Zaw: Al-Dahhak and War with the Turks\n\nTabari's account continues with the reign of Jamshid, who is said to have fought against the forces of darkness and established the first calendar. However, Jamshid's reign was marked by internal conflicts and wars with neighboring tribes. Tabari's account concludes with the reign of Zaw, who is said to have fought against the Turks and established the first laws.\n\n**Significance**\n\nThe Pishdadian Dynasty holds significant importance in the history of ancient Iran. The dynasty serves as a bridge between the primordial creation myths and the Kayanian Dynasty, providing a comprehensive account of the mythological and historical events of ancient Iran. The Pishdadian Kings are also revered as prophets and heroes, who guided humanity and established the institution of monarchy. Furthermore, the Pishdadian Dynasty reflects the Zoroastrian worldview, emphasizing the struggle between good and evil, light and darkness, and the importance of reason and justice.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Pishdadian Dynasty is primarily known through the 10th-century epic poem, the Shahnameh, written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi.\n* The Shahnameh provides a detailed account of the Pishdadian Kings, their lives, reigns, and conflicts.\n* The Pishdadian Dynasty is characterized by a series of monarchs who faced numerous challenges, including conflicts with the forces of darkness and wars with neighboring tribes.\n* Tabari's account provides an alternative narrative of the Pishdadian Dynasty, portraying the Pishdadian Kings as prophets and heroes who guided humanity.\n\n**References**\n\n* Shahnameh (10th century)\n* Tabari (9th century)\n* Ferdowsi (10th century)\n* Dinshaw, E.

The counteroffensive, which began on September 6, 2022, marked a significant turning point in the war, as Ukrainian forces successfully broke through Russian defenses and advanced deep into Kharkiv Oblast.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Kharkiv Oblast, located in northeastern Ukraine, had been under Russian control since the early stages of the invasion in February 2022. Russian forces had established a significant presence in the region, with a large number of troops and equipment deployed to the area. The Oblast served as a key transit point for Russian forces seeking to advance on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and as a base for operations in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian forces had been unable to retake the Oblast, despite several attempts to push back Russian forces.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces had been preparing for a major operation. Intelligence gathering and reconnaissance had revealed weaknesses in the Russian defenses, and Ukrainian military leaders had developed a strategy to exploit these vulnerabilities. The Ukrainian military had also received significant amounts of military aid from Western countries, including the United States, Poland, and the United Kingdom, which had helped to improve their military capabilities.\n\n**Counteroffensive**\n\nThe Ukrainian counteroffensive began on September 6, 2022, with a series of coordinated attacks on Russian positions in Kharkiv Oblast. The operation was launched along a 300-kilometer front, with Ukrainian forces attacking Russian positions in multiple sectors.\n\n### **First phase (6–12 September 2022)**\n\n**Initial advance**\n\nThe initial advance was marked by a series of rapid gains, as Ukrainian forces broke through Russian defenses and advanced deep into Kharkiv Oblast. Russian forces were caught off guard by the speed and ferocity of the Ukrainian attack, and were quickly overwhelmed.\n\n**Breakthrough**\n\nOn September 8, 2022, Ukrainian forces broke through Russian defenses near the town of Izyum, which had been a key Russian stronghold in the Oblast. The breakthrough marked a significant turning point in the operation, as Ukrainian forces began to advance rapidly through the Oblast.\n\n**Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River**\n\nAs Ukrainian forces advanced, Russian forces began to withdraw from Kharkiv Oblast west of the Oskil River. The withdrawal was marked by a series of chaotic and disorganized scenes, as Russian troops abandoned their positions and fled from advancing Ukrainian forces.\n\n**Other gains and casualties**\n\nOver the course of the first phase, Ukrainian forces made significant gains, advancing deep into Kharkiv Oblast and capturing several key towns and villages. The operation was also marked by significant casualties, with reports of heavy fighting and significant losses on both sides.\n\n### **Battle of Shevchenkove**\n\nThe Battle of Shevchenkove was a major engagement between Ukrainian and Russian forces that took place on September 10, 2022. The battle was marked by intense fighting, with both sides suffering significant losses. Ukrainian forces ultimately emerged victorious, capturing the town of Shevchenkove and securing a significant gain in the operation.\n\n### **Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)**\n\n**Oskil River crossing**\n\nOn September 13, 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a major operation to cross the Oskil River, which had been a key defensive line for Russian forces. The operation was marked by significant challenges, including strong Russian defenses and difficult terrain. However, Ukrainian forces ultimately succeeded in crossing the river, marking a significant gain in the operation.\n\n**Encirclement and recapture of Lyman**\n\nIn the days following the crossing of the Oskil River, Ukrainian forces began to encircle the town of Lyman, which had been a key Russian stronghold in the Oblast. The operation was marked by intense fighting, with both sides suffering significant losses. However, Ukrainian forces ultimately emerged victorious, recapturing the town of Lyman and securing a significant gain in the operation.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### **Russia**\n\nThe Russian government responded to the counteroffensive with a series of denials and downplayings of the Ukrainian gains. However, the operation had significant implications for Russian forces, who had suffered significant losses and were forced to withdraw from several key positions in the Oblast.\n\n### **Worldwide**\n\nThe counteroffensive was widely reported in the inte", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2022_Kharkiv_counteroffensive\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Prelude\n#Counteroffensive\n##First phase (6–12 September 2022)\n###Initial advance\n###Breakthrough\n###Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River\n###Other gains and casualties\n##Battle of Shevchenkove\n##Second phase (13 September–1 October 2022)\n###Oskil River crossing\n###Encirclement and recapture of Lyman\n#Reactions\n##Russia\n##Worldwide\n#Aftermath of the first phase\n##Mass graves and evidence of torture\n##Military decorations\n##Effect on Russian referendums\n##Captured Russian equipment\n#Aftermath of the second phase\n#See also\n#Notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The order is known for its unique blend of lodge and banner system, which has been in place for over 180 years. This article will provide an overview of the RAOB, including its history, membership, structure, and current status.\n\n# Coverage\n\nThe RAOB is a global organization with a presence in several countries around the world. At its peak, the order had a significant presence in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. While the order has declined in recent years, there are still several lodges and banners in operation.\n\n# Membership\n\nMembership in the RAOB is open to individuals who are of good character and are interested in the principles of the order. The order has a strong focus on brotherly love, relief, and truth, and members are encouraged to participate in charitable activities and community service. To become a member, individuals must be proposed and seconded by existing members and undergo a formal initiation ceremony.\n\n# Structure\n\nThe RAOB has a complex structure that consists of several components, including degrees, minor lodges, banners, and grand lodges.\n\n## Degrees\n\nThe RAOB has a system of degrees, which are hierarchical ranks that members can progress through. The first degree is called the \"Buffalo\" and is the basic rank of membership. The second degree is called the \"Mark Master\" and requires a minimum of one year of service as a Buffalo. The third degree is called the \"Royal Ark Mariner\" and requires a minimum of two years of service as a Mark Master.\n\n## Minor Lodges\n\nMinor lodges are chapters of the RAOB that meet regularly to conduct business and participate in social activities. Minor lodges are typically named after geographic locations or other themes and are usually smaller than grand lodges. There are several types of minor lodges, including \"Banners\" and \"Floating Dispensation Lodges\".\n\n## Banners\n\nBanners are a type of minor lodge that is specifically designated for charitable and community service activities. Banners are usually named after a specific theme or cause and are responsible for organizing and participating in fundraising events and other activities.\n\n## Use of \"Royal\"\n\nThe use of the term \"Royal\" in the RAOB's name and logo is a reference to the order's historical connection to the British royal family. The order was founded by a group of freemasons who were associated with the royal family, and the \"Royal\" prefix was adopted as a mark of respect and allegiance.\n\n## Dispensations\n\nDispensations are special permissions granted by the Grand Council to establish new lodges or banners outside of the normal territorial boundaries. Dispensations are usually granted for a specific reason, such as to establish a lodge in a new geographic area or to create a new type of lodge.\n\n## Motto\n\nThe motto of the RAOB is \"Per Ardua ad Astra\", which is Latin for \"Through adversity to the stars\". This motto reflects the order's commitment to perseverance and striving for excellence.\n\n## Lodge names and associations\n\nLodge names and associations are an important part of the RAOB's identity and culture. Lodges often have names that reflect their geographic location, historical significance, or other themes.

The rebellion marked a rare instance of internal conflict within the Russian military, highlighting the deep-seated tensions and power struggles within the country's highest echelons.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Wagner Group\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman and former chef, founded the Wagner Group in 2014. The PMC quickly gained notoriety for its involvement in various conflicts, including the Syrian Civil War and the Russian-Ukrainian War. Wagner Group operatives have been accused of committing war crimes and human rights abuses in several countries. Despite these allegations, Prigozhin has maintained a close relationship with the Russian government, particularly with President Vladimir Putin.\n\n### Internal tensions during the invasion of Ukraine\n\nAs the Russian invasion of Ukraine escalated in 2022, tensions within the Russian military and government began to rise. The Wagner Group, which had been instrumental in the initial stages of the invasion, became increasingly at odds with the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) and the government. Prigozhin, who had been calling for a more aggressive approach to the war, grew frustrated with the MoD's perceived lack of support for the Wagner Group.\n\n### Order to integrate Wagner\n\nIn January 2023, the Russian government ordered the integration of the Wagner Group into the Russian military. Prigozhin, who had grown accustomed to the PMC's independence, saw this move as a betrayal and a power play by the government to consolidate control over the military. The order sparked widespread discontent within the Wagner Group, with many operatives viewing it as a threat to their autonomy and livelihoods.\n\n### Planning the rebellion\n\nAs tensions escalated, Prigozhin and his allies within the Wagner Group began planning a rebellion against the Russian government. The exact details of the planning process remain unclear, but it is believed that Prigozhin and his associates used their extensive network of contacts and operatives to gather support and resources for the impending conflict.\n\n**Rebellion**\n\n### Prigozhin's statements\n\nOn February 23, 2023, Prigozhin made a series of provocative statements on social media, targeting the Russian government and the MoD. He accused the government of launching a \"coup\" against the Wagner Group and vowed to take action against those responsible. The statements sparked widespread speculation and concern within Russia, as many saw them as a clear call to rebellion.\n\n### Rebukes of the government and allegation of an attack on Wagner\n\nIn a series of subsequent statements, Prigozhin accused the government of launching a coordinated attack on the Wagner Group, seeking to destroy the PMC and eliminate its leader. He claimed that the Wagner Group had been betrayed by the government and that its operatives were being unfairly targeted. The statements were seen as a thinly veiled threat by many, who feared that the conflict could escalate into a full-blown rebellion.\n\n### Call to rebellion\n\nOn February 24, 2023, Prigozhin called on his followers to take action against the Russian government, urging them to join him in a rebellion against the MoD and the government. The call to arms was seen as a turning point in the conflict, as many within the Wagner Group and the broader Russian military began to mobilize against the government.\n\n**Capture of Rostov-on-Don**\n\nOn February 25, 2023, Wagner Group operatives seized control of Rostov-on-Don, a strategic city in southern Russia. The capture marked a significant blow to the government, as the city was a key transportation hub and a major military logistics center. The Wagner Group's control of the city allowed them to launch further attacks against the government and its allies.\n\n**Advance towards Moscow**\n\nAs the conflict escalated, the Wagner Group began to advance towards Moscow, with reports suggesting that they had reached as far as the city of Tula, located approximately 150 kilometers southwest of the capital. The advance sparked widespread panic and concern within the government, as many feared that the rebellion could spread to the capital.\n\n**Security measures**\n\nIn response to the growing threat, the Russian government implemented a series of security measures, including the deployment of troops and military equipment to key locations. The government also imposed a state of emergency in several regions, suspending public gatherings and restricting access to certain areas.\n\n**Events in Syria**\n\nAs the conflict escalated, reports emerged of Wagner Group operatives being deployed to Syria, where they were involved in fighting against the Syrian government and its allies. The deployment marked a significant escalation of the conflict, as the Wagner Group's involvement in Syria had previously been limited to supporting the Russian military.\n\n**Resolution**\n\nAfter several days of intense fighting, the Wagner Group rebellion was brought to an end on February 28, 2023, when Prigozhin's forces were defeated by the Russian military. The conflict had resulted in significant losses on both sides, with reports suggesting that hundreds of operatives and civilians had been killed or injured.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Domestic\n\n* **Vladimir Putin's address**: In a televised address, President Putin condemned the rebellion and vowed to bring those responsible to justice. He praised the Russian military for their bravery and sacrifice, and called on the nation to stand together in the face of the threat.\n* **Other government-aligned figures**: Many government-aligned figures, including senior officials and lawmakers, condemned the rebellion and supported the government's efforts to quell the uprising. They praised the Russian military for their bravery and praised Putin for his leadership.\n* **Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups**: Anti-war opposition groups and anti-government armed groups, such as the Russian opposition party \"Solidarity,\" condemned the government's actions and supported the Wagner Group's rebellion. They called for an end to the war in Ukraine and demanded greater accountability from the government.\n* **Ultranationalists and milbloggers**: Ultranationalist groups and milbloggers, who had previously supported the Russian military, turned against the government in the wake of the rebellion. They accused the government of treason and called for a new leadership to take charge.\n* **Wider public**: Many ordinary Russians, who had been watching the conflict unfold, expressed shock and disappointment at the government's handling of the situation. They called for greater transparency and accountability from the government and demanded an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\n### International\n\n* **NATO countries**: NATO countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland, condemned the rebellion and supported the Russian government's efforts to quell the uprising. They praised the Russian military for their bravery and called on the nation to stand together in the face of the threat.\n* **European Union**: The European Union condemned the rebellion and called for greater accountability from the Russian government. They praised the Russian military for their bravery and called on the nation to respect international law and human rights.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Fallout and restoring order\n\nAfter the rebellion was brought to an end, the Russian government implemented a series of measures to restore order and stability within the country. The government deployed troops to key locations, suspended public gatherings, and restricted access to certain areas.\n\n### Subsequent statements\n\nIn the aftermath of the rebellion, Prigozhin and his associates released a series of statements, condemning the government's actions and praising the Wagner Group's bravery. They called for greater accountability from the government and demanded an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\n### Fate of the Wagner Group and Yevgeny Prigozhin\n\n* **Closure of criminal case**: The Russian government closed the criminal case against the Wagner Group, citing a lack of evidence.\n* **Initial statements**: Prigozhin and his associates released a series of initial statements, praising the Wagner Group's bravery and condemning the government's actions.\n* **Crackdown on Wagner**: The Russian government launched a crackdown on the Wagner Group, arresting several operatives and seizing assets.\n* **Alleged purges and related arrests**: The Russian government reportedly launched a series of purges within the military and government, targeting those who had supported the Wagner Group or been involved in the rebellion.\n* **Prigozhin's return to Russia**: Prigozhin returned to Russia, where he was reportedly placed under house arrest.\n* **Death of Prigozhin and Utkin**: In March 2023, Prigozhin and his close associate, Dmitry Utkin, were killed in a helicopter crash in Russia.\n\n### Measures of NATO countries\n\nIn the aftermath of the rebellion, NATO countries implemented a series of measures to support the Russian government and strengthen their own military presence in the region. They deployed troops to Eastern Europe, increased military spending, and imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n* **Political**: The Wagner Group rebellion marked a significant turning point in the conflict between the Russian government and the Wagner Group. The rebellion highlighted the deep-seated tensions and power struggles within the Russian military and government, and demonstrated the willingness of the Wagner Group to challenge the government's authority.\n* **Military**: The rebellion marked a significant escalation of the conflict, as the Wagner Group's operatives were involved in fighting against the Russian military and its allies.

The election was held in response to the resignation of several members of the assembly who had joined the PTI-led coalition government in the province.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe by-elections were called after the resignation of several members of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, who had joined the PTI-led coalition government in the province. The resignations were triggered by the PTI's decision to form an alliance with the PML-Q and other smaller parties in the province. The by-elections were seen as a test of the PTI's strength in the province and its ability to hold onto power.\n\nThe by-elections were also significant because they were the first major electoral test for the PTI since the 2018 general elections. The PTI had won a landslide victory in the 2018 general elections, but its popularity had begun to wane in recent months due to a series of controversies and scandals.\n\n**Candidates**\n\nA total of 37 candidates contested the by-elections, which were held in 37 constituencies. The candidates included members of the PTI, PML-N, PML-Q, PPP, and other smaller parties. The PTI had fielded candidates in all 37 constituencies, while the PML-N had fielded candidates in 29 constituencies.\n\nThe candidates included several prominent politicians, including former provincial ministers and assembly members. The PTI had also fielded several young and charismatic candidates, who were seen as potential future leaders of the party.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the by-elections were announced on July 20, 2022, and the PTI emerged as the winner in 22 constituencies. The PML-N won in 12 constituencies, while the PML-Q won in 3 constituencies. The PPP won in 2 constituencies.\n\nThe PTI's victory in the by-elections was seen as a significant boost to the party's morale and a vindication of its decision to form an alliance with the PML-Q and other smaller parties. The party's leaders hailed the results as a major victory and a testament to the party's popularity and strength in the province.\n\n**Result by Constituency**\n\nThe results of the by-elections varied from constituency to constituency.

They are typically found on the right-hand side of the periodic table, with some exceptions.\n\n## Definition and applicable elements\n\nNonmetals are a broad category of elements that include the noble gases, halogens, and other elements that do not exhibit the typical properties of metals. The applicable elements are:\n\n* Noble gases: He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn\n* Halogen nonmetals: F, Cl, Br, I, At\n* Unclassified nonmetals: C, N, O, P, S, Se, Te, Po\n\n## General properties\n\nNonmetals exhibit a range of physical and chemical properties that distinguish them from metals.\n\n### Physical properties\n\nNonmetals are typically characterized by their low densities, low melting and boiling points, and low thermal conductivities. They are often found in their elemental form as gases or solids at room temperature.\n\n#### Allotropes\n\nSome nonmetals exhibit allotropy, which is the ability to exist in different physical forms. For example, carbon can exist as diamond, graphite, and fullerenes. Nitrogen can exist as N2, N4, and other forms.\n\n### Chemical properties\n\nNonmetals are generally unreactive and do not readily form compounds with other elements. However, they can exhibit a range of chemical properties, including:\n\n* Oxidation states: Nonmetals can exhibit a range of oxidation states, from -3 (e.g., in the case of boron) to +7 (e.g., in the case of chlorine).\n* Multiple bond formation: Nonmetals can form multiple bonds with other elements, such as double and triple bonds.\n\n### Complications\n\nThe classification of nonmetals is not always straightforward, and there are several complications that arise.\n\n#### First row anomaly\n\nThe first row of the periodic table is anomalous, with the elements lithium, beryllium, and boron exhibiting some properties of metals, such as malleability and conductivity.\n\n#### Secondary periodicity\n\nSome nonmetals exhibit secondary periodicity, which is the phenomenon of certain elements exhibiting properties that are more characteristic of other elements in the same group.\n\n#### Higher oxidation states\n\nSome nonmetals can exhibit higher oxidation states than would be expected based on their group number, such as phosphorus, which can exhibit an oxidation state of +5.\n\n#### Multiple bond formation\n\nNonmetals can form multiple bonds with other elements, which can lead to the formation of complex molecules.\n\n#### Property overlaps\n\nThere are some elements that exhibit properties that overlap between the nonmetal and metal categories, such as carbon and silicon.\n\n## Types\n\nNonmetals can be divided into several types based on their properties and behavior.\n\n### Noble gases\n\nThe noble gases are a group of elements that are chemically inert and do not readily form compounds with other elements. They are characterized by their low reactivity and their ability to exist as monatomic gases.\n\n### Halogen nonmetals\n\nThe halogen nonmetals are a group of elements that are highly reactive and readily form compounds with other elements. They are characterized by their high reactivity and their ability to exist as diatomic molecules.\n\n### Unclassified nonmetals\n\nThe unclassified nonmetals are a group of elements that do not fit into the noble gas or halogen nonmetal categories. They are characterized by their unique properties and behavior.\n\n## Abundance, extraction, and uses\n\nNonmetals are found in a range of natural environments, including the atmosphere, soil, and minerals.\n\n### Abundance\n\nNonmetals are relatively abundant in the Earth's crust, with some elements, such as oxygen and nitrogen, being present in high concentrations.\n\n### Extraction\n\nNonmetals can be extracted from the Earth's crust using a range of methods, including mining, drilling, and chemical extraction.\n\n### Uses\n\nNonmetals have a range of uses, including:\n\n* Energy production: Nonmetals, such as carbon and hydrogen, are used to produce energy through combustion and nuclear reactions.\n* Manufacturing: Nonmetals, such as silicon and aluminum, are used to produce a range of materials, including semiconductors and aerospace components.\n* Medical applications: Nonmetals, such as oxygen and nitrogen, are used in medical applications, including respiratory therapy and cryosurgery.\n\n## Taxonomical history\n\nThe classification of nonmetals has undergone significant changes over the years.\n\n### Background\n\nThe concept of nonmetals dates back to the early days of chemistry, when scientists recognized that there were elements that did not exhibit the typical properties of metals.\n\n### Organization of elements by types\n\nIn the early days of chemistry, elements were organized into several categories, including metals, nonmetals, and metalloids.\n\n### Development of types\n\nOver time, the concept of nonmetals has been refined, with the development of new categories and subcategories.\n\n### Suggested distinguishing criteria\n\nThere are several suggested distinguishing criteria for nonmetals, including:\n\n* Electronegativity: Nonmetals are characterized by their high electronegativity, which is the ability of an atom to attract electrons.\n* Ionization energy: Nonmetals are characterized by their high ionization energy, which is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom.\n* Electronegativity trend: Nonmetals exhibit a trend in electronegativity, with the elements becoming more electronegative as you move from left to right in the periodic table.\n\n## Comparison of selected properties\n\nThe following table compares the physical and chemical properties of some of the nonmetals.\n\n| Element | Physical Properties | Chemical Properties |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Carbon | Solid at room temperature, high melting point | Forms multiple bonds with other elements, exhibits a range of oxidation states |\n| Nitrogen | Gas at room temperature, low melting point | Forms multiple bonds with other elements, exhibits a range of oxidation states |\n| Oxygen | Gas at room temperature, high reactivity | Forms multiple bonds with other elements, exhibits a range of oxidation states |\n| Phosphorus | Solid at room temperature, high reactivity | Forms multiple bonds with other elements, exhibits a range of oxidation states |\n\n## See also\n\n* Metal\n* Metalloid\n* Noble gas\n* Halogen\n* Electronegativity\n* Ionization energy\n\n## Notes\n\n* Nonmetals are a broad category of elements that include many different elements.\n* The classification of nonmetals is not always straightforward, and there are several complications that arise.\n* Nonmetals exhibit a range of physical and chemical properties that distinguish them from metals.\n\n## References\n\n### Citations\n\n* [1] Greenwood, Norman N.; Earnshaw, Alan (1997).

The playoffs began on January 14, 2023, and concluded with Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023. The playoffs consisted of six teams from each conference, with the four division winners and two wild-card teams from each conference competing for their respective conference championships and the right to play in the Super Bowl.\n\n# Participants\n\n## Unused format changes following Week 17 canceled Bills–Bengals game\n\nThe NFL had considered adopting a new format for the playoffs, with the top two teams in each conference receiving a first-round bye. However, this format was not implemented due to the Week 17 cancellation of the Buffalo Bills–Cincinnati Bengals game, which would have affected the seeding of the teams. As a result, the traditional format of the playoffs was used, with the four division winners and two wild-card teams from each conference competing in the postseason.\n\n## New postseason overtime rule\n\nFor the 2022-23 playoffs, the NFL introduced a new overtime rule, which allowed the game to continue until a winner was determined in the event of a tie at the end of the four quarters. This rule was intended to reduce the number of tie games and provide a more conclusive outcome for the teams competing in the postseason.\n\n# Bracket\n\nThe 2022-23 NFL playoffs consisted of six teams from each conference, with the four division winners and two wild-card teams from each conference competing for their respective conference championships and the right to play in the Super Bowl.

The path runs from the Pacific Ocean to the Expo Line, passing through the cities of Santa Monica and Los Angeles.\n\n# Route\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path begins at the Ballona Creek mouth, where it empties into the Santa Monica Bay. From there, it runs northward, paralleling the creek, and passes through the Ballona Creek Wetlands, a protected area that is home to a variety of plant and animal species. The path then enters the city of Santa Monica, where it passes through the city's Ballona Creek Bike Path section, a 1.3-mile-long (2.1 km) stretch that is relatively flat and easy to ride.\n\n## Airport\n\nAs the path continues northward, it approaches the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), which is located on the western edge of the city. The path passes beneath the airport's runways, providing a unique view of the planes taking off and landing. However, this section of the path is often closed due to airport operations and construction.\n\n# Conditions\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path is generally considered a moderately difficult ride, with some sections being relatively flat and others being more hilly. The path is paved and well-maintained, with wide shoulders and a clear view of the surrounding area. However, the path can be quite busy, especially on weekends and holidays, when families and tourists often ride or walk the path.\n\n## Rest stops\n\nThere are several rest stops and parking areas along the Ballona Creek Bike Path, providing a place for riders to stop and rest or park their bikes. These areas are often equipped with picnic tables, benches, and restrooms. Some of the most notable rest stops include the Ballona Creek Wetlands rest stop, which offers a stunning view of the surrounding wetlands, and the LAX rest stop, which provides a unique view of the airport.\n\n## Homeless camping\n\nUnfortunately, the Ballona Creek Bike Path has become a popular spot for homeless camping, with many individuals setting up makeshift shelters and camps along the path. While some advocates argue that the path provides a safe and convenient location for homeless individuals to reside, others argue that it creates a public health and safety concern.\n\n# Access gates\n\nThere are several access gates along the Ballona Creek Bike Path, providing riders with points of entry and exit. These gates are often locked at night and during inclement weather, but are typically unlocked during daylight hours. Some of the most notable access gates include the Santa Monica access gate, which is located at the southern end of the path, and the LAX access gate, which is located at the northern end of the path.\n\n# History\n\nThe Ballona Creek Bike Path has a long and varied history, dating back to the early 20th century when the creek was first developed for flood control and drainage purposes. The path was initially constructed in the 1970s as a bike path and pedestrian walkway, but it has undergone several renovations and expansions over the years. In 2010, the path was closed for several years due to a major flood control project, which improved the path's infrastructure and expanded its length.\n\n# Improvements\n\nIn recent years, the Ballona Creek Bike Path has undergone several improvements, including the installation of new signage, lighting, and landscaping. The path has also been widened and resurfaced, making it safer and more accessible for riders. Additionally, the Ballona Creek Wetlands have been restored and improved, providing a more natural and diverse environment for plant and animal species.\n\n# Proposed extensions\n\nThere are several proposed extensions to the Ballona Creek Bike Path, including a potential extension to the Santa Monica Pier and a potential connection to the Marvin Braude Bike Trail. These extensions would provide riders with additional routes and opportunities to explore the surrounding area.\n\n# Gallery\n\n[Insert gallery of images]\n\n# See also\n\n* Ballona Creek Wetlands\n* Los Angeles International Airport\n* Marvin Braude Bike Trail\n* Santa Monica Pier\n\n# References\n\n# External links\n\nNote: The article does not include any citations or references as per the requirement.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ballona_Creek_Bike_Path\" following this outline:\n\n#Route\n##Airport\n#Conditions\n##Rest stops\n##Homeless camping\n#Access gates\n#History\n#Improvements\n#Proposed extensions\n#Gallery\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The team of scientists and deep-sea explorers, led by Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham), returns to the Mariana Trench to investigate a series of strange occurrences and unexplained phenomena. They soon discover that the Megalodon, the massive prehistoric shark they thought they had killed, is still alive and has evolved into an even more formidable creature.\n\nAs the team delves deeper into the trench, they encounter a swarm of smaller sharks and other marine predators that seem to be attracted to the Megalodon's presence. The team soon realizes that the Megalodon is not just a mindless killer, but a highly intelligent and calculating creature that has been awakened by the team's presence.\n\nAs tensions rise and the team's situation becomes more desperate, they realize that the only way to stop the Megalodon is to use the same technology that was used to kill it in the first place. However, the team soon discovers that the technology has been compromised, and they must find a way to repair it before it's too late.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Jason Statham as Jonas Taylor\n* Li Bingbing as Suyin Zhang\n* Page Kennedy as DJ\n* Rainn Wilson as Jack Morris\n* Sophia Cai as Meiying\n* Jessica McNamee as Lori Taylor\n* Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as Jaxx Herd\n* Winston Chao as Dr. Heller\n* Cliff Curtis as Dr. Heller\n* Ruby Rose as Jaxx's sister\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nMeg 2: The Trench was first announced in 2019, with Ben Wheatley set to direct and Damon Gaster writing the script.

The series features silkscreen prints of Campbell's soup cans, which became an instantly recognizable symbol of consumer culture and American identity.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series is widely regarded as one of the most iconic and influential works of the Pop Art movement. Warhol's innovative use of commercial images and mass production techniques challenged traditional notions of art and culture. The series has been interpreted in various ways, from a commentary on consumer culture to a celebration of American iconography. This article provides an overview of the series, its creation, and its significance in the context of Warhol's art and the Pop Art movement.\n\n**Early career**\n\n**New York art scene**\n\nIn the early 1960s, Warhol was a prominent figure in the New York art scene. He had already gained recognition for his work as a commercial illustrator and filmmaker. Warhol's studio, known as the Factory, became a hub for artists, musicians, and writers, who were drawn to his innovative and experimental approach to art. The Factory was a space where Warhol and his collaborators could experiment with new techniques and ideas, and it played a significant role in the development of the Campbell's Soup Cans series.\n\n**Pop art**\n\nWarhol's work was closely associated with the Pop Art movement, which emerged in the late 1950s. Pop Art challenged traditional notions of art by incorporating elements of popular culture, such as advertising and consumer products. Warhol's use of Campbell's soup cans as a subject for art was a direct reference to the ubiquity of consumer culture in American society. The series was a commentary on the ways in which consumer products had become an integral part of American life.\n\n**Premiere**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series premiered at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1962. The exhibition was a groundbreaking event that showcased Warhol's innovative use of commercial images and mass production techniques. The series consisted of 32 silkscreen prints of Campbell's soup cans, each in a different color. The prints were created using a silkscreen process, which allowed Warhol to mass-produce the images quickly and efficiently.\n\n**Subsequent publicity**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series received widespread publicity, with reviews and articles appearing in major newspapers and art magazines. The series was seen as a bold and provocative challenge to traditional notions of art, and it sparked a lively debate about the role of consumer culture in American society. Warhol's use of commercial images and mass production techniques was seen as a commentary on the ways in which consumer products had become an integral part of American life.\n\n**Campbell's Soup Company**\n\n**Can and label history**\n\nCampbell's Soup Company was founded in 1869 by Joseph A. Campbell. The company began as a small business, producing canned soups and other food products. Over the years, Campbell's Soup Company expanded its product line to include a wide range of soups, sauces, and other food products. The company's iconic soup cans, featuring a red and white label, became a recognizable symbol of American consumer culture.\n\n**Relation to Warhol's art**\n\nWarhol's use of Campbell's soup cans as a subject for art was a commentary on the ways in which consumer products had become an integral part of American life. The series was a reference to the ubiquity of consumer culture in American society, and it challenged traditional notions of art by incorporating elements of popular culture. Warhol's use of Campbell's soup cans was also a nod to the company's iconic branding and packaging, which had become a recognizable symbol of American consumer culture.\n\n**Inspiration**\n\n**Artist colleagues**\n\nWarhol's work was influenced by his colleagues and friends, including artists such as Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns. Lichtenstein's use of comic book images in his art was a direct reference to the ubiquity of popular culture in American society. Johns' use of everyday objects as subjects for art was a commentary on the ways in which consumer products had become an integral part of American life. Warhol's use of Campbell's soup cans was a nod to the work of his colleagues and friends, who were challenging traditional notions of art and culture.\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series has been interpreted in various ways, from a commentary on consumer culture to a celebration of American iconography. The series has been seen as a reference to the ways in which consumer products had become an integral part of American life, and it has been praised for its innovative use of commercial images and mass production techniques. The series has also been criticized for its perceived lack of depth and meaning, and it has been seen as a reflection of Warhol's own fascination with the banal and the mundane.\n\n**Variations**\n\n**Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II**\n\nIn 1962, Warhol created two versions of the Campbell's Soup Cans series, which he titled \"Campbell's Soup I\" and \"Campbell's Soup Cans II.\" The first version featured 32 silkscreen prints of Campbell's soup cans, each in a different color. The second version featured 18 prints, which were created using a different technique and color palette. The two versions of the series showcase Warhol's innovative use of commercial images and mass production techniques, and they demonstrate his ability to experiment with different techniques and ideas.\n\n**Colored soup cans**\n\nWarhol's use of colored soup cans in the series was a reference to the ways in which consumer products had become an integral part of American life. The colors used in the series, such as red, blue, and green, were chosen for their bright and eye-catching qualities, which were meant to grab the viewer's attention and draw them into the world of consumer culture. The use of color in the series also added a sense of depth and texture to the images, which helped to create a sense of visual interest and engagement.\n\n**Unauthorized versions**\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, unauthorized versions of the Campbell's Soup Cans series were created by artists and designers who were inspired by Warhol's work. These versions, which often featured modified or distorted images of the soup cans, were meant to pay homage to Warhol's innovative use of commercial images and mass production techniques. However, they were also seen as a critique of the ways in which consumer culture had become a dominant force in American society.\n\n**Other variations**\n\nWarhol's use of the Campbell's Soup Cans series has been adapted and reinterpreted in various ways, including in film, music, and literature. The series has been referenced in works such as Martin Scorsese's film \"Mean Streets\" and in the music of artists such as Madonna and Prince. The series has also been the subject of numerous exhibitions and retrospectives, which have showcased Warhol's innovative use of commercial images and mass production techniques.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Campbell's Soup Cans series is a iconic and influential work of the Pop Art movement. Warhol's innovative use of commercial images and mass production techniques challenged traditional notions of art and culture. The series has been interpreted in various ways, from a commentary on consumer culture to a celebration of American iconography. The series continues to be widely regarded as one of the most important works of the 20th century, and it remains a powerful symbol of American consumer culture.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Pop Art\n* Andy Warhol\n* Campbell's Soup Company\n* Roy Lichtenstein\n* Jasper Johns\n* Martin Scorsese\n* Madonna\n* Prince\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is based on a range of sources, including books, articles, and online resources.\n* The article provides a general overview of the Campbell's Soup Cans series and its significance in the context of Warhol's art and the Pop Art movement.\n* The article does not include specific citations or references, as these are not required for a Wikipedia-style article.\n\n**References**\n\n* This article does not include specific references, as these are not required for a Wikipedia-style article.\n\n**External links**\n\n* The Andy Warhol Museum: Campbell's Soup Cans\n* Campbell's Soup Company: History\n* Pop Art: A Movement in Modern Art\n* Roy Lichtenstein: Artist and Illustrator\n* Jasper Johns: Artist and Illustrator\n* Martin Scorsese: Film Director and Producer\n* Madonna: Singer and Songwriter\n* Prince: Singer and Songwriter", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Campbell's_Soup_Cans\" following this outline:\n\n#Early career\n##New York art scene\n##Pop art\n#Premiere\n##Subsequent publicity\n#Campbell's Soup Company\n##Can and label history\n##Relation to Warhol's art\n#Inspiration\n##Artist colleagues\n#Interpretation\n#Variations\n##Campbell's Soup I and Campbell's Soup Cans II\n##Colored soup cans\n##Unauthorized versions\n##Other variations\n#Conclusion\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The mission aimed to test the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the Orion spacecraft, and the Gateway, a lunar-orbiting space station. This article provides an overview of the mission profile, background, flight, payloads, media outreach, and related information.\n\n**Mission Profile**\n\nThe Artemis I mission profile involved launching an uncrewed Orion spacecraft on top of the SLS rocket from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B. The spacecraft was designed to travel to the Moon, enter lunar orbit, and then return to Earth. The mission timeline included a series of complex events, including lunar orbit insertion, trans-Earth injection, and reentry.\n\n### Mission Profile Animation\n\nA mission profile animation was created to illustrate the various stages of the Artemis I mission. The animation showed the SLS rocket lifting off from Kennedy Space Center, followed by the separation of the Orion spacecraft and the ICPS (Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage). The animation also depicted the spacecraft's journey to the Moon, including the lunar orbit insertion and the return to Earth.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was part of NASA's long-term plan to return humans to the Moon by 2024. The mission was designed to test the SLS rocket, which was intended to carry astronauts to the Moon and beyond. The Orion spacecraft, which was developed by Lockheed Martin, was also designed to carry astronauts on future missions.\n\n### Ground Testing\n\nGround testing was conducted on the SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft to ensure they were functioning properly. The testing included a series of static fires and vibration tests, which were designed to simulate the stresses of launch and flight. The testing also included a series of systems checks, which were designed to ensure that all of the spacecraft's systems were functioning properly.\n\n### Assembly\n\nThe SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft were assembled at Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). The assembly process involved stacking the rocket's stages and attaching the Orion spacecraft to the top of the rocket. The assembly process also involved attaching the ICPS to the top of the SLS rocket.\n\n### Launch Preparations\n\nThe SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft underwent a series of final checks and preparations before launch. The rocket's fuel tanks were filled with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, and the spacecraft's systems were powered up. The rocket's guidance system was also checked to ensure that it was functioning properly.\n\n### Initial Launch Attempts\n\nThe Artemis I mission was initially scheduled to launch on August 29, 2022, but it was scrubbed due to technical issues with the SLS rocket. The rocket's fuel tanks were not properly fueled, which caused a series of system failures. The launch was rescheduled for September 2, 2022, but it was scrubbed again due to a series of issues with the rocket's power system. The launch was rescheduled for November 16, 2022, and it was successful.\n\n**Flight**\n\nThe Artemis I mission began with the launch of the SLS rocket from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B on November 16, 2022. The rocket lifted off at 1:47 a.m. EST and flew for 26 minutes before separating from the ICPS. The Orion spacecraft continued on its journey to the Moon, entering lunar orbit on November 21, 2022.\n\n### Launch\n\nThe launch of the SLS rocket was a complex process that involved a series of stages. The rocket's core stage was powered by four RS-25 engines, which burned liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to produce a combined 1.2 million pounds of thrust. The rocket's upper stage was powered by a single RL-10 engine, which burned liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to produce 24,000 pounds of thrust.\n\n### Outbound Flight\n\nThe Orion spacecraft traveled to the Moon on the SLS rocket, which provided a precise and efficient ride. The spacecraft's speed increased as it traveled to the Moon, reaching a maximum speed of 24,791 miles per hour. The spacecraft's trajectory was also affected by the gravitational pull of the Earth and the Moon.\n\n### Lunar Orbit\n\nThe Orion spacecraft entered lunar orbit on November 21, 2022, and began a series of lunar-orbiting maneuvers. The spacecraft's orbit was designed to take it to the far side of the Moon, where it would conduct a series of scientific experiments. The spacecraft's orbit was also affected by the gravitational pull of the Moon.\n\n### Return Flight\n\nThe Orion spacecraft began its return flight to Earth on December 11, 2022, and re-entered Earth's atmosphere on December 11, 2022. The spacecraft's heat shield was designed to protect it from the intense heat generated by re-entry, and its parachutes were deployed to slow its descent.\n\n### Reentry and Splashdown\n\nThe Orion spacecraft splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on December 11, 2022, at 12:40 p.m. EST. The spacecraft's splashdown was a complex process that involved a series of systems checks and a final splashdown in the ocean. The spacecraft was recovered by a U.S. Navy ship, which transported it back to shore for further analysis.\n\n**Payloads**\n\nThe Artemis I mission carried a series of payloads, including a pair of cubesats. The cubesats were designed to test the spacecraft's communication systems and its ability to conduct scientific experiments in space.\n\n### Cubesats\n\nThe two cubesats that were carried on the Artemis I mission were the Near-Earth Asteroid Scout (NEASc) and the BioSentinel. The NEASc was designed to test the spacecraft's communication systems and its ability to conduct scientific experiments in space. The BioSentinel was designed to test the spacecraft's ability to conduct biological experiments in space.\n\n**Media Outreach**\n\nThe Artemis I mission was a major media event, with thousands of journalists and media outlets covering the mission. The mission was covered by major news outlets, including NASA's public affairs team, which provided a series of press releases and updates throughout the mission.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Artemis program\n* Space Launch System (SLS)\n* Orion spacecraft\n* Mars Exploration Program\n* International Space Station\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Artemis I mission was the first uncrewed mission of the Artemis program.\n* The mission was designed to test the SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft.\n* The mission was carried out by NASA's Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate.\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: No references are provided in this article, as it is based on publicly available information and does not require citations.)\n\n**External Links**\n\n* NASA's Artemis I mission website\n* NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) website\n* NASA's Orion spacecraft website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Artemis_I\" following this outline:\n\n#Mission profile\n##Mission profile animation\n#Background\n##Ground testing\n##Assembly\n##Launch preparations\n##Initial launch attempts\n#Flight\n##Launch\n##Outbound flight\n##Lunar orbit\n##Return flight\n##Reentry and splashdown\n#Payloads\n##Cubesats\n#Media outreach\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was the 46th federal election since the Federation of Australia in 1901.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe 2022 Australian federal election was a highly contested election, with the incumbent Liberal Party-led government, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, facing a significant challenge from the opposition Labor Party, led by Anthony Albanese. The election was marked by a range of key issues, including economic management, climate change, and social policy. The election saw a high level of voter engagement, with a record number of Australians casting their ballots.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Previous election\n\nThe previous federal election was held in 2019, when the Liberal Party-led government, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, won a surprise victory, defeating the opposition Labor Party, led by Bill Shorten. The election saw the Liberal Party win a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, with the Labor Party winning 35 seats, the Greens winning one seat, and 15 independent and minor party members elected.\n\n### Composition of parliament\n\nAt the time of the 2022 election, the Australian Parliament consisted of 151 members of the House of Representatives and 76 members of the Senate. The composition of the Parliament was as follows:\n\n* Liberal Party: 76 seats (House of Representatives), 26 seats (Senate)\n* National Party: 16 seats (House of Representatives), 8 seats (Senate)\n* Labor Party: 69 seats (House of Representatives), 26 seats (Senate)\n* Greens: 1 seat (House of Representatives), 12 seats (Senate)\n* Independents and minor parties: 9 seats (House of Representatives), 4 seats (Senate)\n\n### Events of the 46th Parliament\n\nThe 46th Parliament of Australia was marked by a range of significant events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the bushfires of 2019-2020, and the ongoing debate over climate change. The Parliament also saw the passage of a number of key legislation, including the Banking Royal Commission's recommendations and the Retirement Savings Guarantee.\n\n### Change in party registration rules\n\nIn 2021, the Australian Electoral Commission introduced new rules for party registration, requiring parties to meet stricter requirements to be eligible for funding and representation.

These clocks are based on the principles of quantum mechanics and have revolutionized the way we keep track of time. With their incredible accuracy, atomic clocks have become a crucial tool in various fields, from science and technology to navigation and finance.\n\n**History**\n\n### Definition of the Second\n\nThe concept of an atomic clock began to take shape in the 1940s, when physicists first proposed the idea of using atomic vibrations to measure time. The definition of the second was a major factor in the development of atomic clocks. Prior to the 1960s, the second was defined as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day, which was a relatively inaccurate measurement.\n\n### Metrology Advancements and Optical Clocks\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, significant advancements in metrology led to the development of more accurate timekeeping methods. The invention of the maser (microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) in 1954 marked a major breakthrough in the field. The maser's ability to amplify weak microwave signals paved the way for the creation of the first atomic clocks.\n\n### Chip-Scale Atomic Clocks\n\nIn recent years, the development of chip-scale atomic clocks has further improved the accuracy and compactness of atomic clocks. These clocks use a tiny chip to store and amplify the atomic signal, enabling the creation of more accurate and portable timekeeping devices.\n\n**Measuring Time with Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Clock Mechanism\n\nAn atomic clock consists of three main components: the atomic source, the reference cavity, and the control system. The atomic source releases a stream of atoms that are excited to a specific energy state. The reference cavity, typically a microwave cavity, is used to detect the changes in the atomic energy state. The control system adjusts the clock's frequency to match the atomic energy state, thus maintaining the clock's accuracy.\n\n### Tuning and Optimization\n\nTo ensure optimal performance, atomic clocks must be carefully tuned and optimized. This involves adjusting the clock's frequency to match the atomic energy state and compensating for external factors such as temperature, magnetic fields, and vibrations. Regular calibration and maintenance are also essential to maintain the clock's accuracy.\n\n**Accuracy**\n\nThe accuracy of an atomic clock is measured in terms of its frequency stability and its ability to maintain a consistent time standard. Atomic clocks are capable of achieving an accuracy of one second over tens of millions of years, making them the most accurate timekeeping devices in existence.\n\n**Comparing Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Time Standards\n\nAtomic clocks are used as time standards in various countries, with the most accurate clock being the International System of Units (SI) second. This time standard is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.\n\n### Synchronization with Satellites\n\nAtomic clocks are used in global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) such as GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo to provide accurate location and time information. These clocks are synchronized with the atomic clocks on the ground to ensure accurate timing.\n\n### International Timekeeping\n\nThe International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) are responsible for coordinating international timekeeping and ensuring that atomic clocks are synchronized across the globe.\n\n### Fiber Optics\n\nFiber optic technology has also been used to improve the accuracy and reliability of atomic clocks. Fiber optic links enable the transmission of precise timing signals over long distances, reducing the need for physical synchronization of clocks.\n\n**Microwave Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Caesium\n\nCaesium is one of the most commonly used elements in atomic clocks due to its high sensitivity to microwave radiation. Caesium atomic clocks are widely used in scientific and industrial applications due to their high accuracy and stability.\n\n### Block Diagram\n\nA block diagram of a caesium atomic clock is shown below:\n\n```\n  +---------------+\n  |  Caesium  |\n  |  source    |\n  +---------------+\n           |\n           |\n           v\n  +---------------+\n  |  Reference  |\n  |  cavity     |\n  +---------------+\n           |\n           |\n           v\n  +---------------+\n  |  Control    |\n  |  system     |\n  +---------------+\n```\n\n### Rubidium\n\nRubidium is another element used in atomic clocks, particularly in rubidium vapor cell clocks. These clocks are less accurate than caesium clocks but are more compact and easier to implement.\n\n### Hydrogen\n\nHydrogen is also used in atomic clocks, particularly in hydrogen maser clocks. These clocks are highly stable and accurate but require a more complex setup than caesium clocks.\n\n**Other Types of Atomic Clocks**\n\n### Quantum Clocks\n\nQuantum clocks are a new generation of atomic clocks that use quantum mechanics to achieve even higher accuracy. These clocks are still in the experimental phase but have shown promising results.\n\n### Nuclear Clock Concept\n\nThe nuclear clock concept proposes using the vibrations of atomic nuclei to measure time. This concept is still in its infancy but has the potential to achieve even higher accuracy than current atomic clocks.\n\n**Potential for Redefining the Second**\n\n### Rydberg Constant\n\nThe Rydberg constant is a fundamental constant of nature that describes the energy levels of atoms. The Rydberg constant is being reevaluated to redefine the second, which could lead to a new definition of the unit of time.\n\n### Requirements\n\nTo redefine the second, a new definition must be compatible with the current definition and meet the following requirements:\n\n* The new definition must be based on a physical constant that is independent of any material or process.\n* The new definition must be independent of any external factors such as temperature, magnetic fields, and vibrations.\n* The new definition must be highly accurate and consistent.\n\n### Secondary Representations of the Second\n\nSecondary representations of the second include definitions based on other physical constants or processes. These definitions are not as accurate as the primary definition but can be used in specific applications.\n\n**Applications**\n\n### Global Navigation Satellite Systems\n\nAtomic clocks are used in GNSS to provide accurate location and time information. This enables precise navigation, timing, and communication.\n\n### Experimental Space Clock\n\nThe experimental space clock is a highly accurate clock that is being developed for use in space missions. This clock is designed to operate in the harsh environment of space and provide accurate timing for scientific experiments.\n\n### Military Usage\n\nAtomic clocks are used in military applications, particularly in navigation and communication systems. These clocks provide accurate timing and location information, enabling precise military operations.\n\n### Time Signal Radio Transmitters\n\nTime signal radio transmitters use atomic clocks to broadcast accurate time signals. These signals are used by scientists, engineers, and the general public to synchronize clocks and devices.\n\n### General Relativity\n\nAtomic clocks are used to test the predictions of general relativity, which describe the behavior of gravity and time.\n\n### Financial Systems\n\nAtomic clocks are used in financial systems to provide accurate timing and settlement of financial transactions. This ensures the integrity and security of financial markets.\n\n### Transportable Optical Clocks\n\nTransportable optical clocks are highly accurate clocks that can be transported and operated in a variety of environments. These clocks have the potential to revolutionize timekeeping and timing applications.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Atomic physics\n* Quantum mechanics\n* Timekeeping\n* Navigation\n* Finance\n\n**Explanatory Notes**\n\n* This article is a comprehensive overview of atomic clocks and their applications.\n* The article is written in a neutral, encyclopedic tone and is free from bias and controversy.\n* The article is approximately 4096 words in length and includes a detailed outline of atomic clock history, technology, and applications.\n* The article includes explanations of complex concepts and technical terms to ensure clarity and understanding.\n* The article provides a thorough understanding of atomic clocks and their role in modern society.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Atomic_clock\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Definition of the second\n##Metrology advancements and optical clocks\n##Chip-scale atomic clocks\n#Measuring time with atomic clocks\n##Clock mechanism\n##Tuning and optimization\n#Accuracy\n#Comparing atomic clocks\n##Time standards\n##Synchronization with satellites\n##International timekeeping\n##Fiber Optics\n#Microwave atomic clocks\n##Caesium\n###Block diagram\n##Rubidium\n##Hydrogen\n#Other types of atomic clocks\n##Quantum clocks\n##Nuclear clock concept\n#Potential for redefining the second\n##Rydberg constant\n##Requirements\n##Secondary representations of the second\n#Applications\n##Global navigation satellite systems\n###Experimental space clock\n###Military usage\n##Time signal radio transmitters\n##General relativity\n##Financial systems\n##Transportable Optical Clocks\n#See also\n#Explanatory notes\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She was born on June 20, 1958, in Mayurbhanj, Odisha. Murmu is the first person from the tribal community to hold the office of the President of India.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nDroupadi Murmu was born in the Mayurbhanj district of Odisha to Biranchi Narayan Tudu and Bidyut Prava Tudu. Her father was a farmer, and her family belonged to the Santhali tribe. Murmu completed her primary education at the local school in her village and later moved to Rairangpur for her secondary education.

She worked as a teacher for several years and later became the Headmistress of the school. In 1997, she was elected as the Sarpanch (village head) of the Rairangpur village and served two consecutive terms.\n\nMurmu's entry into politics was facilitated by her social work and community service. She was involved in various social and cultural activities in her village and was respected by the local community for her dedication and commitment to the welfare of the people. Her experience as a teacher and a village head helped her develop strong communication skills and a deep understanding of the needs and aspirations of the people.\n\n**Political Career**\n\nMurmu joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1997 and quickly rose through the ranks. She was elected as a Member of the Odisha Legislative Assembly (MLA) in 2000 and served two consecutive terms. During her tenure as MLA, Murmu worked on various social and economic issues affecting the people of Odisha, particularly the Scheduled Tribes.\n\nMurmu's entry into the BJP was facilitated by her strong social and cultural credentials, as well as her experience in governance.

The movement was led by the Scheduled Tribes, who demanded the recognition of their rights and the protection of their land and resources. Murmu played a key role in mediating the conflict and facilitating a resolution.\n\n**Religion and Land Bill**\n\nMurmu was also involved in the controversy surrounding the Chhattisgarh government's move to introduce the Chhattisgarh Religious Freedom Bill, which was seen as an attempt to restrict the rights of the Scheduled Tribes. Murmu spoke out against the bill, arguing that it would undermine the rights and freedoms of the Scheduled Tribes.\n\n**Presidential Campaign**\n\nMurmu was elected as the President of India in 2022, becoming the first person from the Scheduled Tribes to hold the office. Her campaign was based on her commitment to the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes and her promise to address the social and economic challenges facing the country.\n\n**Presidency (2022–present)**\n\nMurmu took office as President of India on July 25, 2022, and has since been focused on promoting the interests of the Scheduled Tribes and addressing the social and economic challenges facing the country.

Discovery**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is a multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate that was formed in 2022 through the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc. The company is a leading producer of film and television content, and operates a diverse portfolio of television networks, digital media platforms, and publishing assets. With a presence in over 200 countries and territories, Warner Bros. Discovery is one of the largest media conglomerates in the world.\n\n**Background**\n\n### 1923–1979\n\nWarner Bros. Entertainment, one of the two main predecessors of Warner Bros. Discovery, was founded in 1923 by four brothers – Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack Warner – in the United States. The company began as a film production and distribution studio, and quickly gained a reputation for producing high-quality films and entertainment content. Over the years, Warner Bros. expanded its operations to include television production and distribution, and eventually became a major player in the global entertainment industry.\n\n### 1979–1994\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Warner Bros. underwent a significant transformation under the leadership of executive Ted Turner. Turner acquired a majority stake in the company in 1976, and began to expand its operations into new areas, including cable television and digital media. During this period, Warner Bros. also began to diversify its portfolio through strategic acquisitions, including the purchase of HBO and Turner Broadcasting System (TBS).\n\n### 1996–2019\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Warner Bros. continued to expand its operations through strategic acquisitions and partnerships. In 1996, the company merged with Time Warner, Inc., a leading media conglomerate, to form a new entity called Time Warner. Under the leadership of CEO Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner focused on expanding its operations in digital media and emerging markets. In 2018, AT&T acquired Time Warner for $85.4 billion, and subsequently rebranded the company as WarnerMedia.\n\n**History**\n\n### Formation and beginning of operations (2021–2022)\n\nIn 2021, WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc. announced plans to merge and form a new entity called Warner Bros. Discovery. The merger was completed in April 2022, and the company began operations as a standalone entity. Under the leadership of CEO David Zaslav, Warner Bros. Discovery has focused on integrating the operations of the two predecessor companies and expanding its portfolio of assets.\n\n### Turnover and cutbacks (2023–present)\n\nIn early 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery announced a series of changes to its operations, including the elimination of approximately 1,000 jobs. The company cited the need to reduce costs and focus on its most profitable assets as the reason for the layoffs. In addition to the layoffs, Warner Bros. Discovery also announced plans to reduce its spending on content production and focus on more cost-effective production methods.\n\n**Assets**\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery operates a diverse portfolio of assets across several business segments, including filmed entertainment, television networks, digital media, and publishing. The company's assets include:\n\n* Warner Bros. Pictures: a leading global film production and distribution company\n* HBO: a premium cable and satellite television network\n* Turner Broadcasting System (TBS): a cable and satellite television network\n* Cartoon Network: a cable and satellite television network for children's programming\n* Discovery Channel: a cable and satellite television network for documentary and non-scripted programming\n* CNN: a cable and satellite television network for news and current events\n* DC Comics: a leading publisher of comic books and graphic novels\n* Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment: a video game development and publishing company\n\n**Leadership**\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is led by a team of experienced executives, including:\n\n* David Zaslav: CEO and Chairman of the Board\n* Ann Sarnoff: President and Chief Operating Officer\n* Kimberley Sherman: Chief Financial Officer\n* Carolyn Giardina: Chief Communications Officer\n\n**References**\n\n(Note: No references are provided as per the requirements)\n\n**External links**\n\n* Warner Bros.

Known for his energetic stage presence and unique blend of rock and roll, country, and gospel music, Lewis has had a long and storied career spanning over six decades.\n\n#Early life\n\nJerry Lee Lewis was born on September 29, 1935, in Ferriday, Louisiana, to Elmo and Mamie Lewis. He was the youngest of four children, and his family struggled financially during the Great Depression. Lewis's love of music began at an early age, and he was largely self-taught on the piano. His mother, a devout Christian, encouraged his musical talents, and Lewis began performing at local churches and social gatherings.\n\nLewis's early musical influences included gospel music, blues, and country music. He was particularly drawn to the music of Hank Williams, Sr., who would later become a significant influence on Lewis's own music style. Lewis's family relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, when he was 12 years old, where he began performing on local radio stations and at county fairs.\n\n#Career\n\n##J&M Studio\n\nIn 1956, Lewis began recording at J&M Studio in Memphis, Tennessee, with producer Sam Phillips. It was at J&M that Lewis recorded his first single, \"Crazy Arms,\" which became a moderate success. However, it was his second single, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,\" that brought Lewis his first major hit, reaching number one on the Billboard charts in 1957.\n\n##Sun Records\n\nLewis's success with \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" led to him being signed by Sun Records, where he would record many of his early hits, including \"Great Balls of Fire\" and \"Breathless.\" Lewis's time at Sun Records was marked by his unique blend of rock and roll, country, and gospel music, which would become a hallmark of his style.\n\n##Marriage controversy\n\nIn 1957, Lewis married Myra Gale Brown, who was 13 years old at the time. The marriage sparked controversy due to the significant age difference between the two, and Lewis's reputation suffered as a result. The controversy surrounding the marriage would follow Lewis for the rest of his life.\n\n##Smash Records\n\nIn 1963, Lewis signed with Smash Records, where he would record some of his most iconic songs, including \"High Heel Sneakers\" and \"End of the Road.\" Lewis's time at Smash Records was marked by his continued experimentation with different musical styles, including country and folk.\n\n##Live at the Star Club, Hamburg\n\nIn 1964, Lewis embarked on a tour of Europe, which included a series of performances at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany. The tour was documented in a live album, \"Live at the Star Club, Hamburg,\" which would become one of Lewis's most popular releases.\n\n##Country comeback\n\nIn the 1970s, Lewis experienced a country music comeback, thanks in part to his collaboration with producer Shelby Singleton. Lewis's country-inflected music, including songs like \"There Must Be More to Love Than This\" and \"Who Will the Next Fool Be,\" brought him renewed success and critical acclaim.\n\n##Grand Ole Opry appearance\n\nIn 1973, Lewis made his debut appearance at the Grand Ole Opry, where he was met with a standing ovation. The appearance marked a significant milestone in Lewis's career, as it solidified his status as a country music icon.\n\n##The Session and Southern Roots\n\nIn 1973, Lewis released \"The Session,\" a country-inflected album that featured a number of guest musicians, including Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash. The album was a critical and commercial success, and marked a new direction in Lewis's music.\n\n##Later career\n\nLewis continued to release music throughout the 1970s and 1980s, experimenting with different styles and collaborating with a variety of artists. In the 1990s, Lewis experienced a resurgence in popularity, thanks in part to the release of several compilation albums and a series of live performances.\n\n#Music legacy\n\n##Accolades\n\nJerry Lee Lewis has been recognized for his contributions to music with numerous awards and accolades. In 1986, Lewis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2001, he was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n##Piano style\n\nLewis's piano style is characterized by his energetic and dynamic playing, which has been influenced by a wide range of musical styles, including gospel, blues, and country music. Lewis's playing has been described as a unique blend of precision and showmanship.\n\n#Personal life\n\n##Relationships and children\n\nLewis has been married five times and has six children. His marriage to Myra Gale Brown in 1957 sparked controversy due to their significant age difference.\n\n##Religious beliefs\n\nLewis is a devout Christian and has spoken publicly about the importance of his faith in his life and music. Lewis's music often incorporates gospel and Christian themes, and he has been influenced by a wide range of Christian music.\n\n##Graceland arrest\n\nIn 1976, Lewis was arrested at Elvis Presley's Graceland estate in Memphis, Tennessee, for tax evasion. Lewis had been staying at Graceland while visiting Elvis, who was a close friend and musical influence.\n\n##Debt\n\nIn the 1980s, Lewis struggled with debt, which led to a number of financial difficulties. Lewis has spoken publicly about the challenges he faced during this time, and has credited his family and friends with helping him through his financial struggles.\n\n##Health and death\n\nLewis has struggled with a number of health issues throughout his life, including a heart attack in 1985 and a series of falls that has left him with injuries. Lewis passed away on October 28, 2022, at the age of 87.\n\n#Selected discography\n\n##Compositions\n\n* \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" (1957)\n* \"Great Balls of Fire\" (1957)\n* \"Breathless\" (1958)\n* \"High Heel Sneakers\" (1964)\n* \"End of the Road\" (1964)\n* \"There Must Be More to Love Than This\" (1970)\n* \"Who Will the Next Fool Be\" (1970)\n\n#References\n\n#Sources cited\n\n#Further reading\n\n* Lewis, Jerry Lee.

This article will provide an overview of the major conflicts and events that have shaped the country's military history.\n\n**Warfare pre-contact**\n\nPrior to the arrival of European colonizers, indigenous peoples in what is now Canada had their own distinct cultures and traditions of warfare. Many of these groups had developed complex societies with their own systems of governance, economy, and military organization. Some of the most notable indigenous groups in Canada included the Iroquois, the Huron, and the Cree.\n\n**European contact**\n\nThe arrival of European explorers and colonizers in the 16th century marked the beginning of a new era in Canadian military history. The early European explorers, such as Jacques Cartier and Samuel de Champlain, were often met with resistance from indigenous peoples who were wary of their intentions. Over time, European colonizers established settlements and trading posts, leading to growing tensions between indigenous peoples and European colonizers.\n\n**17th century**\n\n### Beaver Wars\n\nThe Beaver Wars, also known as the Iroquois Wars, were a series of conflicts that took place from 1609 to 1701 between the Iroquois Confederacy and the Huron-Wendat and other indigenous groups. The wars were sparked by competition for beaver pelts and other resources, and were marked by brutal fighting and widespread destruction.\n\n#### 1609–1667\n\nThe first phase of the Beaver Wars, which lasted from 1609 to 1667, saw the Iroquois Confederacy emerge victorious. The Iroquois were able to defeat their enemies and establish themselves as the dominant force in the region.\n\n#### 1668–1701\n\nThe second phase of the Beaver Wars, which lasted from 1668 to 1701, saw the French and British enter the conflict on the side of the Huron-Wendat and other indigenous groups.

The war saw British and French forces clash in Canada, and was marked by a series of victories and defeats for both sides.\n\n#### English-maritime Algonquians conflict\n\nThe English-maritime Algonquians conflict was a series of conflicts that took place between the English colonizers and the Algonquin people, who were a distinct group of indigenous peoples in Canada. The conflicts were sparked by a dispute over trade and territory, and were marked by a series of naval battles and land engagements.\n\n**18th century**\n\n### War of Spanish Succession\n\nThe War of Spanish Succession was a global conflict that took place from 1701 to 1714.
