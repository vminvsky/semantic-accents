clubs, including Sampdoria, Juventus, and Chelsea, as well as the Italy national team. He is best known for his successful playing career, particularly during his time at Sampdoria, where he won numerous domestic and international honors, including the European Cup Winners' Cup. Vialli went on to become a highly respected manager, leading Chelsea to several titles, including the European Cup Winners' Cup and the Premier League. He is also remembered for his philanthropic work, particularly in the area of cancer research.\n\n# Club Career\n\n## Cremonese\n\nVialli's senior career started in 1980 when he signed for local club Cremonese in Serie C1, winning promotion to Serie B. After scoring ten goals for the club as a winger in the 1983–84 Serie B season, he was transferred to Sampdoria.\n\n## Sampdoria\n\nVialli played for Sampdoria between 1984 and 1992, during which time the club had their most successful period in their history. At Sampdoria, he formed a prolific strike partnership with teammate and friend Roberto Mancini, earning the nickname 'The Goal Twins' (in Italian I Gemelli del Gol). Vialli also had a very good relationship with club president Paolo Mantovani and coach Vujadin Boškov, who were both described by Vialli as being father figures. Sampdoria won their first ever Italian Cup in 1985 with Vialli scoring in the final, and would win it again in 1988 and 1989, when Vialli would score a record 13 goals in the tournament. This led to two notable European Cup Winners' Cup runs, where Sampdoria lost the 1989 final before winning the trophy in 1990, with Vialli scoring both goals in the final victory over Anderlecht, and finishing the tournament as top-scorer.\n\n## Juventus\n\nVialli moved to Juventus shortly after the 1992 European Cup final loss for a world record fee of £12.5 million. His first Juventus contract was negotiated for him by Sampdoria president Mantovani, as Vialli did not have an agent. Although he struggled with injury, Vialli won the UEFA Cup in his first season with Juventus playing alongside players such as Roberto Baggio, Pierluigi Casiraghi, Paolo Di Canio and Andreas Möller, among other players, under manager Giovanni Trapattoni. During the 1993 UEFA Cup Final against Borussia Dortmund, Vialli set-up Baggio's decisive first goal in the first leg.\n\n## Chelsea\n\nGullit was sacked as Chelsea manager in February 1998, and 33-year-old Vialli was appointed player-manager, becoming the first Italian to manage in the Premier League. Chelsea were already in the semi-finals of the League Cup and the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup, and went on to win both competitions under Vialli, as well as finishing fourth in the Premier League. In beating VfB Stuttgart at the Cup Winners' Cup final on 13 May 1998, at 33 years and 308 days old, Vialli became the youngest manager ever to win a UEFA competition.

{"title": "Kurt_Cobain", "content": "\nEarly life\nKurt Donald Cobain was born at Grays Harbor Hospital in Aberdeen, Washington, on February 20, 1967, [9] the son of waitress Wendy Elizabeth (née Fradenburg; 1947-2021) and car mechanic Donald Leland Cobain (born 1946) [10] His parents married in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, on July 31, 1965 Cobain had Dutch, English, French, German, Irish, and Scottish ancestry [11]: 13  [12] [13]: 7  The Cobain surname comes from his Irish ancestors, who emigrated in 1875 from Carrickmore, a village near Omagh in County Tyrone in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland [13]: 7  Researchers found that they were shoemakers, originally surnamed Cobane, and were Ulster Scots people who came from the Inishatieve area of Carrickmore They first settled in Canada, where they lived in Cornwall, Ontario, before moving to Washington [14] Cobain mistakenly believed that his Irish ancestors came from County Cork [15] His younger sister, Kimberly, was born on April 24, 1970 [10] [12]\n\n\nCareer\nOn his 14th birthday, February 20, 1981, Cobain's uncle offered him the choice of either a bike or a used guitar; Kurt chose the guitar Soon, he was trying to play Led Zeppelin's song \"Stairway to Heaven\" He also learned how to play \"Louie Louie\", Queen's \"Another One Bites the Dust\", and the Cars' \"My Best Friend's Girl\", before he began working on his own songs Cobain played left-handed, despite being forced to write right-handed [11]: 22 \n\n\nEarly musical projects\nOn his 14th birthday, February 20, 1981, Cobain's uncle offered him the choice of either a bike or a used guitar; Kurt chose the guitar Soon, he was trying to play Led Zeppelin's song \"Stairway to Heaven\" He also learned how to play \"Louie Louie\", Queen's \"Another One Bites the Dust\", and the Cars' \"My Best Friend's Girl\", before he began working on his own songs Cobain played left-handed, despite being forced to write right-handed [11]: 22 \n\n\nNirvana\nFor a complete list of all Nirvana releases, see Nirvana discography.\n\n\nOther collaborations\nIn 1989, members of Nirvana and fellow American alternative rock band Screaming Trees formed a side project known as the Jury The band featured Cobain on vocals and guitar, Mark Lanegan on vocals, Krist Novoselic on bass, and Mark Pickerel on drums Over two days of recording sessions, on August 20 and 28, 1989, the band recorded four songs also performed by Lead Belly; \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\", an instrumental version of \"Grey Goose\", \"Ain't It a Shame\", and \"They Hung Him on a Cross\", the latter of which featured Cobain performing solo [35] Cobain was inspired to record the songs after receiving a copy of Lead Belly's Last Sessions from friend Slim Moon; after hearing it, he \"felt a connection to Leadbelly's almost physical expressions of longing and desire.\" [36]\n\n\nMusical influences\nThe Beatles were an early and lasting influence on Cobain; his aunt Mari remembers him singing \"Hey Jude\" at the age of two [13]: 9  \"My aunts would give me Beatles records\", Cobain told Jon Savage in 1993, \"so for the most part  [I listened to] the Beatles  [as a child], and if I was lucky, I'd be able to buy a single.\" [41] Cobain expressed a particular fondness for John Lennon, whom he called his \"idol\" in his posthumously released journals, [42] and he said that he wrote the song \"About a Girl\", from Nirvana's 1989 debut album Bleach, after spending three hours listening to Meet the Beatles! [13]: 121 \n\n\nArtistry\nAccording to Grohl, Cobain believed that music comes first and lyrics second; he focused primarily on the melodies [55] He complained when fans and rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing and extract meaning from his lyrics, writing: \"Why in the hell do journalists insist on coming up with a second-rate Freudian evaluation of my lyrics, when 90 percent of the time they've transcribed them incorrectly?\" [13]: 182  Though Cobain insisted on the subjectivity and unimportance of his lyrics, he labored and procrastinated in writing them, often changing the content and order of lyrics during performances [13]: 177  Cobain would describe his own lyrics as \"a big pile of contradictions They're split down the middle between very sincere opinions that I have and sarcastic opinions and feelings that I have and sarcastic and hopeful, humorous rebuttals toward cliché bohemian ideals that have been exhausted for years.\" [56]\n\n\nEquipment\nIn a Guitar World retrospective, Cobain's guitar tone was deemed \"one of the most iconic\" in the history of the electric guitar, while noting that rather than relying on expensive or vintage items, Cobain used \"an eccentric cache of budget models, low-end imports and pawn shop prizes.\" Cobain stated in a 1992 interview, \"Junk is always best,\" but denied this was a punk statement and claimed it was a necessity, as he had trouble finding high quality lefthanded guitars [62]\n\n\nPersonal life\nThere are differing accounts of exactly when and how Kurt Cobain first met Courtney Love In his 1993 authorized biography of Nirvana, Michael Azerrad cites a January 21, 1989, Dharma Bums gig in Portland where Nirvana played as support, [66] while the Charles R Cross 2001 Cobain biography has Love

[13]: 121 \n\n\nArtistry\nAccording to Grohl, Cobain believed that music comes first and lyrics second; he focused primarily on the melodies [55] He complained when fans and rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing and extract meaning from his lyrics, writing: \"Why in the hell do journalists insist on coming up with a second-rate Freudian evaluation of my lyrics, when 90 percent of the time they've transcribed them incorrectly?\" [13]: 182  Though Cobain insisted on the subjectivity and unimportance of his lyrics, he labored and procrastinated in writing them, often changing the content and order of lyrics during performances [13]: 177  Cobain would describe his own lyrics as \"a big pile of contradictions They're split down the middle between very sincere opinions that I have and sarcastic opinions and feelings that I have and sarcastic and hopeful, humorous rebuttals toward cliché bohemian ideals that have been exhausted for years.\" [56]\n\n\nEquipment\nIn a Guitar World retrospective, Cobain's guitar tone was deemed \"one of the most iconic\" in the history of the electric guitar, while noting that rather than relying on expensive or vintage items, Cobain used \"an eccentric cache of budget models, low-end imports and pawn shop prizes.\" Cobain stated in a 1992 interview, \"Junk is always best,\" but denied this was a punk statement and claimed it was a necessity, as he had trouble finding high quality lefthanded guitars [62]\n\n\nPersonal life\nThere are differing accounts of exactly when and how Kurt Cobain first met Courtney Love In his 1993

for their \"artistic play, combining team-work and quick, short passing\" Long after his retirement, Peter McWilliam, the team's defender at the time, said, \"The Newcastle team of the 1900s would give any modern side a two goal start and beat them, and furthermore, beat them at a trot\" Newcastle United went on to win the League on three occasions during the 1900s; 1904–05, 1906–07 and 1908–09

the First Division at the end of the 1947–48 season [10] During the 1950s, Newcastle won the FA Cup three times in five years, beating Blackpool in 1951, Arsenal in 1952 and Manchester City in 1955 However, after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the 1960–61 season under the management of Charlie Mitten Mitten left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player Joe Harvey Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the 1964–65 season after winning the Second Division title [10] Under Harvey, the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the 1967–68 season and the following year won the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, triumphing 6–2 over two legs against Hungary's Újpest in the final [10]\n\n\n1969–1992: bouncing between divisions\nHarvey bought striker Malcolm Macdonald in the summer of 1971, for a club

said \"I loved Newcastle, until Gordon Lee took over\" Lee left for Everton in 1977, and was replaced by Richard Dinnis [10]\n\n\n1993–2007: into the Premier League\nAt the end of their first year, 1993–94 season, back in the top flight they finished in third, their highest league finish since 1927 [10] The attacking philosophy of Keegan led to the team being labelled \"The Entertainers\" by Sky Sports [16]\n\n\n2007–2021: Mike Ashley era\nOn 7 June, Freddy Shepherd's final shares in the club were sold to Mike Ashley and Shepherd was replaced as chairman by Chris Mort on 25 July [38] [39]

and red socks In 1894, the club adopted the black and white striped shirts, which had been used as the reserve team's colours These colours were chosen for the senior team because they were not associated with either of the two teams United were merged from They played in grey shorts until 1897, and between 1897 and 1921, they played in blue shorts before adopting the black shorts they play in now [9] [89]\n\n\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors\nIn May 2013, Newcastle announced a sponsorship which featured the Wonga.com logo on kits This attracted criticism from many Newcastle supporters

[120]\n\n\nSaudi-led takeover\nIn April 2020, it was widely reported that a consortium consisting of Public Investment Fund, PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports & Media, was finalising an offer to

serious financial trouble and approached East End with a view to a takeover Newcastle West End was eventually dissolved, and a number of its players and backroom staff joined Newcastle East End, effectively merging the two clubs, with Newcastle East End taking over the lease on St James' Park in May 1892 [9]\n\n\n1881–1903: formation and early history\nThe first record of football being played on Tyneside dates from 3 March 1877 at Elswick Rugby Club Later that year, Newcastle's first football club, Tyne Association, was formed The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of Byker in November 1881 This team was renamed Newcastle East End F.C in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the

eventually dissolved, and a number of its players and backroom staff joined Newcastle East End, effectively merging the two clubs, with Newcastle East End taking over the lease on St James' Park in May 1892 [9]\n\n\n1903–1937: first glory years and war years\nIn 1903–04, the club built up a promising squad of players, and went on to dominate English football for almost a decade, the team known for their \"artistic play, combining team-work and quick, short passing\" Long after his retirement, Peter McWilliam, the team's defender at the time, said, \"The Newcastle team of the 1900s would give any modern side a two goal start and beat them, and furthermore, beat them at a trot\" Newcastle United went on to win the League on three occasions during the 1900s; 1904–05, 1906–07 and 1908–09 [10] [12] In 1904–05, they nearly did the double, losing to Aston Villa in the 1905 FA Cup Final They were beaten again the following year by Everton in the 1906 FA Cup Final They reached the final again in 1908 where they lost to Wolverhampton Wanderers They finally won the FA Cup in 1910 when they beat Barnsley in the final They lost again the following year in the final against Bradford City [10]\n\n\n1937–1969: post-war success\nThe club found it difficult to adjust to the Second Division and were nearly further relegated in the 1937–38 season, when they were spared on goal average However, when World War II broke out in 1939, Newcastle had a chance to regroup, and in the War period, they brought in Jackie Milburn, Tommy Walker and Bobby Cowell They were finally promoted back to the First Division at the end of the 1947–48 season [10] During the 1950s, Newcastle won the FA Cup three times in five years, beating Blackpool in 1951, Arsenal in 1952 and Manchester City in 1955 However, after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the 1960–61 season under the management of Charlie Mitten Mitten left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player Joe Harvey Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the 1964–65 season after winning the Second Division title [10] Under Harvey, the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the 1967–68 season and the following year won the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, triumphing 6–2 over two legs against Hungary's Újpest in the final [10]\n\n\n1969–1992: bouncing between divisions\nHarvey bought striker Malcolm Macdonald in the summer of 1971, for a club record transfer fee of £180,000 (equivalent to £2,265,000 in 2021) [10] [13] He was an impressive goal scorer, who led United's attack to Wembley in their 1974 FA Cup Final defeat at the hands of Liverpool [10] The club also had back to back triumphs in the Texaco Cup in 1974 and 1975 [14] Harvey left the club in 1975, with Gordon Lee brought in to replace him Lee took the team to the 1976 Football League Cup Final against Manchester City, but failed to bring the trophy back to Tyneside However, he sold Macdonald to Arsenal at the end of the season, a decision of which Macdonald later said \"I loved Newcastle, until Gordon Lee took over\" Lee left for Everton in 1977, and was replaced by Richard Dinnis [10]\n\n\n1993–2007: into the Premier League\nAt the end of their first year, 1993–94 season, back in the top flight they finished in third, their highest league finish since 1927 [10] The attacking philosophy of Keegan led to the team being labelled \"The Entertainers\" by Sky Sports [16]\n\n\n2007–2021: Mike Ashley era\nOn 7 June, Freddy Shepherd's final shares in the club were sold to Mike Ashley and Shepherd was replaced as chairman by Chris Mort on 25 July [38] [39] Ashley then announced he would be delisting the club from the London Stock Exchange upon completion of the takeover [40] The club officially ceased trading on the Stock Exchange as of 8 am on 18 July 2007 at 5p a share [41]\n\n\n2021–present: PIF era\nOn 7 October 2021, after 14 years as owner, Ashley sold the club to a new consortium for a reported £305 million [77] The consortium was made up of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, RB Sports & Media and PCP Capital Partners [78] On 20 October, Bruce left his position by mutual consent, after receiving a reported £8 million payout [79] [80] Eddie Howe was appointed as Bruce's replacement on 8 November [81] Howe guided the club to an 11th-place finish after a run of 12 wins in their final 18 games, and Newcastle became the first team in Premier League history to avoid relegation after failing to win any of their first 14 games [82]\n\n\nClub identity\nThe club's home colours are a black and white striped shirt Shorts and socks are usually black with white trim, though white socks are sometimes worn Newcastle's colours at the outset were generally the home kit of Newcastle East End, comprising plain red shirts with white shorts and red socks In 1894, the club adopted the black and white striped shirts, which had been used as the reserve team's colours These colours were chosen for the senior team because they were not associated with either of the two teams United were merged from They played in grey shorts until 1897, and between 1897 and 1921, they played in blue shorts before adopting the black shorts they play in now [9] [89]\n\n\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors\nIn May 2013, Newcastle announced a sponsorship which featured the Wonga.com logo on kits This attracted criticism from many Newcastle supporters In July 2013, it was reported that Newcastle striker and practising Muslim Papiss Cissé refused to wear any official kit or training wear with reference to Wonga.com as it did not align with his religious beliefs The matter was later resolved [95]\n\n\nStadium\nThroughout Newcastle United's history, their home venue has been St James' Park, the oldest and largest football stadium in North East England, as well as the seventh-largest football stadium in the Premier League It has hosted 11 international football matches at senior level, the first in 1901 and the most recent in 2024 [105] [106] It was used as a venue for both the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2015 Rugby World Cup [107] [108] and has been a regular venue for Rugby League's Magic Weekend, attracting record crowds [citation needed]\n\n\nOwnership\nNewcastle United was set up as a private company limited by shares on 6 September 1895 [10] The club traded in this way for much of the 20th century, dominated by McKeag, Westwood and Seymour family ownership, [118] until April 1997, when John Hall, who bought 72.9% of the club for £3 million in 1991, floated the club on the stock exchange as a public limited company, with less than half the shares sold to the Hall family and the majority holding going to his business partner Freddy Shepherd Later that year, Hall stepped down as chairman and was replaced by Shepherd, with the Hall family represented on the board by John's son Douglas [119] In December 1998, after buying a 6.3% stake in the club for £10 million, the media group NTL had considered a full takeover of the club This was later dropped after the Competition Commission, established in April 1999, expressed concerns about football clubs being owned by media companies [120]\n\n\nSaudi-led takeover\nIn April 2020, it was widely reported that a consortium consisting of Public Investment Fund, PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports & Media, was finalising an offer to acquire Newcastle United The proposed sale prompted concerns and criticism, such as arguments considering it sportwashing of Saudi Arabia's human rights record, as well as ongoing piracy of sports broadcasts in the region [131]\n\n\nSocial responsibility\nNewcastle United Foundation is an independent charity established by the club in summer 2008 It seeks to encourage learning and promote healthy living amongst disadvantaged children, young people and families in the North East region, as well as promoting equality and diversity [150] [151] The charity moved into its state-of-the art ‘NUCASTLE’ building in the Arthur's Hill area of the city in 2021 Open seven days a week, NUCASTLE combines community space with education and wellness facilities, including activity and state-of-the-art cycling studios, specialist STEM room, esports room, four-court sports hall, accessible changing areas, event and meeting spaces, offices and more [citation needed]\n\n\nSupporters and rivalries\nNewcastle United's supporters are known for being some of the most passionate football fans in the world In 2016, supporters founded the Wor Flags group, which continues to produce large and unique flag, banner and tifo displays at St James' Park The group is entirely fan-funded [155]\n\n\nRecords and statistics\nAs of the 2024–25 season, Newcastle United have spent 93 seasons in the top-flight They are eighth in the all-time Premier League table and have the ninth-highest total of major honours won by an English club with 11 wins [166] The holder of the record for the most appearances is Jimmy Lawrence, having made 496 first team appearances between 1904 and 1921 [167] The club's top goalscorer is Alan Shearer, who scored 206 goals in all competitions between 1996 and 2006 [168] Andy Cole holds the record for the most goals scored in a season: 41 in the 1993–94 season in the Premier League [167] Shay Given is the most capped international for the club, with 134 appearances for the Republic of Ireland [167]\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA

variant, [13] despite the existence of other, less common, variants first identified in UK, such as Eta variant (lineage B.1.525) Within the UK, it is commonly referred to as the Kent variant after Kent, where the variant was found [14] [15] [16]\n\n\nNames\nThe variant is known by several names Outside the UK it is sometimes referred to as the UK variant or British variant or English variant, [13] despite the existence of other, less common, variants first identified in UK, such as Eta variant (lineage B.1.525) Within the UK, it is commonly referred to as the Kent variant after Kent, where the variant was found [14] [15] [16]\n\n\nGenetic profile\nMutations in SARS-CoV-2 are common: over 4,000 mutations have been detected in its spike protein alone, according to the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium [22]\n\n\nSymptoms and signs\nImperial College London investigated over a million people in England while the Alpha variant was dominant and discovered a wide range of further symptoms linked to Covid  \"Chills, loss of appetite, headache and muscle aches\" were most common in infected people, as well as classic symptoms [24]\n\n\nDiagnosis\nSeveral rapid antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 are in widespread use globally for COVID-19 diagnostics They are believed to be useful in stopping the chain of transmission of the virus by providing the means to rapidly identify large numbers of cases as part of a mass-testing program Following the emergence of VOC-202012/01, there was initially concern that rapid tests might not detect it, but Public Health England determined that rapid tests evaluated and used in the United Kingdom detected the variant [25]\n\n\nPrevention\nBy late 2020, several COVID-19 vaccines were being deployed or under development.\n\n\nE484K mutation\nOn  2 February 2021, Public Health England reported that they had detected \" [a] limited number of B.1.1.7 VOC-202012/01 genomes with E484K mutations\", [9] which is also present in the Beta and Gamma variants; [14] a mutation which may reduce vaccine effectiveness [14] On 9 February 2021, it became known that some 76 cases with the E484K mutation had been detected, principally in Bristol, but with a genomically distinct group in Liverpool also carrying the mutation [31] A week later a Research and analysis report from PHE gave a total of 77 confirmed and probable cases involving the E484K mutation across the UK, in two variants, VUI-202102/01 and VOC-202102/02, the latter described as 'B.1.1.7 with E484K' [10]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nThe transmissibility of the Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7) had generally been found to be substantially higher than that of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 variants The variant was discovered by a team of scientists at COG-UK whose initial results found transmissibility was 70% (50-100%) higher [16] [34] A study by the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine reported that the variant was 43 to 90% (range of 95% credible intervals, 38 to 130%) more transmissible than pre-existing variants in the United Kingdom, depending on the method used to assess increases in transmissibility Similar increases in the transmissibility of lineage B.1.1.7 were measured in Denmark, Switzerland, and the United States [35] Furthermore, a simple model to account for the rapid rise of lineage B.1.1.7 in several countries and the world found that the variant is 50% more transmissible than the local wild type in these three countries and across the world as whole [36]  Another study concluded that it was 75% (70%–80%) more transmissible in the UK between October and November 2020 [37] A later study suggested that these earlier estimates overestimated the transmissibility of the variant and that the transmissibility increase was on the lower ends of these ranges [38] [39]\n\n\nTransmissibility\nThe transmissibility of the Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7) had generally been found to be substantially higher than that of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 variants The variant was discovered by a team of scientists at COG-UK whose initial results found transmissibility was 70% (50-100%) higher [16] [34] A study by the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine reported that the variant was 43 to 90% (range of 95% credible intervals, 38 to 130%) more transmissible than pre-existing variants in the United Kingdom, depending on the method used to assess increases in transmissibility Similar increases in the transmissibility of lineage B.1.1.7 were measured in Denmark, Switzerland, and the United States [35] Furthermore, a simple model to account for the rapid rise of lineage B.1.1.7 in several countries and the world found that the variant is 50% more transmissible than the local wild type in these three countries and across the world as whole [36]  Another study concluded that it was 75% (70%–80%) more transmissible in the UK between October and November 2020 [37] A later study suggested that these earlier estimates overestimated the transmissibility of the variant and that the transmissibility increase was on the lower ends of these ranges [38] [39]\n\n\nVirulence\nMatched cohort studies of the Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7) found higher mortality rate than earlier circulating variants overall, [60] [61] but not in hospitalised patients [62] An ecological study found no difference in mortality overall [63]\n\n\nEpidemiology\nCases of the Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7) were estimated to be under-reported by most countries as the most commonly used tests do not distinguish between this variant and other SARS-CoV-2 variants, and as many SARS-CoV-2 infections are not detected at all RNA sequencing is required for detection of this variant, [82] although RT-PCR test for specific variants [d] can be used as a proxy test for Alpha  — or as a supplementing first-screening test before conducting the whole-genome sequencing [83] [75]\n\n\nSpread in UK\nThe first case was likely in mid-September 2020 in London or Kent, United Kingdom [90] The variant was sequenced in September [91] As of 13 December 2020, 1,108 cases with this variant had been identified in the UK in nearly 60 different local authorities These cases were predominantly in the south east of England The variant has also been identified in Wales and Scotland [92] By November, around a quarter of cases in the COVID-19 pandemic in London were being caused by the new variant, and by December, that was a third [93] In mid-December, it was estimated that almost 60 percent of cases in London involved Alpha [94] By 25 January 2021, the number of confirmed and probable UK cases had grown to 28,122 [95]\n\n\nSpread in Europe\nThe variant became dominant for:\n\n\nSpread in North America\nIn the United States, the variant first appeared late November 2020, [150] grew from 1.2% in late January and became predominant around the end of March [151] [152]The spread of the variant was primarily concentrated in the upper Midwest of the country, especially the states of Michigan and Minnesota, but it failed to spread in high concentrations to other parts of the country [153]\n\n\nDevelopment\nSeq [96]SGTF rawdata [f]SGTF model [f]\n\n\nCountries reporting a first case\nCases of the variant began to be reported globally during December, being reported in Denmark, [64] [177] Belgium, [178] the Netherlands, Australia [64] [177] and Italy [179] Shortly after, several other countries confirmed their first cases, the first of whom were found in Iceland and Gibraltar, [180] [181] then Singapore, Israel and Northern Ireland on 23 December, [182] [183] [184] Germany and Switzerland on 24 December, [185] [186] and the Republic of Ireland and Japan confirmed on 25 December [187] [188]\n\n\nDecember 2020\nCases of the variant began to be reported globally during December, being reported in Denmark, [64] [177] Belgium, [178] the Netherlands, Australia [64] [177] and Italy [179] Shortly after, several other countries confirmed their first cases, the first of whom were found in Iceland and Gibraltar, [180] [181] then Singapore, Israel and Northern Ireland on 23 December, [182] [183] [184] Germany and Switzerland on 24 December, [185] [186] and the Republic of Ireland and Japan confirmed on 25 December [187] [188]\n\n\nJanuary 2021\nTurkey detected its first cases in 15 people from England on 1 January 2021 [209] It was reported on 1 January that Denmark had found a total of 86 cases of the variant, equalling an overall frequency of less than 1% of the sequenced cases in the period from its first detection in the country in mid-November to the end of December; [210] [211] this had increased to 1.6% of sequenced tests in the period from mid-November to week two of 2021, with 7% of sequenced tests in this week alone being of Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7) [212] Luxembourg and Vietnam reported their first case of this variant on 2 January 2021 [213] [214]\n\n\nFebruary 2021\nOn 1 February, Lithuania confirmed the first cases of the new lineage [citation needed] On 4 February, health authorities in Uruguay announced the first case of the variant in the country The case was detected in a person who entered the country on 20 December 2020 and has been in quarantine ever since [245] On 10 February, the Health Ministry of Croatia confirmed that out of 61 sequenced samples since 20 January, the variant was detected in 3 samples: a male 50 year old and 3.5 year old from Zagreb, and a male 34-year-old from Brod-Posavina County [246] On 12 February, the variant was detected from four areas in Sri Lanka, [247] and the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador confirmed an outbreak of the variant [248]\n\n\nMarch 2021\nOn 2 March, Indonesia reports its first cases of the variant in two migrant workers returning from Saudi Arabia [249] On the same day, Tunisia [250] reported their first cases of the variant The presence of the variant in Ivory Coast was confirmed on 25 March [251]\n\n\nN501Y mutation elsewhere\nThe N501Y mutation arose independently multiple times in different locations:\n\n\nStatistics\nThe Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7) was first detected in early December 2020 by analysing genome data with knowledge that the rates of infection in Kent were not falling despite national restrictions [5]

"lang": "en", "article": "**SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant**\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant, also known as the UK variant or British variant, is a variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that was first identified in the United Kingdom in September 2020. It has since been detected in numerous countries around the world and has been designated as a Variant of Concern (VOC) by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n**Genetic profile**\n\nMutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus are common, with over 4,000 mutations detected in its spike protein alone. The Alpha variant has a unique genetic profile, with several mutations that distinguish it from other variants of the virus. These mutations include the N501Y mutation, which is a change in the amino acid sequence of the virus's spike protein that is thought to affect its ability to bind to human cells.\n\n**Symptoms and signs**\n\nThe symptoms and signs of the Alpha variant are similar to those of other variants of the virus. In a study of over a million people in England, researchers found that the most common symptoms included chills, loss of appetite, headache, and muscle aches. Other symptoms, such as fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath, were also reported.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nSeveral rapid antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 are in widespread use globally for COVID-19 diagnostics. These tests are believed to be useful in stopping the chain of transmission of the virus by providing the means to rapidly identify large numbers of cases as part of a mass-testing program. Following the emergence of the Alpha variant, there was initial concern that rapid tests might not detect it. However, Public Health England determined that rapid tests evaluated and used in the United Kingdom detected the variant.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nBy late 2020, several COVID-19 vaccines were being deployed or under development. Vaccination is an important tool in preventing the spread of the virus, including the Alpha variant. In addition to vaccination, other measures such as physical distancing, mask-wearing, and hand hygiene can help to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n**E484K mutation**\n\nOn February 2, 2021, Public Health England reported that they had detected a limited number of B.1.1.7 VOC-202012/01 genomes with E484K mutations. This mutation is also present in the Beta and Gamma variants, and may reduce vaccine effectiveness. By February 9, 2021, 76 cases with the E484K mutation had been detected, primarily in Bristol, but with a genomically distinct group in Liverpool also carrying the mutation.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nThe transmissibility of the Alpha variant has generally been found to be substantially higher than that of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 variants. A study by the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine reported that the variant was 43 to 90% more transmissible than pre-existing variants in the United Kingdom, depending on the method used to assess increases in transmissibility. Similar increases in the transmissibility of the Alpha variant were measured in Denmark, Switzerland, and the United States.\n\n**Virulence**\n\nMatched cohort studies of the Alpha variant found higher mortality rates than earlier circulating variants overall, but not in hospitalized patients. An ecological study found no difference in mortality overall.\n\n**Epidemiology**\n\nCases of the Alpha variant were estimated to be under-reported by most countries, as the most commonly used tests do not distinguish between this variant and other SARS-CoV-2 variants. RNA sequencing is required for detection of this variant, although RT-PCR tests for specific variants can be used as a proxy test for Alpha or as a supplementing first-screening test before conducting whole-genome sequencing.\n\n**Spread in the UK**\n\nThe first case of the Alpha variant was likely in mid-September 2020 in London or Kent, United Kingdom. The variant was sequenced in September. As of December 13, 2020, 1,108 cases with this variant had been identified in the UK in nearly 60 different local authorities. These cases were predominantly in the south east of England. By November, around a quarter of cases in the COVID-19 pandemic in London were being caused by the new variant, and by December, that was a third. In mid-December, it was estimated that almost 60 percent of cases in London involved Alpha.\n\n**Spread in Europe**\n\nThe Alpha variant became dominant in several countries in Europe, including the UK, the Netherlands, and Belgium.\n\n**Spread in North America**\n\nIn the United States, the Alpha variant first appeared in late November 2020, grew from 1.2% in late January and became predominant around the end of March. The spread of the variant was primarily concentrated in the upper Midwest of the country, especially the states of Michigan and Minnesota, but it failed to spread in high concentrations to other parts of the country.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe Alpha variant was first detected in early December 2020 by analyzing genome data with knowledge that the rates of infection in Kent were not falling despite national restrictions. The variant was named Alpha, and it quickly spread to other parts of the UK and eventually around the world.\n\n**Control**\n\nIn the presence of a more transmissible variant, stronger physical distancing and lockdown measures were opted for to avoid overwhelming the population due to its tendency to grow exponentially.\n\n**Extinction**\n\nIn October 2021, Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health and Security Agency stated that previous circulating variants such as Alpha had 'disappeared' and replaced by the Delta variant. In March 2022, the World Health Organization listed the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants as previously circulating, citing lack of any detected cases in the prior weeks and months.\n\n**See also**\n\nSARS-CoV-2 variants, if considered to have concerning epidemiological, immunological, or pathogenic properties, are raised for formal investigation.

also present in the Beta and Gamma variants; [14] a mutation which may reduce vaccine effectiveness [14] On 9 February 2021, it became known that some 76 cases with the E484K mutation had been detected, principally in Bristol, but with a genomically distinct group in Liverpool also carrying the mutation [31] A week later a Research and analysis report from PHE gave a total of 77 confirmed

the world as whole [36]  Another study concluded that it was 75% (70%–80%) more transmissible in the UK between October and November 2020 [37] A later study suggested that these earlier estimates

base, hermaphrodite flowers that are relatively large and showy, the perianth petaloid with two whorls of three tepals each and septal nectaries The flowers have three stamens and a gynoecium of three united carpels and an inferior ovary, three locules and axile placentation with fruit that is a loculicidal capsule [2]\n\n\nGeneral\nCrocus display the general characteristics of family Iridaceae, which include basal cauline (arising from the aerial stem) leaves that sheath the stem base, hermaphrodite flowers that are relatively large and showy, the perianth petaloid with two whorls of three tepals each and septal nectaries The flowers have three stamens and a gynoecium of three united carpels and an inferior ovary, three locules and axile placentation with fruit that is a loculicidal capsule [2]\n\n\nLeaves\nPlants produce several basal linear bifacial green leaves that arise from the corms These are adaxially (upper surface facing axis) flat or channelled with pale median stripes, while the opposite (abaxial) surface is strongly keeled, with two grooves on either side The leaves have a distinctive shape in cross-section, being boat-shaped with two lateral arms with margins recurved inwardly towards the central ridged keel, forming the sides of the \"boat\" The keel may be square or rectangular, but is lacking in C carpetanus The pale central stripe is caused by parenchymatous cells which lack chloroplasts and may contain air spaces [7] The leaves are from 5 to 30 millimetres (3⁄16 to 1+3⁄16 in) wide and 10 to 118 centimetres (4 to 46 in) long The leaf-like bracts are membranous, while the smaller bracteoles are either membranous or absent [4] [5] The leaf bases are surrounded by up to 5 membranous sheaths called cataphylls, a specialised leaf The bases of the cataphylls form the corm tunic, and their number varies from 3 to 6, and enclose the true leaves (euphylls), bracts, bracteoles and flowering stalk [8] [9]\n\n\nFlowers\nThe number of peduncles (flower stems) vary from one to several and remain underground, emerging only at the fruiting stage, bearing flowers that are solitary or several, so that a true scape is absent The flowers are pedicellate (attached to the peduncle by a short subterranean pedicel stalk) The pedicel is sometimes subtended (below pedicel) by a membranous, sheathing prophyll (leaf-like structure) [4] [5]\n\n\nFruit and seed\nThe fruit is a small membranous  capsule, ellipsoid or oblong-ellipsoid in shape and the many seeds are globose to ellipsoid The seed surface is highly variable, including papillate (covered in small protuberances), digitiform (finger-like) and other epidermal cell types In some species the seeds are arillate, with fleshy appendages Crocus seeds have both inner and outer integuments and in some species the outer epidermis may display long papillae Embryo-sac development is Polygonum type Dehiscence (splitting of the capsule to release the seed) is of the loculicidal type in which it splits through the wall of the locules leaving the septa that separate them intact [13] [10] [14]\n\n\nKaryology\nCrocus has extensive aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes), with some uncertainty as to the base number of chromosomes The chromosome numbers shows extreme variability, ranging from 2n=6 to 2n=70 even within a single species [15] [11]\n\n\nPhytochemistry\nThe Iridaceae contain a wide range of phenolic compounds However, 6-Hydroxyflavones are found only in Crocus, which is also characterised by the presence of crocins, water-soluble yellow carotenoids, in the floral tissues Crocin is a diester of crocetin, responsible for the colour of the styles and stigma of C sativus, and hence saffron [16] [17] A few species contain mangiferin, a glucosylxanthone [18] [19]\n\n\nTaxonomy\nThe crocus was well known to the ancients, [22] being described at least as early as Theophrastus (c 371 – c 287 BC), [a] [24] and was introduced into Britain by the Romans, where the saffron crocus was used as a dyestuff It was reintroduced into Western Europe by the Crusaders The crocus is mentioned in mediaeval and later herbals, one of the earliest being the 14th century Tractatus de Herbis [25] [26] William Turner (1548) states that the crocus is referred to as saffron in English, implying that only C sativus was known at that time [27] However, by 1597 John Gerard writes of \"sundry sorts\" and uses the term saffron and crocus as interchangeable He included both spring and autumn flowering crocus, but distinguished Wild Saffron (Crocus) from Meadow Saffron (Colchicum) He described eleven forms Some of his specimens were obtained from Clusius [28] [29] In the following century, John Parkinson in a more detailed account was more careful to include separate chapters for Colchicum, with the common name of meadow saffron, from Crocus or saffron Parkinson (1656) states that there are \"divers sorts of saffrons\" describing 27 spring flowering plants and 4 autumn flowering ones, pointing out that only one of those was the true saffron crocus, which he called Crocus verus sativus autumnalis [30] Similar accounts are found in continental European herbals, including those of l'Obel in Flanders (1576) [31] and Besler's Hortus Eystettensis in Bavaria (1613) [32]\n\n\nHistory\nThe crocus was well known to

and Besler's Hortus Eystettensis in Bavaria (1613) [32]\n\n\nBotanical illustration\nThe scientific study of the genus in the late eighteenth century was accompanied by detailed descriptions with Botanical illustrations, such as those of William Curtis (1787) and Sims (1803), [45] that appeared in Curtis' Botanical Magazine, with illustrations by Sydenham Edwards [46] Other illustrations are found in monographs such as those of Haworth (1809) [37] and Sabine (1830), illustrated by Charles John Robertson [38] The largest collection is found in the most comprehensive monograph, that of Maw (1886) [47] Other sources include the portfolios of plates, such as the survey of the plants of France by Masclef (1891) At that time only C sativus and C vernus were included in the Flora of France [48]\n\n\nPhylogeny\nThe genus Crocus belongs to the monocot family Iridaceae (iris family), specifically the large subfamily Crocoideae Within that subfamily, crocus is placed on the tribe, Ixieae (synonym Croceae), [b] one of five The Ixieae are then subdivided into subtribes, with the genera Crocus, Romulea and Syringodea forming subtribe Romuleinae The Romuleinae have been characterised within the Ixieae by progressively reduced aerial stems [51]  solitary flowers on the stem branches and woody tunics on the corms They also often have divided style branches However, Crocus corm tunics are fibrous and membranous rather than woody as in Syringodea Also, Crocus has a ridged and often keeled abaxial leaf surface, while that of Syringodea is rounded, and the midline adaxial translucency of Crocus is lacking in Syringodea Romulea is principally distinguished from the other two genera by generally having aerial stems or at least an ovary at ground level, compared with the other acaulescent genera, other differences include unifacial rather than bifacial leaves and the pollen structure [52] [51]\n\n\nSubdivision\nThe genus Crocus consists of about 200 accepted species, which continue to increase, and has undergone a large number of taxonomic classifications [29] The genus has often been divided into sections, beginning with that of Haworth (1809) [37] who described two sections based on the presence or absence of hairs in the throat of the flower, while Sabine was the first to realise the importance of the presence or absence of a basal spathe (prophyll) in dividing the genus into two sections, [38] a practice followed by Herbert [39] However, Sabine's practice of using trinomials for varieties such as C sulphureus concolor is no longer accepted, although Herbert somewhat similarly used varieties and subvarieties, e.g C vernus var.1 Communis subvar 1 Obovatus Herbert also used geographical distribution as a basis of classification [29] By the late 19th century Maw (1886), [47] following Herbert, subdivided the genus into two divisions, the Involucrati and the Nudiflori, and then further divided it into six sections and lastly by flowering times (spring or autumn) Although rejecting the concept of subvarieties, he placed even more emphasis on geography [54] [15] [55] [29]\n\n\nSpeciation\nCrocus populations have extremely high infra-specific variability with a very diverse spectrum of morphological and phenotypical varieties, while many individual specimens from different species may closely resemble each other Based on such morphological differences between isolated populations many new species have been named, but without a definition of new species based on molecular and/or karyological information, species can not be confirmed, creating difficulties in determining speciation and hence the exact number of species [61] [62] The situation is even more complex once hybridisation (combination of taxa) and introgression (transfer of genetic material) are considered [63] [29]\n\n\nMolecular phylogeny\nThe availability of molecular phylogeny methods revealed problems with the traditional systems based on morphology alone The first analysis of the complete genus was carried out by Mathew and colleagues in 2008 using nucleotide sequences from plastid regions In particular, the DNA data suggest there are no grounds for isolating C banaticus in its own subgenus Crociris, though it is a unique species in the genus Because it has a prophyll at the base of the pedicel, it therefore would fall within section Crocus, although its exact relationship to the rest of the subgenus remains unclear [53]\n\n\nSections and species\nThe classification of Brian Mathew (1982), as amended in 2009 divides the genus into two sections, further divided by series [64] The number of series, continues to evolve \n\n\nSimilarly named species\nSome crocus species, known as \"autumn crocus\", flower in late summer and autumn, during (autumnal) rains, after summer's heat and drought The name autumn crocus is also often used as a common name for Colchicum, [68] which is not a true crocus but in its own family (Colchicaceae) in the lily order Liliales The plants are toxic, but have medicinal uses Colchicum are also known as meadow saffron, though true saffron is not toxic [69] Crocus species have three stamens while Colchicum species have six; [70] crocus have one style, while Colchicum have three [71] [10]\n\n\nEtymology\n\"Crocus\", the name of the genus, is Late Middle English (late 14th century) and also denotes saffron It is derived via Latin crocus from the Greek κρόκος (krokos), [76] which is itself probably a loan word from a Semitic language, related to Hebrew כרכום karkōm, [77] Aramaic ܟܟܘܪܟܟܡܡܐ kurkama, and Arabic كركم kurkum, meaning saffron (Crocus sativus), \"saffron yellow\" or turmeric (see Curcuma), another yellow dye [78] The word ultimately traces back to the Sanskrit kunkumam (कुङ्कुमं) for \"saffron\" The English name is a learned 16th-century adoption from the Latin safranum, but Old English already had croh for saffron, introduced by the Romans [47] [79] [80]\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nCrocuses are distributed from the Mediterranean, from the Iberian peninsula and North Africa, through central and southern Europe, the islands of the Aegean, the Middle East and across central and southwest Asia to Xinjiang in western China, but most species are restricted to Turkey and Asia Minor and the Balkans, with the Balkan Peninsula having the largest number of species (at least 31), [59] forming the centre of diversity, however they are widely introduced [53] [1] [81] [82] The distribution of species is described over five contiguous areas from west to east (see map) [15]\n\n\nEcology\nThe life cycle of Crocus species begins with the seed, germinating to a seedling, and a mature plant in 3–5 years, however seeds may remain dormant in the soil for several years The germination stages was first described and illustrated by Maw in his 1886 monograph [47] In its first year, the crocus produces only a single leaf and creates a corm covered by a thin tunic, about 5–8 mm in size, dependent on the species In the northern hemisphere, the autumnal crocuses flower between September and November The vernal (spring) crocuses flowering time depends both on climate and habitat, but is usually mid-winter to spring Leaves may be synanthous (produced during flowering) or hysteranthous (when the flowers wither away) [85] In the summer, with hot and dry conditions the plant becomes dormant, with all the above ground parts dying back Colder temperatures in winter then activate the corms [9] Propagation occurs sexually by seed and asexually by small corms, called cormels or cormlets, produced in the axils of the corms (between tunic scales and body of corm) [10] As the fruit capsule ripens, it emerges from the soil at the base of the flowering stem before dehiscing (splitting open) and releasing the seeds [86] Seed dispersal may be enhanced by ants, at least in species with arillate seeds [18]\n\n\nPests and diseases\nCultivated plants may have their corms consumed by mice and other rodents, [88] including voles, squirrels, [89] and chipmunks They are also attacked by mildew, gray mold, botrytis, and fusarium rot Root rot may also occur, caused by Stromatinia gladioli and Pythium species - the nematode Pratylenchus penetrans may also cause root rot [90] Viruses that are known to infect Crocus spp include: Potyviruses, especially bean yellow mosaic virus and  also tobacco rattle virus, tobaccos necrosis virus, and cucumber mosaic virus [91] The foliage may experience rot, rust, and scab diseases and be fed upon by aphids, mites, snails, and slugs [92] The foliage is eaten by hares, rabbits, and deer; the flowers are sometimes removed by birds, including crows, jackdaws, and magpies [93]\n\n\nCultivation\nThe economic importance of the genus is largely dependent on the single species, Crocus sativus, now known only in cultivation [94] C sativus is grown for the production of saffron, an orange-red derivative of its dried stigma, and among the most expensive spices in the world [53] The estimated worldwide production of C sativus plants is 205 tons [8] About 180,000 stigmas from 60,000 flowers are required to produce 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) saffron, which sells for about $10,000US (2018) Modern saffron production is widely cultivated in Kashmir, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan and the Mediterranean from Spain to Asia Minor [8] An important center is the eponymous town of Krokos, in the Kozani region of Greece The saffron product, Krokos Kozanis is a PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) [95] [96] production is largely indigenous and Iran accounts for 65% of global production, covering 72,162 ha [8]\n\n\nSaffron\nThe economic importance of the genus is largely dependent on the single

Empire, [103] where they were seen by visiting European botanists and explorers, among the first of whom was Pierre Belon who arrived in Constantinople in 1547 The first crocus seen in the Netherlands, where crocus species were not native, were from corms brought to Vienna in 1562 from Constantinople by the Holy Roman Emperor's ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq A few corms were forwarded to Carolus Clusius at the botanical garden in Leiden [20] These were almost certainly cultivated varieties rather than wild species [104] European visitors to Turkey continued to bring back specimens for gardens in their own country Prominent among the latter were the gardens at Middelburg in the Netherlands Jehan Somer, a Middelburg merchant, brought back crocuses among his other specimens in 1592, where they attracted the attention not only of Clusius but of the early Dutch flower painters, notably Ambrosius Bosschaert [105] [106] By 1620, new garden varieties had been developed, and featured in contemporary illustrations, such as that of Crispijn van de Passe in his Hortus floridus of 1614 [105] There are accounts of crocus gardens in the seventeenth century, such as the Saffron Garth of Walter Stonehouse at Darfield, Yorkshire [107]\n\n\nAutumn crocus\nAutumn-flowering species of crocus that are cultivated include: [85]\n\n\nUses\nThe corms of crocuses have been used as foodstuffs in Syria [119] The carotenoids found in the styles of Crocus species, particularly C sativus have been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, and have led to interest in potential pharmaceutical applications [15]\n\n\nCulture\nThe crocus or krokos has been known since ancient times, and used in decorative arts, such as the Minoan wall paintings in Santorini from ca. 1,600 BC [97] Representations of the saffron crocus appear frequently in Minoan art [99] and pervade Aegean art from the Early Bronze Age to the Mycenaean period [120] Theophrastos (4th century BC) described the saffron crocus as being valued as a spice and dye, while Homer compares a sunrise to the flower colour [121] Saffron coloured robes were much admired by women in antiquity [122] and gave the garment Crocota its name [123] The oil was also valued as a cosmetic [124] According to Greek legend Crocus or Krokus (Greek: Κρόκος), was a mortal youth the gods turned into a plant bearing his name, the crocus, after his death caused by his great desire and unfulfilled love for the shepherdess Smilax [125] Other versions state that as he died three tears fell into the flower becoming its three stigmata [126] [95]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Crocus**\n\nThe genus Crocus belongs to the monocot family Iridaceae, comprising approximately 200 accepted species. The genus is widely distributed across the Mediterranean, from the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa, to central and southern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Minor. The largest number of species (at least 31) is found in the Balkan Peninsula, which is considered the centre of diversity.\n\n**Description**\n\nCrocus plants display the general characteristics of family Iridaceae, including basal cauline (arising from the aerial stem) leaves that sheath the stem base, hermaphrodite flowers that are relatively large and showy, and a perianth petaloid with two whorls of three tepals each and septal nectaries. The flowers have three stamens and a gynoecium of three united carpels and an inferior ovary, three locules, and axile placentation with fruit that is a loculicidal capsule.\n\n**Leaves**\n\nPlants produce several basal linear bifacial green leaves that arise from the corms. These leaves are adaxially flat or channelled with pale median stripes, while the opposite surface is strongly keeled, with two grooves on either side. The leaves have a distinctive shape in cross-section, being boat-shaped with two lateral arms with margins recurved inwardly towards the central ridged keel, forming the sides of the \"boat\". The keel may be square or rectangular, but is lacking in C carpetanus. The pale central stripe is caused by parenchymatous cells that lack chloroplasts and may contain air spaces. The leaves are from 5 to 30 millimetres wide and 10 to 118 centimetres long. The leaf-like bracts are membranous, while the smaller bracteoles are either membranous or absent.\n\n**Flowers**\n\nThe number of peduncles (flower stems) varies from one to several and remain underground, emerging only at the fruiting stage, bearing flowers that are solitary or several, so that a true scape is absent. The flowers are pedicellate (attached to the peduncle by a short subterranean pedicel stalk). The pedicel is sometimes subtended (below pedicel) by a membranous, sheathing prophyll (leaf-like structure).\n\n**Fruit and Seed**\n\nThe fruit is a small membranous capsule, ellipsoid or oblong-ellipsoid in shape, and the many seeds are globose to ellipsoid. The seed surface is highly variable, including papillate (covered in small protuberances), digitiform (finger-like), and other epidermal cell types. In some species, the seeds are arillate, with fleshy appendages. The seeds have both inner and outer integuments, and in some species, the outer epidermis may display long papillae.\n\n**Karyology**\n\nCrocus has extensive aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes), with some uncertainty as to the base number of chromosomes. The chromosome numbers show extreme variability, ranging from 2n=6 to 2n=70, even within a single species.\n\n**Phytochemistry**\n\nThe Iridaceae contain a wide range of phenolic compounds. However, 6-Hydroxyflavones are found only in Crocus, which is also characterized by the presence of crocins, water-soluble yellow carotenoids, in the floral tissues. Crocin is a diester of crocetin, responsible for the colour of the styles and stigma of C sativus, and hence saffron.\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\nThe genus Crocus has undergone a large number of taxonomic classifications. The classification of Brian Mathew (1982), as amended in 2009, divides the genus into two sections, further divided by series. The number of series continues to evolve.\n\n**Sections and Species**\n\nThe classification of Brian Mathew (1982), as amended in 2009, divides the genus into two sections, further divided by series. Some of the species include:\n\n* Autumn crocus (Crocus autumnalis)\n* Crocus banaticus\n* Crocus cartwrightianus\n* Crocus ciliatus\n* Crocus danubensis\n* Crocus flaccidus\n* Crocus kotschyanus\n* Crocus ochroleucus\n* Crocus olivieri\n* Crocus pallasii\n* Crocus sieberi\n* Crocus tommasinianus\n* Crocus velutinus\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Crocus\" is derived from the Latin crocus, which is itself derived from the Greek κρόκος (krokos), meaning saffron.

leaf-like bracts are membranous, while the smaller bracteoles are either membranous or absent [4] [5] The leaf bases are surrounded by up to 5 membranous sheaths called cataphylls, a specialised leaf The bases of the cataphylls form the corm tunic, and their number varies from 3 to 6, and enclose the true leaves (euphylls), bracts, bracteoles and flowering stalk [8] [9]\n\n\nFlowers\nThe number of

introduced into Britain by the Romans, where the saffron crocus was used as a dyestuff It was reintroduced into Western Europe by the Crusaders The crocus is mentioned in mediaeval and later herbals, one of the earliest being the 14th century Tractatus de Herbis [25] [26] William Turner (1548) states that the crocus is referred to as saffron in English, implying that only C sativus was known at that time [27] However, by 1597 John Gerard writes of \"sundry sorts\" and uses the term saffron and crocus as interchangeable He included both spring and autumn flowering crocus, but distinguished Wild Saffron (Crocus) from Meadow Saffron (Colchicum) He described eleven forms Some of his specimens were obtained from Clusius [28] [29] In the following century, John Parkinson in a more detailed account was more careful to include separate chapters for Colchicum, with the common name of meadow saffron, from Crocus or saffron Parkinson (1656) states that there are \"divers sorts of saffrons\" describing 27 spring flowering plants and 4 autumn flowering ones, pointing out that only one of those was the true saffron crocus, which he called Crocus verus sativus autumnalis [30] Similar

and Besler's Hortus Eystettensis in Bavaria (1613) [32]\n\n\nBotanical illustration\nThe scientific study of the genus in the late eighteenth century was accompanied by detailed descriptions with Botanical illustrations, such as those of William Curtis (1787) and Sims (1803), [45] that appeared in Curtis' Botanical Magazine, with illustrations by Sydenham Edwards [46] Other illustrations are found in monographs such as those of Haworth (1809) [37] and Sabine (1830), illustrated by Charles John Robertson [38] The largest collection is found in the most comprehensive monograph, that of Maw (1886) [47] Other sources include the portfolios of plates, such as the survey of the plants of France by Masclef (1891) At that time only C sativus and C vernus were included in the Flora of France [48]\n\n\nPhylogeny\nThe genus Crocus belongs to the monocot family Iridaceae (iris family), specifically the large subfamily Crocoideae Within that subfamily, crocus is placed on the tribe, Ixieae (synonym Croceae), [b] one of five The Ixieae are then subdivided into subtribes, with the genera Crocus, Romulea and Syringodea forming subtribe Romuleinae The Romuleinae have been characterised within the Ixieae by progressively reduced aerial stems [51]  solitary flowers on the stem branches and woody tunics on the corms They also often have divided style branches However, Crocus corm tunics are fibrous and membranous rather than woody as in Syringodea Also, Crocus has a ridged and often keeled abaxial leaf surface, while that of Syringodea is rounded, and the midline adaxial translucency of Crocus is lacking in Syringodea Romulea is principally distinguished from the other two genera by generally having aerial stems or at least an ovary at ground level, compared with the other acaulescent genera, other differences include unifacial rather than bifacial leaves and the pollen structure [52] [51]\n\n\nSubdivision\nThe genus Crocus consists of about 200 accepted species, which continue to increase, and has undergone a large number of taxonomic classifications [29] The genus has often been divided into sections, beginning with that of Haworth (1809) [37] who described two sections based on the presence or absence of hairs in the throat of the flower, while Sabine was the first to realise the importance of the presence or absence of a basal spathe (prophyll) in dividing the genus into two sections, [38] a practice followed by Herbert [39] However, Sabine's practice of using trinomials for varieties such as C sulphureus concolor is no longer accepted, although Herbert somewhat similarly used varieties and subvarieties, e.g C vernus var.1 Communis subvar 1 Obovatus Herbert also used geographical distribution as a basis of classification [29] By the late 19th century Maw (1886), [47] following Herbert, subdivided the genus into two divisions, the Involucrati and the Nudiflori, and then further divided it into six sections and lastly by flowering times (spring or autumn) Although rejecting the concept of subvarieties, he placed even more emphasis on geography [54] [15] [55] [29]\n\n\nSpeciation\nCrocus populations have extremely high infra-specific variability with a very diverse spectrum of morphological and phenotypical varieties, while many individual specimens from different species may closely resemble each other Based on such morphological differences between isolated populations many new species have been named, but without a definition of new species based on molecular and/or karyological information, species can not be confirmed, creating difficulties in determining speciation and hence the exact number of species [61] [62] The situation is even more complex once hybridisation (combination of taxa) and introgression (transfer of genetic material) are considered [63] [29]\n\n\nMolecular phylogeny\nThe availability of molecular phylogeny methods revealed problems with the traditional systems based on morphology alone The first analysis of the complete genus was carried out by Mathew and colleagues in 2008 using nucleotide sequences from plastid regions In particular, the DNA data suggest there are no grounds for isolating C banaticus in its own subgenus Crociris, though it is a unique species in the genus Because it has a prophyll at the base of the pedicel, it therefore would fall within section Crocus, although its exact relationship to the rest of the subgenus remains unclear [53]\n\n\nSections and species\nThe classification of Brian Mathew (1982), as amended in 2009 divides the genus into two sections, further divided by series [64] The number of series, continues to evolve \n\n\nSimilarly named species\nSome crocus species, known as \"autumn crocus\", flower in late summer and autumn, during (autumnal) rains, after summer's heat and drought The name autumn crocus is also often used as a common name for Colchicum, [68] which is not a true crocus but in its own family (Colchicaceae) in the lily order Liliales The plants are toxic, but have medicinal uses Colchicum are also known as meadow saffron, though true saffron is not toxic [69] Crocus species have three stamens while Colchicum species have six; [70] crocus have one style, while Colchicum have three [71] [10]\n\n\nEtymology\n\"Crocus\", the name of the genus, is Late Middle English (late 14th century) and also denotes saffron It is derived via Latin crocus from the Greek κρόκος (krokos), [76] which is itself probably a loan word from a Semitic language, related to Hebrew כרכום karkōm, [77] Aramaic ܟܟܘܪܟܟܡܡܐ kurkama, and Arabic كركم kurkum, meaning saffron (Crocus sativus), \"saffron yellow\" or turmeric (see Curcuma), another yellow dye [78] The word ultimately traces back to the Sanskrit kunkumam (कुङ्कुमं) for \"saffron\" The English name is a learned 16th-century adoption from the Latin safranum, but Old English already had croh for saffron, introduced by the Romans [47] [79] [80]\n\n\nDistribution and habitat\nCrocuses are distributed from the Mediterranean, from the Iberian peninsula and North Africa, through central and southern Europe, the islands of the Aegean, the Middle East and across central and southwest Asia to Xinjiang in western China, but most species are restricted to Turkey and Asia Minor and the Balkans, with the Balkan Peninsula having the largest number of species (at least 31), [59] forming the centre of diversity, however they are widely introduced [53] [1] [81] [82] The distribution of species is described over five contiguous areas from west to east (see map) [15]\n\n\nEcology\nThe life cycle of Crocus species begins with the seed, germinating to a seedling, and a mature plant in 3–5 years, however seeds may remain dormant in the soil for several years The germination stages was first described and illustrated by Maw in his 1886 monograph [47] In its first year, the crocus produces only a single leaf and creates a corm covered by a thin tunic, about 5–8 mm in size, dependent on the species In the northern hemisphere, the autumnal crocuses flower between September and November The vernal (spring) crocuses flowering time depends both on climate and habitat, but is usually mid-winter to spring Leaves may be synanthous (produced during flowering) or hysteranthous (when the flowers wither away) [85] In the summer, with hot and dry conditions the plant becomes dormant, with all the above ground parts dying back Colder temperatures in winter then activate the corms [9] Propagation occurs sexually by seed and asexually by small corms, called cormels or cormlets, produced in the axils of the corms (between tunic scales and body of corm) [10] As the fruit capsule ripens, it emerges from the soil at the base of the flowering stem before dehiscing (splitting open) and releasing the seeds [86] Seed dispersal may be enhanced by ants, at least in species with arillate seeds [18]\n\n\nPests and diseases\nCultivated plants may have their corms consumed by mice and other rodents, [88] including voles, squirrels, [89] and chipmunks They are also attacked by mildew, gray mold, botrytis, and fusarium rot Root rot may also occur, caused by Stromatinia gladioli and Pythium species - the nematode Pratylenchus penetrans may also cause root rot [90] Viruses that are known to infect Crocus spp include: Potyviruses, especially bean yellow mosaic virus and  also tobacco rattle virus, tobaccos necrosis virus, and cucumber mosaic virus [91] The foliage may experience rot, rust, and scab diseases and be fed upon by aphids, mites, snails, and slugs [92] The foliage is eaten by hares, rabbits, and deer; the flowers are sometimes removed by birds, including crows, jackdaws, and magpies [93]\n\n\nCultivation\nThe economic importance of the genus is largely dependent on the single species, Crocus sativus, now known only in cultivation [94] C sativus is grown for the production of saffron, an orange-red derivative of its dried stigma, and among the most expensive spices in the world [53] The estimated worldwide production of C sativus plants is 205 tons [8] About 180,000 stigmas from 60,000 flowers are required to produce 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) saffron, which sells for about $10,000US (2018) Modern saffron production is widely cultivated in Kashmir, Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan and the Mediterranean from Spain to Asia Minor [8] An important center is the eponymous town of Krokos, in the Kozani region of Greece The saffron product, Krokos Kozanis is a PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) [95] [96] production is largely indigenous and Iran accounts for 65% of global production, covering 72,162 ha [8]\n\n\nSaffron\nThe economic importance of the genus is largely dependent on the single

production, covering 72,162 ha [8]\n\n\nHorticulture and floriculture\nCrocuses were described in Turkish gardens in the early sixteenth century, [102] gathered from the far reaches of the Ottoman Empire, [103] where they were seen by visiting European botanists and explorers, among the first of whom was Pierre Belon who arrived in Constantinople in 1547 The first crocus seen in the Netherlands, where crocus species were not native, were from corms brought to Vienna in 1562 from Constantinople by the Holy Roman Emperor's ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq A few corms were forwarded to Carolus Clusius at the botanical garden in Leiden [20] These were almost certainly cultivated varieties rather than wild species [104] European visitors to Turkey continued to bring back specimens for gardens in their own country Prominent among the latter were the gardens at Middelburg in the Netherlands Jehan Somer, a Middelburg merchant, brought back crocuses among his other specimens in 1592, where they attracted the attention not only of Clusius but of the early Dutch flower painters, notably Ambrosius Bosschaert [105] [106] By 1620, new garden varieties had been developed, and featured in contemporary illustrations, such as that of Crispijn van de Passe in his Hortus floridus of 1614 [105] There are accounts of crocus gardens in the seventeenth century, such as the Saffron Garth of Walter Stonehouse at Darfield, Yorkshire [107]\n\n\nAutumn crocus\nAutumn-flowering species of crocus that are cultivated include: [85]\n\n\nUses\nThe corms of crocuses have been used as foodstuffs in Syria [119] The carotenoids found in the styles of Crocus species, particularly C sativus have been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, and have led to interest in potential pharmaceutical applications [15]\n\n\nCulture\nThe crocus or krokos has been known since ancient times, and used in decorative arts, such as the Minoan wall paintings in Santorini from ca. 1,600 BC [97] Representations of the saffron crocus appear frequently in Minoan art [99] and pervade Aegean art from the Early Bronze Age to the Mycenaean period [120] Theophrastos (4th century BC) described the saffron crocus as being valued as a spice and dye, while Homer compares a sunrise to the flower colour [121] Saffron coloured robes were much admired by women in antiquity [122] and gave the garment Crocota its name [123] The oil was also valued as a cosmetic [124] According to Greek legend Crocus or Krokus (Greek: Κρόκος), was a mortal youth the gods turned into a plant bearing his name, the crocus, after his death caused by his great desire and unfulfilled love for the shepherdess Smilax [125] Other versions state that as he died three tears fell into the flower becoming its three stigmata [126] [95]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

In the end, Riddle applied the triangle submission on Rollins, who tried to break the hold by hoisting Riddle up and slamming him into the cage walls and on the mat, but Riddle would not let go of the hold, causing Rollins to tap out, thus Riddle won the match.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe event received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised the six-man Donnybrook match and the \"I Quit\" match, the latter for its dark tone and ending, along with Michael Cole's commentary during the match, while the SmackDown Women's Championship match was criticized as the weakest of the event and the Strap match was also criticized. The main event was moderately praised, with most feeling that more could have been done with the stipulation. The return of Bray Wyatt, however, was universally acclaimed for its mystery, buildup, and execution. Critics also praised the variety of stipulation matches, unlike the previous year's event, which only had one hardcore-based match.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThis would be the final Extreme Rules event, as an event was not scheduled for 2023, with that year's October slot given to a reinstated Fastlane. This came after WWE Chief Content Officer Triple H stated that he wanted to discontinue some of the gimmick events.\n\n**Raw**\n\nOn the following episode of Raw, Damage CTRL (Bayley, Dakota Kai, and Iyo Sky) vowed that the next time Bayley faced Bianca Belair for the Raw Women's Championship, she would win the title. Later, after Bayley lost to Candice LeRae, Kai and Sky ran out and attacked LeRae. Belair came out for the save but was outnumbered by Damage CTRL. Bayley would earn another match for the Raw Women's Championship by defeating Belair in a non-title match on the October 24 episode after interference from Nikki Cross, who ditched the Nikki A.S.H persona. The title rematch was scheduled for Crown Jewel and stipulated as a Last Woman Standing match.\n\n**SmackDown**\n\nOn the following episode of SmackDown, Karrion Kross was involved in a car accident while arriving to the arena. Medical personnel tended to Kross, only for Drew McIntyre to appear and viciously attack Kross. WWE officials appeared and separated the two while McIntyre proclaimed that their rivalry was not over. A rematch between the two was scheduled as a Steel Cage match at Crown Jewel, which McIntyre won to end the feud.\n\n**Results**\n\n* The Brawling Brutes (Sheamus, Ridge Holland, and Butch) defeated

space forever.\" [8]\n\n\nInterface\nThe Gmail user interface initially differed from other web-mail systems with its focus on search and conversation threading of emails, grouping several messages between two or more people onto a single page, an approach that was later copied by its competitors Gmail's user interface designer, Kevin Fox, intended users to feel as if they were always on one page and just changing things on that page, rather than having to navigate to other places [18]\n\n\nSpam filter\nGmail's spam filtering features a community-driven system: when any user marks an email as spam, this provides information to help the system identify similar future messages for all Gmail users [29]\n\n\nGmail Labs\nThe Gmail Labs feature, introduced on June 5, 2008, allows users to test new or experimental features of Gmail Users can enable or disable Labs features selectively and provide feedback about each of them This allows Gmail engineers to obtain user input about new features to improve them and also to assess their popularity [30]\n\n\nSearch\nGmail incorporates a search bar for searching emails The search bar can also search contacts, files stored in Google Drive, events from Google Calendar, and Google Sites [33] [34] [35]\n\n\nLanguage support\nAs of March 2015 [update], the Gmail interface supports 72 languages, including: Arabic, Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (UK), English (US), Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malay, Malayalam, Marathi, Norwegian (Bokmål), Odia, Persian, Polish, Punjabi, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, Welsh and Zulu [37]\n\n\nLanguage input styles\nIn October 2012, Google added over 100 virtual keyboards, transliterations, and input method editors to Gmail, enabling users different types of input styles for different languages in an effort to help users write in languages that are not \"limited by the language of your keyboard.\" [38] [39]\n\n\nPlatforms\nThe modern AJAX version is officially supported in the current and previous major releases of Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari web browsers on a rolling basis [43] [44] [45]\n\n\nWeb browsers\nThe modern AJAX version is officially supported in the

but serving as a \"completely different type of inbox\", the service is made to help users deal with the challenges of an active email Citing issues such as distractions, difficulty in finding important information buried in messages, and receiving more emails than ever, Inbox by Gmail has several important differences from Gmail, including bundles that automatically sort emails of the same topic together, highlights that surface key information from messages, and reminders, assists, and snooze, that help the user in handling incoming emails at appropriate times [68] [69] [70]\n\n\nIntegration with Google products\nIn August 2010, Google released a plugin that provides integrated telephone service within Gmail's Google Chat interface The feature initially lacked an official name, with Google referring to it as both \"Google Voice in Gmail chat\" and \"Call Phones in Gmail\" [74] [75] [76] The service logged over one million calls in 24 hours [76] [77] In March 2014, Google Voice was discontinued, and replaced with functionality from Google Hangouts, another communication platform from Google [78] [79]\n\n\nSecurity\nGoogle has supported the secure HTTPS since the day it launched In the beginning, it was only default on the login page, a reason that Google engineer Ariel Rideout stated was because HTTPS made \"your mail slower\" However, users could manually switch to secure HTTPS mode inside the inbox after logging in In July 2008, Google simplified the ability to manually enable secure mode, with a toggle in the settings menu [94]\n\n\nHistory\nThe idea for Gmail was developed by Paul Buchheit several years before it was announced to the public The project was known by the code name Caribou During early development, the

third-party email providers [105]\n\n\nTwo-step verification\nGmail supports two-step verification, an optional additional measure for users to protect their accounts when logging in [106]\n\n\n24-hour lockdowns\nIf an algorithm detects what Google calls \"abnormal usage that may indicate that your account has been compromised\", the account can be automatically locked down for between one minute and 24 hours, depending on the type of activity detected Listed reasons for a lock-down include: [111]\n\n\nAnti-child pornography policy\nGoogle combats child pornography through Gmail's servers in conjunction with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) to find children suffering abuse around the world In collaboration with the NCMEC, Google creates a database of child pornography pictures Each one of the images is given a unique numerical number known as a hash Google then scans Gmail looking for the unique hashes When suspicious images are located Google reports the incident to the appropriate national authorities [112]\n\n\nHistory\nThe idea for Gmail was developed by Paul Buchheit several years before it was announced to the public The project was known by the code name Caribou During early development, the project was kept secret from most of Google's own engineers This changed once the project improved, and by early 2004, most employees were using it to access the company's internal email system [113]\n\n\nGrowth\nIn June 2012, Google announced that Gmail had 425 million active users globally [123] In May 2015, Google

graphic design from Gamil Design in Raleigh, North Carolina, received 3,000 hits per month In May 2004, a Google engineer who had accidentally gone to the Gamil site a number of times contacted the company and asked if the site had experienced an increase in traffic In fact, the site's activity had doubled Two years later, with 600,000 hits per month, the Internet service provider wanted to charge more, and Gamil posted the message on its site \"You may have arrived here by misspelling Gmail We understand Typing fast is not our strongest skill But since you've typed your way here, let's share.\" [131]\n\n\nGoogle Workspace\nAs part of Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), Google's business-focused offering, Gmail comes with additional features, including: [132]\n\n\nReception\nGmail

emails [144] [145] [146]\n\n\nLawsuits\nIn March 2011, a former Gmail user in Texas sued Google, claiming that its Gmail service violates users' privacy by scanning e-mail messages to serve relevant ads [150]\n\n\nApril 2014 Terms of service update\nGoogle updated its terms of service for Gmail in April 2014 to create full transparency for its users in regard to the scanning of email content The relevant revision states: \"Our automated systems analyse your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customised search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.\" A Google spokesperson explained that the corporation wishes for its policies \"to be simple and easy for users to understand.\"\n\n\nMicrosoft ad campaign against Google\nIn 2013, Microsoft launched an advertising campaign to attack Google for scanning email messages, arguing that most consumers are not aware that Google monitors their personal messages to deliver targeted ads Microsoft claims that its email service Outlook does not scan the contents of messages and a Microsoft spokesperson called the issue of privacy \"Google's kryptonite\" In response, Google stated; \"We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive and relevant .. No humans read your e-mail or Google Account information in order to show you advertisements or related information An automated algorithm — similar to that used for features like Priority Inbox or spam filtering — determines which ads are shown.\" The New York Times cites \"Google supporters\", who say that \"Microsoft's ads are distasteful, the last resort of a company that has been unsuccessful at competing against Google on the more noble battleground of products\" [154]\n\n\nOther privacy issues\nIn January 2010, Google detected a \"highly sophisticated\" cyberattack on its infrastructure that originated from China The targets of the attack were Chinese human rights activists, but Google discovered that accounts belonging to European, American and Chinese activists for human rights in China had been \"routinely accessed by third parties\" Additionally, Google stated that their investigation revealed that \"at least\" 20 other large companies from a \"wide range of businesses\" - including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors – had been similarly targeted Google was in the process of notifying those companies and it had also worked with relevant US authorities In light of the attacks, Google enhanced the security and architecture of its infrastructure, and advised individual users to install anti-virus and anti-spyware on their computers, update their operating systems and web browsers, and be cautious when clicking on Internet links or when sharing personal information in instant messages and emails [155] [156]\n\n\n2010 attack from China\nIn January 2010, Google detected a \"highly sophisticated\" cyberattack on its infrastructure that originated from China The targets of the attack were Chinese human rights activists, but Google discovered that accounts belonging to European, American and Chinese activists for human rights in China had been \"routinely accessed by third parties\" Additionally, Google stated that their investigation revealed that \"at least\" 20 other large companies from a \"wide range of businesses\" - including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors – had been similarly targeted Google was in the process of notifying those companies and it had also worked with relevant US authorities In light of the attacks, Google enhanced the security and architecture of its infrastructure, and advised individual users to install anti-virus and anti-spyware on their computers, update their operating systems and web browsers, and be cautious when clicking on Internet links or when sharing personal information in instant messages and emails [155] [156]\n\n\nSocial network integration\nThe February 2010 launch of Google Buzz, a former social network that was linked to Gmail, immediately drew criticism for publicly sharing details of users' contacts unless the default settings were changed [157] [158] A new Gmail feature was launched in January 2014, whereby users can email people with Google+ accounts even though they do not know the email address of the recipient Marc Rotenberg, President of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, called the feature \"troubling\", and compared it to the Google Buzz initial launch privacy flaw [159]\n\n\nUpdate to DoubleClick privacy policy\nIn June 2016, Julia Angwin of ProPublica wrote about Google's updated privacy policy, which deleted a clause that had stated Google would not combine DoubleClick web browsing cookie information with personally identifiable information from its other services This change has allowed Google to merge users' personally identifiable information from different Google services to create one unified ad profile for each user After publication of the article, Google reached out to ProPublica to say that the merge would not include Gmail keywords in ad targeting [160]\n\n\nOutages\nGmail suffered at least seven outages in 2009, causing doubts about the reliability of its service [161] [162] It suffered a new outage on February 28, 2011, in which a bug caused Gmail accounts to seem empty Google stated in a blog post that \"email was never lost\" and restoration was in progress [163] Other outages occurred on April 17, 2012, [164] September 24, 2013, [165] January 24, 2014, [166] January 29, 2019  [167] and August 20, 2020 [168]\n\n\n\"On behalf of\" tag\nIn May 2009, Farhad Manjoo wrote on The New York Times blog about Gmail's \"on behalf of\" tag Manjoo explained: \"The problems  [sic] is, when you try to send outbound mail from your Gmail universal inbox, Gmail adds a tag telling your recipients that you're actually using Gmail and not your office e-mail If your recipient is using Microsoft Outlook, he'll see a message like, 'From youroffice@domain.com on behalf of yourgmail@gmail.com.'\" Manjoo further wrote that \"Google explains that it adds the tag in order to prevent your e-mail from being considered spam by your recipient; the theory is that if the e-mail is honest about its origins, it shouldn't arouse suspicion by spam checking software\" [170] The following July, Google announced a new option that would remove the \"On behalf of\" tag, by sending the email from the server of the other email address instead of using Gmail's servers [171]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Gmail is a free web-based email service provided by Google.

was launched with one gigabyte (GB) of storage space, a significantly higher amount than competitors offered at the time [7]\nThe limit was doubled to two gigabytes of storage on April 1, 2005, the first anniversary of Gmail Georges Harik, the product management director for Gmail, stated that Google would \"keep giving people more space forever.\" [8]\n\n\nStorage\nOn April 1, 2004, Gmail was launched with one gigabyte (GB) of storage space, a significantly higher amount than competitors offered at the time [7]\nThe limit was doubled to two gigabytes of storage on April 1, 2005, the first anniversary of Gmail Georges Harik, the product management director for Gmail, stated that Google would \"keep giving people more space forever.\" [8]\n\n\nInterface\nThe Gmail user interface initially differed from other web-mail systems with its focus on search and conversation threading of emails, grouping several messages between two or more people onto a single page, an approach that was later copied by its competitors Gmail's user interface designer, Kevin Fox, intended users to feel as if they were always on one page and just changing things on that page, rather than having to navigate to other places [18]\n\n\nSpam filter\nGmail's spam filtering features a community-driven system: when any user marks an email as spam, this provides information to help the system identify similar future messages for all Gmail users [29]\n\n\nGmail Labs\nThe Gmail Labs feature, introduced on June 5, 2008, allows users to test new or experimental features of Gmail Users can enable or disable Labs features selectively and provide feedback about each of them This allows Gmail engineers to obtain user input about new features to improve them and also to assess their popularity [30]\n\n\nSearch\nGmail incorporates a search bar for searching emails The search bar can also search contacts, files stored in Google Drive, events from Google Calendar, and Google Sites [33] [34] [35]\n\n\nLanguage support\nAs of March 2015 [update], the Gmail interface supports 72 languages, including: Arabic, Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (UK), English (US), Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malay, Malayalam, Marathi, Norwegian (Bokmål), Odia, Persian, Polish, Punjabi, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, Welsh and Zulu [37]\n\n\nLanguage input styles\nIn October 2012, Google added over 100 virtual keyboards, transliterations, and input method editors to Gmail, enabling users different types of input styles for different languages in an effort to help users write in languages that are not \"limited by the language of your keyboard.\" [38] [39]\n\n\nPlatforms\nThe modern AJAX version is officially supported in the current and previous major releases of Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari web browsers on a rolling basis [43] [44] [45]\n\n\nWeb browsers\nThe modern AJAX version is officially supported in the current and previous major releases of Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge

[55]\n\n\nInbox by Gmail\nIn October 2014, Google introduced Inbox by Gmail on an invitation-only basis Developed by the Gmail team, but serving as a \"completely different type of inbox\", the service is made to help users deal with the challenges of an active email Citing issues such as distractions, difficulty in finding important information buried in messages, and receiving more emails than ever, Inbox by Gmail has several important differences from Gmail, including bundles that automatically sort emails of the same topic together, highlights that surface key information from messages, and reminders, assists, and snooze, that help the user in handling incoming emails at appropriate times [68] [69] [70]\n\n\nIntegration with Google products\nIn August 2010, Google released a plugin that provides integrated telephone service within Gmail's Google Chat interface The feature initially lacked an official name, with Google referring to it as both \"Google Voice in Gmail chat\" and \"Call Phones in Gmail\" [74] [75] [76] The service logged over one million calls in 24 hours [76] [77] In March 2014, Google Voice was discontinued, and replaced with functionality from Google Hangouts, another communication platform from Google [78] [79]\n\n\nSecurity\nGoogle has supported the secure HTTPS since the day it launched In the beginning, it was only default on the login page, a reason that Google engineer Ariel Rideout stated was because HTTPS made \"your mail slower\" However, users could manually switch to secure HTTPS mode inside the inbox after logging in In July 2008, Google simplified the ability to manually enable secure mode, with a toggle in the settings menu [94]\n\n\nHistory\nThe idea for Gmail was developed by Paul Buchheit several years before it was announced to the public The project was known by the code name Caribou During early development, the project was kept secret from most of Google's own engineers This changed once the project improved, and by early 2004, most employees were using it to access the company's internal email system [113]\n\n\nThird-party encryption in transit\nIn Google's Transparency Report under the Safer email section, it provides information on the percentage of emails encrypted in transit between Gmail and third-party email providers [105]\n\n\nTwo-step verification\nGmail supports two-step verification, an optional additional measure for users to protect their accounts when logging in [106]\n\n\n24-hour lockdowns\nIf an algorithm detects what Google calls \"abnormal usage that may indicate that your account has been compromised\", the account can be automatically locked down for between one minute and 24 hours, depending on the type of activity detected Listed reasons for a lock-down include: [111]\n\n\nAnti-child pornography policy\nGoogle combats child pornography through Gmail's servers in conjunction with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) to find children suffering abuse around the world In collaboration with the NCMEC, Google creates a database of child pornography pictures Each one of the images is given a unique numerical number known as a hash Google then scans Gmail looking for the unique hashes When suspicious images are located Google reports the incident to the appropriate national authorities [112]\n\n\nHistory\nThe idea for Gmail was developed by Paul Buchheit several years before it was announced to the public The project was known by the code name Caribou During early development, the project was kept secret from most of Google's own engineers This changed once the project improved, and by early 2004, most employees were using it to access the company's internal email system [113]\n\n\nGrowth\nIn June 2012, Google announced that Gmail had 425 million active users globally [123] In May 2015, Google announced that Gmail had 900 million active users, 75% of whom were using the service on mobile devices [124] In February 2016, Google announced that Gmail had passed 1 billion active users [125] [126] In July 2017, Google announced that Gmail had passed 1.2 billion active users [127] [128]\n\n\nGamil Design company and misspellings\nBefore the introduction of Gmail, the website of product and graphic design from Gamil Design in Raleigh, North Carolina, received 3,000 hits per month In May 2004, a Google engineer who had accidentally gone to the Gamil site a number of times contacted the company and asked if the site had experienced an increase in traffic In fact, the site's activity had doubled Two years later, with 600,000 hits per month, the Internet service provider wanted to charge more, and Gamil posted the message on its site \"You may have arrived here by misspelling Gmail We understand Typing fast is not our strongest skill But since you've typed your way here, let's share.\" [131]\n\n\nGoogle Workspace\nAs part of Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), Google's business-focused

webmail application for small businesses [140] In November 2006, Gmail received PC World's 4-star rating [141]\n\n\nCriticism\nGoogle has one privacy policy that covers all of its services [142]\n\n\nPrivacy\nGoogle has one privacy policy that covers all of its services [142]\n\n\nAutomated scanning of email content\nGoogle's mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including filtering spam and malware, and (until 2017) adding context-sensitive advertisements next to emails [144] [145] [146]\n\n\nLawsuits\nIn March 2011, a former Gmail user in Texas sued Google, claiming that its Gmail service violates users' privacy by scanning e-mail messages to serve relevant ads [150]\n\n\nApril 2014 Terms of service update\nGoogle updated its terms of service for Gmail in April 2014 to create full transparency for its users in regard to the scanning of email content The relevant revision states: \"Our automated systems analyse your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customised search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.\" A Google spokesperson explained that the corporation wishes for its policies \"to be simple and easy for users to understand.\"\n\n\nMicrosoft ad campaign against Google\nIn 2013, Microsoft launched an advertising campaign to attack Google for scanning email messages, arguing that most consumers are not aware that Google monitors their personal messages to deliver targeted ads Microsoft claims that its email service Outlook does not scan the contents of messages and a Microsoft spokesperson called the issue of privacy \"Google's kryptonite\" In response, Google stated; \"We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive and relevant .. No humans read your e-mail or Google Account information in order to show you advertisements or related information An automated algorithm — similar to that used for features like Priority Inbox or spam filtering — determines which ads are shown.\" The New York Times cites \"Google supporters\", who say that \"Microsoft's ads are distasteful, the last resort of a company that has been unsuccessful at competing against Google on the more noble battleground of products\" [154]\n\n\nOther privacy issues\nIn January 2010, Google detected a \"highly sophisticated\" cyberattack on its infrastructure that originated from China The targets of the attack were Chinese human rights activists, but Google discovered that accounts belonging to European, American and Chinese activists for human rights in China had been \"routinely accessed by third parties\" Additionally, Google stated that their investigation revealed that \"at least\" 20 other large companies from a \"wide range of businesses\" - including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors – had been similarly targeted Google was in the process of notifying those companies and it had also worked with relevant US authorities In light of the attacks, Google enhanced the security and architecture of its infrastructure, and advised individual users to install anti-virus and anti-spyware on their computers, update their operating systems and web browsers, and be cautious when clicking on Internet links or when sharing personal information in instant messages and emails [155] [156]\n\n\n2010 attack from China\nIn January 2010, Google detected a \"highly sophisticated\" cyberattack on its infrastructure that originated from China The targets of the attack were Chinese human rights activists, but Google discovered that accounts belonging to European, American and Chinese activists for human rights in China had been \"routinely accessed by third parties\" Additionally, Google stated that their investigation revealed that \"at least\" 20 other large companies from a \"wide range of businesses\" - including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors – had been similarly targeted Google was in the process of notifying those companies and it had also worked with relevant US authorities In light of the attacks, Google enhanced the security and architecture of its infrastructure, and advised individual users to install anti-virus and anti-spyware on their computers, update their operating systems and web browsers, and be cautious when clicking on Internet links or when sharing personal information in instant messages and emails [155] [156]\n\n\nSocial network integration\nThe February 2010 launch of Google Buzz, a former social network that was linked to Gmail, immediately drew criticism for publicly sharing details of users' contacts unless the default settings were changed [157] [158] A new Gmail feature was launched in January 2014, whereby users can email people with Google+ accounts even though they do not know the email address of the recipient Marc Rotenberg, President of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, called the feature \"troubling\", and compared it to the Google Buzz initial launch privacy flaw [159]\n\n\nUpdate to DoubleClick privacy policy\nIn June 2016, Julia Angwin of ProPublica wrote about Google's updated privacy policy, which deleted a clause that had stated Google would not combine DoubleClick web browsing cookie information with personally identifiable information from its other services This change has allowed Google to merge users' personally identifiable information from different Google services to create one unified ad profile for each user After publication of the article, Google reached out to ProPublica to say that the merge would not include Gmail keywords in ad targeting [160]\n\n\nOutages\nGmail suffered at least seven outages in 2009, causing doubts about the reliability of its service [161] [162] It suffered a new outage on February 28, 2011, in which a bug caused Gmail accounts to seem empty Google stated in a blog post that \"email was never lost\" and restoration was in progress [163] Other outages occurred on April 17, 2012, [164] September 24, 2013, [165] January 24, 2014, [166] January 29, 2019  [167] and August 20, 2020 [168]\n\n\n\"On behalf of\" tag\nIn May 2009, Farhad Manjoo wrote on The New York Times blog about Gmail's \"on behalf of\" tag Manjoo explained: \"The problems  [sic] is, when you try to send outbound mail from your Gmail universal inbox, Gmail adds a tag telling your recipients that you're actually using Gmail and not your office e-mail If your recipient is using Microsoft Outlook, he'll see a message like, 'From youroffice@domain.com on behalf of yourgmail@gmail.com.'\" Manjoo further wrote that \"Google explains that it adds the tag in order to prevent your e-mail from being considered spam by your recipient; the theory is that if the e-mail is honest about its origins, it shouldn't arouse suspicion by spam checking software\" [170] The following July, Google announced a new option that would remove the \"On behalf of\" tag, by sending the email from the server of the other email address instead of using Gmail's servers [171]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The website is dedicated to hosting wikis, which are online encyclopedias that can be edited by anyone. Fandom has undergone several changes and rebranding over the years, with the current name being adopted in 2016.\n\nHistory\n\nFandom was launched on October 18, 2004, at 23:50:49 (UTC) under the name Wikicities (which invited comparisons to Yahoo's GeoCities), by Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, and Angela Beesley Starling—respectively chairman emeritus and advisory board member of the Wikimedia Foundation. Wales' original idea was to use his Wikipedia idea for a place where people from the same city or other geographical place could come together.\n\n2004–2009: Early days and growth\n\nInitially, Wikicities allowed users to create wikis in various languages, with the number of languages supported increasing over time. By 2010, wikis could be created in 188 different languages. In October 2011, Craig Palmer, the former CEO of Gracenote, replaced Penchina as CEO. In February 2012, co-founder Beesley Starling left Wikia to launch a startup called ChalkDrop.com. At the end of November 2012, Wikia raised $10.8 million in Series C funding from Institutional Venture Partners and previous investors Bessemer Ventures Partners and Amazon.com. Another $15 million was raised in August 2014 for Series D funding, with investors Digital Garage, Amazon, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Institutional Venture Partners. The total raised at this point was $39.8 million.\n\n2016–2018: Fandom brand\n\nOn January 25, 2016, Wikia launched a new entertainment news site named Fandom.

King\", leads the town in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations This year, however, Jack grows tired of the same routine and longs for something new Upon discovering trees containing doors to other holiday-themed worlds, Jack stumbles through the one leading to Christmas Town and is fascinated by the unfamiliar holiday.\n\n\nVoice cast\n\n\n\nProduction\nAs writer Tim Burton's upbringing in Burbank, California, was associated with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood \"Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween,  […] it was great It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn't there before,\" Burton would later recall [18] After completing his short film Vincent in 1982, [18] Burton, who was then employed at Walt Disney Feature Animation, wrote a three-page poem titled The Nightmare Before Christmas, drawing inspiration from television specials of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and the poem A Visit from St Nicholas [19] Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor, Vincent Price, [20] but also considered other options such as a children's book [21] He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs, who also sculpted character models; [22] [23] Burton later showed his and Heinrichs' works-in-progress to Henry Selick, also a Disney animator at the time [24] After the success of Vincent in 1982, Disney started to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute holiday television special [22] However, the project's development eventually stalled, as its tone seemed \"too weird\" to the company [25] As Disney was unable to \"offer his nocturnal loners enough scope\", Burton was fired from the studio in 1984 [20] and went on to direct the commercially successful films Beetlejuice (1988) and Batman (1989) for Warner Bros Pictures [25]\n\n\nDevelopment\nAs writer Tim Burton's upbringing in Burbank, California, was associated with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his

commercially successful films Beetlejuice (1988) and Batman (1989) for Warner Bros Pictures [25]\n\n\nFilming\nSelick and his team of animators began production in July 1991 in San Francisco, California, with a crew of over 120 workers, utilizing 20 sound stages for filming [24] [30] Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor, while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation [31] At the peak of production, 20 individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming [32] In total, there were 109,440 frames taken for the film The work of Ray Harryhausen, Ladislas Starevich, Edward Gorey, Étienne Delessert, Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams, Jan Lenica, Francis Bacon, and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers Selick described the production design as akin to a pop-up book [22] [29] In addition, Selick stated, \"When we reach Halloween Town, it's entirely German Expressionism When Jack enters Christmas Town, it's an outrageous Dr Seuss-esque setpiece Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the 'Real World', everything is plain, simple and perfectly aligned.\" [33] Vincent Price, Don Ameche, and James Earl Jones were considered to provide the narration for the film's prologue; however, all proved difficult to cast, and the producers instead hired local voice artist Ed Ivory [15] Patrick Stewart provided the prologue narration for the film's soundtrack.\n\n\nSoundtracks\nThe film's soundtrack album was released in 1993 on Walt Disney Records The film's soundtrack contains bonus tracks, including a longer prologue and an extra epilogue, both narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart For the film's 2006 re-release in Disney Digital 3-D, a special edition of the soundtrack was released, featuring a bonus disc that contained covers of five of the film's songs by Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, Marilyn Manson, Fiona Apple, and She Wants Revenge Four original demo tracks by Elfman were also included [37] On September 30, 2008, Disney released the cover album Nightmare Revisited, featuring artists such as Amy Lee, Flyleaf, Korn, Rise Against, Plain White T's, The All-American Rejects, and many more [38]\n\n\nRelease\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas was originally going to be released under Walt Disney Pictures as part of the Walt Disney Feature Animation lineup (as was advertised as Walt Disney Pictures in the behind the scenes sneak peek on the 1993 VHS release of Pinocchio), but Disney decided to release the film under the studio's adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures banner, because the studio thought the film would be \"too dark and scary for kids,\" Selick remembered \"Their biggest fear, and why it was kind of a stepchild project,  [was] they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming.\" [40] To convey Burton's involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [27] According to Selick, the decision was made approximately three weeks before the film went into wide release [41] Burton explained that, \"…it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about.\" [4] The film made its world premiere on the opening day celebration of the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, [42] and was given a limited release on October 13, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29, 1993.\n\n\nReissues and re-releases\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas was reissued under the Walt Disney Pictures label and re-released on October 20, 2006, with conversion to Disney Digital 3-D, and was accompanied by Pixar's short film Knick Knack [1] Industrial Light & Magic assisted in the process [31] It subsequently re-released on October 19, 2007, October 24, 2008, and October 23, 2009 [43] The El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California, has been showing the film in 4-D screenings annually in October, ending on Halloween, since 2010 [44] The reissues have led to a reemergence of 3-D films and advances in RealD Cinema [45] [46]\n\n\nHome media\nWith years of successful home video sales, The Nightmare Before Christmas later achieved the ranks of a cult film [31] Touchstone Home Video first released the film on VHS and LaserDisc (in both deluxe CAV and widescreen editions) on September 30, 1994, and on DVD on December 2, 1997 [49] The Nightmare Before Christmas was released on DVD a second time on October 3, 2000, as a special edition The release included an audio commentary by Selick and cinematographer Pete Kozachik, a 28-minute making-of documentary, a gallery of concept art, storyboards, test footage and deleted scenes Burton's Vincent (1982) and Frankenweenie (1984) were also included [50] Both DVDs were non-anamorphic widescreen releases The film was released on UMD for PlayStation Portable on October 25, 2005 [51]\n\n\nMarketing\nDisney has extensively marketed the film and its characters across many forms of media and memorabilia, including action figures, books, games, art crafts, and fashion products Jack Skellington, Sally, Pajama Jack, and the Mayor have been made into bendable figures, [57] while Jack and Sally even appear in fine art [58]  Sally has been made into an action figure and a Halloween costume [59]\n\n\nReception\nAround the release of the film, Hoberman was quoted, \"I hope Nightmare goes out and makes a fortune If it does, great If it doesn't, that doesn't negate the validity of the process The budget was less than any Disney blockbuster so it doesn't have to earn Aladdin-sized grosses to satisfy us.\" [22] The film earned $50 million in the United States in its initial theatrical run [43] and was regarded as a moderate sleeper hit.\n\n\nBox office\nAround the release of the film, Hoberman was quoted, \"I hope Nightmare goes out and makes a fortune If it does, great If it doesn't, that doesn't negate the validity of the process The budget

critics consensus reads, \"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a stunningly original and visually delightful work of stop-motion animation.\" [66] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\" [67] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale [68]\n\n\nAccolades\nThe film was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation Nightmare won the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, while Elfman won Best Music Selick and the animators were also nominated for their work Elfman was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score Most recently, the film ranked #1 on Rotten Tomatoes' \"Top 25 Best Christmas Movies\" list [78]\n\n\nLegacy\nBlink-182's 2003 song \"I Miss You\" makes reference to the film [79] [80]\n\n\nPossible sequel\n\nIn 2003, Disney began to consider producing a sequel, but rather than using stop motion, they wanted to use computer animation [81] Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea \"I was always very protective of  [The Nightmare Before Christmas], not to do sequels or things of that kind,\" Burton explained \"You know, Jack visits Thanksgiving world or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it and the people that like it, because it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it.\" [46] The 2004 video game The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge did serve as a sequel of the film, with Capcom's crew of developers going after Burton for advice [82] and having the collaboration of the film's art director, Deane Taylor [83] In 2009, Selick said he would do a film sequel if he and Burton could create a good story for it [84]\n\n\nRelated media\nA collectible card game based on the film called The Nightmare Before Christmas TCG was released in 2005 by NECA The game was

upbringing in Burbank, California, was associated with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood \"Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween,  […] it was great It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn't there before,\" Burton would later recall [18] After completing his short film Vincent in 1982, [18] Burton, who was then employed at Walt Disney Feature Animation, wrote a three-page poem titled The Nightmare Before Christmas, drawing inspiration from television specials of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and the poem A Visit from St Nicholas [19] Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor, Vincent Price, [20] but also considered other options such as a children's book [21] He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs, who also sculpted character models; [22] [23] Burton later showed his and Heinrichs' works-in-progress to Henry Selick, also a Disney animator at the time [24] After the success of Vincent in 1982, Disney started to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute holiday television special [22] However, the project's development eventually stalled, as its tone seemed \"too weird\" to the company [25] As Disney was unable to \"offer his nocturnal loners enough scope\", Burton was fired from the studio in 1984 [20] and went on to direct the commercially successful films Beetlejuice (1988) and Batman (1989) for Warner Bros Pictures [25]\n\n\nDevelopment\nAs writer Tim Burton's upbringing in Burbank, California, was associated with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely

July 1991 in San Francisco, California, with a crew of over 120 workers, utilizing 20 sound stages for filming [24] [30] Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor, while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation [31] At the peak of production, 20 individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming [32] In total, there were 109,440 frames taken for the film The work of Ray Harryhausen, Ladislas Starevich, Edward Gorey, Étienne Delessert, Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams, Jan Lenica, Francis Bacon, and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers Selick described the production design as akin to a pop-up book [22] [29] In addition, Selick stated, \"When we reach Halloween Town, it's entirely German Expressionism When Jack enters Christmas Town, it's an outrageous Dr Seuss-esque setpiece Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the 'Real World', everything is plain, simple and perfectly aligned.\" [33] Vincent Price, Don Ameche, and James Earl Jones were considered to provide the narration for the film's prologue; however, all proved difficult to cast, and the producers instead hired local voice artist Ed Ivory [15] Patrick Stewart provided the prologue narration for the film's soundtrack.\n\n\nSoundtracks\nThe film's soundtrack album was released in 1993 on Walt Disney Records The film's soundtrack contains bonus tracks, including a longer

Pictures in the behind the scenes sneak peek on the 1993 VHS release of Pinocchio), but Disney decided to release the film under the studio's adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures banner, because the studio thought the film would be \"too dark and scary for kids,\" Selick remembered \"Their biggest fear, and why it was kind of a stepchild project,  [was] they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming.\" [40] To convey Burton's involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas [27] According to Selick, the decision was made approximately three weeks before the film went into wide release [41] Burton explained that, \"…it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about.\" [4] The film made its world premiere on the opening day celebration of the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, [42] and was given a limited release on October

because it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it.\" [46] The 2004 video game The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge did serve as a sequel of the

the Star Trek franchise beyond Discovery to several new series, miniseries, and animated series [33] One of these new series was reported to star Patrick Stewart, reprising his role of Jean-Luc Picard from the series Star Trek: The Next Generation [34] [35] Kurtzman and Akiva Goldsman (who worked on the first season of Discovery) were attached to the project [35] When CBS had first approached him about making more Star Trek series, Kurtzman included a series featuring Picard on his wish list as he believed the character was the greatest Star Trek captain [3] This was despite Stewart having previously said that he did not want to return to the franchise [12]\n\n\nWriting\nKurtzman's mandate for the series was that it be a psychological character study about Picard in his \"emeritus years\" He noted that it was rare for a television series to star an actor of Stewart's age [47] Goldsman said the series would not be a direct sequel to The Next Generation and would be more character-focused than that series, describing Picard as \"slower, more gentle, more lyrical\" than previous Star Trek stories [17] He contrasted Picard with Discovery by describing the latter as a sci-fi action-adventure series while Picard is a sci-fi drama series that tells dramatic stories within an otherworldly setting [5] Stewart was assured by the creative team that the series would not be \"jokey\", [38] and compared Picard to when he reprised his X-Men role of Professor X in the film Logan (2017), where he was the same character but the franchise's world and tone was \"blown apart\" [4]\n\n\nCasting\nWith the series announcement in August 2018 came confirmation that Stewart would star as Picard [12] At the start of March 2019, Santiago Cabrera and Michelle Hurd were both set to co-star in the series, with Cabrera being one of the most sought-after actors during the 2019 television pilot season and choosing this series over other offers [62] Later that month, newcomer Evan Evagora was cast in another series regular role [63] In April, Alison Pill, Harry Treadaway, and Isa Briones joined the cast [64] Characters for the new cast members were announced in July, with Pill as Agnes Jurati, Cabrera as Cristobal \"Chris\" Rios, Hurd as Raffi Musiker, Treadaway as Narek, and Evagora as Elnor [17] Briones portrays several androids, including Dahj and Soji Asha [19]\n\n\nDesign\nSeveral members of the design team from Star Trek: Discovery returned for Picard, including production designer Todd Cherniawsky and creature designer Neville Page of Alchemy Studios [73] [5] Christine Bieselin Clark served as costume designer [74] Acknowledging that the series would be set further in the future than any previous Star Trek film or series, Kurtzman explained that the production was aiming for a \"grounded\" approach rather than having things like \"crazy floating skyscrapers and all the cliches of science fiction\" [75] The opening title sequence was created by Prologue, the company that created the Discovery opening sequence [76]\n\n\nFilming\nThe series was filmed at Santa Clarita Studios, California, under the working title Drawing Room [45] It received large tax credits from the California Film Commission for the production to take place in California, rather than in Toronto, Canada, where Star Trek: Discovery is filmed [77] Filming for the first season took place from April to September 2019, [78] [79] with location shooting around California, including at Sunstone Winery in Santa Ynez Valley to depict Picard's French vineyard, [80] at long-time Star Trek filming location Vasquez Rocks in the Sierra Pelona Mountains in Los Angeles County for Raffi's home, [81] and in the Malibu area for the planet Coppelius [6]\n\n\nVisual effects\nVisual effects for the series are provided by Pixomondo, [88] DNEG, [89] Crafty Apes, [90] Ghost VFX, [91] Gentle Giant Studios, Technicolor VFX, and Filmworks/FX [92] with Jason Zimmerman returning from Discovery as visual effects supervisor [93] Pixomondo worked with the series' production design department to help flesh out their designs into 3D assets, and then shared those assets with the other vendors For the first season, these digital models included the Borg Cube, La Sirena, and the Romulan ships [91]\n\n\nMusic\nStar Trek: Discovery composer Jeff Russo was revealed to be composing the score for Picard in July 2019 [94] Russo's relationship with Star Trek began as a fan of The Next Generation, and he asked Kurtzman if he could work on Picard after seeing Stewart's announcement of the series at the Las Vegas Star Trek Convention Russo wanted his music to remain truthful to previous Star Trek scores without repeating them, and especially wanted to avoid his music for Discovery Russo felt that Picard was a more intimate story and wanted to take a more personalized approach by featuring more solo instrument performances than he did for Discovery [95]\n\n\nRelease\nStar Trek: Picard premiered on the streaming service CBS All Access in the United States on January 23, 2020 [17] Like Discovery, each episode was broadcast in Canada by Bell Media

film with the cast of The Next Generation [168] He reiterated this wish in February 2023, praising the ending of Picard but feeling there were questions left unanswered and saying \"it might be a good idea to look at Jean-Luc Picard one more time in a different atmosphere, and then wrap him up with certainty.\" [169] That April, Paramount+ announced that the franchise was expanding into television films with Star Trek: Section 31 [170] In June, Stewart said he still thought a film would be an appropriate way to end his time as Picard, but there had been \"no eager response\" from the studio about the idea and he had been asked to stop talking about it [171] In his memoir Making It So which was released later that year, Stewart said he was \"gently pushing\" Paramount to make a Picard film and had discussed the idea with Frakes, Burton, and Spiner He said they were all open to reprising their roles in the film and Frakes was his personal first choice to direct [172] In January 2024, Stewart said he had just been told that a Star Trek film was being written for him to star in and he should expect to receive the script in the next week or so [173] The next month, Matalas said he was open to making a television film that could serve as a backdoor pilot for his proposed Star Trek: Legacy spin-off series, as long as he could hire the cast and crew that he wanted [174] By the end of March, Kurtzman was considering a follow-up to Picard as one of the next Star Trek television films if Section 31 was successful [175]\n\n\nPotential series continuation\nGoldsman and Matalas stated in January 2022 that elements of the series could be explored more in a spin-off series, with Matalas describing Picard's 25th century setting as the \"present day of Star Trek.. what's going on in that particular world is very important to me\" [176] By that May, some fans had begun championing the idea of a spin-off series featuring Ryan as Seven of Nine and Hurd as Raffi Matalas said he was \"not just supporting,  [but] spearheading\" the idea, which both actresses also expressed interest in [177] In November, Frakes said Picard was \"ripe for a continuation of some version of what we've established in the show Not more Picard, but certainly, Next Gen is alive and well.\" McFadden added that the Next Generation cast were excited to continue in their roles after the third season [178] In January 2023, Kurtzman said it was possible for the series to continue beyond its third season [179] The next month, Matalas said the third season of Picard would feel like \"the final voyage\" of the Next Generation's main cast, but a \"Next, Next Generation\" series could continue the story and include \"legacy characters\" from The Next Generation, Voyager, and Deep Space Nine He said a spin-off series was not in development but he would love to be involved if it ever was, and suggested the possible title Star Trek: Legacy [180]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

overall deal with CBS Television Studios to expand the Star Trek franchise beyond Discovery to several new series, miniseries, and animated series [33] One of these new series was reported to star

Star Trek captain [3] This was despite Stewart having previously said that he did not want to return to the franchise [12]\n\n\nWriting\nKurtzman's mandate for the series was that it be a psychological character study about Picard in his \"emeritus years\" He noted that it was rare for a television series to star an actor of Stewart's age [47] Goldsman said the series would not be a direct sequel to The Next Generation and would be more character-focused than that series, describing Picard as \"slower, more gentle, more lyrical\" than previous Star Trek stories [17] He contrasted Picard with Discovery by describing the latter as a sci-fi action-adventure series while Picard is a sci-fi drama series that tells dramatic stories within an otherworldly setting [5] Stewart was assured by the creative team that the series would not be \"jokey\", [38] and compared Picard to when he reprised his X-Men role of Professor X in the film Logan (2017), where he was the same character but the franchise's world and tone was \"blown apart\" [4]\n\n\nCasting\nWith the series announcement in August 2018 came confirmation that Stewart would star as Picard [12] At the start of March 2019, Santiago Cabrera and Michelle Hurd were both set to co-star in the series, with Cabrera being one of the most sought-after actors during the 2019 television pilot season and choosing this series over other offers [62] Later that month, newcomer Evan Evagora was cast in another series regular role [63] In April, Alison Pill, Harry Treadaway, and Isa Briones joined the cast [64] Characters for the new cast members were announced in July, with Pill as Agnes Jurati, Cabrera as Cristobal \"Chris\" Rios, Hurd as Raffi Musiker, Treadaway as Narek, and Evagora as Elnor [17] Briones portrays several androids, including Dahj and Soji Asha [19]\n\n\nDesign\nSeveral members of the design team from Star Trek: Discovery returned for Picard, including production designer Todd Cherniawsky and creature designer Neville Page of Alchemy Studios [73] [5] Christine Bieselin Clark served as costume designer [74] Acknowledging that the series would be set further in the future than any previous Star Trek film or series, Kurtzman explained that the production was aiming for a \"grounded\" approach rather than having things like \"crazy floating skyscrapers and all the cliches of science fiction\" [75] The opening title sequence was created by Prologue, the company that created the Discovery opening sequence [76]\n\n\nFilming\nThe series was filmed at Santa Clarita Studios, California, under the working title Drawing Room [45] It received large tax credits from the California Film Commission for the production to take place in California, rather than in Toronto, Canada, where Star Trek: Discovery is filmed [77] Filming for the first season took place from April to September 2019, [78] [79] with location shooting around California, including at Sunstone Winery in Santa Ynez Valley to depict Picard's French vineyard, [80] at long-time Star Trek filming location Vasquez Rocks in the Sierra Pelona Mountains in Los Angeles County for Raffi's home, [81] and in the Malibu area for the planet Coppelius [6]\n\n\nVisual effects\nVisual effects for the series are provided by Pixomondo, [88] DNEG, [89] Crafty Apes, [90] Ghost VFX, [91] Gentle Giant Studios, Technicolor VFX, and Filmworks/FX [92] with Jason Zimmerman returning from Discovery as visual effects supervisor [93] Pixomondo worked with the series' production design department to help flesh out their designs into 3D assets, and then shared those assets with the other vendors For the first season, these digital models included the Borg Cube, La Sirena, and the Romulan ships [91]\n\n\nMusic\nStar Trek: Discovery composer Jeff Russo was revealed to be composing the score for Picard in July 2019 [94] Russo's relationship with Star Trek began as a fan of The Next Generation, and he asked Kurtzman if he could work on Picard after seeing Stewart's announcement of the series at the Las Vegas Star Trek Convention Russo wanted his music to remain truthful to previous Star Trek scores without repeating them, and especially wanted to avoid his music for Discovery Russo felt that Picard was a more intimate story and wanted to take a more personalized approach by featuring more solo instrument performances than he did for Discovery [95]\n\n\nRelease\nStar Trek: Picard premiered on the streaming service CBS All Access in the United States on January 23, 2020 [17] Like

continuation\nStewart said in November 2022 that he would like to make another Star Trek film with the cast of The Next Generation [168] He reiterated this wish in February 2023, praising the ending of Picard but feeling there were questions left unanswered and saying \"it might be a good idea to look at Jean-Luc Picard one more time in a different atmosphere, and then wrap him up with certainty.\" [169] That April, Paramount+ announced that the franchise was expanding into television films with Star Trek: Section 31 [170] In June, Stewart said he still thought a film would be an appropriate way to end his time as Picard, but there had been \"no eager response\" from the studio about the idea and he had been asked to stop talking about it [171] In his memoir Making It So which was released later that year, Stewart said he was \"gently pushing\" Paramount to make a Picard film and had discussed the idea with Frakes, Burton, and Spiner He said they were all open to reprising their roles in the film and Frakes was his personal first choice to direct [172] In January 2024, Stewart said he had just been told that a Star Trek film was being written for him to star in and he should expect to receive the script in the next week or so [173] The next month, Matalas said he was open to making a television film that could serve as a backdoor pilot for his proposed Star Trek: Legacy spin-off series, as long as he could hire the cast and crew that he wanted [174] By the end of March, Kurtzman was considering a follow-up to Picard as one of the next Star Trek television films if Section 31 was successful [175]\n\n\nPotential series continuation\nGoldsman and Matalas stated in January 2022 that elements of the series could be explored more in a spin-off series, with Matalas describing Picard's 25th century setting as the \"present day of Star Trek.. what's going on in that particular world is very important to me\" [176] By that May, some fans had begun championing the idea of a spin-off series featuring Ryan as Seven of Nine and Hurd as Raffi Matalas said he was \"not just supporting,  [but] spearheading\" the idea, which both actresses also expressed interest in [177] In November, Frakes said Picard was \"ripe for a continuation of some version of what we've established in the show Not more Picard, but certainly, Next Gen is alive and well.\" McFadden added that the Next Generation cast were excited to continue in their roles after the third season [178] In January 2023, Kurtzman said it was possible for the series to continue beyond its third season [179] The next month, Matalas said the third season of Picard would feel like \"the final voyage\" of the Next Generation's main cast, but a \"Next, Next Generation\" series could continue the story and include \"legacy characters\" from The Next Generation, Voyager, and Deep Space Nine He said a spin-off series was not in development but he would love to be involved if it ever was, and suggested the possible title Star Trek: Legacy [180]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Pet", "content": "\nPet popularity\nIn China, spending on domestic animals has grown from an estimated $3.12 billion in 2010 to $25 billion in 2018 The Chinese people own 51 million dogs and 41 million cats, with pet owners often preferring to source pet food internationally [4] There are a total of 755 million pets, increased from 389 million in 2013 [5]\n\n\nEffects on pets' health\nKeeping animals as pets may be detrimental to their health if certain requirements are not met An important issue is inappropriate feeding, which may produce clinical effects The consumption of chocolate or grapes by dogs, for example, may prove fatal Certain species of houseplants can also prove toxic if consumed by pets Examples include philodendrons and Easter lilies, which can cause severe kidney damage to cats, [15] [16] and poinsettias, begonia, and aloe vera, which are mildly toxic to dogs [17] [18] For birds, chocolate can be deadly, and foods intended for human consumption, such as bread, crackers, and dairy items, can potentially cause health problems [19]\n\n\nEffects of pets on their caregivers' health\nIt is widely believed among the public, and among many scientists, that pets probably bring mental and physical health benefits to their owners; [23] a 1987 NIH statement cautiously argued that existing data was \"suggestive\" of a significant benefit [24] A recent dissent comes from a 2017 RAND study, which found that at least in the case of children, having a pet per se failed to improve physical or mental health by a statistically significant amount; instead, the study found children who were already prone to being healthy were more likely to get pets in the first place [23] [25] [26] Conducting long-term randomized trials to settle the issue would be costly or infeasible [24] [26]\n\n\nHealth benefits\nIt is widely believed among the public, and among many scientists, that pets probably bring mental and physical health benefits to

correlations\nPets might have the ability to stimulate their caregivers, in particular the elderly, giving people someone to take care of, someone to exercise with, and someone to help them heal from a physically or psychologically troubled past [24] [27] [28] Animal company can also help people to preserve acceptable levels of happiness despite the presence of mood symptoms like anxiety or depression [29] Having a pet may also help people achieve health goals, such as lowered blood pressure, or mental goals, such as decreased stress [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] There is evidence that having a pet can help a person lead a longer, healthier life In a 1986 study of 92 people hospitalized for coronary ailments, within a year, 11 of the 29 patients without pets had died, compared to only 3 of the 52 patients who had pets [28] Having pet(s) was shown to significantly reduce triglycerides, and thus heart disease risk, in the elderly [36] A study by the National Institute of Health found that people who owned dogs were less likely to die as a result of a heart attack than those who did not own one [37] There is some evidence that pets may have a therapeutic effect in dementia cases [38] Other studies have shown that for the elderly, good health may be a requirement for having a pet, and not a result [39] Dogs trained to be guide dogs can help people with vision impairment Dogs trained in the field of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) can also benefit people with other disabilities [24] [40]\n\n\nPets in long-term care institutions\nPeople residing in a long-term care facility, such as a hospice or nursing home, may experience health benefits from pets Pets help them to cope with the emotional issues related to their illness They also offer physical contact with another living creature, something that is often missing in an elder's life [9] [41] Pets for nursing homes are chosen based on the size of the pet, the amount of care that the breed needs, and the population and size of the care institution [28] Appropriate pets go through a screening process and, if it is a dog, additional training programs to become a therapy dog [42] There are three types of therapy dogs: facility therapy dogs, animal-assisted therapy dogs, and therapeutic visitation dogs The most common therapy dogs are therapeutic visitation dogs These dogs are household pets whose handlers take time to visit hospitals, nursing homes, detention facilities, and rehabilitation facilities [27] Different pets require varying amounts of attention and care; for example, cats may have lower maintenance requirements than dogs [43]\n\n\nConnection with community\nIn addition to providing health benefits for their owners, pets also impact the social lives of their owners and their connection to their community There is some evidence that pets can facilitate social interaction [44] Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Leslie Irvine has focused her attention on pets of the homeless population Her studies of pet ownership among the homeless found that many modify their life activities for fear of losing their pets Pet ownership prompts them to act responsibly, with many making a deliberate choice not to drink or use drugs, and to avoid contact with substance abusers or those involved in any criminal activity for fear of being separated from their pet Additionally, many refuse to house in shelters if their pet is not allowed to stay with them [45]\n\n\nHealth risks\nHealth risks that are associated with pets include:\n\n\nLegislation\nThe European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals is a 1987 treaty of the Council of Europe – but accession to the treaty is open to all states in the world – to

and other animals' well-being [48] [49] [50] [51] Since the year 2000, a small but increasing number of jurisdictions in North America have enacted laws redefining pet's owners as guardians Intentions have been characterized as simply changing attitudes and perceptions but not legal consequences to working toward legal personhood for pets themselves Some veterinarians and breeders have opposed these moves The question of pets' legal status can arise with concern to purchase or adoption, custody, divorce, estate and inheritance, injury, damage, and veterinary malpractice [52] [53] [54]

personally or for business purposes Prohibited pets may be specific to certain breeds such as pit bulls or Rottweilers, they may apply to general categories of animals (such as livestock, exotic animals, wild animals, and canid or felid hybrids), or they may simply be based on the animal's size Additional or different maintenance rules and regulations may also apply Condominium associations and owners of rental properties also commonly limit or forbid tenants' keeping of pets [citation needed]\n\n\nKilling and eating pets\nIn January 2011, the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain stated that people are not allowed to kill miscellaneous or unknown cats walking in their garden, but \"nowhere in the law does it say that you can't eat your cat, dog, rabbit, fish or whatever You just have to kill them in an animal-friendly way.\" [59] Since 1 July 2014, it is illegal in the Netherlands for owners to kill their own cats and dogs kept as pets Parakeets, guinea pigs, hamsters and other animals may still be killed by their owners, but nonetheless when owners mistreat their companion animals (for example, in the process of killing them), the owners can still be prosecuted under Dutch law [60]\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\nPets have a considerable environmental impact, especially in countries where they are common or held in high densities For instance, the 163 million dogs and cats kept in the United States consume about 20% of the amount of dietary energy that humans do and an estimated 33% of the animal-derived energy [61] [62] They produce about 30% ± 13%, by mass, as much feces as Americans, and through their diet, constitute about 25–30% of the environmental impacts from animal production in terms of the use of land, water, fossil fuel, phosphate, and biocides Dog and cat animal product consumption is responsible for the release of up to 64 ± 16 million tons CO2-equivalent methane and nitrous oxide, two powerful greenhouse gasses Americans are the largest pet owners in the world, but pet ownership in the US has considerable environmental costs [62]\n\n\nTypes\nWhile many people have kept many different species of animals in captivity over the course of human history, only a relative few have been kept long enough to be considered domesticated Other types of animal, notably monkeys, have never been domesticated but are still sold and kept as pets Some wild animals are kept as pets, such as tigers, even though this is illegal There is a market for illegal pets.\n\n\nDomesticated\nDomesticated pets are the most common A domesticated animal is a species that has been made fit for a human environment, [63] by being consistently kept in captivity and selectively bred over a long enough period of time that it exhibits marked differences in behavior and appearance from its wild relatives Domestication contrasts with taming, which is simply when an un-domesticated, wild animal has become tolerant of human presence, and perhaps even enjoys it.\n\n\nWild animals\nWild animals are kept as pets The term wild in this context specifically applies to any species of animal which has not undergone a fundamental change in behavior to facilitate a close co-existence with humans Some species may have been bred in captivity for a considerable length of time, but are still not recognized as domesticated.\n\n\nHistory\nArchaeology suggests that human ownership of dogs as pets may date back to at least 12,000 years ago [64]\n\n\nPrehistory\nArchaeology suggests that human ownership of dogs as pets may date back to at least 12,000 years ago [64]\n\n\nAncient history\nAncient Greeks and Romans would openly grieve for the loss of a dog, evidenced by inscriptions left on tombstones commemorating their loss [65] The surviving epitaphs dedicated to horses are more likely to reference a gratitude for the companionship that had come from war horses rather than race horses The latter may have chiefly been commemorated as a way to further the owner's fame and glory [66] In Ancient Egypt, dogs and baboons were kept as pets and buried with their owners Dogs were given names, which is significant as Egyptians considered names to have magical properties [67]\n\n\nVictorian era: the rise of modern pet keeping\nThroughout the 17th and 18th-century pet keeping in the modern sense gradually became accepted throughout Britain Initially, aristocrats kept dogs for both companionship and hunting Thus, pet keeping was a sign of elitism within society By the 19th century, the rise of the middle class stimulated the development of pet keeping and it became inscribed within the bourgeois culture [68]\n\n\nEconomy\nAs the popularity of pet-keeping in the modern sense rose during the Victorian era, animals became a fixture within urban culture as commodities and decorative objects [69] Pet keeping generated a commercial opportunity for entrepreneurs By the mid-19th century, nearly twenty thousand street vendors in London dealt with live animals [70] The popularity of animals also developed a demand for animal goods such as accessories and guides for pet keeping Pet care developed into a big business by the end of the nineteenth century [71]\n\n\nSocial\nPets and animals also had social and cultural implications throughout the nineteenth century The categorization of dogs by their breeds reflected the hierarchical, social order of the Victorian era The pedigree of a dog represented the high status and lineage of their owners and reinforced social stratification [74] Middle-class owners valued the ability to associate with the upper-class through ownership of their pets The ability to care for a pet signified respectability and the capability to be self-sufficient [75] According to Harriet Ritvo, the identification of \"elite animal and elite owner was not a confirmation of the owner's status but a way of redefining it.\" [76]\n\n\nEntertainment\nThe popularity of dog and pet keeping generated animal fancy Dog fanciers showed enthusiasm for owning pets, breeding dogs, and showing dogs in various shows The first dog show took place on 28 June 1859 in Newcastle and focused mostly on sporting and hunting dogs [77] However, pet owners produced an eagerness to demonstrate their pets as well as have an outlet to compete [78] Thus, pet animals gradually were included within dog shows The first large show, which would host one thousand entries, took place in Chelsea in 1863 [79] The Kennel Club was created in 1873 to ensure fairness and organization within dog shows The development of the Stud Book by the Kennel Club defined policies, presented a national registry system of purebred dogs, and essentially institutionalized dog shows [80]\n\n\nPet ownership by non-humans\nPet ownership by animals in the wild, as an analogue to the human phenomenon, has not been observed and is likely non-existent in nature [81] One group of capuchin monkeys was observed appearing to care for a marmoset, a fellow New World monkey species; however, observations of chimpanzees apparently \"playing\" with small animals like hyraxes have ended with the chimpanzees killing the animals and tossing the corpses around [82]\n\n\nPets in art\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

From ancient civilizations to modern times, pets have played a significant role in human society, influencing culture, economy, and social dynamics. This article explores the various aspects of pet ownership, including its benefits, effects on human health, and the impact of pets on the environment.\n\n**Pet Popularity**\n\nThe popularity of pets has grown significantly over the years. In China, spending on domestic animals has grown from an estimated $3.12 billion in 2010 to $25 billion in 2018. The Chinese people own 51 million dogs and 41 million cats, with pet owners often preferring to source pet food internationally. Globally, there are a total of 755 million pets, increased from 389 million in 2013. The growth in pet ownership has led to a significant increase in the pet industry, with pet owners spending billions of dollars on pet care, food, and other related products.\n\n**Effects on Pets' Health**\n\nKeeping animals as pets may be detrimental to their health if certain requirements are not met. Inappropriate feeding, for example, can produce clinical effects. The consumption of chocolate or grapes by dogs can be fatal, while certain species of houseplants can prove toxic if consumed by pets. Birds, on the other hand, can be deadly if they consume chocolate, and foods intended for human consumption, such as bread, crackers, and dairy items, can potentially cause health problems.\n\n**Effects of Pets on Their Caregivers' Health**\n\nIt is widely believed that pets probably bring mental and physical health benefits to their owners. A 1987 NIH statement cautiously argued that existing data was \"suggestive\" of a significant benefit. While a recent dissent comes from a 2017 RAND study, which found that at least in the case of children, having a pet per se failed to improve physical or mental health by a statistically significant amount. Conducting long-term randomized trials to settle the issue would be costly or infeasible.\n\n**Health Benefits**\n\nIt is widely believed that pets probably bring mental and physical health benefits to their owners. Observations have shown that pets might have the ability to stimulate their caregivers, particularly the elderly, giving people someone to take care of, someone to exercise with, and someone to help them heal from a physically or psychologically troubled past. Animal company can also help people to preserve acceptable levels of happiness despite the presence of mood symptoms like anxiety or depression. Having a pet may also help people achieve health goals, such as lowered blood pressure, or mental goals, such as decreased stress.\n\n**Observed Correlations**\n\nPets might have the ability to stimulate their caregivers, particularly the elderly, giving people someone to take care of, someone to exercise with, and someone to help them heal from a physically or psychologically troubled past. Animal company can also help people to preserve acceptable levels of happiness despite the presence of mood symptoms like anxiety or depression. Having a pet may also help people achieve health goals, such as lowered blood pressure, or mental goals, such as decreased stress. There is evidence that having a pet can help a person lead a longer, healthier life.\n\n**Pets in Long-term Care Institutions**\n\nPeople residing in a long-term care facility, such as a hospice or nursing home, may experience health benefits from pets. Pets help them to cope with the emotional issues related to their illness, and they also offer physical contact with another living creature, something that is often missing in an elder's life. Pets for nursing homes are chosen based on the size of the pet, the amount of care that the breed needs, and the population and size of the care institution.\n\n**Connection with Community**\n\nIn addition to providing health benefits for their owners, pets also impact the social lives of their owners and their connection to their community. There is some evidence that pets can facilitate social interaction. Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Leslie Irvine, has focused her attention on pets of the homeless population. Her studies of pet ownership among the homeless found that many modify their life activities for fear of losing their pets.\n\n**Health Risks**\n\nHealth risks associated with pets include the risk of zoonotic diseases, which are diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans. These diseases can include rabies, ringworm, and salmonella. Additionally, pets can also carry parasites, such as fleas and ticks, which can transmit diseases to humans.\n\n**Legislation**\n\nThe European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals is a 1987 treaty of the Council of Europe, which promotes the welfare of pet animals and ensures minimum standards for their treatment and protection. The convention went into effect on 1 May 1992, and as of June 2020, it has been ratified by 24 states.\n\n**National and Local Laws**\n\nPets have commonly been considered private property, owned by individual persons.

the companionship that had come from war horses rather than race horses The latter may have chiefly been commemorated as a way to further the owner's fame and glory [66] In Ancient Egypt, dogs and baboons were kept as pets and buried with their owners Dogs were given names, which is significant as Egyptians considered names to have magical properties [67]\n\n\nVictorian era: the rise of modern pet keeping\nThroughout the 17th and 18th-century pet keeping in the modern sense gradually became accepted throughout Britain Initially, aristocrats kept dogs for both companionship and hunting Thus, pet keeping was a sign of elitism within society By the 19th century, the rise of the middle class stimulated the development of pet keeping and it became inscribed within the bourgeois culture [68]\n\n\nEconomy\nAs the popularity of pet-keeping in the modern sense rose during the Victorian era, animals became a fixture within urban culture as commodities and decorative objects [69] Pet keeping generated a commercial opportunity for entrepreneurs By the mid-19th century, nearly twenty thousand street vendors in London dealt with live animals [70] The popularity of animals also developed a demand for animal goods such as accessories and guides for pet keeping Pet care developed into a big business by the end of the nineteenth century [71]\n\n\nSocial\nPets and animals also had social and cultural implications throughout the nineteenth century The categorization of dogs by their breeds reflected the hierarchical, social order of the Victorian era The pedigree of a dog represented the high status and lineage of their owners and reinforced social stratification [74] Middle-class owners valued the ability to associate with the upper-class through ownership of their pets The ability to care for a pet signified respectability and the capability to be self-sufficient [75] According to Harriet Ritvo, the identification of \"elite animal and elite owner was not a confirmation of the owner's status but a way of redefining it.\" [76]\n\n\nEntertainment\nThe popularity of dog and pet keeping generated animal fancy Dog fanciers showed enthusiasm for owning pets, breeding dogs, and showing dogs in various shows The first dog show took place on 28 June 1859 in Newcastle and focused mostly on sporting and hunting dogs [77] However, pet owners produced an eagerness to demonstrate their pets as well as have an outlet to compete [78] Thus, pet animals gradually were included within dog shows The first large show, which would host one thousand entries, took place in Chelsea in 1863 [79] The Kennel Club was created in 1873 to ensure fairness and organization within dog shows The development of the Stud Book by the Kennel Club defined policies, presented a national registry system of purebred dogs, and essentially institutionalized dog shows [80]\n\n\nPet ownership by non-humans\nPet ownership by animals in the wild, as an analogue to the human phenomenon, has not been observed and is likely non-existent in nature [81] One group of capuchin monkeys was observed appearing to care for a marmoset, a fellow New World monkey species; however, observations of chimpanzees apparently \"playing\" with small animals like hyraxes have ended with the chimpanzees killing the animals and tossing the corpses around [82]\n\n\nPets in

unknown [25] The Hindu Rigveda, composed between 2000 and 1500 BC and one of the four canonical texts of Hinduism, and the Avesta, the primary canon of texts of Zoroastrianism, refer to the Kabul River and to a settlement called Kubha [25] [26]\n\n\nAntiquity\nThe origin of Kabul, who built it and when, is largely unknown [25] The Hindu Rigveda, composed between 2000 and 1500 BC and one of the four canonical texts of Hinduism, and the Avesta, the primary canon of texts of Zoroastrianism, refer to the Kabul River and to a settlement called Kubha [25] [26]\n\n\nThe Jewish community\nJews had a presence in Afghanistan from ancient times until 2021 [42] There are records of religious correspondence establishing the presence of Jews in Kabul since the 8th century, though it is believed that they were present centuries or even millenia earlier [43] [44] The 12th century Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi wrote down his observations of a Jewish quarter in Kabul [45] In the early 19th century, Kabul and other major Afghan cities became sites of refuge for Jews fleeing persecution in neighboring Iran [46]\n\n\nIslamisation and Mongol invasion\nThe Islamic conquest reached modern-day Afghanistan in 642 AD, at a time when Kabul was independent [47] Until then, Kabul was considered politically and culturally part of the Indian world [48] A number of failed expeditions were made to Islamise the region In one of them, Abdur Rahman bin Samara arrived in Kabul from Zaranj in the late 600s and converted 12,000 inhabitants to Islam before abandoning the city Muslims were a minority until Ya'qub bin Laith as-Saffar of Zaranj conquered Kabul in 870 from the Hindu Shahis and established the first Islamic dynasty in the region It was reported that the rulers of Kabul were Muslims with non-Muslims living close by Iranian traveller and geographer Istakhri described it in 921:\n\n\nTimurid and Mughal era\nIn the 14th century, Kabul became a major trading centre under the kingdom of Timur (Tamerlane) In 1504, the city fell to Babur from the north and made into his headquarters, which became one of the principal cities of his later Mughal Empire In 1525, Babur described Kabulistan in his memoirs by writing that:\n\n\nDurrani and Barakzai dynasties\nNine years after Nader Shah and his forces invaded and occupied the city as part of the more easternmost parts of his Empire, he was assassinated by his own officers, causing its rapid disintegration Ahmad Shah Durrani, commander of 4,000 Abdali Afghans, asserted Pashtun rule in 1747 and further expanded his new Afghan Empire His ascension to power marked the beginning of Afghanistan By this time, Kabul had lost its status as a metropolitan city, and its population had decreased to 10,000 [58] Interest in the city was renewed when Ahmad Shah's son Timur Shah Durrani, after inheriting power, transferred the capital of the Durrani Empire from Kandahar to Kabul in 1776 [4] [53] Kabul experienced considerable urban development during the reigns of Timur Shah and his successor Zaman Shah; several religious and public buildings were constructed, and diverse groups of Sufis, jurists, and literary families were encouraged to settle the city through land grants and stipends [59] [53] Kabul's first visitor from Europe was Englishman George Forster, who described 18th-century Kabul as \"the best and cleanest city in Asia\" [60]\n\n\n20th century\nIn Kabul, an established bazaar city, leather and textile industries developed by 1916 [63] The majority of the population was concentrated on the south

Saur Revolution Pro-Soviet PDPA under Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power and slowly began to institute reforms [80] Private businesses were nationalised in the Soviet manner [81] Education was modified into the Soviet model, with lessons focusing on teaching Russian, Marxism–Leninism and learning of other countries belonging to the Soviet bloc [81]\n\n\n21st century\nIn November 2001, the Northern Alliance captured Kabul after the Taliban had abandoned the city following an American invasion A month later, a new government began to assemble under President Hamid Karzai A NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was deployed in Afghanistan and many expatriate Afghans returned to the country Kabul's population grew from about 500,000 in 2001 to over 3 million Foreign embassies re-opened In 2008, responsibility for security began to shift from NATO to Afghan forces [106] In 2001 rebuilding began [107] and many of the city's damaged landmarks were rebuilt or restored, including the Gardens of Babur in 2005, [108] the arch of Paghman, the Mahmoud Khan Bridge clock tower in 2013 [109] and the Taj Beg Palace in 2021 [110] Local community efforts repaired homes and dwellings [111]\n\n\nGeography\nKabul was situated in the eastern part of the country, 1,791 meters (5,876 feet) above sea level in a narrow valley, wedged between the Hindu Kush mountains along the Kabul River Immediately to the south of the old city are the ancient city walls and the Sher Darwaza mountain, with the Shuhadayi Salihin cemetery behind it A bit further east is the ancient Bala Hissar fortress with the Kol-e Hasmat Khan lake behind it.\n\n\nClimate\nKabul has a continental, cold semi-arid climate (BSk), with precipitation concentrated in the winter (almost exclusively falling as snow) and spring months Summers have very low humidity, providing some relief from the heat Autumns feature warm afternoons and sharply cooler evenings Winters are very cold by South Asian standards, with a subzero January daily average temperature of −2.3 °C (27.9 °F), mainly due to the high elevation of the city Spring is the wettest time of the year Sunny conditions dominate year-round, and the annual mean temperature is only 12.1 °C (53.8 °F), much lower than that of Afghanistan's other large cities.\n\n\nEnvironment\nThe Kabul River flows through the heart of the city, dividing the central bazaars There are several bridges (pul) crossing the river, the major ones being Pul-e Shah-Do Shamshira, Pul-e Bagh-e Omomi, Pul-e Khishti, and Pul-e Mahmoud Due to climate change, since the 21st century, the river runs dry most of the year, only filling up in the wetter winter and spring seasons [139]\n\n\nDistricts\nThe city of Kabul located within Kabul District, one of the 15 districts of Kabul Province As the provincial capital, it forms a municipality (shārwāli) which is further divided into 22 administrative districts called municipal districts or city districts (nāhia), which coincide with the official Police Districts (PD) [146] The number of city districts increased from 11 to 18 in 2005, and then to 22 by 2010 after the incorporation of Districts 14 and 19–22 which were annexed by Kabul Municipality from surrounding rural districts The city limits have thus substantially increased Due to demarcation disputes with the provincial administration, some of these new districts are more administered by the provincial districts than the municipality.\n\n\nDemographics\nKabul's population was estimated in 2023 at about 4.95 million [3] The city's population has long fluctuated due to the wars The lack of an up-to-date census means that there are various estimates of the population.\n\n\nSports\nCricket has historically been the dominant sport in Kabul, with two of three sports stadiums reserved for it [163]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe municipality's administrative structure consisted of 17 departments under a mayor Like other provincial municipalities in Afghanistan, the municipality of Kabul dealt with city affairs such as construction and infrastructure The city districts (nāhia) collected certain taxes and issued building licenses Each city district had a district head appointed by the mayor, and lead six major departments in the district office The neighbourhood organisation structure at the nahia level was called a gozar Kabul has been Divided in to 630 Gozars A wakil-e gozar was a person chosen to represent a community within a city district.\n\n\nEconomy and infrastructure\nKabul's main products included fresh and dried fruit, nuts, beverages, Afghan rugs, leather and sheep skin products, furniture, antique replicas, and domestic clothes The World Bank authorised US$25 million for the Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project which closed in 2011 [164] Over the last decade, the United States has invested approximately $9.1 billion into urban infrastructure in Afghanistan [165] [166] The wars since 1978 have limited the city's economic productivity but after the establishment of the Karzai administration since late 2001, local economic developments have included a number of indoor shopping malls The first of these was the Kabul City Center, opened 2005 Others have also opened in recent years including Gulbahar Center, City Walk Mall and Majid Mall [167]\n\n\nDevelopment planning\nA US$1 billion contract was signed in 2013 to commence work on the \"Kabul New City\" (sometimes reported as \"New Kabul City\"), which is a major residential scheme that would accommodate 1.5 million people [175] [176] [177] [178] Construction was delayed due to instability in the region, but construction broke ground in August 2023 after a new contract was signed between the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing and Khawar Company The new agreement is expected to modernize the city, address overpopulation, and incentivize the return of expatriates by adding housing to accommodate 3 million people and modern amenities [179] [180] [181] The construction is planned to occur in two phases over the span of about 30 years.\n\n\nCommunications\nAs of November 2015, there were more than 24 television stations based out of Kabul [184] Terrestrial TV transmitters were located at the summit of the Koh-e Asamai.\n\n\nHotels and other lodging\nKabul has many hotels for domestic and foreign travelers Guest houses are also found in the city The better and safer ones are located in the Shahr-e Naw and Wazir Akbar Khan neighbourhoods (the Green Zone) The following are some of the hotels in Kabul (in alphabetical order).\n\n\nCulture and landmarks\nThe old part of Kabul was filled with bazaars nestled along its narrow, crooked streets, examples being the Mandawi and the Bird Market (Ka Foroshi) Cultural sites included: the National Museum of Afghanistan, notably displaying an impressive statue of Surya excavated at Khair Khana, the ruined Darul Aman Palace, the tomb of Mughal Emperor Babur at Bagh-e Babur, and Chihil Sutun Park, the Minar-i-Istiqlal (Column of Independence) built in 1919 after the Third Afghan War, the tomb of Timur Shah Durrani, the Bagh-e

also the Kolola Pushta fort, which was garrisoned by the Afghan Army, and the nearby 19th-century Shahrara Tower fort, which was ruined in 1928 The Koh-e Asamai mountain had a temple that was considered important to Hinduism.\n\n\nArchitecture\nKabul's various architectural designs reflected the various links it has had with empires and civilisations, particularly being on the ancient trade route connecting India and China with Persia and the West [188]\n\n\nTransportation\nKabul has no train service [67]\n\n\nAir\nKabul International Airport is located 25 km (16 mi) from the

of Afghanistan. It is situated in the eastern part of the country, 1,791 meters (5,876 feet) above sea level in a narrow valley, wedged between the Hindu Kush mountains along the Kabul River.\n\n**Toponymy and Etymology**\n\nThe origin of Kabul's name is not well-documented. Several theories exist, including that it may be derived from the ancient Persian word \"kabul,\" meaning \"place of strength\" or \"fortress.\" Another theory suggests that the name may be derived from the Pashto word \"kabul,\" meaning \"abundance\" or \"plenty.\"\n\n**History**\n\nThe origin of Kabul is largely unknown, but it is believed to have been inhabited since ancient times. The Hindu Rigveda, composed between 2000 and 1500 BC, and the Avesta, the primary canon of texts of Zoroastrianism, refer to the Kabul River and to a settlement called Kubha.\n\n**Antiquity**\n\nThe Hindu Shahis, a dynasty of Hindu rulers from India, conquered Kabul in the 7th century AD. However, their rule was short-lived, and the city was eventually conquered by the Islamic Empire in the 8th century AD.\n\n**The Jewish Community**\n\nJews had a presence in Afghanistan from ancient times until 2021. There are records of religious correspondence establishing the presence of Jews in Kabul since the 8th century, although it is believed that they were present centuries or even millennia earlier. The 12th-century Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi wrote down his observations of a Jewish quarter in Kabul. In the early 19th century, Kabul and other major Afghan cities became sites of refuge for Jews fleeing persecution in neighboring Iran.\n\n**Islamisation and Mongol Invasion**\n\nThe Islamic conquest reached modern-day Afghanistan in 642 AD, at a time when Kabul was independent. Until then, Kabul was considered politically and culturally part of the Indian world. A number of failed expeditions were made to Islamize the region. One of them, led by Abdur Rahman bin Samara, arrived in Kabul from Zaranj in the late 600s and converted 12,000 inhabitants to Islam before abandoning the city. Muslims were a minority until Ya'qub bin Laith as-Saffar of Zaranj conquered Kabul in 870 from the Hindu Shahis and established the first Islamic dynasty in the region.\n\n**Timurid and Mughal Era**\n\nIn the 14th century, Kabul became a major trading center under the kingdom of Timur (Tamerlane). In 1504, the city fell to Babur from the north and made into his headquarters, which became one of the principal cities of his later Mughal Empire. In 1525, Babur described Kabulistan in his memoirs by writing that \"the city of Kabul was a place of great beauty and charm, with gardens and palaces that were the envy of the world.\"\n\n**Durrani and Barakzai Dynasties**\n\nNine years after Nader Shah and his forces invaded and occupied the city as part of the more easternmost parts of his Empire, he was assassinated by his own officers, causing its rapid disintegration. Ahmad Shah Durrani, commander of 4,000 Abdali Afghans, asserted Pashtun rule in 1747 and further expanded his new Afghan Empire. His ascension to power marked the beginning of Afghanistan. By this time, Kabul had lost its status as a metropolitan city, and its population had decreased to 10,000. Interest in the city was renewed when Ahmad Shah's son Timur Shah Durrani, after inheriting power, transferred the capital of the Durrani Empire from Kandahar to Kabul in 1776.\n\n**20th Century**\n\nIn Kabul, an established bazaar city, leather and textile industries developed by 1916. The majority of the population was concentrated on the south side of the river. The city experienced significant growth and development during the 20th century, with the establishment of the Afghan government and the introduction of modern infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and electricity.\n\n**Occupations, Wars, and Taliban Rule (1996-2001)**\n\nOn 28 April 1978, President Daoud and most of his family were assassinated in Kabul's Presidential Palace in what is called the Saur Revolution. Pro-Soviet PDPA under Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power and slowly began to institute reforms. Private businesses were nationalized in the Soviet manner. Education was modified into the Soviet model, with lessons focusing on teaching Russian, Marxism-Leninism, and learning of other countries belonging to the Soviet bloc.\n\n**21st Century**\n\nIn November 2001, the Northern Alliance captured Kabul after the Taliban had abandoned the city following an American invasion. A month later, a new government began to assemble under President Hamid Karzai. A NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was deployed in Afghanistan, and many expatriate Afghans returned to the country. Kabul's population grew from about 500,000 in 2001 to over 3 million. Foreign embassies re-opened. In 2008, responsibility for security began to shift from NATO to Afghan forces. In 2001, rebuilding began, and many of the city's damaged landmarks were rebuilt or restored, including the Gardens of Babur in 2005, the arch of Paghman, the Mahmoud Khan Bridge clock tower in 2013, and the Taj Beg Palace in 2021.\n\n**Geography**\n\nKabul is situated in the eastern part of the country, 1,791 meters (5,876 feet) above sea level in a narrow valley, wedged between the Hindu Kush mountains along the Kabul River.

administration, some of these new districts are more administered by the provincial districts than the municipality.\n\n\nDemographics\nKabul's population was estimated in 2023 at about 4.95 million [3] The city's population has long fluctuated due to the wars The lack of an up-to-date census means that there are various estimates of the population.\n\n\nSports\nCricket has historically been the dominant sport in Kabul, with two of three sports stadiums reserved for it [163]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe municipality's administrative structure consisted of 17 departments under a mayor Like other provincial municipalities in Afghanistan, the municipality of Kabul dealt with city affairs such as construction and infrastructure The city districts (nāhia) collected certain taxes and issued building licenses Each city district had a district head appointed by the mayor, and lead six major departments in the district office The neighbourhood organisation structure at the nahia level was called a gozar Kabul has been Divided in to 630 Gozars A wakil-e gozar was a person chosen to represent a community within a city district.\n\n\nEconomy and infrastructure\nKabul's main products included fresh and dried fruit, nuts, beverages, Afghan rugs, leather and sheep skin products, furniture, antique replicas, and domestic clothes The World Bank authorised US$25 million for the Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project which closed in 2011 [164] Over the last decade, the United States has invested approximately $9.1 billion into urban infrastructure in Afghanistan [165] [166] The wars since 1978 have limited the city's economic productivity but after the establishment of the Karzai administration since late 2001, local economic developments have included a number of indoor shopping malls The first of these was the Kabul City Center, opened 2005 Others have also opened in recent years including Gulbahar Center, City Walk Mall and Majid Mall [167]\n\n\nDevelopment planning\nA US$1 billion contract was signed in 2013 to commence work on the \"Kabul New City\" (sometimes reported as \"New Kabul City\"), which is a major residential scheme that would accommodate 1.5 million people [175] [176] [177] [178] Construction was delayed due to instability in the region, but construction broke ground in August 2023 after a new contract was signed between the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing and Khawar Company The new agreement is expected to modernize the city, address overpopulation, and incentivize the return of expatriates by adding housing to accommodate 3 million people and modern amenities [179] [180] [181] The construction is planned to occur in two phases over the span of about 30 years.\n\n\nCommunications\nAs of November 2015, there were more than 24 television stations based out of Kabul [184] Terrestrial TV transmitters were located at the summit of the Koh-e Asamai.\n\n\nHotels and other lodging\nKabul has many hotels for domestic and foreign travelers Guest houses are also found in the city The better and safer ones are located in the Shahr-e Naw and Wazir Akbar Khan neighbourhoods (the Green Zone) The following are some of the hotels in Kabul (in alphabetical order).\n\n\nCulture and landmarks\nThe old part of Kabul was filled with bazaars nestled along its narrow, crooked streets, examples being the Mandawi and the Bird Market (Ka Foroshi) Cultural sites included: the National Museum of Afghanistan, notably displaying an impressive statue of Surya excavated at Khair Khana, the ruined Darul Aman Palace, the tomb of Mughal Emperor Babur at Bagh-e Babur, and Chihil Sutun Park, the Minar-i-Istiqlal (Column of Independence) built in 1919 after the Third Afghan War, the tomb of Timur Shah Durrani, the Bagh-e Bala Palace and the imposing Id Gah Mosque (founded 1893) Bala Hissar was a fort which was partially destroyed during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, [62] then restored as a military college There was also the Kolola Pushta fort, which was garrisoned by the Afghan Army, and the nearby 19th-century Shahrara Tower fort, which was ruined in 1928 The Koh-e Asamai mountain had a temple that was considered important to Hinduism.\n\n\nArchitecture\nKabul's various architectural designs reflected the various links it has had with empires and civilisations, particularly being on the ancient trade route connecting India and China with Persia and the West [188]\n\n\nTransportation\nKabul has no train service [67]\n\n\nAir\nKabul International Airport is located 25 km (16 mi) from the centre of Kabul It is a hub to Ariana Afghan Airlines, the national carrier of Afghanistan, as well as private airlines such as Afghan Jet International, East Horizon Airlines, Kam Air, Pamir Airways, and Safi Airways Regional airlines such as Air India, SpiceJet, flydubai, Emirates, Gulf Air, Mahan Air, Pakistan International Airlines, Turkish Airlines and others also had regularly scheduled flights to the airport.\n\n\nRoad\nThe AH76 highway (or Kabul-Charikar Highway) connected Kabul north towards Charikar, Pol-e Khomri and Mazar-i-Sharif (310 km (190 mi) away), with leading roads to Kunduz (250 km (160 mi) away) The AH77 highway went west towards Bamiyan Province (150 km (93 mi) away) and Chaghcharan in the central mountains of Afghanistan To the south-west, the Kabul-Ghazni Highway went to Ghazni (130 km (81 mi) away) and Kandahar (460 km (290 mi) away) To the south, the Kabul-Gardez Highway connected it to Gardez (100 km (62 mi) away) and Khost To the east, the Kabul-Jalalabad Highway went to Jalalabad (120 km (75 mi) away) and across the border to Peshawar.\n\n\nPublic transport\nThe taxicabs in Kabul were painted in a white and yellow livery The majority of these were older model Toyota Corollas A few Soviet-era Russian cabs were also still in operation.\n\n\nInternet-based participatory planning\nIn 2019, the Nagoya Institute of Technology, in partnership with the Kabul city Municipality, jointly agreed to deploy a digital platform, called D-Agree in urban planning to provide support for stakeholders to promote meaningful public participation and help reach consensus in Kabul city planning process [211]\n\n\nEducation\nThe Ministry of Education led by Ghulam Farooq Wardak was responsible for the education system in Afghanistan [222] Public and private schools in the city have reopened since 2002 after they were shut down or destroyed during fighting in the 1980s to the late 1990s Boys and girls were strongly encouraged to attend school under the Karzai administration but many more schools were needed not only in Kabul but throughout the country The Afghan Ministry of Education had plans to build more schools in the coming years so that education was provided to all citizens of the country High schools in Kabul included:\n\n\nUniversities\nUniversities included:\n\n\nHealth care\nHealth care in

general framework to structure and guide the implementation of its human rights responsibilities and commitment, published in 2017, and that Qatar had implemented those recommendations [22] After a thorough investigation, the International Labour Organization, claimed the figures \"misleading\" and said they had been wrongly linked to World Cup sites without proper context in November 2022 via reported drafted by France24 Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri said Qatar already has started a Workers' Support and Insurance Fund to help workers which successfully reimbursed US$320 million this year alone to  victims through the Insurance Fund stated the ILO in November 2022 Furthermore, according to a statement by ITUC (International Trade Union Confederation) General Secretary Sharan Burrow, who had previously been a harsh critic of Qatar's labour laws, workers can now obtain justice in the country She praised \"the amazing change of the labour legislation in Qatar In an article, which was published in September 2020, experts from the OHCHR (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights) added, \"We are very encouraged by the bold steps Qatar is taking to increase the protection of migrant workers' rights and ensure adequate living and working conditions for all.\" [23]\n\n\nLGBT issues\nBecause of Islamic sharia law, there are no LGBT rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBT rights criminalised As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with several topics becoming the subject of controversy The security of fans, [24] as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion [25]\n\n\nPre-tournament\nEach stadium in Qatar requires 10,000 litres of water per day in winter months, when the tournament is taking place, to maintain the pitch With little access to freshwater in the nation, the sourced water was saltwater, which has to be desalinated The process damages the marine environment Desalination plants in the Middle East also heavily rely on the use of fossil fuels As well as the pitches at the stadiums, the organising committee grew and maintained a large farm of match-suitable fresh grass outside Doha, in case of turf damage The need for so much desalination, and the oil and gas used to power the plants, have been criticised [31]\n\n\nStadiums\nEach stadium in Qatar requires 10,000 litres of water per day in winter months, when the tournament is taking place, to maintain the pitch

maintained a large farm of match-suitable fresh grass outside Doha, in case of turf damage The need for so much desalination, and the oil and gas used to power the plants, have been criticised [31]\n\n\nCorruption\nThere have been allegations of bribery or corruption in the Qatar's 2022 World Cup selection process involving members of FIFA's executive committee There have been numerous allegations of bribery between the Qatar bid committee and FIFA members and executives, some of whom—including Theo Zwanziger and Sepp Blatter—were later recorded regretting awarding Qatar the tournament [33] [34] [35] [36]\n\n\n2011\nIn May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup being held in Qatar According to then vice-president Jack Warner, an email has been publicised about the possibility that Qatar 'bought' the 2022 World Cup through bribery via Mohammed bin Hammam who was president of the Asian Football Confederation at the time Qatar's officials in the bid team for 2022 have denied any wrongdoing [37] A whistleblower, revealed to be Phaedra Almajid, alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5m by Qatar [38] She later retracted her claims of bribery, stating she had fabricated them in order to exact revenge on the Qatari bid team for relieving her of her job with them She also denied being put under any pressure to make her retraction FIFA confirmed receiving an email from her which stated her retraction [39] [40]\n\n\n2014–15\nIn March 2014, it was alleged that a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign paid committee member Jack Warner and his family almost $2 million The Daily Telegraph reported that it understands that the U.S FBI is investigating Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid [41]\n\n\nFIFA ethics investigation report\nIn 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar, the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup respectively Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids and spoke to all persons connected to the bids and appealed for witnesses to come forward with evidence [46] At the end of investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report in September 2015 FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge Hans Joachim Eckert who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations stating that Qatar \"pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways\" but did not \"compromise the integrity\" of the overall bid process [47]\n\n\n2020\nIn January, Bonita Mersiades, a whistle-blower from inside Australia's 2022 World Cup bid published a book which alleges that in the months before the vote in December 2010, FIFA executives were privately worried that a Qatar win would leave a financial shortfall for the governing body in 2022 which Al Jazeera (now beIN Sports) agreed a secret deal to pay $100 million if Qatar won the vote According to the book, the deal took place with the involvement and knowledge of Jérôme Valcke, secretary general of FIFA at the time who was later banned for nine years from football for corruption The Mail on Sunday asked beIN Sports about the allegations, in which a spokesman characterised the bonus as \"production contributions\" which were \"standard market practice and are often imposed upon broadcasters by sports federations and sports rights holders\" [49]\n\n\nScheduling\nThe notion of staging the tournament in winter proved controversial; Blatter ruled out a January or February event because it may clash with the 2022 Winter Olympics, [55] while others expressed concerns over a November or December event, because it might clash with the Christmas season (even though Qatar is predominantly Muslim, the players in the tournament are predominantly Christian) [56] The Premier League voiced concern over moving the tournament to the northern hemisphere's winter as it could interfere with the local leagues FA Chairman Greg Dyke said, shortly after he took his job in 2013, that he was open to either a winter tournament or moving the tournament to another country [57] FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar's desert state was a \"blatant mistake\", and that any potential shift to a winter event would be unmanageable due to the effect on major European domestic leagues [33]\n\n\nClimate\nAs the World Cup usually occurs during the northern hemisphere's summer, the weather in Qatar was a concern with temperatures reaching more than 50 °C (122 °F) Two doctors from Qatar's Aspetar sports hospital in Doha who gave an interview in November 2010 to Qatar Today magazine said the climate would be an issue, stating that the region's climate would \"affect performance levels from a health point of view\" of professional athletes, specifically footballers, that \"recovery times between games would be longer\" than in a temperate climate and that, on the field of play, \"more mistakes would be made\" One of the doctors said that \"total acclimation (to the Qatari climate) is impossible\" [73]\n\n\nCost\nBy some estimates, the World Cup is set to cost Qatar approximately US$220 billion (£184 billion) This is about 60 times the $3.5 billion that South Africa spent on the 2010 FIFA World Cup [74] Nicola Ritter, a German legal and financial analyst, told an investors' summit held in Munich that £107 billion would be spent on stadiums and facilities plus a further £31 billion on transport infrastructure Ritter said £30 billion would be spent on building air-conditioned stadiums with £48 billion on training facilities and accommodation for players and fans A further £28 billion will be spent on creating a new city called Lusail that will surround the stadium that will host the opening and final matches of the tournament [75]\n\n\nPossible Israeli qualification\nThe head of the Qatar bid delegation stated that if Israel were to qualify, they would be able to compete in the World Cup despite Qatar not recognising the state of Israel [80] [81] [82] Israel ultimately were eliminated during FIFA World Cup qualification, and thus did not compete at the tournament in Qatar.\n\n\nRussia's participation following its invasion of Ukraine\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, FIFA stated that matches would not be held in Russia, though Russia would still be able to continue its participation in World Cup qualifying, where it had reached Path B Also in Path B were Poland, the Czech Republic and Sweden, all of which refused to play against Russia in any form (as did England, which had already qualified for the tournament) [83]\n\n\nQatari football record\nAt the time of being awarded the tournament in 2010, Qatar was ranked 113 in the world, [90] and had never qualified for the World Cup before The most prestigious accolade the team had won was the Arabian Gulf Cup twice, both times hosting Since being awarded the tournament, they have also won the Arabian Gulf Cup for a third time in 2014 and the AFC Asian Cup in 2019 Qatar became the smallest country by land area to host the World Cup (less than half the size of 1954 hosts Switzerland, when the tournament consisted of 16 teams) These facts led some to question the strength of football culture in Qatar and if that made them unsuitable World Cup hosts.\n\n\nAlcohol\nHassan Abdulla al Thawadi, chief executive of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, said the Muslim state would also permit alcohol consumption during the event [99] [80] Specific fan-zones would be established where alcohol could be bought [100] [81] [101] Although expatriates may purchase alcohol and certain businesses may sell alcohol with a permit, drinking in public is not permitted as Qatar's legal system is based on Sharia [102]\n\n\nNovember 2022 Infantino communications\nOn 5 November 2022, Gianni Infantino and Fatma Samoura sent out a letter to all participating nations telling them to cease and avoid any further or current discussion of Qatar's poor human rights records to \"respect all opinions and beliefs, without handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world\" and to \"focus on the football\" as to \"not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists\" Notably, members of the UEFA Working Group such as Australia, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States were specifically targeted for their involvement in trying to improve the conditions for migrant workers, women, and LGBT people All of the nations criticised the letter, stating \"FIFA acknowledged in their letter that football does not operate in a vacuum, however they seem to be calling for that to be the case History has shown us that the pursuit of such a strategy will be self-defeating and only further erodes football's social license to operate.\" [110]\n\n\n\"Focus on the football\" letter\nOn 5 November 2022, Gianni Infantino and Fatma Samoura sent out a letter to all participating nations telling them to cease and avoid any further or

that the pursuit of such a strategy will be self-defeating and only further erodes football's social license to operate.\" [110]\n\n\n\"Today I feel\" address\nOn 19 November 2022, Infantino gave an hour-long address to the media during a pre-tournament press conference, during which he defended FIFA's hosting of the tournament in Qatar, and commented upon pre-tournament developments such as the banning of alcohol [111] He opened by declaring that he \"felt\" Qatari, Arabic, African, gay, disabled, and like a migrant worker, because he understood how it felt to be discriminated [111] He argued that criticism of the treatment of migrant workers by Western critics was hypocritical because \"for what we Europeans have been doing for 3,000 years around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people\" Infantino argued that none of the European companies \"who earn millions and millions from Qatar or other countries in the

[The beds] are rock hard so you might as well sleep on the floor.\" [176] However, article published by CNN during the World Cup claimed that the supporters who were on a budget and were unable to afford what's on offer from hotels, eight fan villages provide “casual camping and cabin-style” options “There are so many cabins and containers and there's a big screen that we can all watch the games together.” Fei Peng, from China, who was there to watch over 30 World Cup games, told CNN Sport [177]\n\n\nProvisions inside stadium\nThough not connected to any protest against Iran, the official Wales brass band had their instruments confiscated before the Group B Wales vs Iran match The brass band had been allowed to play at the previous Wales match (against the United States) and FIFA officially supported their attendance at the tournament [179]\n\n\nBrass band instrument confiscation\nThough not connected to any protest against Iran, the official Wales brass band had their instruments confiscated before the Group B Wales vs Iran match The brass band had been allowed to play at the previous Wales match (against the United States) and FIFA officially supported their attendance at the tournament [179]\n\n\nTicketing\nMany England supporters missed the start of the Group B England vs Iran match due to problems with FIFA's ticketing app [180] That day also, the FIFA app caused tickets belonging to fans of the United States team to disappear [181] [182]\n\n\nMedia incidents\nPrior to the tournament, there were several reported incidents of altercations between broadcasters and Qatari security officials Rasmus Tantholdt of Denmark's TV 2 was interrupted by a group of security guards during a live broadcast from the Katara Cultural Village, who threatened him and attempted to break their camera Tantholdt responded to the group, saying \"You have invited the whole world here Why can't we film?

anyone involved in Qatar 2022 The Daily Telegraph reported on emails showing efforts to arrange a meeting between Al Thawadi and BBC hosts and pundits ahead of the World Cup draw in April A BBC spokesperson denied Al Thawadi's claims and said they had a duty to cover legitimate issues related to the World Cup without fear or favour [217] Lineker would go on to end his commentary of the tournament by stating that the United States, one of the co-hosts of the following World Cup, is “extraordinarily racist” in an attempt to show that he was willing to criticise any host country and

Some fans reported that their tickets had disappeared from the app.\n\n**Media Incidents**\n\nThere were several incidents involving media interference, including a journalist being interrupted by security guards during a live broadcast.\n\n**Security Interference**\n\nSecurity guards attempted to break the camera of a Danish TV2 crew during a live broadcast from the Katara Cultural Village.\n\n**Grant Wahl's Death**\n\nAmerican soccer journalist Grant Wahl collapsed and died while covering the Netherlands vs Argentina match on 10 December 2022.\n\n**Chinese Censorship**\n\nCCTV, the state broadcaster of mainland China, censored footage of maskless audiences during the tournament, replacing it with close-ups of coaches, officials, or players.\n\n**Algerian Censorship**\n\nState-run TV2 of Algeria avoided coverage of the Group F Belgium vs Morocco match and Morocco's subsequent win, due to tensions between Algeria and Morocco.\n\n**Western Media Coverage Perceived as Racist**\n\nMiddle East Eye accused several Western media publications of being racist, including the French satirical newspaper Le Canard enchaîné and the German television network Welt.\n\n**BBC Controversies**\n\nHassan Al Thawadi, the head of the Qatar World Cup, accused the BBC of being \"extremely racist\" and charged Gary Lineker with not engaging with the organizers before criticizing them directly.\n\n**Israeli Media**\n\nIsraeli journalists tried to interview Arab people but were ignored and walked away once their nationality became known.\n\n**Boycotts**\n\nTromsø IL of Norway released a statement calling for a boycott of the 2022 World Cup due to reports of \"modern-day slavery\" and the \"alarming number of deaths\" among other concerns.\n\n**Match Incidents**\n\nThere were several incidents during matches, including pitch invasions, xenophobic chants, and fan disturbances.\n\n**Post-Match Incidents**\n\nThere were several incidents after matches, including a flag showing Kosovo as being part of Serbia being displayed in the Serbian locker room and a riot in the Belgian city of Brussels following the Group F Belgium vs Morocco match.\n\n**Moroccan Riots**\n\nFollowing the Group F Belgium vs Morocco match, Moroccan fans rioted in several cities in Belgium and the Netherlands, resulting in the detention of at least 12 people and the injury of two police officers.\n\n**Uruguayans After Ghana Game**\n\nSeveral Uruguayan players confronted the referee and other FIFA officials after the Group H Ghana vs Uruguay match, with one player pushing over the VAR monitor.\n\n**Samuel Eto'o Assault**\n\nFormer Cameroon international and Barcelona player Samuel Eto'o assaulted a man outside Stadium 974 after the Group G Cameroon vs Brazil match.\n\n**Argentina–France Final**\n\nQatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani presented an Arab cloak, a bisht, to Lionel Messi after Argentina's win in the final, which was criticized by some as being inappropriate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar was marred by numerous controversies, both on and off the pitch.

Rights) added, \"We are very encouraged by the bold steps Qatar is taking to increase the protection of migrant workers' rights and ensure adequate living and working conditions for all.\" [23]\n\n\nLGBT issues\nBecause of Islamic sharia law, there are no LGBT rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBT rights criminalised As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with several topics becoming the subject of controversy The security of fans, [24] as well as the homophobic

process involving members of FIFA's executive committee There have been numerous allegations of bribery between the Qatar bid committee and FIFA members and executives, some of whom—including Theo Zwanziger and Sepp Blatter—were later recorded regretting awarding Qatar the tournament [33] [34] [35] [36]\n\n\n2011\nIn May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup being held in Qatar According to then vice-president Jack Warner, an email has been publicised about the possibility that Qatar 'bought' the 2022 World Cup through bribery via Mohammed bin Hammam who was president of the Asian Football Confederation at the time Qatar's officials in the bid team for 2022 have denied any wrongdoing [37] A whistleblower, revealed to be Phaedra Almajid, alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5m by Qatar [38] She later retracted her claims of bribery, stating she had fabricated them in order to exact revenge on the Qatari bid team for relieving her of her job with them She also denied being put under any pressure to make her retraction FIFA confirmed receiving an email from her which stated her retraction [39] [40]\n\n\n2014–15\nIn March 2014, it was alleged that a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign paid committee member Jack Warner and his family almost $2 million The Daily Telegraph reported that it understands that the U.S FBI is investigating Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid [41]\n\n\nFIFA ethics investigation report\nIn 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar, the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup respectively Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids and spoke to all persons connected to the bids and appealed for witnesses to come forward with evidence [46] At the end of investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report in September 2015 FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge Hans Joachim Eckert who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations stating that Qatar \"pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways\" but did not \"compromise the integrity\" of the overall bid process [47]\n\n\n2020\nIn January, Bonita Mersiades, a whistle-blower from inside Australia's 2022 World Cup bid published a book which alleges that in the months before the vote in December 2010, FIFA executives were privately worried that a Qatar win would leave a financial shortfall for the governing body in 2022 which Al Jazeera (now beIN Sports) agreed a secret deal to pay $100 million if Qatar won the vote According to the book, the deal took place with the involvement and knowledge of Jérôme Valcke, secretary general of FIFA at the time who was later banned for nine years from football for corruption The Mail on Sunday asked beIN Sports about the allegations, in which a spokesman characterised the bonus as \"production contributions\" which were \"standard market practice and are often imposed upon broadcasters by sports federations and sports rights holders\" [49]\n\n\nScheduling\nThe notion of staging the tournament in winter proved controversial; Blatter ruled out a January or February event because it may clash with the 2022 Winter Olympics, [55] while others expressed concerns over a November or December event, because it might clash with the Christmas season (even though Qatar is predominantly Muslim, the players in the tournament are predominantly Christian) [56] The Premier League voiced concern over moving the tournament to the northern hemisphere's winter as it could interfere with the local leagues FA Chairman Greg Dyke said, shortly after he took his job in 2013, that he was open to either a winter tournament or moving the tournament to another country [57] FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar's desert state was a \"blatant mistake\", and that any potential shift to a winter event would be unmanageable due to the effect on major European domestic leagues [33]\n\n\nClimate\nAs the World Cup usually occurs during the northern hemisphere's summer, the weather in Qatar was a concern with temperatures reaching more than 50 °C (122 °F) Two doctors from Qatar's Aspetar sports hospital in Doha who gave an interview in November 2010 to Qatar Today magazine said the climate would be an issue, stating that the region's climate would \"affect performance levels from a health point of view\" of professional athletes, specifically footballers, that \"recovery times between games would be longer\" than in a temperate climate and that, on the field of play, \"more mistakes would be made\" One of the doctors said that \"total acclimation (to the Qatari climate) is impossible\" [73]\n\n\nCost\nBy some estimates, the World Cup is set to cost Qatar approximately US$220 billion (£184 billion) This is about 60 times the $3.5 billion that South Africa spent on the 2010 FIFA World Cup [74] Nicola Ritter, a German legal and financial analyst, told an investors' summit held in Munich that £107 billion would be spent on stadiums and facilities plus a further £31 billion on transport infrastructure Ritter said £30 billion would be spent on building air-conditioned stadiums with £48 billion on training facilities and accommodation for players and fans A further £28 billion will be spent on creating a new city called Lusail that will surround the stadium that will host the opening and final matches of the tournament [75]\n\n\nPossible Israeli qualification\nThe head of the Qatar bid delegation stated that if Israel were to qualify, they would be able to compete in the World Cup despite Qatar not recognising the state of Israel [80] [81] [82] Israel ultimately were eliminated during FIFA World Cup qualification, and thus did not compete at the tournament in Qatar.\n\n\nRussia's participation following its invasion of Ukraine\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, FIFA stated that matches would not be held in Russia, though Russia would still be able to continue its participation in World Cup qualifying, where it had reached Path B Also in Path B were Poland, the Czech Republic and Sweden, all of which refused to play against Russia in any form (as did England, which had already qualified for the tournament) [83]\n\n\nQatari football record\nAt the time of being awarded the tournament in 2010, Qatar was ranked 113 in the world, [90] and had never qualified for the World Cup before The most prestigious accolade the team had won was the Arabian Gulf Cup twice, both times hosting Since being awarded the tournament, they have also won the Arabian Gulf Cup for a third time in 2014 and the AFC Asian Cup in 2019 Qatar became the smallest country by land area to host the World Cup (less than half the size of 1954 hosts Switzerland, when the tournament consisted of 16 teams) These facts led some to question the strength of football culture in Qatar and if that made them unsuitable World Cup hosts.\n\n\nAlcohol\nHassan Abdulla al Thawadi, chief executive of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, said the Muslim state would also permit alcohol consumption during the event [99] [80] Specific fan-zones would be established where alcohol could be bought [100] [81] [101] Although expatriates may purchase alcohol and certain businesses may sell alcohol with a permit, drinking in public is not permitted as Qatar's legal system is based on Sharia [102]\n\n\nNovember 2022 Infantino communications\nOn 5 November 2022, Gianni Infantino and Fatma Samoura sent out a letter to all participating nations telling them to cease and avoid any further or current discussion of Qatar's poor human rights records to \"respect all opinions and beliefs, without handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world\" and to \"focus on the football\" as to \"not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists\" Notably, members of the UEFA Working Group such as Australia, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States were specifically targeted for their involvement in trying to improve the conditions for migrant workers, women, and LGBT people All of the nations criticised the letter, stating \"FIFA acknowledged in their letter that football does not operate in a vacuum, however they seem to be calling for that to be the case History has shown us that the pursuit of such a strategy will be self-defeating and only further erodes football's social license to operate.\" [110]\n\n\n\"Focus on the football\" letter\nOn 5 November 2022, Gianni Infantino and Fatma Samoura sent out a letter to all participating nations telling them to cease and avoid any further or current discussion of Qatar's poor human rights records to \"respect all opinions and beliefs, without handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world\" and to \"focus on the football\" as to \"not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists\" Notably, members of the UEFA Working Group such as Australia, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States were specifically targeted for their involvement

a vacuum, however they seem to be calling for that to be the case History has shown us that the pursuit of such a strategy will be self-defeating and only further erodes football's social license to operate.\" [110]\n\n\n\"Today I feel\" address\nOn 19 November 2022, Infantino gave an hour-long address to the media during a pre-tournament press conference, during which he defended FIFA's hosting of the tournament in Qatar, and commented upon pre-tournament developments such as the banning of alcohol [111] He opened by declaring that he \"felt\" Qatari, Arabic, African, gay, disabled, and like a migrant worker, because he understood how it felt to be discriminated [111] He argued that criticism of the treatment of migrant workers by Western critics was hypocritical because \"for what we Europeans have been doing for 3,000 years around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people\" Infantino argued that none of the European companies \"who earn millions and millions from Qatar or other countries in the region\" had taken steps to address the rights of migrant workers like FIFA had, and suggested that Europe needed to be more open to accepting refugees and migrant workers [112] [19] He asked, \"do we want to continue to spit on the others because they look different, or they feel different? We defend human rights We do it our way We obtain results We got women fans in Iran The Women's League was created in Sudan Let's celebrate Don't divide.\" [111] [112] [19] In response to a last-minute prohibition on the sale of alcohol inside the stadiums, Infantino stated that it was a decision made jointly by FIFA and the organising committee, but argued that FIFA was still in \"200% control\" of the event, prohibitions on the sale of alcohol at sporting events were not exclusive to Qatar, and joked that \"if this is the biggest issue we have for the World Cup then I will resign immediately and go to the beach to relax\" [112] [19] He once again argued that people should \"focus on the football\", and direct their criticism to FIFA and \"me if you want\" instead of Qatar [113]\n\n\nOpening ceremony and anthem\nIn the weeks before the tournament began, singers Dua Lipa and Shakira announced that they had refused to perform at the opening ceremony and collaborate on the tournament anthem due to human rights violations implemented by the Emirate's internal policies [116] British singer Rod Stewart said he turned down a substantial offer to perform in the country: \"They offered me a lot of money, more than a million dollars, to perform there  [in Qatar] I turned it down It's not right to go there.\" [117] In addition, the league's ambassador, David Beckham, was criticized by the LGBT community in the United Kingdom for lending his face to the event in exchange for $10 million Discussing Beckham's involvement, former Spice Girls member Melanie C said that it is \"complex\" for sports to change culture when so much money is involved [118]  British singer Robbie Williams defended his choice to participate as a guest at the opening event, stating: \"I don't condone any abuses of human rights anywhere But, that being said, if we're not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, then it would be the shortest tour the world has ever known  [...] You get this microscope that goes 'okay, these are the baddies, and we need to rally against them'.. I think that the hypocrisy there is that if we take that case in this place, we need to apply that unilaterally to the world Then if we apply that unilaterally to the world, nobody can go anywhere\" [119] [120]\n\n\nIranian protests\nIn October 2022, calls were made to ban the Iranian national team from the World Cup for the Iranian government's blocking of Iranian women from their stadiums, their supplying of weapons to Russia during the invasion of Ukraine, and the treatment towards protesters during the Mahsa Amini protests [128] [129] [130]\n\n\nTreatment of fans\nIt was reported that Qatar went back on its word to provide cooked kosher food and public Jewish prayer services at the 2022 World Cup, banning both activities Qatar alleged that they could not \"secure\" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar [159]\n\n\nJewish and Israeli fans\nIt was reported that Qatar went back on its word to provide cooked kosher food and public Jewish prayer services at the 2022 World Cup, banning both activities Qatar alleged that they could not \"secure\" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar [159]\n\n\nPaid fans\nIn 2020, Qatar began a fan engagement program promising to pay air travel, entrance tickets to matches, housing and even spending money for groups of fans from all competing nations However, fans who are handpicked by the Qatari government are required to sing and chant when asked to, and are required to report any social media posts which are critical of Qatar Many fans reportedly declined the offer [165] On 18 November 2022, it was reported that Qatar had cancelled the daily spending allowances for fans who were paid to attend the World Cup [166]\n\n\nAccommodation\nIn the days leading up to the tournament, videos emerged of the tournament accommodation, which consisted of shipping containers, some with a curtain leading to the exterior instead of four solid walls, and portable air conditioners This accommodation cost over $200 a night A Greek salad which costs $10, consisting of a small amount of lettuce, one slice of cucumber, and no feta, served in a foam container was criticized as expensive and unpalatable These criticisms led to comparisons to the ill-fated Fyre Festival [175] One official fan village, comprising hundreds of shipping containers, still resembled a building site less than two days before the first World Cup match People who had stayed in another village complained about the air conditioning and beds: \"It has been hell The air con in the cabin barely works and sounds like a  [fighter jet] is taking off...  [The beds] are rock hard so you might as well sleep on the floor.\" [176] However, article published by CNN during the World Cup claimed that the supporters who were on a budget and were unable to afford what's on offer from hotels, eight fan villages provide “casual camping and cabin-style” options “There are so many cabins and containers and there's a big screen that we can all watch the games together.” Fei Peng, from China, who was there to watch over 30 World Cup games, told CNN Sport [177]\n\n\nProvisions inside stadium\nThough not connected to any protest against Iran, the official Wales brass band had their instruments confiscated before the Group B Wales vs Iran match The brass band had been allowed to play at the previous Wales match (against the United States) and FIFA officially supported their attendance at the tournament [179]\n\n\nBrass band instrument confiscation\nThough not connected to any protest against Iran, the official Wales brass band had their instruments confiscated before the Group B Wales vs Iran match The brass band had been allowed to play at the previous Wales match (against the United States) and FIFA officially supported their attendance at the tournament [179]\n\n\nTicketing\nMany England supporters missed the start of the Group B England vs Iran match due to problems with FIFA's ticketing app [180] That day also, the FIFA app caused tickets belonging to fans of the United States team to disappear [181] [182]\n\n\nMedia incidents\nPrior to the tournament, there were several reported incidents of altercations between broadcasters and Qatari security officials Rasmus Tantholdt of Denmark's TV 2 was interrupted by a group of security guards during a live broadcast from the Katara Cultural Village, who threatened him and attempted to break their camera Tantholdt responded to the group, saying \"You have invited the whole world here Why can't we film?

covering the Netherlands vs Argentina match in the early morning of 10 December 2022 [192]\n\n\nChinese censorship\nCCTV, the state broadcaster and the official broadcaster of FIFA World Cup in mainland China, replaced footage of maskless audiences with close-ups of coaches, officials or players, or birds-eye view of stadiums in its broadcast, as scenes of maskless audiences fueled unrest with China's zero-COVID policy during ongoing protests [200] Following the protests, the Chinese government began to relax pandemic control measures and more images of audience without masks appeared on live telecast [201]\n\n\nAlgerian censorship\nState-run TV2 of Algeria avoided coverage of the Group F Belgium vs Morocco match and Morocco's subsequent win, due to tensions between Algeria and Morocco [202] In addition, Algeria's state TV channel and the Algeria Press Service never mentioned Morocco's defeating Spain in the round of 16, although many Algerians celebrated Morocco's victory [203]\n\n\nWestern media coverage perceived as racist\nMiddle East Eye, a web news portal accused of being funded and operated by Qatar, though the nation denies this, [206] [207] has described several Western media publications as racist, and criticised the nations from which they originate It highlighted the French satirical newspaper Le Canard enchaîné, which published a cartoon of bearded men wearing Qatar football jerseys holding knives, guns, and rocket launchers; [208] and the German television network Welt, on which a presenter described the Tawhid Islamic salute performed by Moroccan players after they defeated Portugal as \"the signature hand gesture of members of ISIS\" [209]\n\n\nBBC controversies\nHassan Al Thawadi, the head of the Qatar World Cup, called some of the BBC's coverage of the tournament \"extremely racist\" and charged Gary Lineker with not engaging with the organisers before criticising them directly The BBC said it had received more than 1,000 complaints about its coverage of the World Cup opener between hosts Qatar and Ecuador, and some users described the BBC's coverage of the World Cup as \"racist\" [215] [216]\nAl Thawadi said since February, he had tried several times to have a meeting between the officials organising the World Cup and the hosts and pundits of the BBC, especially Lineker, but there was never any desire to listen to the Qatari side of the story He claimed that Lineker never wanted to engage In response to Al Thawadi, Lineker tweeted that he and his representative had not received any requests to engage with anyone involved in Qatar 2022 The Daily Telegraph reported on emails showing efforts to arrange a meeting between Al Thawadi and BBC hosts and pundits ahead of the World Cup draw in April A BBC spokesperson denied Al Thawadi's claims and said they had a duty to cover legitimate issues related to the World Cup without fear or favour [217] Lineker would go on to end his commentary of the tournament by stating that the United States, one of the co-hosts of the following World Cup, is “extraordinarily racist” in an attempt to show that he was willing to criticise any host country and had not only singled out Qatar for its issues while also mentioning that “every country has problems” [218]\n\n\nIsraeli media\nIsraeli journalists tried to interview some Arab people but they were ignored and the interviewees just walked away once the former's nationality became known [219]\n\n\nBoycotts\nTromsø IL of Norway released a statement calling for a boycott of the 2022 World Cup, in

chants against Serbians, with both players going into the referee's book [235]\n\n\nCroatian incidents\nXenophobic chants were reported during the course of the Group F Croatia vs Canada match on 27 November During the match, Croatian fans chanted xenophobic anti-Serb slogans against Canadian goalkeeper Milan Borjan, an ethnic Croatian Serb who fled Croatia during the Croatian War of Independence [240] They also displayed a modified John Deere banner making a reference to Operation Storm, a military operation that ended the war and abolished the separatist proto-state Republic of Serbian Krajina, which resulted in a mass exodus and war crimes against number of Krajina's Serb civilians [241] [242] Serbs generally consider it an act of ethnic cleansing, [243] [241] however, in a controversial decision, the ICTY appeals court in the 2012 final verdict ruled that \"there had been no joint criminal enterprise, or conspiracy, to force out the Serbs from the Krajina region.\" [244] Borjan's phone number was leaked among Croatian fans who sent him over 2,500 hateful messages during and after the game [245] His wife was also insulted during the game and targeted with hateful

midfielder Ao Tanaka scored a controversial goal (his team's second), the ball ending up in Unai Simón's net shortly after it seemed to have gone out of play After a lengthy delay the goal was eventually awarded by VAR [254] [255] [256] The decision proved critical in both Japan's surprise topping of Group E and the elimination of Germany from the tournament, with Die Mannschaft finishing third despite securing a 4-2 victory over Costa Rica in the group's other game [257] An image was later released showing that the ball had not fully crossed the line, by the narrowest of margins Qatari-owned network beIN Sports showed a virtual bird's eye view of the ball: the section of the ball which was in contact with the pitch was outside the field of play, but its curvature meant the side of the ball was still marginally over the line [258] Spain's coach Luis Enrique claimed that the image had been \"manipulated\" [259] On December 3, FIFA released video and images to provide an

produced a FIFA World Cup record of 18 yellow cards, including two people who were sitting on the bench and thus not involved in the game [262] [263] After the end of the game, Mateu Lahoz issued a red card to Netherlands player Denzel Dumfries, however, no TV commentator picked up on this, leaving viewers who checked the match reports afterward puzzled [261] [264] During the extra time period (which resulted from Netherlands striker Wout Weghorst scoring an equalising goal with the last kick of normal time, which itself went on for ten minutes extra due to the number of stoppages), BBC commentator Martin Keown remarked: \"I think the referee is losing the plot here.\" [265]\n\n\nPost-match incidents\nShortly after the Group G Brazil vs Serbia match on 24 November, a flag showing

This acquisition marked the beginning of Fox Networks Group's expansion into the production of original content.\n\n**Formation and Expansion**\n\nThe formation of Fox Networks Group marked the beginning of a new era in international television broadcasting. The company's focus on expanding its operations across the world led to the launch of new channels and the acquisition of production studios.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Fox Networks Group expanded its operations into Europe, launching channels such as Fox Life and Fox Crime. The company also established production studios in the region, producing a range of original content for local and international audiences.\n\nIn 2009, Fox Networks Group launched its first digital media platform, Fox Now, which allowed users to stream content from the company's channels on-demand. This marked the beginning of a new era in digital television, with Fox Networks Group at the forefront of the industry.\n\n**Disney Acquisition and Closure**\n\nIn 2017, The Walt Disney Company announced its intention to acquire most of 21st Century Fox's assets, including Fox Networks Group. The acquisition was completed in 2019, with Disney assuming control of Fox Networks Group's operations.\n\nAs a result of the acquisition, Fox Networks Group's units were transferred to Disney General Entertainment Content, including Fox Television Group, Fox Cable Networks, National Geographic Partners, and FX Networks.\n\nHowever, some of Fox Networks Group's units were not transferred to Disney. Fox Sports Media Group, Fox Television Stations Group, Fox News Group, and Fox Hispanic Media were retained by Fox Corporation, which was established by the Murdoch family following the acquisition.\n\n**Units**\n\nFox Networks Group consisted of a number of units, including:\n\n* **Fox Television Group**: A division of Fox Networks Group responsible for the production and

It has a long and complex history, with its evolution tracing back to the Greek alphabet and the Etruscan language.\n\n**History**\n\nThe evolution of the Latin alphabet's G can be traced back to the Latin alphabet's predecessor, the Greek alphabet. The third letter of the Greek alphabet, gamma (Γ), was used to represent the voiced velar stop sound. This sound was later adopted by the Etruscan language, which borrowed the \"rounded form\" of gamma, C, to represent the same sound in words such as recei, which was likely an early dative form of rex, meaning \"king\", as found in an \"early Latin inscription.\"\n\nOver time, however, the letter C shifted to represent the unvoiced velar stop, leading to the displacement of the letter K. Scholars believe that this change can be attributed to the influence of the Etruscan language on Latin.\n\n**Typographic Variants**\n\nThe modern lowercase g has two typographic variants: the single-storey and the double-storey . The single-storey form derives from the majuscule (uppercase) form by raising the serif that distinguishes it from 'c' to the top of the loop (thus closing the loop), and extending the vertical stroke downward and to the left. The double-storey form () had developed similarly, except that some ornate forms then extended the tail back to the right, and to the left again, forming a closed bowl or loop. The initial extension to the left was absorbed into the upper closed bowl.\n\nThe double-storey version became popular when printing switched from Blackletter type to Roman type, because the tail was effectively shorter, making it possible to put more lines on a page. In the double-storey version, a small top stroke in the upper-right, often terminating in an orb shape, is called an \"ear.\"\n\n**Use in Writing Systems**\n\nIn English, the letter G appears either alone or in some digraphs . Alone, it represents the voiced velar stop sound /ɡ/. In other languages, such as Spanish and French, the letter G can also be used to represent the /x/ sound, particularly in the case of the letter G with a cedilla (ç).\n\nIn English, the letter G is often used in combination with other letters to form digraphs, such as:\n\n* Gh: used to represent the voiced velar stop sound /ɡ/ in words such as \"ghost\" and \"ghastly\"\n* Gg: used to represent the voiced velar stop sound /ɡ/ in words such as \"giggle\" and \"gigantic\"\n* Ng: used to represent the nasal vowel sound /ŋ/ in words such as \"sing\" and \"singing\"\n\n**Other Languages**\n\nMost Romance languages and some Nordic languages also have two main pronunciations for , hard and soft. While the soft value of varies in different Romance languages (/ʒ/ in French and Portuguese, [(d)ʒ] in Catalan, /d͡ʒ/ in Italian and Romanian, and /x/ in most dialects of Spanish), in all except Romanian and Italian, soft has the same pronunciation as the .\n\nIn other languages, such as German and Dutch, the letter G is used to represent the unvoiced velar stop sound /k/, particularly in the case of the letter G with a umlaut (G).\n\n**Other Systems**\n\nIn the International Phonetic Alphabet,  represents the voiced velar plosive. The small caps  represents the voiced uvular plosive.\n\n**Other Uses**\n\nThe letter G is also used in various other contexts, such as:\n\n* In the name of the chemical element Gallium (Ga)\n* In the name of the musical note G\n* In the name of the star Gaius\n* In the name of the astronomical object G (a binary system)\n\n**Related Characters**\n\nThe letter G is related to the following characters:\n\n* C: the unvoiced velar stop sound\n* K: the unvoiced velar stop sound (in some languages)\n* G with cedilla (ç): used to represent the /x/ sound\n* G with umlaut (G): used to represent

The commission was conceived in response to the New York Times' 1619 Project, which explores American history through an African-American framework and highlights systemic racism.\n\n**History**\n\nThe 1619 Project was first published in The New York Times Magazine in August 2019, marking a significant shift in the way American history is presented and discussed. The project's central argument is that American history began in 1619, when the first enslaved Africans arrived in the English colonies, and that the legacy of slavery and racism continues to shape the country today. The 1619 Project has been widely praised for its innovative approach to history and its ability to challenge dominant narratives.\n\nThe establishment of the 1776 Commission can be seen as a response to the 1619 Project's focus on the darker aspects of American history. The commission's goal was to promote a more positive and patriotic view of American history, one that emphasizes the country's founding principles and the achievements of its founders.\n\n**Establishment**\n\nOn November 2, 2020, President Trump issued an executive order establishing the 1776 Commission. The order stated that the commission's purpose was to \"promote patriotic education\" and to \"defend the dignity of America's founding and history.\" The commission held its first meeting on January 5, 2021, and was composed of 18 members, including conservative activists, politicians, and intellectuals.\n\n**Goals**\n\nThe 1776 Commission's goal was to promote a more patriotic and nationalist approach to American history education. The commission believed that the country's history was being distorted by liberal and progressive interpretations, and that a more accurate and balanced approach was needed. The commission's report, released in January 2021, argued that American history should be taught in a way that emphasizes the country's founding principles and the achievements of its founders.\n\nThe commission's report also criticized the 1619 Project and other liberal interpretations of American history, arguing that they were overly focused on the country's flaws and shortcomings. The report argued that a more balanced approach to history would emphasize the country's strengths and achievements, and would promote a more positive and patriotic view of American history.\n\n**Members**\n\nThe 1776 Commission was composed of 18 members, including:\n\n* Larry Arnn, president of Hillsdale College and chair of the commission\n* Carol Swain, Black conservative and former professor at Vanderbilt Law School\n* Brooke Rollins, former domestic policy advisor to President Trump\n* Charles R. Kesler, professor at Claremont Graduate University and editor of the Claremont Review of Books\n* Ned Ryun, former speechwriter for President George W.

The report was a 41-page document that argued for a more patriotic and nationalist approach to American history education. The report did not include citations or footnotes, and did not identify its main authors. About half the pages in the report were appendices.\n\nThe report was widely criticized by historians and scholars, who argued that it was filled with errors and partisan politics, and that it lacked scholarship and intellectual rigor. The American Historical Association and other historical societies condemned the report, stating that it was completed without any consultation with professional historians of the United States.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe 1776 Report was widely criticized by historians and scholars, who argued that it was filled with errors and partisan politics, and that it lacked scholarship and intellectual rigor. The report's lack of citations and footnotes was seen as particularly egregious, as it made it difficult to verify the accuracy of the report's claims.\n\nThe American Historical Association and other historical societies condemned the report, stating that it was completed without any consultation with professional historians of the United States. The Association of University Presses also criticized the report, stating that it was plagued by procedural deficiencies that would render it unpublishable as a serious work of scholarship.\n\n**Termination**\n\nOn January 20, 2021, President Joe Biden issued an executive order dissolving the 1776 Commission. The report was removed from the White House website, although the National Archives and Records Administration archived the report, along with the entire Trump White House website.\n\nThe termination of the 1776 Commission was seen as a victory for historians and scholars, who had widely criticized the commission's report and its approach to American history education.

{"title": "Scream_(1996_film)", "content": "\nPlot\nIn the small town of Woodsboro, California, high school student Casey Becker is home alone when she receives a phone call from an unknown person They discuss horror films until the caller turns sadistic, threatening her life and revealing that her boyfriend, Steve, is tied up on her patio The caller demands she answer questions about horror films to save his life, but Casey gives an incorrect answer about Friday the 13th, resulting in Steve's death Casey attempts to escape, but is stabbed to death by someone wearing a \"Ghostface\" costume, and her disemboweled corpse is found hanging from a tree by her parents.\n\n\nCast\nScream also features Roger L Jackson as the voice of Ghostface, [17] and Kevin Patrick Walls as Steve Orth, Casey's boyfriend [16] [12] Lawrence Hecht and Lynn McRee portray Sidney's parents, Neil and Maureen [14] [18] [19] C.W Morgan appears as Hank Loomis, Frances Lee McCain portrays Mrs Riley, and David Booth and Carla Hatley appear as Casey's father and mother [14] Leonora Scelfo portrays a \"bitchy\" cheerleader in the school bathroom [20] Scream features several cameo appearances, including Henry Winkler as principal Arthur Himbry, Linda Blair as Obnoxious Reporter, casting director Lisa Beach as a reporter, and director Wes Craven appears as Freddy the janitor, an homage to iconic horror character Freddy Krueger [a]\n\n\nProduction\nIn 1994, Kevin Williamson was a novice and financially struggling screenwriter, having recently sold his first script, Killing Mrs Tingle (1999) [b] While house-sitting, Williamson watched a Turning Point documentary about serial killer Danny Rolling which he said left him unsettled Williamson later noticed an open window, armed himself with a knife, and called his friend for support The pair began discussing horror characters that had resonated with them such as Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees [26] [28] The following morning, Williamson was woken by a nightmare and used the experience as inspiration for the opening home invasion of Scream He was also influenced by a one-act play he wrote in college about an unknown caller taunting a young girl [24] [26] [28]\n\n\nWriting\nIn 1994, Kevin Williamson was a novice and financially struggling screenwriter, having recently sold his first script, Killing Mrs Tingle (1999) [b] While

woken by a nightmare and used the experience as inspiration for the opening home invasion of Scream He was also influenced by a one-act play he wrote in college about an unknown caller taunting a young girl [24] [26] [28]\n\n\nDevelopment\nBy 1995, there was competition to secure the rights to Scary Movie, with early interest expressed by Morgan Creek Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and filmmaker Oliver Stone [e] The script came to the attention of producer Cathy Konrad of Woods Entertainment, which had a development deal with production studio Miramax Films She brought it to Richard Potter, the director of development for Miramax Films' genre-film-focused subsidiary Dimension Films [35] Potter expected a \"stupid spoof\" but was drawn in by the opening scene and recommended Miramax Films chairman, Bob Weinstein, pursue the rights He agreed, considering it an opportunity to produce films instead of distributing those of others [f] Although others offered larger figures, Williamson's lawyer advised him take Weinstein's offer ($400,000–$500,000) because Dimension Films was willing to make the film immediately [g]\n\n\nCasting\nAtypical for the genre at the time, Scream featured a cast of established stars, such as Drew Barrymore and Courteney Cox, as well as relatively unknown actors [25] [26] Executive producer Cary Woods used his friendship with Barrymore's agent to approach her for the lead role of Sidney Prescott, but she requested the smaller role of Casey Becker because \"that's the part I love the most\" [n] Maddalena suggested that Barrymore had wanted to leave the project entirely, but took the smaller role to avoid disappointing Bob Weinstein and his brother Harvey [55] The filmmakers agreed to the change, believing it would be impactful to kill off their most well-known actor during Scream's opening and convince audiences that no character was safe [25] [57] [26] Vinessa Shaw and Reese Witherspoon were also considered for Sidney Prescott Witherspoon was discounted because she looked too young compared to the other cast, and Williamson's choice, Molly Ringwald, believed she was too old for the part [28] [55] The final choices came down to Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, and Neve Campbell [26] [31] [25] According to Williamson, Campbell swiftly emerged as the favored choice among the principal crew and, to improve her chances, they filmed her screen-test first, forcing the other contenders to try and surpass her performance [25] Beach and Maddalena said Campbell brought athleticism from her dancing background with a combination of strength and vulnerability [26] Describing what attracted her to the role, Campbell said Sidney was \"a fantastic character for any kind of movie\" who transitions from \"tormented, traumatized, insecure young woman to overwhelmingly empowered and strong\" [58]\n\n\nPre-production\nIt was determined early on that Scream required too many different interior and exterior locations to be filmed on sets Production designer Bruce Miller explained that it was important to portray the characters as vulnerable in their homes which made it essential that they could film inside and outside the properties [72] Scouts researched locations in the United States and Canada but struggled to locate a house for the opening scene which featured plentiful windows and visibility [73] Craven initially researched Wilmington, North Carolina but it failed to meet his expectations: \"I wanted to have very American looking houses .. and a lot of the houses there were very dark brown, or brick, and that didn't look attractive to me.\" [73] [32] Locations near Vancouver were discounted for similar reasons, as was Napa County, California [73] [32]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on April 15, 1996, on a $14 million budget [94] [26] [95] [y] The first week was spent filming the Casey Becker scenes [z] To elicit the necessary emotions, Barrymore recalled a sad story developed with Craven and made herself hyperventilate [26] [56] [9] To enhance her performance, Jackson was situated outside the house so that he could see Barrymore while making the calls but she could not see him Jackson was used similarly for other Ghostface call scenes, and never met the cast in person He said \"the scariest monsters are the monsters you don't see, but the monsters you make in your mind So just having the voice to react to made it larger in their minds\" [aa] For safety, stunt performers portrayed the killer in costume, although Craven portrays the killer in parts of the opening [28] [96] The first few days of filming used a custom mask designed for Scream, but Craven did not like it and reshot various scenes with the Fun World design before it was licensed [93] Because the hung Casey was to appear gutted from chest to waist, effects artist Howard Berger decided against applying prosthetics to Barrymore in favor of a mannequin that could be hollowed out, showing her spine holding her upper and lower parts together The effect was enhanced with various rubber and vinyl guts [97] For Steve Orth's death, KNB created an open back chair allowing the actor to kneel behind a hollowed out anatomical mannequin torso cut open at the abdomen and filled with latex, rubber, and gelatin intestines [98]\n\n\nThe finale\nThe film's 42-minute end sequence set at Stu's party was filmed at night over three weeks [ag] Issues filming at the location, including difficulties with providing proper lighting because of the uneven landscape, exacerbated tensions between Craven and Irwin regarding the quality of Irwin's footage Scream was filmed with an anamorphic lens, which distorts and stretches the image to achieve a specific aspect ratio However, neither Craven nor Irwin had much experience with this type of lens The crew, including Lussier, had raised concerns about lens flares and out-of-focus images, partially blaming the focus puller hired by Irwin [84] Lussier explained, \"You can often tell your focus is supposed to be on somebody's eye usually,  .. and the focus puller just hasn't moved with the actor\" [105] As a result, there were limited options during the editing process due to the inconsistent focus [106] Irwin said he was informed that all filmed footage was unusable and that 35 days of scenes needed to be reshot After an argument with Maddalena, Irwin was immediately fired and replaced by Peter Deming for the final three weeks of filming [93] [107] Irwin believed he was made a scapegoat for the film's behind-schedule status, risking Craven forfeiting his salary, but Konrad denied this [106]\n\n\nPost-production\nThe Scary Movie title remained late into production, appearing on the cast and crew gifts for completing filming [ai] Harvey Weinstein suggested Scream based on the Michael and Janet Jackson song \"Scream\" [41] [36] [112] Many of the cast and crew were initially unhappy with the change Sony Pictures filed a lawsuit against Dimension and Miramax, claiming Scream infringed on their copyright of Screamers (1995) The case was settled out of court with Dimension being able to use Scream going forward [112] Although Arquette's and Kennedy's characters were killed in the script, alternate scenes were filmed showing them survive in case they proved popular with test screening audiences The successful screenings also resulted in Miramax asking Craven to direct two Scream sequels [aj]\n\n\nMusic\nDespite having no background in film scoring or an interest in the horror genre, Marco Beltrami was recommended to Plec and Craven, who found his music samples original compared with Beltrami's contemporaries [al] Craven gave Beltrami a weekend to compose \"The Cue from Hell\", the score for the film's opening sequence, which secured his hiring Beltrami wrote the piece from Casey's perspective and used an \"operatic\" style, employing a range of instruments, including piano and brass [123] [120] [25] Beltrami described himself as \"bumbling\" through the scoring process, acknowledging his limited knowledge of horror music styles [121] [124] [123] He incorporated elements of the western genre, particularly for Dewey's theme, and took cues from composers including Elliot Goldenthal, Ennio Morricone, Eric Serra, Christopher Young, and Hans Zimmer [121] [124] [123]\n\n\nRelease\nThe theatrical year of 1996 was projected to record a $5.8 billion domestic box office record after twelve films grossed over $100 million, with Independence Day and Twister each earning over $200 million However, individual successes were hindered by the high number of releases competing for audiences, resulting in several box office flops and studio bankruptcies This was compounded by rising production costs and high salaries for stars such as Jim Carrey, Tom Cruise, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Julia Roberts, prompting many studios to cut their film slate by fifty percent Even so, over forty films were scheduled for release in late 1996, including Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, Jerry Maguire, Mars Attacks!, Ransom, Space Jam, and Star Trek: First

[an]\n\n\nBox office\nThe premiere of Scream took place on December 18, 1996, at the AVCO theater in Westwood, Los Angeles [27] [138] It was released in the United States and Canada on December 20 [95] [27] [25] During its opening weekend, the film grossed $6.4 million across 1,413 theaters—an average of $4,497 per theater—making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of the weekend, behind 101 Dalmatians ($7 million), Jerry Maguire ($13.1 million), and the debut of Beavis and Butt-Head Do America ($20.1 million) [139] [25] The performance was considered a failure by industry professionals, resulting in Variety labeling Scream \"dead on arrival\" [95] [25] [26] [verification needed] Maddalena recounted herself and Craven observing a raucous audience for Beavis and Butt-Head Do America while Scream had \"maybe seven people in there No one was laughing or screaming We went away so dejected.\" [26] However, Scream received positive audience word-of-mouth and exit-polling responses, leading the studio to increase the marketing and distribution budget This contributed to Scream's performance improving in the following weeks [27] [25] [26] Although it fell to fifth place in its second weekend, it increased its weekend gross to $9.1 million, [140] [25] [26] and again in its third weekend, rising to third place with $10 million [141] [25] Scream remained in the top-ten-highest-grossing films for nine weeks in total, becoming a surprise success and grossing a total of $103 million [142] [143] [144] This figure made it the number 13 highest-grossing film of 1996, [145] and highest-grossing slasher film of its time, until Halloween (2018) [144] [146] [147] It was Miramax's second film to gross $100 million in the United States and Canada after Pulp Fiction (1994) [148] The film was most successful with teenagers and young people in their 20s [149]\n\n\nReception\nScream received generally positive reviews [155] Critics, such as Roger Ebert, James Berardinelli, and Owen Gleiberman, praised Scream's meta commentary about its horror predecessors and its self-referential humor while also writing that the self parody diluted any suspense, and criticizing the excessive violence [aq] Some critics said that the film's intelligence and wit beneath the gore would be appreciated by \"sophisticated viewers\", [21] [169] but Ebert was unsure if the degree of violence was \"defused by the ironic way the film uses it and comments on it\" [159]\n\n\nCritical response\nScream received generally positive reviews [155] Critics, such as Roger

appearance by Linda Blair, famed for her appearance in The Exorcist (1973), and the killers admonishing the police for not watching Prom Night for advice In a meta reference, Randy recounts the rules of the genre: to survive a horror film, characters cannot sin by drinking, taking drugs, or having sex, and they cannot say \"'I'll be right back.' Because you won't be back\" [26] [165] [164] This self reference is extended when Randy (Jamie Kennedy), watches Halloween and yells at the lead character Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) to look behind her, oblivious to the killer approaching himself from behind Further, Kenny futilely yells at Randy to look behind him while observing via a remote camera [164] When Sidney confronts Billy and Stu, she says \"You've seen one too many movies\", to which Billy replies \"Movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative.\" [aw] Writer Kate Gardener believed this dialogue rejects the blame on horror films for inspiring real-world violence [195] Lussier said the MPAA had objected to this dialogue because \"you can't speak that kind of truth\" [25]\n\n\nThemes\nScream is influenced by, and pays many homages to, the history of the horror genre, including a school janitor referencing Freddy Krueger, a cameo appearance by Linda Blair, famed for her appearance in The Exorcist (1973), and the killers admonishing the police for not watching Prom Night for advice In a meta reference, Randy recounts the rules of the genre: to survive a horror film, characters cannot sin by drinking, taking drugs, or having sex, and they cannot say \"'I'll be right back.'

wrote that Scream was pro-feminism, depicting several final girls who fight the killer instead of submitting The success of Scream demonstrated to studios that although typically seen as fare for young males, horror films had an untapped female market [198] Writer Aime Simon said Sidney, like Craven's Nancy Thompson, is allowed to develop as a character by surviving successive films [198] The Scream films often explore female trauma through characters such as Sidney and Gale, including the dangers posed by angry males who feel rejected Gardener said that although this may not have been Craven's intention, the film's narrative effectively conveys this theme She continued that the male killers in Scream enact violence and intimidation primarily on women, including Casey who romantically rejects Stu before the events of the film, and Sidney's mother Maureen, as Billy blames her for the end of his parents' marriage Maureen is not responsible for his mother leaving, but Billy blames her, takes his anger out on her directly, and then abuses Sidney's emotional vulnerability caused by her death In this way, the portrayal of Billy and Stu as angry entitled men seeking revenge is more relatable and realistic than supernatural horror villains [195]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn the decades following its release, Scream has remained an enduringly popular horror film and launched a

\"ground-breaking\" slasher film that \"successfully crossed over into the mainstream\" because of its deft blend of traditional horror with self-aware commentary and satire [28] [209] Vox wrote that Scream \"mainstreamed metatextual storytelling and made that analytical understanding of the genre mainstream in a lot of ways\" [210] Studios rushed to capitalize on Scream's success with teen-centric horror films and television series leading into the 2000s, such as I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), Urban Legend (1998) and Cherry Falls (2000), as well as sequels to popular, but

Several publications have also listed it among the best films of the 1990s [be] Williamson believed Scream's success was due, in part, to fitting the contemporary zeitgeist when \"everyone wanted to have scary and fun in their life .. If the movie had been released at any other time, I'm not sure that would've been the case\" Campbell believed it connected with audiences because of a deft combination of humor, horror, and intelligence [25] As of 2023 [update], Scream remains the highest-grossing film in the Scream film series, [95] [267] and is generally considered to be the best film in the series [bf] The franchise is also among the highest-grossing horror franchises, alongside Halloween, Saw, and The Conjuring Universe [95]\n\n\nSequels\nDue to the success of Scream, development of a sequel began while the original was still in theaters [25] [30] Scream 2 (1997) achieved similar financial and critical success as Scream [208] Williamson was unavailable to write Scream 3 (2000), the trilogy's concluding chapter, and was replaced with Ehren Kruger The film fared less well than its predecessors, commercially and critically, and is regarded as the franchise's most divisive entry [208] [285] Williamson returned to the series with the reboot film Scream 4 (2011) [bg] While Scream 4 has grown in esteem since its release, its modest box office and critical reception, as well as Craven's death, placed the franchise on hold [287] [285]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nCitations\n\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Scream (1996 film)**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nScream is a 1996 American slasher film written by Kevin Williamson and directed by Wes Craven. The film is known for its self-aware, meta approach to the horror genre, blending traditional slasher elements with witty dialogue and clever references to popular culture. Released in December 1996, Scream was a commercial and critical success, grossing over $103 million at the domestic box office and receiving widespread acclaim from critics. The film's success helped revitalize the horror genre, which had declined in popularity in the early 1990s, and spawned a successful franchise with multiple sequels.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in the small town of Woodsboro, California, where high school student Casey Becker is home alone when she receives a phone call from an unknown person. The caller, who is ultimately revealed to be Ghostface, discusses horror films with Casey until he turns sadistic, threatening her life and revealing that her boyfriend, Steve, is tied up on her patio. The killer demands that Casey answer questions about horror films to save Steve's life, but she gives an incorrect answer about Friday the 13th, resulting in Steve's death. Casey attempts to escape, but is stabbed to death by someone wearing a Ghostface costume, and her disemboweled corpse is found hanging from a tree by her parents.\n\n**Cast**\n\nScream features a cast of established stars, including Drew Barrymore and Courteney Cox, as well as relatively unknown actors. Atypical for the genre at the time, Scream also features a cast of characters who are well-developed and relatable, making the film's violence and gore all the more disturbing. The film's cast includes:\n\n* Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott\n* Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers\n* David Arquette as Deputy Dewey Riley\n* Rose McGowan as Tatum Riley\n* Skeet Ulrich as Billy Loomis\n* Matthew Lillard as Stu Macher\n* W. Earl Brown as Kenny Jones\n* Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks\n* Lawrence Hecht as Neil Prescott\n* Lynn McRee as Maureen Prescott\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was produced on a budget of $14 million and was shot on location in California. The film's score was composed by Marco Beltrami, who was recommended to director Wes Craven by production designer Bruce Miller. Beltrami's score is notable for its use of a mix of electronic and orchestral elements, creating a sense of tension and unease that complements the film's on-screen violence.\n\n**Filming**\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 15, 1996, and lasted for several weeks. The film's cast and crew worked in a variety of locations, including a high school, a university, and several private homes. The film's climax, which takes place at a party, was filmed over the course of several weeks, with the cast and crew working under the direction of Wes Craven.\n\n**Post-production**\n\nThe film's post-production process was marked by a number of challenges, including difficulties with the film's special effects and the sound design.

about \"Scream_(1996_film)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nIn the small town of Woodsboro, California, high school student Casey Becker is home alone when she receives a phone call from an unknown person They discuss horror films until the caller turns sadistic, threatening her life and revealing that her boyfriend, Steve, is tied up on her patio The caller demands she answer questions about horror films to save his life, but Casey gives an incorrect answer about Friday the 13th, resulting in Steve's death Casey attempts to escape, but is stabbed to death by someone wearing a \"Ghostface\" costume, and her disemboweled corpse is found hanging from a tree by her parents.\n\n\nCast\nScream also features Roger L Jackson as the voice of Ghostface, [17] and Kevin Patrick Walls as Steve Orth, Casey's boyfriend [16] [12] Lawrence Hecht and Lynn McRee portray Sidney's parents, Neil and Maureen [14] [18] [19] C.W Morgan appears as Hank Loomis, Frances Lee McCain portrays Mrs Riley, and David Booth and Carla Hatley appear as Casey's father and mother [14] Leonora Scelfo portrays a \"bitchy\" cheerleader in the school bathroom [20] Scream features several cameo appearances, including Henry Winkler as principal Arthur Himbry, Linda Blair as Obnoxious Reporter, casting director Lisa Beach as a reporter, and director Wes Craven appears as Freddy the janitor, an homage to iconic horror character Freddy Krueger [a]\n\n\nProduction\nIn 1994, Kevin Williamson was a novice and financially struggling screenwriter, having recently sold his first script, Killing Mrs Tingle (1999) [b] While house-sitting, Williamson watched a Turning Point documentary about serial killer Danny Rolling which he said left him unsettled Williamson later noticed an open window, armed himself with a knife, and called his friend for support The pair began discussing horror characters that had resonated with them such as Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees [26] [28] The following morning, Williamson was woken by a nightmare and used the experience as inspiration for the opening home invasion of Scream He was also influenced by a one-act play he wrote in college about an unknown caller taunting a young girl [24] [26] [28]\n\n\nWriting\nIn 1994, Kevin Williamson was a novice and financially struggling screenwriter, having recently sold his first script, Killing Mrs Tingle (1999) [b]

was woken by a nightmare and used the experience as inspiration for the opening home invasion of Scream He was also influenced by a one-act play he wrote in college about an unknown caller taunting a young girl [24] [26] [28]\n\n\nDevelopment\nBy 1995, there was competition to secure the rights to Scary Movie, with early interest expressed by Morgan Creek Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and filmmaker Oliver Stone [e] The script came to the attention of producer Cathy Konrad of Woods Entertainment, which had a development deal with production studio Miramax Films She brought it to Richard Potter, the director of development for Miramax Films' genre-film-focused subsidiary Dimension Films [35] Potter expected a \"stupid spoof\" but was drawn in by the opening scene and recommended Miramax Films chairman, Bob Weinstein, pursue the rights He agreed, considering it an opportunity to produce films instead of distributing those of others [f] Although others offered larger figures, Williamson's lawyer advised him take Weinstein's offer ($400,000–$500,000) because Dimension Films was willing to make the film immediately [g]\n\n\nCasting\nAtypical for the genre at the time, Scream featured a cast of established stars, such as Drew Barrymore and Courteney Cox, as well as relatively unknown actors [25] [26] Executive producer Cary Woods used his friendship with Barrymore's agent to approach her for the lead role of Sidney Prescott, but she requested the smaller role of Casey Becker because \"that's the part I love the most\" [n] Maddalena suggested that Barrymore had wanted to leave the project entirely, but took the smaller role to avoid disappointing Bob Weinstein and his brother Harvey [55] The filmmakers agreed to the change, believing it would be impactful to kill off their most well-known actor during Scream's opening and convince audiences that no character was safe [25] [57] [26] Vinessa Shaw and Reese Witherspoon were also considered for Sidney Prescott Witherspoon was discounted because she looked too young compared to the other cast, and Williamson's choice, Molly Ringwald, believed she was too old for the part [28] [55] The final choices came down to Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, and Neve Campbell [26] [31] [25] According to Williamson, Campbell swiftly emerged as the favored choice among the principal crew and, to improve her chances, they filmed her screen-test first, forcing the other contenders to try and surpass her performance [25] Beach and Maddalena said Campbell brought athleticism from her dancing background with a combination of strength and vulnerability [26] Describing what attracted her to the role, Campbell said Sidney was \"a fantastic character for any kind of movie\" who transitions from \"tormented, traumatized, insecure young woman to overwhelmingly empowered and strong\" [58]\n\n\nPre-production\nIt was determined early on that Scream required too many different interior and exterior locations to be filmed on sets Production designer Bruce Miller explained that it was important to portray the characters as vulnerable in their homes which made it essential that they could film inside and outside the properties [72] Scouts researched locations in the United States and Canada but struggled to locate a house for the opening scene which featured plentiful windows and visibility [73] Craven initially researched Wilmington, North Carolina but it failed to meet his expectations: \"I wanted to have very American looking houses .. and a lot of the houses there were very dark brown, or brick, and that didn't look attractive to me.\" [73] [32] Locations near Vancouver were discounted for similar reasons, as was Napa County, California [73] [32]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on April 15, 1996, on a $14 million budget [94] [26] [95] [y] The first week was spent filming the Casey Becker scenes [z] To elicit the necessary emotions, Barrymore recalled a sad story developed with Craven and made herself hyperventilate [26] [56] [9] To enhance her performance, Jackson was situated outside the house so that he could see Barrymore while making the calls but she could not see him Jackson was used similarly for other Ghostface call scenes, and never met the cast in person He said \"the scariest monsters are the monsters you don't see, but the monsters you make in your mind So just having the voice to react to made it larger in their minds\" [aa] For safety, stunt performers portrayed the killer in costume, although Craven portrays the killer in parts of the opening [28] [96] The first few days of filming used a custom mask designed for Scream, but Craven did not like it and reshot various scenes with the Fun World design before it was licensed [93] Because the hung Casey was to appear gutted from chest to waist, effects artist Howard Berger decided against applying prosthetics to Barrymore in favor of a mannequin that could be hollowed out, showing her spine holding her upper and lower parts together The effect was enhanced with various rubber and vinyl guts [97] For Steve Orth's death, KNB created an open back chair allowing the actor to kneel behind a hollowed out anatomical mannequin torso cut open at the abdomen and filled with latex, rubber, and gelatin intestines [98]\n\n\nThe finale\nThe film's 42-minute end sequence set at Stu's party was filmed at night over three weeks [ag] Issues filming at the location, including difficulties with providing proper lighting because of the uneven landscape, exacerbated tensions between Craven and Irwin regarding the quality of Irwin's footage Scream was filmed with an anamorphic lens, which distorts and stretches the image to achieve a specific aspect ratio However, neither Craven nor Irwin had much experience with this type of lens The crew, including Lussier, had raised concerns about lens flares and out-of-focus images, partially blaming the focus puller hired by Irwin [84] Lussier explained, \"You can often tell your focus is supposed to be on somebody's eye usually,  .. and the focus puller just hasn't moved with the actor\" [105] As a result, there were limited options during the editing process due to the inconsistent focus [106] Irwin said he was informed that all filmed footage was unusable and that 35 days of scenes needed to be reshot After an argument with Maddalena, Irwin was immediately fired and replaced by Peter Deming for the final three weeks of filming [93] [107] Irwin believed he was made a scapegoat for the film's behind-schedule status, risking Craven forfeiting his salary, but Konrad denied this [106]\n\n\nPost-production\nThe Scary Movie title remained late into production, appearing on the cast and crew gifts for completing filming [ai] Harvey Weinstein suggested Scream based on the Michael and Janet Jackson song \"Scream\" [41] [36] [112] Many of the cast and crew were initially unhappy with the change Sony Pictures filed a lawsuit against Dimension and Miramax, claiming Scream infringed on their copyright of Screamers (1995) The case was settled out of court with Dimension being able to use Scream going forward [112] Although Arquette's and Kennedy's characters were killed in the script, alternate scenes were filmed showing them survive in case they proved popular with test screening audiences The successful screenings also resulted in Miramax asking Craven to direct two Scream sequels [aj]\n\n\nMusic\nDespite having no background in film scoring or an interest in the horror genre, Marco Beltrami was recommended to Plec and Craven, who found his music samples original compared with Beltrami's contemporaries [al] Craven gave Beltrami a weekend to compose \"The Cue from Hell\", the score for the film's opening sequence, which secured his hiring Beltrami wrote the piece from Casey's perspective and used an \"operatic\" style, employing a range of instruments, including piano and brass [123] [120] [25] Beltrami described himself as \"bumbling\" through the scoring process, acknowledging his limited knowledge of horror music styles [121] [124] [123] He incorporated elements of the western genre, particularly for Dewey's theme, and took cues from composers including Elliot Goldenthal, Ennio Morricone, Eric Serra, Christopher Young, and Hans Zimmer [121] [124] [123]\n\n\nRelease\nThe theatrical year of 1996 was projected to record a $5.8 billion domestic box office record after twelve films grossed over $100 million, with Independence Day and Twister each earning over $200 million However, individual successes were hindered by the high number of releases competing for audiences, resulting in several box office flops and studio bankruptcies This was compounded by rising production costs and high salaries for stars such as Jim Carrey, Tom Cruise, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Julia Roberts, prompting many studios to cut their film slate by fifty percent Even so, over forty films were scheduled for release in late 1996, including Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, Jerry Maguire, Mars Attacks!, Ransom, Space Jam, and Star Trek: First

[95] [27] [25] During its opening weekend, the film grossed $6.4 million across 1,413 theaters—an average of $4,497 per theater—making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of the weekend, behind 101 Dalmatians ($7 million), Jerry Maguire ($13.1 million), and the debut of Beavis and Butt-Head Do America ($20.1 million) [139] [25] The performance was considered a failure by industry professionals, resulting in Variety labeling Scream \"dead on arrival\" [95] [25] [26] [verification needed] Maddalena recounted herself and Craven observing a raucous audience for Beavis and Butt-Head Do America while Scream had \"maybe seven people in there No one was laughing or screaming We went away so dejected.\" [26] However, Scream received positive audience word-of-mouth and exit-polling responses, leading the studio to increase the marketing and distribution budget This contributed to Scream's performance improving in the following weeks [27] [25] [26] Although it fell to fifth place in its second weekend, it increased its weekend gross to $9.1 million, [140] [25] [26] and again in its third weekend, rising to third place with $10 million [141] [25] Scream remained in the top-ten-highest-grossing films for nine weeks in total, becoming a surprise success and grossing a total of $103 million [142] [143] [144] This figure made it the number 13 highest-grossing film of 1996, [145] and highest-grossing slasher film of its time, until Halloween (2018) [144] [146] [147] It was Miramax's second film to gross $100 million in the United States and Canada after Pulp Fiction (1994) [148] The film was most successful with teenagers and young people in their 20s [149]\n\n\nReception\nScream received generally positive reviews [155] Critics, such as Roger Ebert, James Berardinelli, and Owen Gleiberman, praised Scream's meta commentary about its horror predecessors and its self-referential humor while also writing that the self parody diluted any suspense, and criticizing the excessive violence [aq] Some critics said that the film's intelligence and wit beneath the gore would be appreciated by \"sophisticated viewers\", [21] [169] but Ebert was unsure if the degree of violence was \"defused by the ironic way the film uses it and comments on it\" [159]\n\n\nCritical response\nScream received generally positive reviews [155] Critics, such as Roger

immediate sequels [189] [190]\n\n\nThematic analysis\nScream is influenced by, and pays many homages to, the history of the horror genre, including a school janitor referencing Freddy Krueger, a cameo appearance by Linda Blair, famed for her appearance in The Exorcist (1973), and the killers admonishing the police for not watching Prom Night for advice In a meta reference, Randy recounts the rules of the genre: to survive a horror film, characters cannot sin by drinking, taking drugs, or having sex, and they cannot say \"'I'll be right back.' Because you won't be back\" [26] [165] [164] This self reference is extended when Randy (Jamie Kennedy), watches Halloween and yells at the lead character Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) to look behind her, oblivious to the killer approaching himself from behind Further, Kenny futilely yells at Randy to look behind him while observing via a remote camera [164] When Sidney confronts Billy and Stu, she says \"You've seen one too many movies\", to which Billy replies \"Movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative.\" [aw] Writer Kate Gardener believed this dialogue rejects the blame on horror films for inspiring real-world violence [195] Lussier said the MPAA had objected to this dialogue because \"you can't speak that kind of truth\" [25]\n\n\nThemes\nScream is influenced by, and pays many homages to, the history of the horror genre, including a school janitor referencing Freddy Krueger, a cameo appearance by Linda Blair, famed for her appearance in The Exorcist (1973), and the killers admonishing the police for not watching Prom Night for advice In a meta reference, Randy recounts the rules of the genre: to survive a horror film, characters cannot sin by drinking, taking drugs, or having sex, and they cannot say \"'I'll be right back.'

wrote that Scream was pro-feminism, depicting several final girls who fight the killer instead of submitting The success of Scream demonstrated to studios that although typically seen as fare for young males, horror films had an untapped female market [198] Writer Aime Simon said Sidney, like Craven's Nancy Thompson, is allowed to develop as a character by surviving successive films [198] The Scream films often explore female trauma through characters such as Sidney and Gale, including the dangers posed by angry males who feel rejected Gardener said that although this may not have been Craven's intention, the film's narrative effectively conveys this theme She continued that the male killers in Scream enact violence and intimidation primarily on women, including Casey who romantically rejects Stu before the events of the film, and Sidney's mother Maureen, as Billy blames her for the end of his parents' marriage Maureen is not responsible for his mother leaving, but Billy blames her, takes his anger out on her directly, and then abuses Sidney's emotional vulnerability caused by her death In this way, the portrayal of Billy and Stu as angry entitled men seeking revenge is more relatable and realistic than supernatural horror villains [195]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn the decades following its release, Scream has remained an enduringly popular horror film and launched a successful film franchise [198] [25] It is credited with revitalizing the horror genre, which had significantly declined in popularity by the early 1990s [az] Far Out and MTV described Scream as a \"ground-breaking\" slasher film that \"successfully crossed over into the mainstream\" because of its deft blend of traditional horror with self-aware commentary and satire [28] [209] Vox wrote that Scream \"mainstreamed metatextual storytelling and made that analytical understanding of the genre mainstream in a lot of ways\" [210] Studios rushed to capitalize on Scream's success with teen-centric horror films and television series leading into the 2000s, such as I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), Urban Legend (1998) and Cherry Falls (2000), as well as sequels to popular, but diminished, franchises such as Halloween H20: 20 Years Later and Bride of Chucky (both 1998) [ba] Scream also serves as the subject of the parody film Scary Movie (2000), which in turn launched its own franchise of horror spoofs [211] [214] [215] Director Jordan Peele has credited Scream as a direct inspiration for his own influential horror film, Get Out (2017), in manipulating the audience's

Several publications have also listed it among the best films of the 1990s [be] Williamson believed Scream's success was due, in part, to fitting the contemporary zeitgeist when \"everyone wanted to have scary and fun in their life .. If the movie had been released at any other time, I'm not sure that would've been the case\" Campbell believed it connected with audiences because of a deft combination of humor, horror, and intelligence [25] As of 2023 [update], Scream remains the highest-grossing film in the Scream film series, [95] [267] and is generally considered to be the best film in the series [bf] The franchise is also among the highest-grossing horror franchises, alongside Halloween, Saw, and The Conjuring Universe [95]\n\n\nSequels\nDue to the success of Scream, development of a sequel began while the original was still in theaters [25] [30] Scream 2 (1997) achieved similar financial and critical success as Scream [208] Williamson was unavailable to write Scream 3 (2000), the trilogy's concluding chapter, and was replaced with Ehren Kruger The film fared less well than its predecessors, commercially and critically, and is regarded as the franchise's most divisive entry [208] [285] Williamson returned to the series with the reboot film Scream 4 (2011) [bg] While Scream 4 has grown in esteem since its release, its modest box office and critical reception, as well as Craven's death, placed the franchise on hold [287] [285]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nCitations\n\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

one he was renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur [32] [33] [34] [35] He was named after Túpac Amaru II, a descendant of the last Incan ruler, who was executed in Peru in 1781 after his revolt against Spanish rule [36] Shakur's mother Afeni Shakur explained, \"I wanted him to have the name of revolutionary, indigenous people in the world I wanted him to know he was part of a world culture and not just from a neighborhood.\" [32] Tupac's surname came from Lumumba Shakur, a Sunni Muslim, whom his mother married in November 1968 Their marriage fell apart when it was discovered that Lumumba was not Tupac's biological father [37] [38] [39]\n\n\nPanther heritage\nShakur's parents, Afeni Shakur—born Alice Faye Williams in North Carolina—and his biological father, William \"Billy\" Garland, had been active Black Panther Party members in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s [41] A month before Shakur's birth, his mother was tried in New York City as part of the Panther 21 criminal trial She was acquitted of over 150 charges [42] [43]\n\n\nEducation\nIn the 1980s, Shakur's mother found it difficult to find work and struggled with drug addiction [49] In 1984, his family moved from New York City to Baltimore, Maryland [50] Beginning in 1984 when Shakur was 13, he lived in the Pen Lucy neighborhood with his mother and younger sister at 3955 Greenmount Ave [51] The home was a two-story rowhouse that had been subdivided into two separate rental units; the Shakur family lived on the first floor [52] After his death, the block was renamed Tupac Shakur Way [53]\n\n\nMusic career\nShakur began recording under the stage name MC New York in 1988 [70] That year, he began attending the poetry classes of Leila Steinberg, and she soon became his manager [71] [66] Steinberg organized a

businessman and politician, and Rose Kennedy (née Fitzgerald), a philanthropist and socialite [4] His paternal grandfather, P J Kennedy, was an East Boston ward boss and Massachusetts state legislator [5] Kennedy's maternal grandfather and namesake, John F Fitzgerald, was a U.S congressman and two-term mayor of Boston [6] All four of his grandparents were children of Irish immigrants [1] Kennedy had an older brother, Joseph Jr., and seven younger siblings: Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean, and Ted [7]\n\n\nU.S. Naval Reserve (1941–1945)\nKennedy planned to attend Yale Law School, but canceled when American entry into World War II seemed imminent [39] In 1940, Kennedy attempted to enter the army's Officer Candidate School Despite months of training, he was medically disqualified due to his chronic back problems On September 24, 1941, Kennedy, with the help of the director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and the former naval attaché to Joe Sr., Alan Kirk, joined the United States Naval Reserve He was commissioned an ensign on October 26, 1941, [40] and joined the ONI staff in Washington, D.C [41] [42] [43]\n\n\nCommanding PT-109 and PT-59\nIn April 1943, Kennedy was assigned to Motor Torpedo Squadron TWO, [41] and on April 24 he took command of PT-109, [46] then based on Tulagi Island in the Solomons [42] On the night of August 1–2, in support of the New Georgia campaign, PT-109 and fourteen other PTs were ordered to block or repel four Japanese destroyers and floatplanes carrying food, supplies, and 900 Japanese soldiers to the Vila Plantation garrison on the southern tip of the Solomon's Kolombangara Island Intelligence had been sent to Kennedy's Commander Thomas G Warfield expecting the arrival of the large Japanese naval force that would pass on the evening of August 1 Of the 24 torpedoes fired that night by eight of the American PTs, not one hit the Japanese convoy [47] On that moonless night, Kennedy spotted a Japanese destroyer heading north on its return from the base of Kolombangara around 2:00 a.m., and attempted to turn to attack, when PT-109 was rammed suddenly at an angle and cut in half by the destroyer Amagiri, killing two PT-109 crew members [48] [49] [42] [b] Avoiding surrender, the remaining crew swam towards Plum Pudding Island, 3.5 miles (5.6 km) southwest of the remains of PT-109, on August 2 [42] [51] Despite re-injuring his back in the collision, Kennedy towed a badly burned crewman to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth [52] From there, Kennedy and his subordinate, Ensign George Ross, made forays through the coral islands, searching for help [53] When they encountered an English-speaking native with a canoe, Kennedy carved his location on a coconut shell and requested a boat rescue Seven days after the collision, with the coconut message delivered, the PT-109 crew were rescued [54] [55]\n\n\nJournalism (1945)\nIn April 1945, Kennedy's father, who was a friend of William Randolph Hearst, arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent for Hearst Newspapers; the assignment kept Kennedy's name in the public eye and \"expose [d] him to journalism as a possible career.\" [71] That May he went to Berlin as a correspondent, [72] covering the Potsdam Conference and other events [73]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives (1947–1953)\nKennedy's elder brother Joe Jr had been the family's political standard-bearer and had been tapped by their father to seek the presidency After Joe's death, the assignment fell to JFK as the second eldest [74] Boston mayor Maurice J Tobin discussed the possibility of John becoming his running mate in 1946 as a candidate for Massachusetts lieutenant governor, but Joe Sr preferred a congressional campaign that could send John to Washington, where he could have national visibility [75]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (1953–1960)\nAs early as 1949, Kennedy began preparing to run for the Senate in 1952 against Republican three-term incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr with the campaign slogan \"KENNEDY WILL DO MORE FOR MASSACHUSETTS\" [91] Joe Sr again financed his son's candidacy (persuading the Boston Post to switch its support to Kennedy by promising the publisher a $500,000 loan), [92] while John's younger brother Robert emerged as campaign manager [93] Kennedy's mother and sisters contributed as highly effective canvassers by hosting a series of \"teas\" at hotels and parlors across Massachusetts to reach out to women voters [94] [95] In the presidential election, Republican Dwight D Eisenhower carried Massachusetts by 208,000 votes, but Kennedy narrowly defeated Lodge by 70,000 votes for the Senate seat [96] The following year, he married Jacqueline Bouvier [97]\n\n\n1960 presidential election\nOn January 2, 1960, Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination [136] Though some questioned Kennedy's age and experience, his

[137]\n\n\nPresidency (1961–1963)\nKennedy was sworn in as the 35th president at noon on January 20, 1961 In his inaugural address, he spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens: \"Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.\" He asked the nations of the world to join to fight what he called the \"common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.\" [159] He added:\n\n\nForeign policy\nKennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the Cold War Like his predecessors, Kennedy adopted the policy of containment to stop the spread of communism [165] Fearful of the possibility of nuclear war, Kennedy implemented a defense strategy known as flexible response This strategy relied on multiple options for responding to the Soviet Union, discouraged massive retaliation, and encouraged mutual deterrence [166] [167] In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the military-industrial complex, Kennedy focused on rearmament From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them [168]\n\n\nCold War and flexible response\nKennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the Cold War Like his predecessors, Kennedy adopted the policy of containment to stop the spread of communism [165] Fearful of the possibility of nuclear war, Kennedy implemented a defense strategy known as flexible response This strategy relied on multiple options for responding to the Soviet Union, discouraged massive retaliation, and encouraged mutual deterrence [166] [167] In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the military-industrial complex, Kennedy focused on rearmament From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them [168]\n\n\nDecolonization and the Congo Crisis\nBetween 1960 and 1963, twenty-four countries gained independence as the process of decolonization continued Kennedy set out to woo the leaders and people of the \"Third World,\" expanding economic aid and appointing knowledgeable ambassadors [171] His administration established the Food for Peace program and the Peace Corps to provide aid to developing countries The Food for Peace program became a central element in American foreign policy, and eventually helped many countries to develop their economies and become commercial import customers [172]\n\n\nPeace Corps\nIn one of his first presidential acts, Kennedy signed Executive Order 10924 that officially started the Peace Corps He named his brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, as its first director [177] Through this program, Americans volunteered to help developing countries in fields like education, farming, health care, and construction [178] Kennedy believed that countries that received Peace Corps volunteers were less likely to succumb to a communist revolution [179] Tanganyika (present-day Tanzania) and Ghana were the first countries to participate [180] The organization grew to 5,000 members by March 1963 and 10,000 the year after [181] Since 1961, over 200,000 Americans have joined the Peace Corps, representing 139 countries [182] [183]\n\n\nVienna Summit and the Berlin Wall\nKennedy anxiously anticipated a summit with Nikita Khrushchev The proceedings for the summit got off to a problematic start when Kennedy reacted aggressively to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961 The speech was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union, but Kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge His mistake helped raise tensions going into the Vienna summit [184] The summit would cover several topics, but both leaders knew that the most contentious issue would be Berlin, which had been divided in two with the start of the Cold War The enclave of West Berlin lay within Soviet-allied East Germany, but was supported by the U.S and other Western powers The Soviets wanted to reunify Berlin under the control of East Germany, partly due to the large number of East Germans who had fled to West Berlin [185]\n\n\nBay of Pigs Invasion\nThe Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime though an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Castro Cuban exiles [193] [194] led by CIA paramilitary officers [195] Kennedy had campaigned on a hardline stance against Castro, and when presented with the plan that had been developed under the Eisenhower administration, he enthusiastically adopted it regardless of the risk of inflaming tensions with the Soviet Union [196] Kennedy approved the final invasion plan on April 4, 1961 [197]\n\n\nOperation Mongoose\nIn late 1961, the White House formed the Special Group (Augmented), headed by Robert Kennedy and including Edward Lansdale, Secretary Robert McNamara, and others The group's objective—to overthrow Castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics—was never pursued [211] In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose [212] In March 1962, Kennedy rejected Operation Northwoods, proposals for false flag attacks against American military and civilian targets, [213] and blaming them on the Cuban government to gain approval for a war against Cuba However, the administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962 [212]\n\n\nCuban Missile Crisis\nIn the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs invasion, Khrushchev increased economic and military assistance to Cuba [214] The Soviet Union planned to allocate in Cuba 49 medium-range ballistic missiles, 32 intermediate-range ballistic missiles, 49 light Il-28 bombers and about 100 tactical nuclear weapons [215] The Kennedy administration viewed the growing Cuba-Soviet alliance with alarm, fearing that it could eventually pose a threat to the U.S [216] On October 14, 1962, CIA U-2 spy planes took photographs of the Soviets' construction of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and posed an immediate nuclear threat [217]\n\n\nLatin America and communism\nBelieving that \"those who make peaceful revolution impossible, will make violent revolution inevitable,\" [234] [235] Kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in Latin America by establishing the Alliance for Progress, which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region [236] In response to Kennedy's plea, Congress voted for an initial grant of $500 million in May 1961 [237] The Alliance for Progress supported the construction of housing, schools, airports, hospitals, clinics and water-purification projects as well as the distribution of free textbooks to students [238] However, the program did not meet many of its goals Massive land reform was not achieved; populations more than kept pace with gains in health and welfare; and according to one study, only 2 percent of economic growth in 1960s Latin America directly benefited the poor [239] [240] U.S presidents after Kennedy were less supportive of the program and by 1973, the permanent committee established to implement the Alliance was disbanded by the OAS [238]\n\n\nLaos\nAfter the election, Eisenhower emphasized to Kennedy that the communist threat in Southeast Asia required priority; Eisenhower considered Laos to be \"the cork in the bottle\" in regards to the regional threat [243] In March 1961, Kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a \"free\" Laos to a \"neutral\" Laos, indicating privately that Vietnam should be deemed America's tripwire for communism's spread in the area [243] Though he was unwilling to commit U.S forces to a major military intervention in Laos, Kennedy did approve CIA activities designed to defeat Communist insurgents through bombing raids and the recruitment of the Hmong people [244]\n\n\nVietnam\nDuring his presidency, Kennedy continued policies that provided political, economic, and military support to the South Vietnamese government [245] Vietnam had been divided into a communist North Vietnam and a non-communist South Vietnam after the 1954 Geneva Conference, but Kennedy escalated American involvement in Vietnam in 1961 by financing the South Vietnam army, increasing the number of U.S military advisors above the levels of the Eisenhower administration, and authorizing U.S helicopter units to provide support to South Vietnamese forces [246] On January 18, 1962, Kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) – \"Subversive Insurgency (War of Liberation).\" [247] Operation Ranch Hand, a large-scale aerial defoliation effort using the herbicide Agent Orange, began on the roadsides of South Vietnam to combat guerrilla defendants [248] [249]\n\n\nWest Berlin speech\nIn 1963, Germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to Soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of West German Chancellor Adenauer [269] At the same time, French President Charles de Gaulle was trying to build a Franco-West German counterweight to the American and Soviet spheres of influence [270] [271] [272] To Kennedy's eyes, this Franco-German cooperation seemed directed against NATO's influence in Europe [273]\n\n\nMiddle East\nKennedy ended the arms embargo that the Truman and Eisenhower administrations had enforced on Israel in favor of increased security ties, becoming the founder of the U.S.-Israeli military alliance Describing the protection of Israel as a moral and national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a 'special relationship' between the U.S and Israel [277] In 1962, the Kennedy administration sold Israel a major weapon system, the Hawk antiaircraft missile Historians differ as to whether Kennedy pursued security ties with Israel primarily to shore up support with Jewish-American voters, or because of his admiration of the Jewish state [278]\n\n\nIreland\nDuring his four-day visit to his ancestral home of Ireland beginning on June 26, 1963, [283] Kennedy accepted a grant of armorial bearings from the Chief Herald of Ireland, received honorary degrees from the National University of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin, attended a State Dinner in Dublin, and was conferred with the freedom of the towns and cities of Wexford, Cork, Dublin, Galway, and Limerick [284] [285] He visited the cottage at Dunganstown, near New Ross, County Wexford, where his ancestors had lived before emigrating to America [286]\n\n\nAmerican University speech\nOn June 10, 1963, Kennedy, at the high point of his rhetorical powers, [290] delivered the commencement address at American University Also known as \"A Strategy of Peace\", not only did Kennedy outline a plan to curb nuclear arms, but he also \"laid out a hopeful, yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the U.S and Soviet Union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race.\" [291] Kennedy also announced that the Soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, and that the U.S had postponed planned atmospheric tests [292]\n\n\nNuclear Test Ban Treaty\nTroubled by the long-term dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear proliferation, Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, originally conceived in Adlai Stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign [293] In their Vienna summit meeting in June 1961, Khrushchev and Kennedy reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but the Soviet Union began testing nuclear weapons that September In response, the United States conducted tests five days later [294] Shortly afterwards, new U.S satellites began delivering images that made it clear that the Soviets were substantially behind the U.S in the arms race [295] Nevertheless, the greater nuclear strength of the U.S was of little value as long as the Soviet Union perceived itself to be at parity [296]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nKennedy called his domestic proposals the \"New Frontier\" [301] However, Kennedy's small margin of victory in the 1960 election, his lack of deep connections to influential members of Congress, and his administration's focus on foreign policy hindered the passage of New Frontier policies [302]\n\n\nNew Frontier\nKennedy called his domestic proposals the \"New Frontier\" [301] However, Kennedy's small margin of victory in the 1960 election, his lack of deep connections to influential members of Congress, and his administration's focus on foreign policy hindered the passage of New Frontier policies [302]\n\n\nTaxes\nWalter Heller, who served as the chairman of the CEA, advocated for a Keynesian-style tax cut designed to help spur economic growth, and Kennedy adopted this policy [312] The idea was that a tax cut would stimulate consumer demand, which in turn would lead to higher economic growth, lower unemployment, and increased federal revenues [313] To the disappointment of liberals like John Kenneth Galbraith, Kennedy's embrace of the tax cut shifted his administration's focus away from the proposed old-age health insurance program and other domestic expenditures [314] In January 1963, Kennedy proposed a tax cut that would reduce the top marginal tax rate from 91 to 65 percent, and lower the corporate tax rate from 52 to 47 percent The predictions according to the Keynesian model indicated the cuts would decrease income taxes by about $10 billion and corporate taxes by about $3.5 billion The plan included reforms designed to reduce the impact of itemized deductions, as well as provisions to help the elderly and handicapped Republicans and many Southern Democrats opposed the bill, calling for simultaneous reductions in expenditures, but debate continued throughout 1963 [315] Three months after Kennedy died, Johnson pushed the plan through Congress The Revenue Act of 1964 lowered the top individual rate to 70 percent, and the top corporate rate to 48 percent [316]\n\n\nEconomy\nKennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and to encourage growth of the economy [317] He presided over the first government budget to top the $100 billion mark, in 1962, and his first budget in 1961 resulted in the nation's first non-war, non-recession deficit [318] The economy, which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when Kennedy took office, accelerated notably throughout his administration Despite low inflation and interest rates, the GDP had grown by an average of only 2.2% per annum during the Eisenhower administration (scarcely more than population growth at the time), and it had declined by 1% during Eisenhower's last twelve months in office [319]\n\n\nCivil rights movement\nKennedy verbally supported civil rights during his 1960 presidential campaign; he telephoned Coretta Scott King, wife of Martin Luther King Jr., who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter Robert Kennedy called Georgia Governor Ernest Vandiver and obtained King's release from prison, which drew additional Black support to his brother's candidacy [327] Recognizing that conservative Southern Democrats could block legislation, Kennedy did not introduce civil rights legislation on taking office [328] He needed their support to pass his economic and foreign policy agendas, and to support his reelection in 1964 [329] Kennedy did appoint many Blacks to office, including civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall to the U.S Court of Appeals [330]\n\n\nStatus of women\nDuring the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy endorsed the concept of equal pay for equal work [354] In December 1961, Kennedy signed an executive order creating the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women to advise him on issues concerning the status of women [355] Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt led the commission The commission's final report was issued in October 1963; it documented the legal and cultural discrimination women in America faced and made several policy recommendations to bring about change [356] On June 10, 1963, Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which amended the Fair Labor Standards Act and abolished wage disparity based on sex [357]\n\n\nCrime\nUnder the leadership of the attorney general, the Kennedy administration shifted the focus of the Justice Department, the FBI, and the IRS to organized crime Kennedy won congressional approval for five bills (i.e., Federal Wire Act of 1961) designed to crack down on interstate racketeering, gambling, and the transportation of firearms [358] [359]\n\n\nAgriculture\nKennedy had relatively little interest in agricultural issues, but he sought to remedy the issue of overproduction, boost the income of farmers, and lower federal expenditures on agriculture Under the direction of Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, the administration sought to limit the production of farmers, but these proposals were generally defeated in Congress To increase demand for domestic agricultural products and help the impoverished, Kennedy launched a pilot Food Stamp program and expanded the federal school lunch program [362]\n\n\nNative American relations\nConstruction of the Kinzua Dam flooded 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares) of Seneca nation land that they had occupied under the Treaty of 1794, and forced 600 Seneca to relocate to Salamanca, New York Kennedy was asked by the American Civil Liberties Union to halt the project, but he declined, citing a critical need for flood control He expressed concern about the plight of the Seneca and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land, damages, and assistance to mitigate their displacement [363] [364]\n\n\nSpace policy\nIn the aftermath of the Soviet launch of Sputnik 1, the first artificial Earth satellite, NASA proposed a crewed lunar landing by the early 1970s [365] Funding for the program, known as the Apollo program, was far from certain as Eisenhower held an ambivalent attitude [366] Early in his presidency, Kennedy was poised to dismantle the crewed space program, but he postponed any decision out of deference to Vice President Johnson, who had been a strong supporter of the program in the Senate [367] With Jerome Wiesner, Johnson was given a major role in overseeing the administration's space policy, and at Johnson's recommendation Kennedy appointed James E Webb to head NASA [368]\n\n\nJudicial appointments\nIn 1962, Kennedy appointed justices Byron White and Arthur Goldberg to the Supreme Court [378] Additionally, Kennedy appointed 21 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 102 judges to the United States district courts [379]\n\n\nAssassination\nKennedy was assassinated in Dallas at 12:30 p.m Central Standard Time on November 22, 1963 [380] He was in Texas on a political trip to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberals Ralph Yarborough and Don Yarborough (no relation) and conservative John Connally [381] Traveling in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza, he was shot once in the back, the bullet exiting via his throat, and once in the head [382] [383]\n\n\nFuneral\nKennedy's body was brought back to Washington On November 23, six military pallbearers carried the flag-draped coffin into the East Room of the White House, where he lay in repose for 24 hours [396] [397] Then, the coffin was carried on a horse-drawn caisson to the Capitol to lie in state Throughout the day and night, hundreds of thousands lined up to view the guarded casket, [398] [399] with a quarter million passing through the rotunda during the 18 hours of lying in state [398]\n\n\nPersonal life, family, and reputation\nThe Kennedy family is one of the most established political families in the United States, having produced a president, three senators, three ambassadors, and multiple other representatives and politicians While a congressman, Kennedy embarked on a seven-week trip to India, Japan, Vietnam, and Israel in 1951, at which point he became close with his then 25-year-old brother Robert, as well as his 27-year-old sister Patricia Because they were several years apart in age, the brothers had previously seen little of each other This 25,000-mile (40,000 km) trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends [404] Robert would eventually serve as his brother's attorney general and closest presidential advisor; [404] he would later run for president in 1968 before his assassination, while another Kennedy brother, Ted, ran for president in 1980 [405]\n\n\nWife and children\nKennedy met his wife, Jacqueline Lee \"Jackie\" Bouvier, when he was a congressman Charles L Bartlett, a journalist, introduced the pair at a dinner party [406] They were married on September 12, 1953, at St Mary's Church in Newport, Rhode Island [407] [408] The newlyweds honeymooned in Mexico, before settling in their new home, Hickory Hill in McLean, Virginia [409] In 1956, they sold their Hickory Hill estate to Kennedy's brother Robert, and bought a townhouse in Georgetown [410] [411] The Kennedys also resided at an apartment in Boston, their legal residence during John's congressional career, [412] [413] and a summer home in Cape Cod, Massachusetts [414]\n\n\nPopular image\nKennedy and his wife were younger than the presidents and first ladies who preceded them, and both were popular in the media culture in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of photo spreads in popular magazines Although Eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television, Kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast live and made good use of the medium [417] In 1961, the Radio-Television News Directors Association presented Kennedy with its highest honor, the Paul White Award, in recognition of his open relationship with the media [418]\n\n\nHealth\nDespite a privileged youth, Kennedy was plagued by childhood diseases, including whooping cough, chicken pox, measles, and ear infections These ailments compelled him to spend a considerable amount of time convalescing Three months prior to his third birthday, in 1920, Kennedy came down with scarlet fever, a highly contagious and life-threatening disease, and was admitted to Boston City Hospital [422] [15]\n\n\nAffairs and friendships\nKennedy was single in the 1940s while having relationships with Danish journalist Inga Arvad [434] and actress Gene Tierney [435] During his time as a senator, he had an affair with Gunilla von Post, who later wrote that the future president tried to end his marriage to be with her before having any children with his wife [436] Kennedy was also reported to have had affairs with Marilyn Monroe, [437] Judith Campbell, [438] Mary Pinchot Meyer, [439] Marlene Dietrich, [30] White House intern Mimi Alford, [440] and his wife's press secretary, Pamela Turnure [441] There have been several conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Monroe, alleging that Kennedy may have had a part in her death [442]\n\n\nSports\nKennedy was a fan of Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox and the National Basketball Association's Boston Celtics [452] [453] Growing up on Cape Cod, Kennedy and his siblings developed a lifelong passion for sailing [454] He also took up golf; playing  regularly at the Hyannisport Club in Massachusetts and the Palm Beach Country Club in Florida [452] [455]\n\n\nReligion\nKennedy was the first Catholic elected to the presidency [456] During his childhood, he attended St Aidan's Church in Brookline, Massachusetts, where he was baptized on June 19, 1917 [457]\n\n\nHistorical evaluations and legacy\nHistorians and political scientists tend to rank Kennedy as an above-average president, and he is usually the highest-ranking president who served less than one full term [458] A 2014 survey from The Washington Post of 162 members of the American Political Science Association's Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Kennedy 14th highest overall among the 43 persons who have been president, including then-president Barack Obama The survey found Kennedy to be the most overrated U.S president [459] A 2017 C-SPAN survey has Kennedy ranked among the top ten presidents [460] A 2023 Gallup, Inc survey showed Kennedy with a retrospective approval rating of 90 percent, the highest of all U.S presidents in recent history [461] Assessments of his policies are mixed [462] [463] Many of Kennedy's legislative proposals were passed after his death, during the Johnson administration, and Kennedy's death gave those proposals a powerful moral component [464]\n\n\nPresidency\nHistorians and political scientists tend to rank Kennedy as an above-average president, and he is usually the highest-ranking president who served less

that era of American history [469] According to Richard Dean Burns and Joseph M Siracusa, the most popular theme surrounding Kennedy's legacy is its replay of the legend of King Arthur and Camelot from Arthurian Literature [470] In an interview following Kennedy's death, his widow Jacqueline mentioned his affection for the Broadway musical Camelot and quoted its closing lines: \"Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief, shining moment that was known as Camelot.\" [471] [472] Critics, especially historians, have mocked the Camelot myth as a distortion of Kennedy's actions, beliefs, and policies However, in the public memory, the years of Kennedy's presidency are still seen as a brief, brilliant, and shining moment [473] [474]\n\n\nMemorials and

Kennedy or JFK, was the 35th President of the United States. He served from January 20, 1961, until his assassination on November 22, 1963. Kennedy's presidency was marked by significant events, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Berlin Wall, and the beginning of the American space program. He was the first Catholic to be elected President and is remembered for his charisma, leadership, and vision for America.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts, to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Kennedy. His paternal grandfather, P.J. Kennedy, was an East Boston ward boss and Massachusetts state legislator, and his maternal grandfather, John F. Fitzgerald, was a U.S. congressman and two-term mayor of Boston. Kennedy's parents were both children of Irish immigrants. He had an older brother, Joseph Jr., and seven younger siblings: Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean, and Ted.\n\n**U.S. Naval Reserve (1941–1945)**\n\nKennedy planned to attend Yale Law School, but canceled when American entry into World War II seemed imminent. In 1940, he attempted to enter the army's Officer Candidate School, but was medically disqualified due to his chronic back problems. In September 1941, Kennedy joined the United States Naval Reserve, with the help of the director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and the former naval attaché to Joe Sr., Alan Kirk. He was commissioned as an ensign on October 26, 1941, and joined the ONI staff in Washington, D.C.\n\n**Commanding PT-109 and PT-59**\n\nIn April 1943, Kennedy was assigned to Motor Torpedo Squadron TWO. On April 24, he took command of PT-109, then based on Tulagi Island in the Solomons. On the night of August 1-2, PT-109 and fourteen other PTs were ordered to block or repel four Japanese destroyers and floatplanes carrying food, supplies, and 900 Japanese soldiers to the Vila Plantation garrison on the southern tip of the Solomon's Kolombangara Island. Kennedy spotted a Japanese destroyer heading north on its return from the base of Kolombangara around 2:00 a.m. and attempted to turn to attack, when PT-109 was suddenly rammed and cut in half by the destroyer Amagiri, killing two crew members. Kennedy swam towards Plum Pudding Island, 3.5 miles southwest of the remains of PT-109, on August 2, despite re-injuring his back in the collision.\n\n**Journalism (1945)**\n\nIn April 1945, Kennedy's father arranged a position for him as a special correspondent for Hearst Newspapers. The assignment kept Kennedy's name in the public eye and \"expose[d] him to journalism as a possible career.\" He went to Berlin as a correspondent and covered the Potsdam Conference and other events.\n\n**U.S. House of Representatives (1947–1953)**\n\nAfter the death of his brother Joe Jr., Kennedy became the family's political standard-bearer. He won a House seat in 1946 and was a member of the House Armed Services Committee. He served two terms in the House before running for the Senate.\n\n**U.S. Senate (1953–1960)**\n\nKennedy began preparing to run for the Senate in 1949. He won the election in 1952, defeating Republican three-term incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. He served two terms in the Senate, focusing on foreign policy and international relations.\n\n**1960 Presidential Election**\n\nOn January 2, 1960, Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. He won the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles and went on to defeat Republican candidate Richard Nixon in the general election.\n\n**Presidency (1961–1963)**\n\nKennedy was inaugurated as the 35th President of the United States on January 20, 1961. His presidency was marked by significant events, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Berlin Wall, and the beginning of the American space program.\n\n**Foreign Policy**\n\nKennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the Cold War. He adopted the policy of containment to stop the spread of communism and implemented a defense strategy known as flexible response. He also focused on rearmament, increasing the number of nuclear weapons and B-52 bombers.\n\n**Domestic Policy**\n\nKennedy called his domestic proposals the \"New Frontier.\" He focused on issues such as tax cuts, economic growth, and civil rights. He proposed a tax cut that would reduce the top marginal tax rate from 91 to 65 percent and lower the corporate tax rate from 52 to 47 percent.\n\n**Civil Rights**\n\nKennedy verbally supported civil rights during his 1960 presidential campaign. He appointed many Blacks to office, including civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall to the U.S Court of Appeals.\n\n**Assassination**\n\nKennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963, while riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza. He was shot once in the back and once in the head.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nKennedy's legacy is a subject of ongoing debate and discussion. He is remembered for his charisma, leadership, and vision for America. The term \"Camelot\" is often used to describe his presidency, reflecting both the mythic grandeur accorded Kennedy in death and powerful nostalgia for that era of American history.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"John_F._Kennedy\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy was born outside Boston in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917, [3] to Joseph P Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician, and Rose Kennedy (née Fitzgerald), a philanthropist and socialite [4] His paternal grandfather, P J Kennedy, was an East Boston ward boss and Massachusetts state legislator [5] Kennedy's maternal grandfather and namesake, John F Fitzgerald, was a U.S congressman and two-term mayor of Boston [6] All four of his grandparents were children of Irish immigrants [1] Kennedy had an older brother, Joseph Jr., and seven younger siblings: Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean, and Ted [7]\n\n\nU.S. Naval Reserve (1941–1945)\nKennedy planned to attend Yale Law School, but canceled when American entry into World War II seemed imminent [39] In 1940, Kennedy attempted to enter the army's Officer Candidate School Despite months of training, he was medically disqualified due to his chronic back problems On September 24, 1941, Kennedy, with the help of the director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and the former naval attaché to Joe Sr., Alan Kirk, joined the United States Naval Reserve He was commissioned an ensign on October 26, 1941, [40] and joined the ONI staff in Washington, D.C [41] [42] [43]\n\n\nCommanding PT-109 and PT-59\nIn April 1943, Kennedy was assigned to Motor Torpedo Squadron TWO, [41] and on April 24 he took command of PT-109, [46] then based on Tulagi Island in the Solomons [42] On the night of August 1–2, in support of the New Georgia campaign, PT-109 and fourteen other PTs were ordered to block or repel four Japanese destroyers and floatplanes carrying food, supplies, and 900 Japanese soldiers to the Vila Plantation garrison on the southern tip of the Solomon's Kolombangara Island Intelligence had been sent to Kennedy's Commander Thomas G Warfield expecting the arrival of the large Japanese naval force that would pass on the evening of August 1 Of the 24 torpedoes fired that night by eight of the American PTs, not one hit the Japanese convoy [47] On that moonless night, Kennedy spotted a Japanese destroyer heading north on its return from the base of Kolombangara around 2:00 a.m., and attempted to turn to attack, when PT-109 was rammed suddenly at an angle and cut in half by the destroyer Amagiri, killing two PT-109 crew members [48] [49] [42] [b] Avoiding surrender, the remaining crew swam towards Plum Pudding Island, 3.5 miles (5.6 km) southwest of the remains of PT-109, on August 2 [42] [51] Despite re-injuring his back in the collision, Kennedy towed a badly burned crewman to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth [52] From there, Kennedy and his subordinate, Ensign George Ross, made forays through the coral islands, searching for help [53] When they encountered an English-speaking native with a canoe, Kennedy carved his location on a coconut shell and requested a boat rescue Seven days after the collision, with the coconut message delivered, the PT-109 crew were rescued [54] [55]\n\n\nJournalism (1945)\nIn April 1945, Kennedy's father, who was a friend of William Randolph Hearst, arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent for Hearst Newspapers; the assignment kept Kennedy's name in the public eye and \"expose [d] him to journalism as a possible career.\" [71] That May he went to Berlin as a correspondent, [72] covering the Potsdam Conference and other events [73]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives (1947–1953)\nKennedy's elder brother Joe Jr had been the family's political standard-bearer and had been tapped by their father to seek the presidency After Joe's death, the assignment fell to JFK as the second eldest [74] Boston mayor Maurice J Tobin discussed the possibility of John becoming his running mate in 1946 as a candidate for Massachusetts lieutenant governor, but Joe Sr preferred a congressional campaign that could send John to Washington, where he could have national visibility [75]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (1953–1960)\nAs early as 1949, Kennedy began preparing to run for the Senate in 1952 against Republican three-term incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr with the campaign slogan \"KENNEDY WILL DO MORE FOR MASSACHUSETTS\" [91] Joe Sr again financed his son's candidacy (persuading the Boston Post to switch its support to Kennedy by promising the publisher a $500,000 loan), [92] while John's younger brother Robert emerged as campaign manager [93] Kennedy's mother and sisters contributed as highly effective canvassers by hosting a series of \"teas\" at hotels and parlors across Massachusetts to reach out to women voters [94] [95] In the presidential election, Republican Dwight D Eisenhower carried Massachusetts by 208,000 votes, but Kennedy narrowly defeated Lodge by 70,000 votes for the Senate seat [96] The following year, he married Jacqueline Bouvier [97]\n\n\n1960 presidential election\nOn January 2, 1960, Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination [136] Though some questioned Kennedy's age and experience, his charisma and eloquence earned him numerous supporters Kennedy faced several potential challengers, including Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson, Adlai Stevenson II, and Senator Hubert Humphrey [137]\n\n\nPresidency (1961–1963)\nKennedy was sworn in as the 35th president at noon on January 20, 1961 In his inaugural address, he spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens: \"Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.\" He asked the nations of the world to join to fight what he called the \"common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.\" [159] He added:\n\n\nForeign policy\nKennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the Cold War Like his predecessors, Kennedy adopted the policy of containment to stop the spread of communism [165] Fearful of the possibility of nuclear war, Kennedy implemented a defense strategy known as flexible response This strategy relied on multiple options for responding to the Soviet Union, discouraged massive retaliation, and encouraged mutual deterrence [166] [167] In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the military-industrial complex, Kennedy focused on rearmament From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them [168]\n\n\nCold War and flexible response\nKennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the Cold War Like his predecessors, Kennedy adopted the policy of containment to stop the spread of communism [165] Fearful of the possibility of nuclear war, Kennedy implemented a defense strategy known as flexible response This strategy relied on multiple options for responding to the Soviet Union, discouraged massive retaliation, and encouraged mutual deterrence [166] [167] In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the military-industrial complex, Kennedy focused on rearmament From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them [168]\n\n\nDecolonization and the Congo Crisis\nBetween 1960 and 1963, twenty-four countries gained independence as the process of decolonization continued Kennedy set out to woo the leaders and people of the \"Third World,\" expanding economic aid and appointing knowledgeable ambassadors [171] His administration established the Food for Peace program and the Peace Corps to provide aid to developing countries The Food for Peace program became a central element in American foreign policy, and eventually helped many countries to develop their economies and become commercial import customers [172]\n\n\nPeace Corps\nIn one of his first presidential acts, Kennedy signed Executive Order 10924 that officially started the Peace Corps He named his brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, as its first director [177] Through this program, Americans volunteered to help developing countries in fields like education, farming, health care, and construction [178] Kennedy believed that countries that received Peace Corps volunteers were less likely to succumb to a communist revolution [179] Tanganyika (present-day Tanzania) and Ghana were the first countries to participate [180] The organization grew to 5,000 members by March 1963 and 10,000 the year after [181] Since 1961, over 200,000 Americans have joined the Peace Corps, representing 139 countries [182] [183]\n\n\nVienna Summit and the Berlin Wall\nKennedy anxiously anticipated a summit with Nikita Khrushchev The proceedings for the summit got off to a problematic start when Kennedy reacted aggressively to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961 The speech was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union, but Kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge His mistake helped raise tensions going into the Vienna summit [184] The summit would cover several topics, but both leaders knew that the most contentious issue would be Berlin, which had been divided in two with the start of the Cold War The enclave of West Berlin lay within Soviet-allied East Germany, but was supported by the U.S and other Western powers The Soviets wanted to reunify Berlin under the control of East Germany, partly due to the large number of East Germans who had fled to West Berlin [185]\n\n\nBay of Pigs Invasion\nThe Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime though an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Castro Cuban exiles [193] [194] led by CIA paramilitary officers [195] Kennedy had campaigned on a hardline stance against Castro, and when presented with the plan that had been developed under the Eisenhower administration, he enthusiastically adopted it regardless of the risk of inflaming tensions with the Soviet Union [196] Kennedy approved the final invasion plan on April 4, 1961 [197]\n\n\nOperation Mongoose\nIn late 1961, the White House formed the Special Group (Augmented), headed by Robert Kennedy and including Edward Lansdale, Secretary Robert McNamara, and others The group's objective—to overthrow Castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics—was never pursued [211] In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose [212] In March 1962, Kennedy rejected Operation Northwoods, proposals for false flag attacks against American military and civilian targets, [213] and blaming them on the Cuban government to gain approval for a war against Cuba However, the administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962 [212]\n\n\nCuban Missile Crisis\nIn the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs invasion, Khrushchev increased economic and military assistance to Cuba [214] The Soviet Union planned to allocate in Cuba 49 medium-range ballistic missiles, 32 intermediate-range ballistic missiles, 49 light Il-28 bombers and about 100 tactical nuclear weapons [215] The Kennedy administration viewed the growing Cuba-Soviet alliance with alarm, fearing that it could eventually pose a threat to the U.S [216] On October 14, 1962, CIA U-2 spy planes took photographs of the Soviets' construction of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and posed an immediate nuclear threat [217]\n\n\nLatin America and communism\nBelieving that \"those who make peaceful revolution impossible, will make violent revolution inevitable,\" [234] [235] Kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in Latin America by establishing the Alliance for Progress, which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region [236] In response to Kennedy's plea, Congress voted for an initial grant of $500 million in May 1961 [237] The Alliance for Progress supported the construction of housing, schools, airports, hospitals, clinics and water-purification projects as well as the distribution of free textbooks to students [238] However, the program did not meet many of its goals Massive land reform was not achieved; populations more than kept pace with gains in health and welfare; and according to one study, only 2 percent of economic growth in 1960s Latin America directly benefited the poor [239] [240] U.S presidents after Kennedy were less supportive of the program and by 1973, the permanent committee established to implement the Alliance was disbanded by the OAS [238]\n\n\nLaos\nAfter the election, Eisenhower emphasized to Kennedy that the communist threat in Southeast Asia required priority; Eisenhower considered Laos to be \"the cork in the bottle\" in regards to the regional threat [243] In March 1961, Kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a \"free\" Laos to a \"neutral\" Laos, indicating privately that Vietnam should be deemed America's tripwire for communism's spread in the area [243] Though he was unwilling to commit U.S forces to a major military intervention in Laos, Kennedy did approve CIA activities designed to defeat Communist insurgents through bombing raids and the recruitment of the Hmong people [244]\n\n\nVietnam\nDuring his presidency, Kennedy continued policies that provided political, economic, and military support to the South Vietnamese government [245] Vietnam had been divided into a communist North Vietnam and a non-communist South Vietnam after the 1954 Geneva Conference, but Kennedy escalated American involvement in Vietnam in 1961 by financing the South Vietnam army, increasing the number of U.S military advisors above the levels of the Eisenhower administration, and authorizing U.S helicopter units to provide support to South Vietnamese forces [246] On January 18, 1962, Kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) – \"Subversive Insurgency (War of Liberation).\" [247] Operation Ranch Hand, a large-scale aerial defoliation effort using the herbicide Agent Orange, began on the roadsides of South Vietnam to combat guerrilla defendants [248] [249]\n\n\nWest Berlin speech\nIn 1963, Germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to Soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of West German Chancellor Adenauer [269] At the same time, French President Charles de Gaulle was trying to build a Franco-West German counterweight to the American and Soviet spheres of influence [270] [271] [272] To Kennedy's eyes, this Franco-German cooperation seemed directed against NATO's influence in Europe [273]\n\n\nMiddle East\nKennedy ended the arms embargo that the Truman and Eisenhower administrations had enforced on Israel in favor of increased security ties, becoming the founder of the U.S.-Israeli military alliance Describing the protection of Israel as a moral and national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a 'special relationship' between the U.S and Israel [277] In 1962, the Kennedy administration sold Israel a major weapon system, the Hawk antiaircraft missile Historians differ as to whether Kennedy pursued security ties with Israel primarily to shore up support with Jewish-American voters, or because of his admiration of the Jewish state [278]\n\n\nIreland\nDuring his four-day visit to his ancestral home of Ireland beginning on June 26, 1963, [283] Kennedy accepted a grant of armorial bearings from the Chief Herald of Ireland, received honorary degrees from the National University of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin, attended a State Dinner in Dublin, and was conferred with the freedom of the towns and cities of Wexford, Cork, Dublin, Galway, and Limerick [284] [285] He visited the cottage at Dunganstown, near New Ross, County Wexford, where his ancestors had lived before emigrating to America [286]\n\n\nAmerican University speech\nOn June 10, 1963, Kennedy, at the high point of his rhetorical powers, [290] delivered the commencement address at American University Also known as \"A Strategy of Peace\", not only did Kennedy outline a plan to curb nuclear arms, but he also \"laid out a hopeful, yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the U.S and Soviet Union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race.\" [291] Kennedy also announced that the Soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, and that the U.S had postponed planned atmospheric tests [292]\n\n\nNuclear Test Ban Treaty\nTroubled by the long-term dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear proliferation, Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, originally conceived in Adlai Stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign [293] In their Vienna summit meeting in June 1961, Khrushchev and Kennedy reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but the Soviet Union began testing nuclear weapons that September In response, the United States conducted tests five days later [294] Shortly afterwards, new U.S satellites began delivering images that made it clear that the Soviets were substantially behind the U.S in the arms race [295] Nevertheless, the greater nuclear strength of the U.S was of little value as long as the Soviet Union perceived itself to be at parity [296]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nKennedy called his domestic proposals the \"New Frontier\" [301] However, Kennedy's small margin of victory in the 1960 election, his lack of deep connections to influential members of Congress, and his administration's focus on foreign policy hindered the passage of New Frontier policies [302]\n\n\nNew Frontier\nKennedy called his domestic proposals the \"New Frontier\" [301] However, Kennedy's small margin of victory in the 1960 election, his lack of deep connections to influential members of Congress, and his administration's focus on foreign policy hindered the passage of New Frontier policies [302]\n\n\nTaxes\nWalter Heller, who served as the chairman of the CEA, advocated for a Keynesian-style tax cut designed to help spur economic growth, and Kennedy adopted this policy [312] The idea was that a tax cut would stimulate consumer demand, which in turn would lead to higher economic growth, lower unemployment, and increased federal revenues [313] To the disappointment of liberals like John Kenneth Galbraith, Kennedy's embrace of the tax cut shifted his administration's focus away from the proposed old-age health insurance program and other domestic expenditures [314] In January 1963, Kennedy proposed a tax cut that would reduce the top marginal tax rate from 91 to 65 percent, and lower the corporate tax rate from 52 to 47 percent The predictions according to the Keynesian model indicated the cuts would decrease income taxes by about $10 billion and corporate taxes by about $3.5 billion The plan included reforms designed to reduce the impact of itemized deductions, as well as provisions to help the elderly and handicapped Republicans and many Southern Democrats opposed the bill, calling for simultaneous reductions in expenditures, but debate continued throughout 1963 [315] Three months after Kennedy died, Johnson pushed the plan through Congress The Revenue Act of 1964 lowered the top individual rate to 70 percent, and the top corporate rate to 48 percent [316]\n\n\nEconomy\nKennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and to encourage growth of the economy [317] He presided over the first government budget to top the $100 billion mark, in 1962, and his first budget in 1961 resulted in the nation's first non-war, non-recession deficit [318] The economy, which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when Kennedy took office, accelerated notably throughout his administration Despite low inflation and interest rates, the GDP had grown by an average of only 2.2% per annum during the Eisenhower administration (scarcely more than population growth at the time), and it had declined by 1% during Eisenhower's last twelve months in office [319]\n\n\nCivil rights movement\nKennedy verbally supported civil rights during his 1960 presidential campaign; he telephoned Coretta Scott King, wife of Martin Luther King Jr., who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter Robert Kennedy called Georgia Governor Ernest Vandiver and obtained King's release from prison, which drew additional Black support to his brother's candidacy [327] Recognizing that conservative Southern Democrats could block legislation, Kennedy did not introduce civil rights legislation on taking office [328] He needed their support to pass his economic and foreign policy agendas, and to support his reelection in 1964 [329] Kennedy did appoint many Blacks to office, including civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall to the U.S Court of Appeals [330]\n\n\nStatus of women\nDuring the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy endorsed the concept of equal pay for equal work [354] In December 1961, Kennedy signed an executive order creating the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women to advise him on issues concerning the status of women [355] Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt led the commission The commission's final report was issued in October 1963; it documented the legal and cultural discrimination women in America faced and made several policy recommendations to bring about change [356] On June 10, 1963, Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which amended the Fair Labor Standards Act and abolished wage disparity based on sex [357]\n\n\nCrime\nUnder the leadership of the attorney general, the Kennedy administration shifted the focus of the Justice Department, the FBI, and the IRS to organized crime Kennedy won congressional approval for five bills (i.e., Federal Wire Act of 1961) designed to crack down on interstate racketeering, gambling, and the transportation of firearms [358] [359]\n\n\nAgriculture\nKennedy had relatively little interest in agricultural issues, but he sought to remedy the issue of overproduction, boost the income of farmers, and lower federal expenditures on agriculture Under the direction of Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, the administration sought to limit the production of farmers, but these proposals were generally defeated in Congress To increase demand for domestic agricultural products and help the impoverished, Kennedy launched a pilot Food Stamp program and expanded the federal school lunch program [362]\n\n\nNative American relations\nConstruction of the Kinzua Dam flooded 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares) of Seneca nation land that they had occupied under the Treaty of 1794, and forced 600 Seneca to relocate to Salamanca, New York Kennedy was asked by the American Civil Liberties Union to halt the project, but he declined, citing a critical need for flood control He expressed concern about the plight of the Seneca and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land, damages, and assistance to mitigate their displacement [363] [364]\n\n\nSpace policy\nIn the aftermath of the Soviet launch of Sputnik 1, the first artificial Earth satellite, NASA proposed a crewed lunar landing by the early 1970s [365] Funding for the program, known as the Apollo program, was far from certain as Eisenhower held an ambivalent attitude [366] Early in his presidency, Kennedy was poised to dismantle the crewed space program, but he postponed any decision out of deference to Vice President Johnson, who had been a strong supporter of the program in the Senate [367] With Jerome Wiesner, Johnson was given a major role in overseeing the administration's space policy, and at Johnson's recommendation Kennedy appointed James E Webb to head NASA [368]\n\n\nJudicial appointments\nIn 1962, Kennedy appointed justices Byron White and Arthur Goldberg to the Supreme Court [378] Additionally, Kennedy appointed 21 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 102 judges to the United States district courts [379]\n\n\nAssassination\nKennedy was assassinated in Dallas at 12:30 p.m Central Standard Time on November 22, 1963 [380] He was in Texas on a political trip to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberals Ralph Yarborough and Don Yarborough (no relation) and conservative John Connally [381] Traveling in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza, he was shot once in the back, the bullet exiting via his throat, and once in the head [382] [383]\n\n\nFuneral\nKennedy's body was brought back to Washington On November 23, six military pallbearers carried the flag-draped coffin into the East Room of the White House, where he lay in repose for 24 hours [396] [397] Then, the coffin was carried on a horse-drawn caisson to the Capitol to lie in state Throughout the day and night, hundreds of thousands lined up to view the guarded casket, [398] [399] with a quarter million passing through the rotunda during the 18 hours of lying in state [398]\n\n\nPersonal life, family, and reputation\nThe Kennedy family is one of the most established political families in the United States, having produced a president, three senators, three ambassadors, and multiple other representatives and politicians While a congressman, Kennedy embarked on a seven-week trip to India, Japan, Vietnam, and Israel in 1951, at which point he became close with his then 25-year-old brother Robert, as well as his 27-year-old sister Patricia Because they were several years apart in age, the brothers had previously seen little of each other This 25,000-mile (40,000 km) trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends [404] Robert would eventually serve as his brother's attorney general and closest presidential advisor; [404] he would later run for president in 1968 before his assassination, while another Kennedy brother, Ted, ran for president in 1980 [405]\n\n\nWife and children\nKennedy met his wife, Jacqueline Lee \"Jackie\" Bouvier, when he was a congressman Charles L Bartlett, a journalist, introduced the pair at a dinner party [406] They were married on September 12, 1953, at St Mary's Church in Newport, Rhode Island [407] [408] The newlyweds honeymooned in Mexico, before settling in their new home, Hickory Hill in McLean, Virginia [409] In 1956, they sold their Hickory Hill estate to Kennedy's brother Robert, and bought a townhouse in Georgetown [410] [411] The Kennedys also resided at an apartment in Boston, their legal residence during John's congressional career, [412] [413] and a summer home in Cape Cod, Massachusetts [414]\n\n\nPopular image\nKennedy and his wife were younger than the presidents and first ladies who preceded them, and both were popular in the media culture in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of photo spreads in popular magazines Although Eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television, Kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast live and made good use of the medium [417] In 1961, the Radio-Television News Directors Association presented Kennedy with its highest honor, the Paul White Award, in recognition of his open relationship with the media [418]\n\n\nHealth\nDespite a privileged youth, Kennedy was plagued by childhood diseases, including whooping cough, chicken pox, measles, and ear infections These ailments compelled him to spend a considerable amount of time convalescing Three months prior to his third birthday, in 1920, Kennedy came down with scarlet fever, a highly contagious and life-threatening disease, and was admitted to Boston City Hospital [422] [15]\n\n\nAffairs and friendships\nKennedy was single in the 1940s while having relationships with Danish journalist Inga Arvad [434] and actress Gene Tierney [435] During his time as a senator, he had an affair with Gunilla von Post, who later wrote that the future president tried to end his marriage to be with her before having any children with his wife [436] Kennedy was also reported to have had affairs with Marilyn Monroe, [437] Judith Campbell, [438] Mary Pinchot Meyer, [439] Marlene Dietrich, [30] White House intern Mimi Alford, [440] and his wife's press secretary, Pamela Turnure [441] There have been several conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Monroe, alleging that Kennedy may have had a part in her death [442]\n\n\nSports\nKennedy was a fan of Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox and the National Basketball Association's Boston Celtics [452] [453] Growing up on Cape Cod, Kennedy and his siblings developed a lifelong passion for sailing [454] He also took up golf; playing  regularly at the Hyannisport Club in Massachusetts and the Palm Beach Country Club in Florida [452] [455]\n\n\nReligion\nKennedy was the first Catholic elected to the presidency [456] During his childhood, he attended St Aidan's Church in Brookline, Massachusetts, where he was baptized on June 19, 1917 [457]\n\n\nHistorical evaluations and legacy\nHistorians and political scientists tend to rank Kennedy as an above-average president, and he is usually the highest-ranking president who served less than one full term [458] A 2014 survey from The Washington Post of 162 members of the American Political Science Association's Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Kennedy 14th highest overall among the 43 persons who have been president, including then-president Barack Obama The survey found Kennedy to be the most overrated U.S president [459] A 2017 C-SPAN survey has Kennedy ranked among the top ten presidents [460] A 2023 Gallup, Inc survey showed Kennedy with a retrospective approval rating of 90 percent, the highest of all U.S presidents in recent history [461] Assessments of his policies are mixed [462] [463] Many of Kennedy's legislative proposals were passed after his death, during the Johnson administration, and Kennedy's death gave those proposals a powerful moral component [464]\n\n\nPresidency\nHistorians and political scientists tend to rank Kennedy as an above-average president, and he is usually the highest-ranking president who served less

powerful moral component [464]\n\n\nCamelot\nThe term \"Camelot\" is often used to describe his presidency, reflecting both the mythic grandeur accorded Kennedy in death and powerful nostalgia for that era of American history [469] According to Richard Dean Burns and Joseph M Siracusa, the most popular theme surrounding Kennedy's legacy is its replay of the legend of King Arthur and Camelot from Arthurian Literature [470] In an interview following Kennedy's death, his widow Jacqueline mentioned his affection for the Broadway musical Camelot and quoted its closing lines: \"Don't let it be

It allows web authors to add semantic meaning to their content, making it more easily accessible and usable by machines and humans alike.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nRDFa is a simple and flexible way to add metadata to web documents, making it easier for search engines, browsers, and other software to understand the structure and meaning of the content. It is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) standard and uses a set of attributes to carry metadata in an XML language. RDFa has become a widely adopted technology, used by many web authors and developers to add semantic meaning to their content.\n\n**History**\n\nRDFa was first proposed by Mark Birbeck in the form of a W3C note entitled \"XHTML and RDF,\" which was then presented to the Semantic Web Interest Group at the W3C's 2004 Technical Plenary. Later that year, the work became part of the sixth public Working Draft of XHTML 2.0. Although it is generally assumed that RDFa was originally intended only for XHTML 2, in fact, the purpose of RDFa was always to provide a way to add metadata to any XML-based language. One of the earliest documents bearing the RDF/A Syntax name has the subtitle \"A collection of attributes for layering RDF on XML languages.\" The document was written by Mark Birbeck and Steven Pemberton and was made available for discussion on October 11, 2004.\n\n**Versions and Variants**\n\nThere are several well-defined variants of the basic concepts of RDFa, which are used as reference and as abbreviation to the W3C standards.\n\n**HTML+RDFa**\n\nRDFa was defined in 2008 with the \"RDFa in XHTML: Syntax and Processing\" Recommendation. Its first application was to be a module of XHTML. This version of RDFa is also known as RDFa 1.0.\n\n**RDFa 1.0**\n\nThe \"HTML+RDFa\" syntax of 2008 was also termed \"RDFa 1.0.\" So, there is no \"RDFa Core 1.0\" standard. In general, this 2008's RDFa 1.0 is used with the old XHTML standards, as long as RDFa 1.1 is used with XHTML5 and HTML5.\n\n**RDFa 1.1**\n\nRDFa 1.1 is the first generic (for HTML and XML) RDFa standard. The \"RDFa Core 1.1\" is in the Third Edition, since 2015.\n\n**RDFa Lite**\n\nRDFa Lite is a W3C Recommendation (1.0 and 1.1) since 2009. It is described as follows:\n\nRDFa Lite is a simplified version of RDFa, designed to be easier to implement and use. It provides a set of attributes that can be used to carry metadata in an XML language, while reducing the complexity and overhead of the full RDFa syntax.\n\n**Essence**\n\nThe essence of RDFa is to provide a set of attributes that can be used to carry metadata in an XML language (hence the 'a' in RDFa). This allows web authors to add semantic meaning to their content, making it more easily accessible and usable by machines and humans alike.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nThere are five \"principles of interoperable metadata\" met by RDFa:\n\n1. **Unambiguous**: RDFa provides a clear and unambiguous way to represent metadata.\n2. **Interoperable**: RDFa is designed to work with multiple applications and platforms.\n3. **Machine-readable**: RDFa provides a machine-readable format for metadata.\n4. **Human-readable**: RDFa provides a human-readable format for metadata.\n5. **Extensible**: RDFa is designed to be extensible, allowing new attributes and vocabularies to be added.\n\n**Usage**\n\nThere is a growing number of tools for better usage of RDFa vocabularies and RDFa annotation. These tools provide a range of features, including:\n\n1. **RDFa editors**: Tools for creating and editing RDFa documents.\n2. **RDFa validators**: Tools for validating RDFa documents against the RDFa standard.\n3. **RDFa converters**: Tools for converting RDFa documents to other formats.\n4. **RDFa viewers**: Tools for viewing and browsing RDFa documents.\n\n**HTML+RDFa Statistics**\n\nSimplified approaches to semantically annotating information items in webpages were greatly encouraged by the HTML+RDFa (released in 2008) and microformats (since ~2005) standards.\n\n**RDFa Editors**\n\nThe following is an example of adding Dublin Core metadata to an XML element in an XHTML file. Dublin Core data elements are data typically added to a book or article (title, author, subject etc.).\n\n```xml\n<div vocab=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" typeof=\"Book\">\n  <h1 property=\"title\">The Great Gatsby</h1>\n  <p property=\"author\">F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>\n  <p property=\"subject\">Classic literature</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Examples**\n\nThe following is an example of a complete XHTML+RDFa 1.0 document. It uses Dublin Core and FOAF, an ontology for describing people and their relationships with other people and things.\n\n```xml\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\n  xmlns:foaf=\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\"\n  xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">\n  <head>\n    <title>Example XHTML+RDFa Document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div vocab=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" typeof=\"Book\">\n      <h1 property=\"title\">The Great Gatsby</h1>\n      <p property=\"author\">F.

His life was marked by crime, violence, and a series of events that led to his eventual capture, escape, and death. This article will explore the life and times of Billy the Kid, from his early years to his infamous exploits and eventual demise.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nHenry McCarty was born to parents of Irish Catholic ancestry, Catherine (née Devine) and Patrick McCarty, in New Mexico City, New York. While his birth year has been confirmed as 1859, the exact date of his birth has been disputed as either September 17 or November 23 of that year. Census records indicate that his younger brother Joseph McCarty was born in 1863. There is uncertainty among historians about the exact place and date of McCarty's birth.\n\nMcCarty's early life was marked by poverty and instability. His mother died when he was young, and his father remarried. However, the family struggled to make ends meet, and McCarty was forced to fend for himself from a young age. He dropped out of school and began working menial jobs to support himself.\n\n**First Crimes**\n\nMcCarty's first crimes were committed when he was just 14 years old. He stole food from a store, and was caught and charged with theft. He escaped from jail and became a fugitive, earning the attention of the local authorities. McCarty continued to commit crimes, including robbery and theft, and was eventually arrested and charged with several offenses.\n\n**Lincoln County War**\n\nAfter returning to New Mexico, McCarty became involved in the Lincoln County War, a range war between rival factions vying for control of the region's cattle and land. McCarty worked as a cowboy for English businessman and rancher John Henry Tunstall, who was opposed to the alliance formed by Irish-American businessmen Lawrence Murphy, James Dolan, and John Riley.\n\nTunstall and his business partner and lawyer Alexander McSween were opponents of the alliance, which had wielded an economic and political hold over Lincoln County since the early 1870s. The three men owned a beef contract with nearby Fort Stanton and a well-patronized dry goods store in the town of Lincoln.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nAfter Tunstall was killed, McCarty and Dick Brewer swore affidavits against Brady and those in his posse, and obtained murder warrants from Lincoln County justice of the peace John B Wilson. On February 20, 1878, while attempting to arrest Brady, the sheriff and his deputies found and arrested McCarty and two other men riding with him.\n\n**Build-up**\n\nOn the night of Sunday, July 14, McSween and the Regulators—now a group of fifty or sixty men—went to Lincoln and stationed themselves in the town among several buildings. At the McSween residence were McCarty, Florencio Chavez, Jose Chavez y Chavez, Jim French, Harvey Morris, Tom O'Folliard, and Yginio Salazar, among others. Another group led by Marin Chavez and Doc Scurlock positioned themselves on the roof of a saloon.\n\nHenry Newton Brown, Dick Smith, and George Coe defended a nearby adobe bunkhouse. The Regulators were prepared for battle, but the outcome was far from certain.\n\n**Battle of Lincoln (1878)**\n\nThe Battle of Lincoln was a pivotal event in the Lincoln County War. On the night of Sunday, July 14, the Regulators and their allies clashed with the forces of Sheriff Brady and his posse. The battle was intense and chaotic, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\nDespite being outnumbered, the Regulators fought bravely, but they were eventually forced to retreat. The battle was a decisive victory for the alliance, and the Regulators were forced to flee the area.\n\n**Outlaw**\n\nAfter the Battle of Lincoln, McCarty became an outlaw, fleeing the area and evading capture. He was eventually indicted for the murder of a bookkeeper, but the indictment was later quashed.\n\nMcCarty continued to commit crimes, including robbery and theft, and was eventually arrested and charged with several offenses. He was captured by Pat Garrett, a sheriff who had been tasked with capturing McCarty.\n\n**Capture and Escape**\n\nOn December 13, 1880, Governor Wallace posted a $500 bounty for McCarty's capture. Pat Garrett continued his search for McCarty, and on December 23, he finally captured him along with Pickett, Rudabaugh, and Wilson at Stinking Springs.\n\nThe prisoners, including McCarty, were shackled and taken to Fort Sumner, then later to Las Vegas, New Mexico. When they arrived on December 26, they were met by crowds of curious onlookers.\n\n**Recapture and Death**\n\nWhile McCarty was on the run, Governor Wallace placed a new $500 bounty on the fugitive's head. Almost three months after his escape, Garrett, responding to rumors that McCarty was in the vicinity of Fort Sumner, left Lincoln with two deputies on July 14, 1881, to question resident Pete Maxwell, a friend of McCarty's.\n\nMaxwell, son of land baron Lucien Maxwell, spoke with Garrett the same day for several hours. Around midnight, the pair sat in Maxwell's darkened bedroom when McCarty unexpectedly entered.\n\nGarrett drew his gun and shot McCarty, killing him instantly. McCarty was 22 years old at the time of his death.\n\n**Rumors of Survival**\n\nOver time, legends grew claiming that McCarty was not killed, and that Garrett staged the incident and death out of friendship so that McCarty could evade the law. During the next 50 years, a number of men claimed they were Billy the Kid, but most of these claims were easily disproven.\n\n**Photographs**\n\nAs of 2021, only one authenticated photograph showing Billy the Kid exists. Others thought to depict him are disputed.

on December 23, following the siege in which Bowdre was killed, Garrett and his posse captured Bonney along with Pickett, Rudabaugh, and Wilson at Stinking Springs The prisoners, including Bonney, were shackled and taken to Fort Sumner, then later to Las Vegas, New Mexico When they arrived on December 26, they were met by crowds of curious onlookers.\n\n\nRecapture and death\nWhile Bonney was on the run, Governor Wallace placed a new $500 bounty on the fugitive's head [93] [94] [95] Almost three months after his escape, Garrett, responding to rumors that Bonney was in the vicinity of Fort Sumner, left Lincoln with two deputies on July 14, 1881, to question resident Pete Maxwell, a friend of Bonney's [96] Maxwell, son of land baron Lucien Maxwell, spoke with Garrett the same day for several hours Around midnight, the pair sat in Maxwell's darkened bedroom when Bonney unexpectedly entered [97]\n\n\nRumors of survival\nOver time, legends grew claiming that Bonney was not killed, and that Garrett staged the incident and death out of friendship so that Bonney could evade the law [109] During the next 50 years, a number of men claimed they were Billy the Kid [citation needed] Most of these claims were easily disproven, but two have remained topics of discussion and debate.\n\n\nPhotographs\nAs of 2021 [update], only one authenticated photograph showing Billy exists;

Born on July 16, 1921, in Norwood, Ohio, Vera-Ellen rose to fame in the 1940s and 1950s, becoming a beloved figure in the world of entertainment.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nVera-Ellen was born to Martin F. Rohe, a piano dealer, and Alma C. Westmeier, who were both descended from German immigrants. Her mother, Alma, had a vision for her daughter's name, including the hyphen, and it was indeed a prophetic choice. Vera-Ellen's early life was marked by a passion for dance, which was encouraged by her parents. She began taking dance lessons at a young age and soon became an accomplished dancer.\n\n**Career**\n\nVera-Ellen's professional career began in 1939, when she made her Broadway debut in the Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein musical \"Very Warm for May.\" Her performances earned her a spot among the youngest Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall. This led to roles in various Broadway productions, including \"Panama Hattie,\" \"By Jupiter,\" and \"A Connecticut Yankee.\" Her success on stage caught the attention of Samuel Goldwyn, who cast her opposite Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo in the 1945 film \"Wonder Man.\"\n\n**Stage**\n\nVera-Ellen's stage career was marked by her versatility and charm. She performed in numerous Broadway productions, including \"Panama Hattie,\" \"By Jupiter,\" and \"A Connecticut Yankee.\" Her performances earned her critical acclaim and a loyal fan base. Vera-Ellen's stage work was characterized by her ability to convey a sense of joy and enthusiasm, which endeared her to audiences.\n\n**Dubbing**\n\nIn the early days of her film career, Vera-Ellen's singing was dubbed, starting with her first film, \"Wonder Man.\" However, her style of singing was distinct and endearing, and she went on to perform in several films without dubbing. Her singing style was that of a comic soubrette, characterized by her lighthearted and playful approach to music.\n\n**Film**\n\nVera-Ellen's film career spanned over two decades, during which she appeared in numerous Hollywood musicals. She danced with Gene Kelly in the films \"Words and Music\" and \"On the Town,\" and starred alongside Fred Astaire in the films \"Three Little Words\" and \"The Belle of New York.\" Vera-Ellen also appeared in the last Marx Brothers film, \"Love Happy,\" and had a co-starring role with Donald O'Connor in the Ethel Merman vehicle \"Call Me Madam.\" Her penultimate film role was in the 1954 blockbuster hit \"White Christmas,\" co-starring with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, and Rosemary Clooney.\n\n**Television**\n\nVera-Ellen was a frequent guest on US variety programming in the mid-to-late 1950s. She appeared on numerous TV shows, including \"The Perry Como Show\" and \"The Dinah Shore Show.\" Her final performances were on a November 22, 1958, television episode of \"The Perry Como Show\" and a February 14, 1959, broadcast of \"The Dinah Shore Show.\"\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nVera-Ellen's personal life was marked by her struggles with her appearance. According to Hollywood chronicler Brian Cronin, Vera-Ellen's \"extremely thin\" appearance led to rumors during her career that she had an eating disorder. However, these rumors were likely exaggerated and have been disputed by friends and family members. Vera-Ellen's friend, Bill Dennington, who knew her during the last 20 years of her life, dismissed the story about her neck and added that he hated \"that people think of her as 'the dancer with anorexia' and not just the fabulous dancer who has been so overlooked.\"\n\n**Death**\n\nVera-Ellen died at the Los Angeles County General Hospital on August 30, 1981, of ovarian cancer. She was 60 years old at the time of her death. Despite her untimely passing, Vera-Ellen's legacy lives on through her performances, which continue to captivate audiences to this day.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* Wonder Man (1945)\n* Words and Music (1948)\n* On the Town (1949)\n* Love Happy (1949)\n* Three Little Words (1950)\n* The Belle of New York (1952)\n* Call Me Madam (1953)\n* Happy Go Lovely (1951)\n* White Christmas (1954)\n* Let's Be Happy (1957)\n\n**Stage Work**\n\n* Very Warm for May (1939)\n* Panama Hattie (1940)\n* By Jupiter (1942)\n* A Connecticut Yankee (1943)\n\n**Radio Appearances**\n\n* The Jack Benny Program (1948)\n* The Dinah Shore Show (1955)\n* The Perry Como Show (1958)\n\n**References**\n\n* Cronin, B.

{"title": "Wiki", "content": "\nCharacteristics\nIn their 2001 book The Wiki Way: Quick Collaboration on the Web, Cunningham and co-author Bo Leuf described the essence of the wiki concept: [10] [11]\n\n\nEditing\nSome wikis will present users with an edit button or link directly on the page being viewed This will open an interface for writing, formatting, and structuring page content The interface may be a source editor, which is text-based and employs a lightweight markup language (also known as wikitext, wiki markup, or wikicode), or a visual editor For example, in a source editor, starting lines of text with asterisks could create a bulleted list.\n\n\nSource editing\nSome wikis will present users with an edit button or link directly on the page being viewed This will open an interface for writing, formatting, and structuring page content The interface may be a source editor, which is text-based and employs a lightweight markup language (also known as wikitext, wiki markup, or wikicode), or a visual editor For example, in a source editor, starting lines of text with asterisks could create a bulleted list.\n\n\nExample of syntax\nA short section of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland rendered in wiki markup:\n\n\nVisual editing\nWhile wiki engines have traditionally offered source editing to users, in recent years some implementations have added a rich text editing mode This is usually implemented, using JavaScript, as an interface which translates formatting instructions chosen from a toolbar into the corresponding wiki markup or HTML This is generated and submitted to the server transparently, shielding users from the technical detail of markup editing and making it easier for them to change the content of pages An example of such an interface is the VisualEditor in MediaWiki, the wiki engine used by Wikipedia WYSIWYG editors may not provide all the features available in wiki markup, and some users prefer not to use them, so a source editor will often be available simultaneously.\n\n\nVersion history\nSome wiki implementations keep a record of changes made to wiki pages, and may store every version of the page permanently This allows authors to revert a page to an older version to rectify a mistake, or counteract a malicious or inappropriate edit to its content [13]\n\n\nEdit summaries\nThe edit history view in many wiki implementations will include edit summaries written by users when submitting changes to a page Similar to the function of a log message in a revision control system, an edit summary is a short piece of text which summarizes and perhaps explains the change, for example \"Corrected grammar\" or \"Fixed table formatting to not extend past page width\" It is not inserted into the article's main text.\n\n\nNavigation\nTraditionally, wikis offer free navigation between their pages via hypertext links in page text, rather than requiring users to follow a formal or structured navigation scheme Users may also create indexes or table of contents pages, hierarchical categorization via a taxonomy, or other forms of ad hoc content organization Wiki implementations can provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages, such as a backlink feature which displays all pages that link to a given page Adding categories or tags to a page makes it easier for other users to find it.\n\n\nNavigation between wikis\nSome wiki communities have established navigational networks between each other using a system called WikiNodes A WikiNode is a page on a wiki which describes and links to other, related wikis Some wikis operate a structure of neighbors and delegates, wherein a neighbor wiki is one which discusses similar content or is otherwise of interest, and a delegate wiki is one which has agreed to have certain content delegated to it [14] WikiNode networks act as webrings which may be navigated from one node to another to find a wiki which addresses a specific subject.\n\n\nLinking to and naming pages\nThe syntax used to create internal hyperlinks varies between wiki implementations Beginning with the WikiWikiWeb in 1995, most wikis used camel case to name pages, [15] which is when words in a phrase are capitalized and the spaces between them removed In this system, the phrase \"camel case\" would be rendered as \"CamelCase\" In early wiki engines, when a page was displayed, any instance of a camel case phrase would be transformed into a link to another page named with the same phrase.\n\n\nHistory\nWikiWikiWeb was the first wiki [17] Ward Cunningham started developing it in 1994, and installed it on the Internet domain c2.com on March 25, 1995 Cunningham gave it the name after remembering a Honolulu International Airport counter employee telling him to take the \"Wiki Wiki Shuttle\" bus that runs between the airport's terminals, later observing that \"I chose wiki-wiki as an alliterative substitute for 'quick' and thereby avoided naming this stuff quick-web.\" [18] [19]\n\n\nAlternative definitions\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the word \"wiki\" was used to refer to both user-editable websites and the software that powers them, and the latter definition is still occasionally in use [1]\n\n\nImplementations\nThe software which powers a wiki may be implemented as a series of scripts which operate an existing web server, a standalone application server that runs on one or more web servers, or in the case of personal wikis, run as a standalone application on a single computer Some wikis use flat file databases to store page content, while others use a relational database, [25] as indexed database access is faster on large wikis, particularly for searching.\n\n\nHosting\nWikis can also be created on wiki hosting services (also known as wiki farms), where the server-side software is implemented by the wiki farm owner, and may do so at no charge in exchange for advertisements being displayed on the wiki's pages Some hosting services offer private, password-protected wikis requiring authentication to access Free wiki farms generally contain advertising on every page.\n\n\nTrust and security\nThe four basic types of users who participate in wikis are readers, authors, wiki administrators and system administrators System administrators are responsible for the installation and maintenance of the wiki engine and the container web server Wiki administrators maintain content and, through having elevated privileges, are granted additional functions (including, for example, preventing edits to pages, deleting pages, changing users' access rights, or blocking them from editing) [26]\n\n\nAccess control\nThe four basic types of users who participate in wikis are readers, authors, wiki administrators and system administrators System administrators are responsible for the installation and maintenance of the wiki engine and the container web server Wiki administrators maintain content and, through having elevated privileges, are granted additional functions (including, for example, preventing edits to pages, deleting pages, changing users' access rights, or blocking them from editing) [26]\n\n\nControlling changes\nWikis are generally designed with a soft security philosophy in which it is easy to correct mistakes or harmful changes, rather than attempting to prevent them from happening in the first place This allows them to be very open while providing a means to verify the validity of recent additions to the body of pages Most wikis offer a recent changes page which shows recent edits, or a list of edits made within a given time frame [27] Some wikis can filter the list to remove edits flagged by users as \"minor\" and automated edits [28] The version history feature allows harmful changes to be reverted quickly and easily [13]\n\n\nTrustworthiness and reliability of content\nCritics of publicly editable wikis argue that they could be easily tampered with by malicious individuals, or even by well-meaning but unskilled users who introduce errors into the content Proponents maintain that these issues will be caught and rectified by a wiki's community of users [2] [17] High editorial standards in medicine and health sciences articles, in which users typically use peer-reviewed journals or university textbooks as sources, have led to the idea of expert-moderated wikis [33] Wiki implementations retaining and allowing access to specific versions of articles has been useful to the scientific community, by allowing expert peer reviewers to provide links to trusted version of articles which they have analyzed [34]\n\n\nSecurity\nTrolling and cybervandalism on wikis, where content is changed to something deliberately incorrect or a hoax, offensive material or nonsense is added, or content is maliciously removed, can be a major problem On larger wiki sites it is possible for such changes to go unnoticed for a long period.\n\n\nHarmful external links\nAs most wikis allow the creation of hyperlinks to other sites and services, the addition of malicious hyperlinks, such as sites infected with malware, can also be a problem For example, in 2006 a German Wikipedia article about the Blaster Worm was edited to include a hyperlink to a malicious

website that allows users to create, edit, and modify content through a collaborative process. The term \"wiki\" was first used to describe a type of website that was launched in 1995 by Ward Cunningham, who named it after the phrase \"wiki wiki,\" which means \"quick\" in Hawaiian. Since then, the concept of a wiki has evolved to include various types of collaborative platforms, including online encyclopedias, knowledge bases, and social networks.\n\nCharacteristics\n--------------\n\nThe essence of the wiki concept was described by Cunningham and co-author Bo Leuf in their 2001 book The Wiki Way: Quick Collaboration on the Web. According to them, a wiki is characterized by its ability to allow users to create, edit, and modify content through a collaborative process. This process is typically facilitated by a wiki engine, which is a software platform that manages the creation, editing, and display of content on a wiki.\n\nEditing\n---------\n\nOne of the key characteristics of a wiki is its editing process. In most wikis, users can edit content directly by clicking on an edit button or link on the page being viewed. This opens an interface for writing, formatting, and structuring page content. The interface may be a source editor, which is text-based and employs a lightweight markup language (also known as wikitext, wiki markup, or wikicode), or a visual editor.\n\nSource editing\n--------------\n\nSource editing is a type of editing that involves writing and formatting content using a text-based interface. This interface is typically used to create and edit the underlying code of a wiki page. In a source editor, users can write and format content using a variety of commands and markup languages. For example, in a source editor, starting lines of text with asterisks can create a bulleted list.\n\nExample of syntax\n-----------------\n\nA short section of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland rendered in wiki markup:\n\n```wiki\n== Chapter 1 ==\n=== The Rabbit Hole ===\nThe rabbit hole went straight down: no difficulty or danger now - there was neither rock nor water to get in the way - nothing to press or push aside - nothing to take hold of - but the great white rabbit himself.\n```\n\nVisual editing\n--------------\n\nWhile wiki engines have traditionally offered source editing to users, in recent years some implementations have added a rich text editing mode. This is usually implemented using JavaScript, as an interface which translates formatting instructions chosen from a toolbar into the corresponding wiki markup or HTML. This is generated and submitted to the server transparently, shielding users from the technical detail of markup editing and making it easier for them to change the content of pages.\n\nVersion history\n--------------\n\nSome wiki implementations keep a record of changes made to wiki pages, and may store every version of the page permanently. This allows authors to revert a page to an older version to rectify a mistake, or counteract a malicious or inappropriate edit to its content.\n\nEdit summaries\n--------------\n\nThe edit history view in many wiki implementations will include edit summaries written by users when submitting changes to a page. Similar to the function of a log message in a revision control system, an edit summary is a short piece of text which summarizes and perhaps explains the change.\n\nNavigation\n------------\n\nTraditionally, wikis offer free navigation between their pages via hypertext links in page text, rather than requiring users to follow a formal or structured navigation scheme. Users may also create indexes or table of contents pages, hierarchical categorization via a taxonomy, or other forms of ad hoc content organization.\n\nNavigation between wikis\n-------------------------\n\nSome wiki communities have established navigational networks between each other using a system called WikiNodes. A WikiNode is a page on a wiki which describes and links to other, related wikis.\n\nLinking to and naming pages\n---------------------------\n\nThe syntax used to create internal hyperlinks varies between wiki implementations. Beginning with the WikiWikiWeb in 1995, most wikis used camel case to name pages, which is when words in a phrase are capitalized and the spaces between them removed.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nWikiWikiWeb was the first wiki, developed by Ward Cunningham in 1994, and installed on the Internet domain c2.com on March 25, 1995. Cunningham gave it the name after remembering a Honolulu International Airport counter employee telling him to take the \"Wiki Wiki Shuttle\" bus that runs between the airport's terminals.\n\nAlternative definitions\n------------------------\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the word \"wiki\" was used to refer to both user-editable websites and the software that powers them. The latter definition is still occasionally in use.\n\nImplementations\n--------------\n\nThe software which powers a wiki may be implemented as a series of scripts which operate an existing web server, a standalone application server that runs on one or more web servers, or in the case of personal wikis, run as a standalone application on a single computer.\n\nHosting\n--------\n\nWikis can also be created on wiki hosting services (also known as wiki farms), where the server-side software is implemented by the wiki farm owner, and may do so at no charge in exchange for advertisements being displayed on the wiki's pages.\n\nTrust and security\n-------------------\n\nThe four basic types of users who participate in wikis are readers, authors, wiki administrators, and system administrators. System administrators are responsible for the installation and maintenance of the wiki engine and the container web server. Wiki administrators maintain content and, through having elevated privileges, are granted additional functions.\n\nAccess control\n----------------\n\nThe four basic types of users who participate in wikis are readers, authors, wiki administrators, and system administrators. System administrators are responsible for the installation and maintenance of the wiki engine and the container web server. Wiki administrators maintain content and, through having elevated privileges, are granted additional functions.\n\nControlling changes\n-------------------\n\nWikis are generally designed with a soft security philosophy in which it is easy to correct mistakes or harmful changes, rather than attempting to prevent them from happening in the first place.\n\nTrustworthiness and reliability of content\n------------------------------------------\n\nCritics of publicly editable wikis argue that they could be easily tampered with by malicious individuals, or even by well-meaning but unskilled users who introduce errors into the content.\n\nSecurity\n--------\n\nTrolling and cybervandalism on wikis, where content is changed to something deliberately incorrect or a hoax, offensive material or nonsense is added, or content is maliciously removed, can be a major problem.\n\nHarmful external links\n------------------------\n\nAs most wikis allow the creation of hyperlinks to other sites and services, the addition of malicious hyperlinks, such as sites infected with malware, can also be a problem.\n\nCommunities\n------------\n\nThe English Wikipedia has the largest user base among

implemented, using JavaScript, as an interface which translates formatting instructions chosen from a toolbar into the corresponding wiki markup or HTML This is generated and submitted to the server transparently, shielding users from the technical detail of markup editing and making it easier for them to change the content of pages An example of such an interface is the VisualEditor in MediaWiki, the wiki engine used by Wikipedia WYSIWYG editors may not provide all the features available in wiki markup, and some users prefer not to use them, so a source editor will often be available simultaneously.\n\n\nVersion history\nSome wiki implementations keep a record of changes made to wiki pages, and may store every version of the page permanently This allows authors to revert a page to an older version to rectify a mistake, or counteract a malicious or inappropriate edit to its content [13]\n\n\nEdit summaries\nThe edit history view in many wiki implementations will include edit summaries written by users when submitting changes to a page Similar to the function of a log message in a revision control system, an edit summary is a short piece of text which summarizes and perhaps explains the change, for example \"Corrected grammar\" or \"Fixed table formatting to not extend past page width\" It is not inserted into the article's main text.\n\n\nNavigation\nTraditionally, wikis offer free navigation between their pages via hypertext links in page text, rather than requiring users to follow a formal or structured navigation scheme Users may also create indexes or table of contents pages, hierarchical categorization via a taxonomy, or other forms of ad hoc content organization Wiki implementations can provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages, such as a backlink feature which displays all pages that link to a given page Adding categories or tags to a page makes it easier for other users to find it.\n\n\nNavigation between wikis\nSome wiki communities have established navigational networks between each other using a system called WikiNodes A WikiNode is a page on a wiki which describes and links to other, related wikis Some wikis operate a structure of neighbors and delegates, wherein a neighbor wiki is one which discusses similar content or is otherwise of interest, and a delegate wiki is one which has agreed to have certain content delegated to it [14] WikiNode networks act as webrings which may be navigated from one node to another to find a wiki which addresses a specific subject.\n\n\nLinking to and naming pages\nThe syntax used to create internal hyperlinks varies between wiki implementations Beginning with the WikiWikiWeb in 1995, most wikis used camel case to name pages, [15] which is when words in a phrase are capitalized and the spaces between them removed In this system, the phrase \"camel case\" would be rendered as \"CamelCase\" In early wiki engines, when a page was displayed, any instance of a camel case phrase would be transformed into a link to another page named with the same phrase.\n\n\nHistory\nWikiWikiWeb was the first wiki [17] Ward Cunningham started developing it in 1994, and installed it on the Internet domain c2.com on March 25, 1995 Cunningham gave it the name after remembering a Honolulu International Airport counter employee telling him to take the \"Wiki Wiki Shuttle\" bus that runs between the airport's terminals, later observing that \"I chose wiki-wiki as an alliterative substitute for 'quick' and thereby avoided naming this stuff quick-web.\" [18] [19]\n\n\nAlternative definitions\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the word \"wiki\" was used to refer to both user-editable websites and the software that powers them, and the latter definition is still occasionally in use [1]\n\n\nImplementations\nThe software which powers a wiki may be implemented as a series of scripts which operate an existing web server, a standalone application server that runs on one or more web servers, or in the case of personal wikis, run as a standalone application on a single computer Some wikis use flat file databases to store page content, while others use a relational database, [25] as indexed database access is faster on large wikis, particularly for searching.\n\n\nHosting\nWikis can also be created on wiki hosting services (also known as wiki farms), where the server-side software is implemented by the wiki farm owner, and may do so at no charge in exchange for advertisements being displayed on the wiki's pages Some hosting services offer private, password-protected wikis requiring authentication to access Free wiki farms generally contain advertising on every page.\n\n\nTrust and security\nThe four basic types of users who participate in wikis are readers, authors, wiki administrators and system administrators System administrators are responsible for the installation and maintenance of the wiki engine and the container web server Wiki administrators maintain content and, through having elevated privileges, are granted additional functions (including, for example, preventing edits to pages, deleting pages, changing users' access rights, or blocking them from editing) [26]\n\n\nAccess control\nThe four basic types of users who participate in wikis are readers, authors, wiki administrators and system administrators System administrators are responsible for the installation and maintenance of the wiki engine and the container web server Wiki administrators maintain content and, through having elevated privileges, are granted additional functions (including, for example, preventing edits to pages, deleting pages, changing users' access rights, or blocking them from editing) [26]\n\n\nControlling changes\nWikis are generally designed with a soft security philosophy in which it is easy to correct mistakes or harmful changes, rather than attempting to prevent them from happening in the first place This allows them to be very open while providing a means to verify the validity of recent additions to the body of pages Most wikis offer a recent changes page which shows recent edits, or a list of edits made within a given time frame [27] Some wikis can filter the list to remove edits flagged by users as \"minor\" and automated edits [28] The version history feature allows harmful changes to be reverted quickly and easily [13]\n\n\nTrustworthiness and reliability of content\nCritics of publicly editable wikis argue that they could be easily tampered with by malicious individuals, or even by well-meaning but unskilled users who introduce errors into the content Proponents maintain that these issues will be caught and rectified by a wiki's community of users [2] [17] High editorial standards in medicine and health sciences articles, in which users typically use peer-reviewed journals or university textbooks as sources, have led to the idea of expert-moderated wikis [33] Wiki implementations retaining and allowing access to specific versions of articles has been useful to the scientific community, by allowing expert peer reviewers to provide links to trusted version of articles which they have analyzed [34]\n\n\nSecurity\nTrolling and cybervandalism on wikis, where content is changed to something deliberately incorrect or a hoax, offensive material or nonsense is added, or content is maliciously removed, can be a major problem On larger wiki sites it is possible for such changes to go unnoticed for a long period.\n\n\nHarmful external links\nAs most wikis allow the creation of hyperlinks to other sites and services, the addition of malicious hyperlinks, such as sites infected with malware, can also be a problem For example, in 2006 a German Wikipedia article about the Blaster Worm was edited to include a hyperlink to a malicious website, and users of vulnerable Microsoft Windows systems who followed the link had their systems infected with the worm [3] Some wiki engines offer a blacklist feature which prevents users from adding hyperlinks to specific sites that have been placed on the list by the wiki's administrators.\n\n\nCommunities\nThe English Wikipedia has the largest user base among wikis on the World Wide Web [36] and ranks in the top 10 among all Web sites in terms of traffic [37] Other large wikis include the WikiWikiWeb, Memory Alpha, Wikivoyage, and previously Susning.nu, a Swedish-language knowledge base Medical and health-related wiki examples include Ganfyd, an online collaborative medical reference that is edited by medical professionals and invited non-medical experts [38] Many wiki communities are private, particularly within enterprises They are often used as internal documentation for in-house systems and applications Some companies use wikis to allow customers to help produce software documentation [39] A study of corporate wiki users found that they could be divided into \"synthesizers\" and \"adders\" of content Synthesizers' frequency of contribution was affected more by their impact on other wiki users, while adders' contribution frequency was affected more by being able to accomplish their immediate work [40] From a study of thousands of wiki deployments, Jonathan Grudin concluded careful stakeholder analysis and education are crucial to successful wiki deployment [41]\n\n\nApplications\nThe English Wikipedia has the largest user base among wikis on

{"title": "NXIVM", "content": "\nHistory\nBefore founding NXIVM, Raniere created Consumers Buyline, a business venture that the New York Attorney General accused of having been a pyramid scheme; Raniere signed a consent order in 1996 in which he denied any wrongdoing but agreed to pay a $40,000 fine and to be permanently banned from \"promoting, offering or granting participation in a chain distribution scheme\" [39]\n\n\nFounding and initial success\nIn 1998, Raniere and Nancy Salzman founded NXIVM, a personal development company offering \"Executive Success Programs\" (ESP) and a range of techniques for self-improvement [40] [41] [7] Raniere claimed that its \"main emphasis is to have people experience more joy in their lives\" [42] In one account cited by former NXIVM member Sarah Edmondson, Raniere chose the name based on the ancient Roman system of debt bondage known as nexum [43] The 2002 registration with United States Patent and Trademark Office for the NXIVM trademark states that \"The foreign wording in the mark translates into English as 'the next millennium'\" [44]\n\n\nCult allegations in early 2000s\nNXIVM claimed its training was a trade secret, subject to non-disclosure agreements, but reportedly used a technique the organization called \"rational inquiry\" to facilitate personal and professional development In 2003, NXIVM sued the Ross Institute in the case known as NXIVM Corp v Ross Institute, alleging copyright infringement for publishing excerpts of content from its manual in three critical articles commissioned by cult investigator Rick Alan Ross and posted on his website [52] [53] [54] Ross posted a psychiatrist's assessment of NXIVM's \"secret\" manual on his website that called the regimen \"expensive brainwashing\" [51] [55]\n\n\nRecruitment in Vancouver\nAfter actress Kristin Kreuk became involved with NXIVM in 2006, Salzman and her daughter Lauren, a junior NXIVM leader, [7] went to Vancouver to recruit Kreuk's Smallville co-star Allison Mack [47] Lauren bonded with Mack (the two women eventually became Raniere's inner circle and his sexual partners) Kreuk, however, left NXIVM in 2013 [61] Mack became \"an enthusiastic proselytizer\" for NXIVM, persuading her parents to take courses, and after wrapping production of Smallville in 2011, moved to Clifton Park, New York, to be near NXIVM's home base in Albany [47]\n\n\n2008–2010\nIn 2008, the Bronfman sisters allegedly pressured Stephen Herbits, a confidant of their father, to ask Albany County District Attorney David Soares, New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, and New Jersey Attorney General Anne Milgram to begin criminal investigations into NXIVM's critics NXIVM reportedly kept dossiers on Soares, Spitzer, political consultants Roger Stone and Steve Pigeon, U.S Senator Chuck Schumer, and Albany Times Union publisher George Randolph Hearst III in a box in the basement of Nancy Salzman's home [62] [63] According to the Times Union, NXIVM \"developed a reputation for aggressively pursuing critics and defectors who broke from its ranks, including using litigation to punish critics of Raniere, the organization, or its training methods.\" [64]\n\n\nRelated organizations\nNXIVM has been associated with several related organizations Jness was a society aimed at women, while the Society of Protectors was aimed primarily at men [78] A third group was known by the acronym DOS, short for \"Dominus Obsequious Sororium\", which, according to one member, means \"master over slave women\" [79] In 2006, Raniere founded Rainbow Cultural Garden, an international chain of childcare organizations in which children were to be exposed to seven different languages [80]\n\n\nExposure of \"DOS\" and NXIVM downfall\nStarting with reports by Frank Parlato in June 2017 [82] and bolstered by an October 2017\narticle in The New York Times, [70] details began to emerge about \"DOS\", a secret society of women that started in 2015 within NXIVM in which female members were allegedly called slaves, branded with the initials of Raniere and Mack, subjected to corporal punishment from their \"masters\", and required to provide nude photos or other potentially damaging information about themselves as \"collateral\" [83] [84] [85] Law enforcement representatives have alleged that DOS members were forced into sexual slavery [86]\n\n\nWhistleblowers' accounts\nSarah Edmondson, a Canadian actress who had been an ESP participant since 2005, said that she left NXIVM after Mack inducted her into DOS at her Albany home Edmondson alleged that DOS participants were blindfolded naked, held down by Mack and three other women, and branded on the lower abdomen with a cauterizing pen by NXIVM-affiliated doctor Danielle Roberts [70] [87] [47] Appearing on an A&E television program about cults, Edmondson provided additional context for the use of the \"collateral\" concept, saying that it was used in innocuous forms from the earliest, outermost stages of NXIVM in order to acclimate victims—for example, collateralizing small amounts of money that one might forfeit if one did not go to the gym one day [7] The New York Times later reported that hundreds of members left NXIVM after Edmondson went public about her experience [7]\n\n\nArrest of Raniere\nIn March 2018, Raniere was arrested and indicted on charges related to DOS, including sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy, and conspiracy to commit forced labor [92] [93] He was arrested in Mexico and held in custody in New York after appearing in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas [94] The indictment alleged that at least one woman was coerced into sex with Raniere, who forced DOS members to undergo the branding ritual alleged by Edmondson and others [95] [96] United States Attorney Richard Donoghue stated that Raniere \"created a secret society of women whom he had sex with and branded with his initials, coercing them with the threat of releasing their highly personal information and taking their assets\" [41]\n\n\nIndictment of Raniere and co-conspirators\nOn April 20, 2018, Mack was arrested and indicted on similar charges to Raniere's [97] According to prosecutors, after she recruited women into first NXIVM and then DOS, Mack was allegedly paid by Raniere to coerce them into engaging in sexual activity with Raniere [47] Mack was further alleged to be DOS's second-in-command after Raniere [98] [99] On April 24, Mack was released on $5 million bond pending trial and held under house arrest with her parents in California [100] [101] On May 4, Raniere pleaded not guilty [102]\n\n\nGuilty pleas, corporations and conviction\nOn March 13, 2019, Nancy Salzman pleaded guilty to a charge of racketeering criminal conspiracy [110] [111] [112] She agreed, as nominal owner, not to contest forfeiture of NXIVM-related assets including real estate as well as corporations that owned Keith Raniere and NXIVM's trademark and patent portfolio [113]\n\n\nNXIVM after Raniere's conviction\nThe assets of NXIVM were held by Nancy Salzman, including several corporate entities and titles to intellectual property As part of her plea agreement with the government, Salzman did not contest asset forfeiture [113]\n\n\nCivil lawsuit against NXIVM leadership\nIn January 2020, Sarah Edmondson became lead plaintiff in a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act civil suit filed in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York accusing Raniere and 14 associates (including Nancy Salzman, Clare Bronfman, Sara Bronfman, Lauren Salzman, Allison Mack, Kathy Russell, Karen Unterreiner, Brandon Porter, Danielle Roberts, and Nicki Clyne) of conducting illegal psychological experiments on members of the company and abusing them physically, emotionally and financially [143] [144]\n\n\nRaniere and loyalists activities\nIn summer 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic preventing in-person visitation to the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, Raniere's remaining followers, including actress Nicki Clyne, began assembling to dance near the jail Though they initially claimed to be entertaining all of the detainees, they were seen with a sign addressed to \"Kay Rose,\" a name sharing Raniere's initials [145] The group began calling itself \"The Forgotten Ones\" and \"We Are As You.\" Former NXIVM member turned prosecution witness Mark Vicente dismissed the group as a \"cover movement\" to support Raniere [146] [147]\n\n\nSentencing and appeals for Raniere and Bronfman\nOn September 30, 2020, Judge Nicholas G Garaufis of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York sentenced Clare Bronfman to six years and nine months in federal prison The sentence was more severe than those recommended by guidelines, with Garaufis stating that, \"Raniere and his adherents appear to understand Ms Bronfman’s continued loyalty—even after his trial and conviction, during which all the details of his sexual abuse and exploitation became known to the world.\" [153]\n\n\nMarc Elliot v. Lions Gate Entertainment libel case\nIn 2021, Raniere supporter Marc Elliot filed a lawsuit against Lions Gate Entertainment in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that he was libelled and defamed by the Starz network documentary Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult [166] Joseph Tully, the attorney who represented Elliot, also represented Raniere in his appeals [167] The court dismissed the lawsuit and ordered Elliot to pay Lions Gate Entertainment's attorneys' fees and costs, finding that the documentary \"impl [ied] that Plaintiff was a devoted member of an organization whose leader has been implicated in a range of serious sexual crimes, but this assertion – however unflattering – is substantially true.\" [168]\n\n\nRaniere v. Garland prison case\nIn May 2022, Keith Raniere sued the U.S Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons, alleging violation of his civil rights Raniere sought an injunction allowing visitation and phone calls from follower Suneel Chakravorty, who he claims is a paralegal working on his appeals [169] The Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons and authorities at USP Tucson argued the injunction should be denied because Chakravorty was not a paralegal but merely \"an ardent former ESP and NXIVM coach with whom  [Raniere] is banned from associating.\" [170]\n\n\nPersonality cult of Keith Raniere\nNXIVM has been described as a cult and Raniere a cult leader by anti-cult activists such as Rick Alan Ross and Steven Hassan, as well as the billionaire businessman Edgar Bronfman Sr [172] [173] [11] Stephen A Kent, a sociologist who studies new religious movements, in an article comparing NXIVM to Scientology, noted NXIVM operated mainly as a business and never incorporated as a religious organization [174]\n\n\nHagiographical claims\nOver the decades, NXIVM emphasized Raniere's specialness through hagiography A complaint from a 2020 lawsuit by former members of NXIVM mentioned several fantastical claims made about Raniere in NXIVM marketing materials, [175] including claims that Raniere spoke in complete sentences as a one-year-old, mastered college-level mathematics in grade school, and was an elite athlete who won judo and track tournaments.\n\n\nClaims of Raniere's superior intellect and sexual powers\nWell before co-founding NXIVM, Keith Raniere made fantastical claims about his intelligence In June 1988, the Times Union profiled Raniere, reporting on his membership in the Mega Society after he achieved a high score on founder Ronald K Hoeflin's MEGA test, an unsupervised, 48-question test published in the April 1985 issue of Omni magazine [178] [179] Although the MEGA test has been widely criticized as not having been properly validated, the 1989 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records (the last to include a category for highest IQ [180]) described the Hoeflin Research Group as \"the most exclusive ultrahigh IQ society\", and the 1989 Australian edition identified Raniere, Marilyn vos Savant, and Eric Hart as the highest-scoring members of the group [181] [182] [183] [184]\n\n\nBeliefs and practices\n\nA 2003 mission statement on the NXIVM website read as follows:\n\nTeachings\nThe oldest program of NXIVM, Executive Success Programs, had students recite a \"Twelve-point Mission Statement\", pledging to \"purge\" themselves \"of all parasite and envy-based habits\", to enroll others, and to \"ethically control as much of the money, wealth and resources of the world as possible within my success plan.\" The Mission Statement also labeled students who shared Executive Success Programs materials as \"breaking a promise and breaching my contract\" and compromising \"inner honesty and integrity.\" [195] [196]\n\n\nClasses and programs\nNXIVM conducted \"Intensives,\" classes conducted for 12 hours daily for 16 days One cited price was $7,500 [200] [7] Classes were divided into modules In one module, \"Relationship Sourcing\", students were instructed to explore the benefits they would receive in the event of a partner's sudden death Another module, \"Dracula and his ghouls\", reportedly discussed psychopaths and their followers Other module titles included \"Best People; Perfect World\" and \"The Heroic Struggle\" [201] [better source needed]\n\n\nRituals and practices\nClasses by NXIVM had a number of idiosyncratic practices, described within the Rational Inquiry patent as \"rules and rituals\" and third-party sources as including:\n\n\nTourette's treatment claims\nA 2018 documentary film directed by Alessandro Molatore showcases a purported study of the use of NXIVM's exploration of meaning technique to treat Tourette syndrome The film is executive produced by Clare Bronfman The film identifies the Tourette's study's \"lead researcher\" as Dr Brandon Porter, at the time a hospitalist at St Peter's Hospital in Albany [205] [206] [207] [208]\n\n\nHuman subject experimentation\nAnother purported study Porter conducted within the NXIVM community was described as watching disturbing footage, including video of people being murdered, while their brainwaves, physiological activity, and facial and auditory responses were recorded through electroencephalography, galvanic skin response and video recording [199] [213]\n\n\nNotable participants\nEdgar Boone, the scion of a wealthy family, introduced NXIVM to numerous affluent Mexicans, becoming head of NXIVM-Mexico and rising to third in the NXIVM organization [217] [218] [219]\n\n\nCritical former members\nBarbara Bouchey was a client of Nancy Salzman, having been referred to her in 1988 Beginning in 2000, Bouchey dated Raniere In 2009, Bouchey and eight other women (\"The NXIVM Nine\") confronted Raniere with concerns about abuse within the organization That year, Bouchey left the group and later went to law enforcement [249]\n\n\nJournalists reporting on the group\nJames Odato is an investigative reporter who wrote for the Albany Times Union In 2012, Odato reported Raniere's history of pedophilia In October 2013, Odato was named in a lawsuit filed by NXIVM, along with Suzanna Andrews of Vanity Fair and blogger John J Tighe; all had written critically of the group [271] The suit alleged that NXIVM computers had been illegally accessed  Shortly thereafter, Odato was described as being \"on leave\" from the Times Union [271] Following Keith Raniere's sentencing in 2020, the editorial board of the New York Daily News praised Odato's work exposing NXIVM for its prescience, taking the unusual step of commending the work published by a competitor [272]\n\n\nFilms, documentaries and books\n42°44′29″N 73°50′24″W﻿ / ﻿42.7414°N 73.8401°W﻿ / 42.7414;

The organization claimed to offer personal development courses and training programs aimed at improving individuals' lives and professional careers. However, NXIVM was also accused of being a cult, with Raniere at its helm, and was involved in various controversies, including allegations of sex trafficking, human rights abuses, and financial exploitation.\n\n**History**\n\nBefore founding NXIVM, Keith Raniere created Consumers Buyline, a business venture that the New York Attorney General accused of being a pyramid scheme. Raniere signed a consent order in 1996, denying any wrongdoing but agreeing to pay a $40,000 fine and to be permanently banned from promoting or granting participation in a chain distribution scheme.\n\nIn 1998, Raniere and Nancy Salzman founded NXIVM, a personal development company offering \"Executive Success Programs\" (ESP) and a range of techniques for self-improvement. Raniere claimed that the main emphasis of NXIVM was to have people experience more joy in their lives. The organization's name is derived from the Latin term \"nexum,\" which refers to a system of debt bondage.\n\n**Founding and Initial Success**\n\nNXIVM's initial success was marked by the recruitment of affluent individuals, including actresses Allison Mack and Kristin Kreuk, who became involved with the organization in the early 2000s. The organization's training programs were marketed as a way to improve individuals' lives and professional careers, with prices ranging from $7,500 to $10,000 per course.\n\n**Cult Allegations in Early 2000s**\n\nIn the early 2000s, NXIVM faced allegations of being a cult, with critics accusing the organization of using high-pressure sales tactics and exploiting its members. The organization responded by suing Rick Ross, a cult investigator, for copyright infringement after he posted excerpts of NXIVM's manual on his website.\n\n**Recruitment in Vancouver**\n\nAfter actress Kristin Kreuk became involved with NXIVM in 2006, Salzman and her daughter Lauren, a junior NXIVM leader, went to Vancouver to recruit Kreuk's Smallville co-star Allison Mack. Lauren bonded with Mack, and the two women eventually became Raniere's inner circle and his sexual partners. Kreuk, however, left NXIVM in 2013.\n\n**2008-2010**\n\nIn 2008, the Bronfman sisters allegedly pressured Stephen Herbits, a confidant of their father, to ask Albany County District Attorney David Soares, New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, and New Jersey Attorney General Anne Milgram to begin criminal investigations into NXIVM's critics. NXIVM reportedly kept dossiers on Soares, Spitzer, and other politicians in a box in the basement of Nancy Salzman's home.\n\n**Related Organizations**\n\nNXIVM was associated with several related organizations, including", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"NXIVM\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nBefore founding NXIVM, Raniere created Consumers Buyline, a business venture that the New York Attorney General accused of having been a pyramid scheme; Raniere signed a consent order in 1996 in which he denied any wrongdoing but agreed to pay a $40,000 fine and to be permanently banned from \"promoting, offering or granting participation in a chain distribution scheme\" [39]\n\n\nFounding and initial success\nIn 1998, Raniere and Nancy Salzman founded NXIVM, a personal development company offering \"Executive Success Programs\" (ESP) and a range of techniques for self-improvement [40] [41] [7] Raniere claimed that its \"main emphasis is to have people experience more joy in their lives\" [42] In one account cited by former NXIVM member Sarah Edmondson, Raniere chose the name based on the ancient Roman system of debt bondage known as nexum [43] The 2002 registration with United States Patent and Trademark Office for the NXIVM trademark states that \"The foreign wording in the mark translates into English as 'the next millennium'\" [44]\n\n\nCult allegations in early 2000s\nNXIVM claimed its training was a trade secret, subject to non-disclosure agreements, but reportedly used a technique the organization called \"rational inquiry\" to facilitate personal and professional development In 2003, NXIVM sued the Ross Institute in the case known as NXIVM Corp v Ross Institute, alleging copyright infringement for publishing excerpts of content from its manual in three critical articles commissioned by cult investigator Rick Alan Ross and posted on his website [52] [53] [54] Ross posted a psychiatrist's assessment of NXIVM's \"secret\" manual on his website that called the regimen \"expensive brainwashing\" [51] [55]\n\n\nRecruitment in Vancouver\nAfter actress Kristin Kreuk became involved with NXIVM in 2006, Salzman and her daughter Lauren, a junior NXIVM leader, [7] went to Vancouver to recruit Kreuk's Smallville co-star Allison Mack [47] Lauren bonded with Mack (the two women eventually became Raniere's inner circle and his sexual partners) Kreuk, however, left NXIVM in 2013 [61] Mack became \"an enthusiastic proselytizer\" for NXIVM, persuading her parents to take courses, and after wrapping production of Smallville in 2011, moved to Clifton Park, New York, to be near NXIVM's home base in Albany [47]\n\n\n2008–2010\nIn 2008, the Bronfman sisters allegedly pressured Stephen Herbits, a confidant of their father, to ask Albany County District Attorney David Soares, New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, and New Jersey Attorney General Anne Milgram to begin criminal investigations into NXIVM's critics NXIVM reportedly kept dossiers on Soares, Spitzer, political consultants Roger Stone and Steve Pigeon, U.S Senator Chuck Schumer, and Albany Times Union publisher George Randolph Hearst III in a box in the basement of Nancy Salzman's home [62] [63] According to the Times Union, NXIVM \"developed a reputation for aggressively pursuing critics and defectors who broke from its ranks, including using litigation to punish critics of Raniere, the organization, or its training methods.\" [64]\n\n\nRelated organizations\nNXIVM has been associated with several related organizations Jness was a society aimed at women, while the Society of Protectors was aimed primarily at men [78] A third group was known by the acronym DOS, short for \"Dominus Obsequious Sororium\", which, according to one member, means \"master over slave women\" [79] In 2006, Raniere founded Rainbow Cultural Garden, an international chain of childcare organizations in which children were to be exposed to seven different languages [80]\n\n\nExposure of \"DOS\" and NXIVM downfall\nStarting with reports by Frank Parlato in June 2017 [82] and bolstered by an October 2017\narticle in The New York Times, [70] details began to emerge about \"DOS\", a secret society of women that started in 2015 within NXIVM in which female members were allegedly called slaves, branded with the initials of Raniere and Mack, subjected to corporal punishment from their \"masters\", and required to provide nude photos or other potentially damaging information about themselves as \"collateral\" [83] [84] [85] Law enforcement representatives have alleged that DOS members were forced into sexual slavery [86]\n\n\nWhistleblowers' accounts\nSarah Edmondson, a Canadian actress who had been an ESP participant since 2005, said that she left NXIVM after Mack inducted her into DOS at her Albany home Edmondson alleged that DOS participants were blindfolded naked, held down by Mack and three other women, and branded on the lower abdomen with a cauterizing pen by NXIVM-affiliated doctor Danielle Roberts [70] [87] [47] Appearing on an A&E television program about cults, Edmondson provided additional context for the use of the \"collateral\" concept, saying that it was used in innocuous forms from the earliest, outermost stages of NXIVM in order to acclimate victims—for example, collateralizing small amounts of money that one might forfeit if one did not go to the gym one day [7] The New York Times later reported that hundreds of members left NXIVM after Edmondson went public about her experience [7]\n\n\nArrest of Raniere\nIn March 2018, Raniere was arrested and indicted on charges related to DOS, including sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy, and conspiracy to commit forced labor [92] [93] He was arrested in Mexico and held in custody in New York after appearing in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas [94] The indictment alleged that at least one woman was coerced into sex with Raniere, who forced DOS members to undergo the branding ritual alleged by Edmondson and others [95] [96] United States Attorney Richard Donoghue stated that Raniere \"created a secret society of women whom he had sex with and branded with his initials, coercing them with the threat of releasing their highly personal information and taking their assets\" [41]\n\n\nIndictment of Raniere and co-conspirators\nOn April 20, 2018, Mack was arrested and indicted on similar charges to Raniere's [97] According to prosecutors, after she recruited women into first NXIVM and then DOS, Mack was allegedly paid by Raniere to coerce them into engaging in sexual activity with Raniere [47] Mack was further alleged to be DOS's second-in-command after Raniere [98] [99] On April 24, Mack was released on $5 million bond pending trial and held under house arrest with her parents in California [100] [101] On May 4, Raniere pleaded not guilty [102]\n\n\nGuilty pleas, corporations and conviction\nOn March 13, 2019, Nancy Salzman pleaded guilty to a charge of racketeering criminal conspiracy [110] [111] [112] She agreed, as nominal owner, not to contest forfeiture of NXIVM-related assets including real estate as well as corporations that owned Keith Raniere and NXIVM's trademark and patent portfolio [113]\n\n\nNXIVM after Raniere's conviction\nThe assets of NXIVM were held by Nancy Salzman, including several corporate entities and titles to intellectual property As part of her plea agreement with the government, Salzman did not contest asset forfeiture [113]\n\n\nCivil lawsuit against NXIVM leadership\nIn January 2020, Sarah Edmondson became lead plaintiff in a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act civil suit filed in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York accusing Raniere and 14 associates (including Nancy Salzman, Clare Bronfman, Sara Bronfman, Lauren Salzman, Allison Mack, Kathy Russell, Karen Unterreiner, Brandon Porter, Danielle Roberts, and Nicki Clyne) of conducting illegal psychological experiments on members of the company and abusing them physically, emotionally and financially [143] [144]\n\n\nRaniere and loyalists activities\nIn summer 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic preventing in-person visitation to the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, Raniere's remaining followers, including actress Nicki Clyne, began assembling to dance near the jail Though they initially claimed to be entertaining all of the detainees, they were seen with a sign addressed to \"Kay Rose,\" a name sharing Raniere's initials [145] The group began calling itself \"The Forgotten Ones\" and \"We Are As You.\" Former NXIVM member turned prosecution witness Mark Vicente dismissed the group as a \"cover movement\" to support Raniere [146] [147]\n\n\nSentencing and appeals for Raniere and Bronfman\nOn September 30, 2020, Judge Nicholas G Garaufis of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York sentenced Clare Bronfman to six years and nine months in federal prison The sentence was more severe than those recommended by guidelines, with Garaufis stating that, \"Raniere and his adherents appear to understand Ms Bronfman’s continued loyalty—even after his trial and conviction, during which all the details of his sexual abuse and exploitation became known to the world.\" [153]\n\n\nMarc Elliot v. Lions Gate Entertainment libel case\nIn 2021, Raniere supporter Marc Elliot filed a lawsuit against Lions Gate Entertainment in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that he was libelled and defamed by the Starz network documentary Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult [166] Joseph Tully, the attorney who represented Elliot, also represented Raniere in his appeals [167] The court dismissed the lawsuit and ordered Elliot to pay Lions Gate Entertainment's attorneys' fees and costs, finding that the documentary \"impl [ied] that Plaintiff was a devoted member of an organization whose leader has been implicated in a range of serious sexual crimes, but this assertion – however unflattering – is substantially true.\" [168]\n\n\nRaniere v. Garland prison case\nIn May 2022, Keith Raniere sued the U.S Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons, alleging violation of his civil rights Raniere sought an injunction allowing visitation and phone calls from follower Suneel Chakravorty, who he claims is a paralegal working on his appeals [169] The Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons and authorities at USP Tucson argued the injunction should be denied because Chakravorty was not a paralegal but merely \"an ardent former ESP and NXIVM coach with whom  [Raniere] is banned from associating.\" [170]\n\n\nPersonality cult of Keith Raniere\nNXIVM has been described as a cult and Raniere a cult leader by anti-cult activists such as Rick Alan Ross and Steven Hassan, as well as the billionaire businessman Edgar Bronfman Sr [172] [173] [11] Stephen A Kent, a sociologist who studies new religious movements, in an article comparing NXIVM to Scientology, noted NXIVM operated mainly as a business and never incorporated as a religious organization [174]\n\n\nHagiographical claims\nOver the decades, NXIVM emphasized Raniere's specialness through hagiography A complaint from a 2020 lawsuit by former members of NXIVM mentioned several fantastical claims made about Raniere in NXIVM marketing materials, [175] including claims that Raniere spoke in complete sentences as a one-year-old, mastered college-level mathematics in grade school, and was an elite athlete who won judo and track tournaments.\n\n\nClaims of Raniere's superior intellect and sexual powers\nWell before co-founding NXIVM, Keith Raniere made fantastical claims about his intelligence In June 1988, the Times Union profiled Raniere, reporting on his membership in the Mega Society after he achieved a high score on founder Ronald K Hoeflin's MEGA test, an unsupervised, 48-question test published in the April 1985 issue of Omni magazine [178] [179] Although the MEGA test has been widely criticized as not having been properly validated, the 1989 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records (the last to include a category for highest IQ [180]) described the Hoeflin Research Group as \"the most exclusive ultrahigh IQ society\", and the 1989 Australian edition identified Raniere, Marilyn vos Savant, and Eric Hart as the highest-scoring members of the group [181] [182] [183] [184]\n\n\nBeliefs and practices\n\nA 2003 mission statement on the NXIVM website read as follows:\n\nTeachings\nThe oldest program of NXIVM, Executive Success Programs, had students recite a \"Twelve-point Mission Statement\", pledging to \"purge\" themselves \"of all parasite and envy-based habits\", to enroll others, and to \"ethically control as much of the money, wealth and resources of the world as possible within my success plan.\" The Mission Statement also labeled students who shared Executive Success Programs materials as \"breaking a promise and breaching my contract\" and compromising \"inner honesty and integrity.\" [195] [196]\n\n\nClasses and programs\nNXIVM conducted \"Intensives,\" classes conducted for 12 hours daily for 16 days One cited price was $7,500 [200] [7] Classes were divided into modules In one module, \"Relationship Sourcing\", students were instructed to explore the benefits they would receive in the event of a partner's sudden death Another module, \"Dracula and his ghouls\", reportedly discussed psychopaths and their followers Other module titles included \"Best People; Perfect World\" and \"The Heroic Struggle\" [201] [better source needed]\n\n\nRituals and practices\nClasses by NXIVM had a number of idiosyncratic practices, described within the Rational Inquiry patent as \"rules and rituals\" and third-party sources as including:\n\n\nTourette's treatment claims\nA 2018 documentary film directed by Alessandro Molatore showcases a purported study of the use of NXIVM's exploration of meaning technique to treat Tourette syndrome The film is executive produced by Clare Bronfman The film identifies the Tourette's study's \"lead researcher\" as Dr Brandon Porter, at the time a hospitalist at St Peter's Hospital in Albany [205] [206] [207] [208]\n\n\nHuman subject experimentation\nAnother purported study Porter conducted within the NXIVM community was described as watching disturbing footage, including video of people being murdered, while their brainwaves, physiological activity, and facial and auditory responses were recorded through electroencephalography, galvanic skin response and video recording [199] [213]\n\n\nNotable participants\nEdgar Boone, the scion of a wealthy family, introduced NXIVM to numerous affluent Mexicans, becoming head of NXIVM-Mexico and rising to third in the NXIVM organization [217] [218] [219]\n\n\nCritical former members\nBarbara Bouchey was a client of Nancy Salzman, having been referred to her in 1988 Beginning in 2000, Bouchey dated Raniere In 2009, Bouchey and eight other women (\"The NXIVM Nine\") confronted Raniere with concerns about abuse within the organization That year, Bouchey left the group and later went to law enforcement [249]\n\n\nJournalists reporting on the group\nJames Odato is an investigative reporter who wrote for the Albany Times Union In 2012, Odato reported Raniere's history of pedophilia In October 2013, Odato was named in a lawsuit filed by NXIVM, along with Suzanna Andrews of Vanity Fair and blogger John J Tighe;

The character quickly became popular, leading to his own solo title in 1940 Robin, Batman's sidekick, was introduced in 1940, lightening the tone and boosting sales Over the next few years, Batman's rogues' gallery expanded with iconic villains like the Joker and Catwoman.\nThe 1950s saw Batman in lighter, science fiction-influenced stories However, declining sales led to a 1964 revamp by editor Julius Schwartz, who returned Batman to his detective roots and updated his appearance The 1966 Batman TV series introduced a campy, humorous tone, which was reflected in the comics until its

Returns in the 1980s, [10] which reintroduced Batman in a grittier, more mature context, the character's narrative evolved to explore deeper themes and darker tones [11] This period also saw the exploration of Batman's origins and psyche through works like Batman: Year One, [11] [12] and Batman: The Killing Joke, which delved into the complexities of heroism and villainy [13] In the 1990s, storylines such as \"Knightfall\" introduced new adversaries like Bane, who physically and mentally challenged Batman, leading to a temporary replacement by Jean-Paul Valley The aftermath of an earthquake in \"No Man's Land\" depicted Gotham City in chaos, further pushing Batman to new limits of heroism and survival [14] Entering the 21st century, Grant Morrison's influential run introduced Damian Wayne as Batman's son and heir, bringing familial dynamics and a new generation of challenges to the forefront Morrison's storytelling also delved into surreal and existential themes, such as in Batman R.I.P and Final Crisis, which tested Batman's resolve and sanity against cosmic threats and personal demons [15] [16] The New 52 reboot in 2011 refreshed Batman's continuity while preserving core elements of his character This era introduced modern interpretations of classic storylines, like Night of the Owls, where Batman confronts the Court of Owls, a clandestine society controlling Gotham for centuries The chilling return of the Joker in \"Death of the Family\" explored the intricate relationships within Batman's extended family of allies and adversaries More recent developments under DC Rebirth and Infinite Frontier have continued to evolve Batman's universe, exploring new characters like Gotham and Gotham Girl, and tackling contemporary issues within the context of Gotham City's ever-evolving landscape of crime and heroism [17]\n\n\nCharacterization\nBatman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, Dr Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek justice against criminals He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal residence, Wayne Manor Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate [18] [19] He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, which in part addresses social issues encouraging crime as well as assisting victims of it, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite [20] In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip while feigning near-drunkenness with consuming large quantities of disguised ginger ale since Wayne is actually a strict teetotaler to maintain his physical and mental prowess [21] Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman account for most of his time [22]\n\n\nBruce Wayne\nBatman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, Dr Thomas Wayne and

a strict teetotaler to maintain his physical and mental prowess [21] Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman account for most of his time [22]\n\n\nPersonality\nBatman's primary character traits can be summarized as \"wealth; physical prowess; deductive abilities and obsession\" [30] The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years with different creative teams Dennis O'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes: \"Julie Schwartz did a Batman in Batman and Detective and Murray Boltinoff did a Batman in the Brave and the Bold and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts, nor were they asked to do so Continuity was not important in those days.\" [31]\n\n\nOthers\nOn several occasions former Robin Dick Grayson has served as Batman; most notably in 2009 while Wayne was believed dead, and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in 2010 [44] As part of DC's 2011 continuity relaunch, Grayson returned to being Nightwing following the Flashpoint crossover event.\n\n\nSupporting characters\nBatman's interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of characters [30]\n\n\nEnemies\nBatman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime [46] These foes are commonly referred to as Batman's rogues gallery Batman's \"most implacable foe\" is the Joker, a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance The Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance As a \"personification of the irrational\", the Joker represents \"everything Batman  [opposes]\" [47] Other long-time recurring foes that are part of Batman's rogues gallery include Catwoman (a cat burglar anti-heroine who is variously an ally and romantic interest), the Penguin, Ra's al Ghul, Two-Face (Harvey Dent), the Riddler, the Scarecrow, Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Bane, Clayface, and Killer Croc, among others Many of Batman's adversaries are often psychiatric patients at Arkham Asylum.\n\n\nAllies\nAlfred Pennyworth, Batman's loyal butler and father figure, first appeared in Batman #16 (1943) After Bruce Wayne's parents were killed, Alfred raised Bruce and became one of the few people to know his secret identity He is often portrayed as a steadying presence in Bruce's life, offering both emotional support and practical assistance in Batman's crime-fighting endeavors More than just a caretaker, Alfred is a trusted ally and sometimes sidekick, sharing Wayne Manor with Bruce and contributing to Batman's mission [46]\n\n\nSidekicks\nRobin, Batman's vigilante partner, has been a widely recognized supporting character for many years; each iteration of the Robin character, of which there have been five in the mainstream continuity, function as members of the Batman family, but additionally, as Batman's \"central\" sidekick in various media [49] Bill Finger stated that he wanted to include Robin because \"Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking.\" [50] The first Robin, Dick Grayson, was introduced in 1940 In the 1970s he finally grew up, went off to college and became the hero Nightwing A second Robin, Jason Todd was introduced in the 1980s, following Dick Grayson's departure from the role Initially impulsive and rebellious, Jason's tenure as Robin was controversial among fans In 1988, DC held a fan vote to determine his fate in the iconic A Death in the Family storyline, where the Joker brutally beat Jason with a crowbar and left him to die in an explosion The fans voted for his death However, Jason was later resurrected and returned as the antihero Red Hood [51]\n\n\nRomantic interests\nBatman's romantic history spans decades, filled with relationships that reflect his struggle between personal happiness and his duty as Gotham's protector His first love interest was Julie Madison, introduced in Detective Comics #31 (1939) Though engaged to Bruce Wayne, she left due to his distant and playboy persona, highlighting the conflict between Bruce's dual life and his desire for a normal relationship [57]\n\n\nAbilities\nBatman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\" [60] Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies, and as a proficient scientist, he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage In the stories, Batman is regarded as one of the world's greatest detectives, if not the world's greatest crime solver [61] Batman has been repeatedly described as having a genius-level intellect, being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe, and having peak human physical and mental conditioning [62] As a polymath, his knowledge and expertise in countless disciplines is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC Universe He has shown prowess in assorted fields such as mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry, and several levels of engineering [63] He has traveled the world acquiring the skills needed to aid him in his endeavors as Batman In the Superman: Doomed story arc, Superman considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet [64]\n\n\nSkills and training\nBatman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\" [60] Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives

specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of which usually share a bat motif Batman historian Les Daniels credits Gardner Fox with creating the concept of Batman's arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in Detective Comics #29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons the batarang and the \"Batgyro\" in Detective Comics #31 and 32 (Sept and October 1939) [67]\n\n\nFictional character biography\nBatman's history has undergone many retroactive continuity revisions, both minor and major Elements of the character's history have varied greatly Scholars William Uricchio and Roberta E Pearson noted in the early 1990s, \"Unlike some fictional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades.\" [71]\n\n\n20th century\nThe central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character's origin story [30] As a young boy, Bruce Wayne was horrified and traumatized when he watched his parents, the physician Dr Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, murdered with a gun by a mugger named Joe Chill Batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents This event drove him to train his body to its peak condition and fight crime in Gotham City as Batman Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, \"Until recently, the fixed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number\", [30] a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories [72]\n\n\nOrigin\nThe central fixed event in the Batman

[72]\n\n\nGolden Age\nIn Batman's first appearance in Detective Comics #27, he is already operating as a crime-fighter [73] Batman's origin is first presented in Detective Comics #33 (November 1939) and is later expanded upon in Batman #47 As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable Gotham City socialites Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor, and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of 8, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill while on their way home from a movie theater That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough \"Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible ...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona [74]\n\n\nSilver Age\nThe Silver Age of Comic Books in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced Barry Allen as a new, updated version of the Flash Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as Earth-One The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until Detective Comics #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.\n\n\nBronze Age\nIn 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics Additionally, Batman also moves from his mansion, Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime In 1974's \"Night of the Stalker\" storyline, a diploma on the wall reveals Bruce Wayne as a graduate of Yale Law School [83] Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin or Batgirl Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of the Joker as a homicidal psychopath, and the arrival of Ra's al Ghul, a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman's secret identity In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing [84]\n\n\nModern Age\nAfter the 12-issue miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics retconned the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences Frank Miller retold Batman's origin in the storyline \"Year One\" from Batman #404–407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character [85] Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the Post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration For example, Gotham's police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman's existence The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987 To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period [86]\n\n\n21st century\nDC Comics' 2005 miniseries Identity Crisis reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman's memories to prevent him from stopping the Justice League from lobotomizing Dr Light after he raped Sue Dibny Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over and, if necessary, kill the other heroes after he remembered The revelation of Batman's creation and his tacit responsibility for the Blue Beetle's death becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother EYE and the OMACs, though, at the very end, Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr seriously wounds Nightwing Picking up a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor

Bruce publicly announced that Wayne Enterprises will aid Batman on his mission, known as \"Batman, Incorporated\" However, due to rebooted continuity that occurred as part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch of all of its comic books, The New 52, Dick Grayson was restored as Nightwing with Wayne serving as the sole Batman once again The relaunch also interrupted the publication of Batman, Incorporated, which resumed its story in 2012–2013 with changes to suit the new status quo.\n\n\nThe New 52\nDuring The New 52, all of DC's continuity was reset and the timeline was changed, making Batman the first

Batman discovers the Court of Owls, a secret organization operating in Gotham for decades [112] Batman somewhat defeats the Court by defeating Owlman, [113] although the Court continues to operate on a smaller scale [114] The Joker returns after losing the skin on his face (as shown in the opening issue of the second volume of Detective Comics) and attempts to kill the Batman's allies, though he is stopped by Batman [115] After some time, Joker returns again, and both he and Batman die while fighting each other Jim Gordon temporarily becomes Batman, using a high-tech suit, while it is revealed that an amnesiac Bruce Wayne is still alive [citation needed] Gordon attempts to fight a new villain called Mr Bloom, while Wayne, regains his memories with the help of Alfred Pennyworth and

"**Introduction**\n\nBatman is a fictional superhero created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. He first appeared in Detective Comics #27 in 1939 and has since become one of the most iconic and enduring characters in popular culture. As the alter ego of billionaire philanthropist Bruce Wayne, Batman is a crime-fighter who uses his intellect, athleticism, and advanced technology to protect the city of Gotham from various villains and threats.\n\n**Creation and Early History**\n\nIn early 1939, following the success of Superman, DC Comics' editors requested more superheroes. Bob Kane created Batman, initially drawing a character with red tights, bat wings, and a domino mask. Bill Finger, a collaborator, made significant contributions by suggesting a cowl, cape, gloves, and a darker costume. The character's alter ego, Bruce Wayne, was inspired by historical figures Robert the Bruce and Mad Anthony Wayne. Batman's early adventures drew inspiration from contemporary pulp fiction and characters like Zorro and the Shadow, establishing Batman as a master detective with a dark, brooding persona driven by the murder of his parents.\n\n**Golden, Silver, and Bronze Ages**\n\nBatman debuted in Detective Comics #27 in 1939. Early stories were dark, featuring a Batman who did not shy away from killing. The character quickly became popular, leading to his own solo title in 1940. Robin, Batman's sidekick, was introduced in 1940, lightening the tone and boosting sales. Over the next few years, Batman's rogues' gallery expanded with iconic villains like the Joker and Catwoman. The 1950s saw Batman in lighter, science fiction-influenced stories. However, declining sales led to a 1964 revamp by editor Julius Schwartz, who returned Batman to his detective roots and updated his appearance. The 1966 Batman TV series introduced a campy, humorous tone, which was reflected in the comics until its cancellation in 1968.\n\n**Modern Age and Reboots**\n\nIn the Modern Age of Comic Books, Batman comics have undergone significant transformations, reflecting changing storytelling trends and audience interests.

Batman to his detective roots and updated his appearance The 1966 Batman TV series introduced a campy, humorous tone, which was reflected in the comics until its cancellation in 1968 In the 1970s, writers Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams restored Batman's dark, gritty nature, a trend that continued despite fluctuating sales.\n\n\nModern Age and reboots\nIn the Modern Age of Comic Books Batman comics have undergone significant transformations, reflecting changing storytelling trends and audience interests Beginning with seminal works like The Dark Knight Returns in the 1980s, [10] which reintroduced Batman in a grittier, more mature context, the character's narrative evolved to explore deeper themes and darker tones [11] This period also saw the exploration of Batman's origins and psyche through works like Batman: Year One, [11] [12] and Batman: The Killing Joke, which delved into the complexities of heroism and villainy [13] In the 1990s, storylines such as \"Knightfall\" introduced new adversaries like Bane, who physically and mentally challenged Batman, leading to a temporary replacement by Jean-Paul Valley The aftermath of an earthquake in \"No Man's Land\" depicted Gotham City in chaos, further pushing Batman to new limits of heroism and survival [14] Entering the 21st century, Grant Morrison's influential run introduced Damian Wayne as Batman's son and heir, bringing familial dynamics and a new generation of challenges to the forefront Morrison's storytelling also delved into surreal and existential themes, such as in Batman R.I.P and Final Crisis, which tested Batman's resolve and sanity against cosmic threats and personal demons [15] [16] The New 52 reboot in 2011 refreshed Batman's continuity while preserving core elements of his character This era introduced modern interpretations of classic storylines, like Night of the Owls, where Batman confronts the Court of Owls, a clandestine society controlling Gotham for centuries The chilling return of the Joker in \"Death of the Family\" explored the intricate relationships within Batman's extended family of allies and adversaries More recent developments under DC Rebirth and Infinite Frontier have continued to evolve Batman's universe, exploring new characters like Gotham and Gotham Girl, and tackling contemporary issues within the context of Gotham City's ever-evolving landscape of crime and heroism [17]\n\n\nCharacterization\nBatman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, Dr Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek justice against criminals He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal residence, Wayne Manor Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate [18] [19] He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, which in part addresses social issues encouraging crime as well as assisting victims of it, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite [20] In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip while feigning near-drunkenness with consuming large quantities of disguised ginger ale since Wayne is actually a strict teetotaler to maintain his physical and mental prowess [21] Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman account for most of his time [22]\n\n\nBruce

physical and mental prowess [21] Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman account for most of his time [22]\n\n\nPersonality\nBatman's primary character traits can be summarized as \"wealth; physical prowess; deductive abilities and obsession\" [30] The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years with different creative teams Dennis O'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes: \"Julie Schwartz did a Batman in Batman and Detective and Murray Boltinoff did a Batman in the Brave and the Bold and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts, nor were they asked to do so Continuity was not important in those days.\" [31]\n\n\nOthers\nOn several occasions former Robin Dick Grayson has served as Batman; most notably in 2009 while Wayne was believed dead, and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in 2010 [44] As part of DC's 2011 continuity relaunch, Grayson returned to being Nightwing following the Flashpoint crossover event.\n\n\nSupporting characters\nBatman's interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of characters [30]\n\n\nEnemies\nBatman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime [46] These foes are commonly referred to as Batman's rogues gallery Batman's \"most implacable foe\" is the Joker, a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance The Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance As a \"personification of the irrational\", the Joker represents \"everything Batman  [opposes]\" [47] Other long-time recurring foes that are part of Batman's rogues gallery include Catwoman (a cat burglar anti-heroine who is variously an ally and romantic interest), the Penguin, Ra's al Ghul, Two-Face (Harvey Dent), the Riddler, the Scarecrow, Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Bane, Clayface, and Killer Croc, among others Many of Batman's adversaries are often psychiatric patients at Arkham Asylum.\n\n\nAllies\nAlfred Pennyworth, Batman's loyal butler and father figure, first appeared in Batman #16 (1943) After Bruce Wayne's parents were killed, Alfred raised Bruce and became one of the few people to know his secret identity He is often portrayed as a steadying presence in Bruce's life, offering both emotional support and practical assistance in Batman's crime-fighting endeavors More than just a caretaker, Alfred is a trusted ally and sometimes sidekick, sharing Wayne Manor with Bruce and contributing to Batman's mission [46]\n\n\nSidekicks\nRobin, Batman's vigilante partner, has been a widely recognized supporting character for many years; each iteration of the Robin character, of which there have been five in the mainstream continuity, function as members of the Batman family, but additionally, as Batman's \"central\" sidekick in various media [49] Bill Finger stated that he wanted to include Robin because \"Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking.\" [50] The first Robin, Dick Grayson, was introduced in 1940 In the 1970s he finally grew up, went off to college and became the hero Nightwing A second Robin, Jason Todd was introduced in the 1980s, following Dick Grayson's departure from the role Initially impulsive and rebellious, Jason's tenure as Robin was controversial among fans In 1988, DC held a fan vote to determine his fate in the iconic A Death in the Family storyline, where the Joker brutally beat Jason with a crowbar and left him to die in an explosion The fans voted for his death However, Jason was later resurrected and returned as the antihero Red Hood [51]\n\n\nRomantic interests\nBatman's romantic history spans decades, filled with relationships that reflect his struggle between personal happiness and his duty as Gotham's protector His first love interest was Julie Madison, introduced in Detective Comics #31 (1939) Though engaged to Bruce Wayne, she left due to his distant and playboy persona, highlighting the conflict between Bruce's dual life and his desire for a normal relationship [57]\n\n\nAbilities\nBatman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on \"his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess\" [60] Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies, and as a proficient scientist, he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage In the stories, Batman is regarded as one of the world's greatest detectives, if not the world's greatest crime solver [61] Batman has been repeatedly described as having a genius-level intellect, being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe, and having peak human physical and mental conditioning [62] As a polymath, his knowledge and expertise in countless disciplines is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC Universe He has shown prowess in assorted fields such as mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry, and several levels of engineering [63] He has traveled the world acquiring the skills needed to aid him in his endeavors as Batman In the Superman: Doomed story arc, Superman considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet [64]\n\n\nSkills and

the Superman: Doomed story arc, Superman considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet [64]\n\n\nTechnology\nBatman utilizes a vast arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of which usually share a bat motif Batman historian Les Daniels credits Gardner Fox with creating the concept of Batman's arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in Detective Comics #29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons the batarang and the \"Batgyro\" in Detective Comics #31 and 32 (Sept and October 1939) [67]\n\n\nFictional character biography\nBatman's history has undergone many retroactive continuity revisions, both minor and major Elements of the character's history have varied greatly Scholars William Uricchio and Roberta E Pearson noted in the early 1990s, \"Unlike some fictional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades.\" [71]\n\n\n20th century\nThe central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character's origin story [30] As a young boy, Bruce Wayne was horrified and traumatized when he watched his parents, the physician Dr Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, murdered with a gun by a mugger named Joe Chill Batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents This event drove him to train his body to its peak condition and fight crime in Gotham City as Batman Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, \"Until recently, the fixed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number\", [30] a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories [72]\n\n\nOrigin\nThe central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character's

appearance in Detective Comics #27, he is already operating as a crime-fighter [73] Batman's origin is first presented in Detective Comics #33 (November 1939) and is later expanded upon in Batman #47 As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable Gotham City socialites Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor, and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of 8, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill while on their way home from a movie theater That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough \"Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible ...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona [74]\n\n\nSilver Age\nThe Silver Age of Comic Books in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced Barry Allen as a new, updated version of the Flash Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as Earth-One The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until Detective Comics #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.\n\n\nBronze Age\nIn 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics Additionally, Batman also moves from his mansion, Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime In 1974's \"Night of the Stalker\" storyline, a diploma on the wall reveals Bruce Wayne as a graduate of Yale Law School [83] Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin or Batgirl Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of the Joker as a homicidal psychopath, and the arrival of Ra's al Ghul, a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman's secret identity In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing [84]\n\n\nModern Age\nAfter the 12-issue miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics retconned the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences Frank Miller retold Batman's origin in the storyline \"Year One\" from Batman #404–407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character [85] Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the Post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration For example, Gotham's police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman's existence The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987 To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period [86]\n\n\n21st century\nDC Comics' 2005 miniseries Identity Crisis reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman's memories to prevent him from stopping the Justice League from lobotomizing Dr Light after he raped Sue Dibny Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over and, if necessary, kill the other heroes after he remembered The revelation of Batman's creation and his tacit responsibility for the Blue Beetle's death becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother EYE and the OMACs, though, at the very end, Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr seriously wounds Nightwing Picking up a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger.\n\n\n2000s\nDC Comics' 2005 miniseries Identity Crisis reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman's memories to prevent him from stopping the

wounds Nightwing Picking up a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger.\n\n\n2010s\nBruce subsequently returned in Morrison's miniseries Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne, which depicted his travels through time from prehistory to present-day Gotham [107] [108] [109] Bruce's return set up Batman Incorporated, an ongoing series which focused on Wayne franchising the Batman identity across the globe, allowing Dick and Damian to continue as Gotham's Dynamic Duo Bruce publicly announced that Wayne Enterprises will aid Batman on his mission, known as \"Batman, Incorporated\" However, due to rebooted continuity that occurred as part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch of all of its comic books, The New 52, Dick Grayson was restored as Nightwing with Wayne serving as the sole Batman once again The relaunch also interrupted the publication of Batman, Incorporated, which resumed its story in 2012–2013 with changes to suit the new status quo.\n\n\nThe New 52\nDuring The New 52, all of DC's continuity was reset and the timeline was changed, making Batman the first superhero to emerge This emergence took place during Zero Year, where Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham and becomes Batman, fighting the original Red Hood [110] and the Riddler [111] In the present day, Batman discovers the Court of Owls, a secret organization operating in Gotham for decades [112] Batman somewhat defeats the Court by defeating Owlman, [113] although the Court continues to operate on a smaller scale [114] The Joker returns after losing the skin on his face (as shown in the opening issue of the second volume of Detective Comics) and attempts to kill the Batman's allies, though he is stopped by Batman [115] After some time, Joker returns again, and both he and Batman die while fighting each other Jim Gordon temporarily becomes Batman, using a high-tech suit, while it is revealed that an amnesiac Bruce Wayne is still alive [citation needed] Gordon attempts to fight a new villain called Mr Bloom, while Wayne, regains his memories with the help of Alfred Pennyworth and Julie Madison Once with his memories, Wayne becomes Batman again and defeats Mr Bloom with the help of Gordon [citation needed]\n\n\nDC Rebirth\nThe timeline was reset again during Rebirth, although no significant changes were made to the Batman mythos  [citation needed] Batman meets two new superheroes operating in Gotham named Gotham and Gotham Girl Psycho-Pirate gets into Gotham's head and turns against Batman, and is finally defeated when he is killed This event is very traumatic for Gotham Girl and she begins to lose her sanity [116]\n\n\nOther versions\nThe character of Batman has been portrayed in numerous alternative versions across various media since his debut in 1939 These adaptations explore different facets and interpretations of the character.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nBatman has ascended to the status of a global pop culture phenomenon, transcending his origins in comic books His influence expanded notably with the release of the 1989 film, which propelled him to the forefront of public consciousness through widespread merchandising The Guardian describes Batman as emblematic of the constant reinvention characteristic of modern mass culture, embodying both iconic status and commercial appeal, making him a quintessential cultural artifact of the 21st century [130]\n\n\nMedia appearances\nApart from comics, Batman's presence spans various mediums, including newspapers, radio dramas, television, stage, and film From the 1940s serials to contemporary TV shows like \"Gotham\" and \"Titans,\" Batman's legacy endures Celebrating the character's 75th anniversary, Warner Bros released \"Batman: Strange Days,\" showcasing his timeless appeal [131]\n\n\nDifferent interpretations\nGay interpretations of Batman have been studied academically since psychologist Fredric Wertham's claims in 1954 [133] Andy Medhurst and Will Brooker have explored Batman's appeal to gay audiences and the validity of a queer reading [134] Meanwhile, in psychological interpretations, Dr Travis Langley sees Batman as representing the \"shadow archetype,\" confronting inner darkness to fight evil, according to Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell's theories Langley's analysis adds depth to Batman's psychological complexity [135]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Flynn, the director of the Bureau of Investigation, appointed J. Edgar Hoover as the chief of the General Intelligence Division (GID). Hoover used his experience working as a library clerk at the Library of Congress to create an index tracking system that utilized extensive cross-referencing. This system allowed the FBI to keep track of individuals and organizations deemed a threat to national security, including those suspected of being communists, anarchists, or socialists.\n\n## Custodial Detention Index\n\nThe Custodial Detention Index (CDI), also known as the Custodial Detention List, was formed in 1939-1941 as part of a program called the \"Custodial Detention Program\" or \"Alien Enemy Control.\" This program was designed to identify and detain individuals deemed a threat to national security, particularly those who were immigrants or had ties to foreign countries. The CDI was used to track individuals who were considered a threat to national security, including those who were suspected of being communists or having ties to the Soviet Union.\n\n## Security Index/Reserve Index\n\nThe Security Index was a list maintained by the FBI that identified individuals who were deemed a threat to national security, particularly in times of emergency. This list included individuals who were suspected of being communists, anarchists, or socialists, as well as those who were considered a threat to public safety. The Reserve Index, on the other hand, was a list of individuals who were suspected of being left-wingers or having ties to the Communist Party. By the 1950s, the Security Index had 5,000 names, while the Reserve Index had 50,000 names in the Chicago field office.\n\n## Rabble Rouser Index\n\nThe Rabble Rouser Index was a list maintained by the FBI that identified individuals who were considered a threat to national security due to their activism or public statements.

Texas, in the Big Thicket region of southeast Texas [5] His father, George Washington Jones, worked in a shipyard and played harmonica and guitar; his mother, Clara (née Patterson), played piano in the Pentecostal Church on Sundays [6] When Jones was born, one of the doctors dropped him and broke his arm [6] He heard country music for the first time when he was seven, when his parents bought a radio Jones recalled to Billboard in 2006 that he would lie in bed with his parents on Saturday nights listening to the Grand Ole Opry, and would insist that his mother wake him if he fell asleep so that he could hear Roy Acuff or Bill Monroe.\n\n\nFirst recordings (1954–1957)\nJones married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954 His first record, the self-penned \"No Money in This Deal\", was recorded on January 19 and was released in February on Starday Records This began Jones's association with producer and mentor H.W \"Pappy\" Daily The song was cut in the living room of Starday Records' co-founder Jack Starnes, who produced it Around this time Jones also worked at KTRM (now KZZB) in Beaumont Deejay Gordon Baxter told Nick Tosches that Jones had acquired the nickname \"possum\" while working there [8] During his early recording sessions, Daily admonished Jones for attempting to sound too much like his heroes Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell [9] In 1996 Jones recalled to NPR that the quality of production at Starday was poor \"It was a terrible sound We recorded in a small living room of a house on a highway near Beaumont You could hear the trucks We had to stop a lot of times because it wasn't soundproof, it was just egg crates nailed on the wall and the big old semi trucks would go by and make a lot of noise and we'd have to start over again.\" Jones's first hit came with \"Why Baby Why\" in 1955, and in that year, while touring as a cast member of the Louisiana Hayride, Jones met and played shows with Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash In 1994, Jones told Nick Tosches that Presley \"stayed pretty much with his friends around him in his dressing room\" [8] Jones remained a lifelong friend of Johnny Cash, and was invited to sing at the Grand Ole Opry in 1956.\n\n\nCommercial breakout (1959–1964)\nIn 1959, Jones had his first number one on the Billboard country chart with \"White Lightnin'\", which was a more authentic rock and roll sound than his half-hearted rockabilly cuts.\n\n\nAlcoholism and decline (1964–1979)\nIn 1964, Pappy Daily secured a new contract with Musicor records For the rest of the 1960s, Jones scored only one number one (1967's \"Walk Through This World With Me\"), but he featured often in the country music charts Significant hits included \"Love Bug\" (a nod to Buck Owens and the Bakersfield sound), \"Things Have Gone to Pieces\", \"The Race Is On\", \"My Favorite Lies\", \"I'll Share My World with You\", \"Take Me\" (which he co-wrote and later recorded with Tammy Wynette), \"A Good Year for the Roses\", and \"If My Heart Had Windows\" Jones's singing style had by now evolved from the full-throated, high lonesome sound of Hank Williams and Roy Acuff on his early Starday records to the more refined, subtle style of Lefty Frizzell In a 2006 interview with Billboard, Jones acknowledged the fellow Texan's influence on his idiosyncratic phrasing: \"I got that from Lefty He always made five syllables out of one word.\"\n\n\nComeback (1980–1990)\nBy 1980, George Jones had not achieved a number-one single in six years, leading many critics to doubt his career However, he surprised the music industry when \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" reached number one on the country charts, staying there for 18 weeks The song, written by Bobby Braddock and Curly Putman, tells the story of a man who continues to love his departed lover until his death Jones's poignant delivery of the song has made it one of the greatest country songs of all time Jones's interpretation, buoyed by his delivery of the line \"first time I'd seen him smile in years,\" gives it a mournful, gripping realism It is consistently voted as one of the greatest country songs of all time, along with \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" by Hank Williams and \"Crazy\" by Patsy Cline [15] [16] Jones, who personally hated the song and considered it morbid, ultimately gave the song credit for reviving his flagging career, stating, \"a four-decade career had been salvaged by a three-minute song\" [17] Jones earned the Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 1980 The Academy of Country Music awarded the song Single of the Year and Song of the Year in 1980 It also became the Country Music Association's Song of the Year in both 1980 and 1981.\n\n\nLater years and death (1990–2013)\nIn 1990, Jones released his last proper studio album on Epic, You Oughta Be Here With Me Although the album featured several stirring performances, including the lead single \"Hell Stays Open All Night Long\" and the Roger Miller-penned title song, the single did poorly and Jones made the switch to MCA, ending his relationship with Sherrill and what was now Sony Music after 19 years His first album with MCA, And Along Came Jones, was released in 1991, and backed by MCA's powerful promotion team and producer Kyle Lehning (who had produced a string of hit albums for Randy Travis), the album sold better than his previous one had However, two singles, \"You Couldn't Get The Picture\" and \"She Loved A Lot In Her Time\" (a tribute to Jones's mother Clara), did not crack the top 30 on the charts, as Jones lost favor with country radio, as the format was altered radically during the early 1990s His last album to have significant radio airplay was 1992's Walls Can Fall, which featured the novelty song \"Finally Friday\" and \"I Don't Need Your Rockin' Chair\", a testament to his continued vivaciousness in his sixties Despite the lack of radio airplay, Jones continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame by Randy Travis in 1992 In 1996, Jones released his autobiography I Lived To Tell It All with Tom Carter, and the irony of his long career was not lost on him, with the singer writing in its preface, \"I also know that a lot of my show-business peers are going to be angry after reading this book So many have worked so hard to maintain their careers I never took my career seriously, and yet it's flourishing.\"  He also pulled no punches about his disappointment in the direction country music had taken, devoting a full chapter to the changes in the country music scene of the 1990s that had him removed from radio playlists in favor of a younger generation of pop-influenced country stars (Jones had long been a critic of country pop, and along with Wynette and Jean Shepard, he was one of the major backers of the Association of Country Entertainers, a guild promoting traditional country sounds that was founded in 1974; Jones's divorce from Wynette was a factor in the association's collapse.) Despite his absence from the country charts during this time, latter-day country superstars such as Garth Brooks, Randy Travis, Alan Jackson, and many others often paid tribute to Jones, while expressing their love and respect for his legacy as a true country legend who paved the way for their own success On February 17, 1998, The Nashville Network premiered a group of television specials called The George Jones Show, with Jones as host [6]  The program featured informal chats with Jones holding court with country's biggest stars old and new, and of course, music Guests included Loretta Lynn, Trace Adkins, Johnny Paycheck, Lorrie Morgan, Merle Haggard, Billy Ray Cyrus, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Charley Pride, Bobby Bare, Patty Loveless, and Waylon Jennings, among others.\n\n\nLegacy\nJones tirelessly defended the integrity of country music, telling Billboard in 2006, \"It's never been for love of money I thank God for it because it makes me a living But I sing because I love it, not because of the dollar signs.\" [36] Jones also went out of his way to promote younger country singers that he felt were as passionate about the music as he was \"Everybody knows he's a great singer,\" Alan Jackson stated in 1995, \"but what I like most about George is that when you meet him, he is like some old guy that works down at the gas station...even though he's a legend!\" [This quote needs a citation]\n\n\nDuets\nJones released many duets over the course of his career While his songs with Tammy Wynette are his best known, Jones claimed in his autobiography that he felt his duets with Melba Montgomery were his best Jones also recorded duet albums with Gene Pitney and his former bass player Johnny Paycheck Jones also recorded the duet albums My Very Special Guests (1979), A Taste of Yesterday's Wine with Merle Haggard (1982), Ladies Choice (1984), Friends In High Places (1991), The Bradley Barn Sessions (1994), God's Country: George Jones And Friends (2006), a second album with Merle Haggard called Kickin' Out The Footlights...Again (2006), and Burn Your Playhouse Down (2008).\n\n\nDiscography\n\n†Honorary former member; was scheduled to be invited, but died before the invitation was extended\n\nNumber-one country hits\n\n†Honorary former member; was scheduled to be invited, but died before the invitation was extended\n\nSee also\n\n†Honorary former member; was scheduled to be invited, but died before the invitation was extended\n\nReferences\n\n†Honorary former member; was scheduled to be invited, but died before the invitation was extended\n\nWorks cited\n\n†Honorary former member; was scheduled to be invited, but died before the invitation was extended\n\nFurther reading\n\n†Honorary former member; was scheduled to be invited, but died before the invitation was extended\n\nExternal links\n\n†Honorary former member; was scheduled to be invited, but died before the invitation was extended\n", "lang": "en", "article": "George Jones\n\nGeorge Jones was a legendary country music singer, known for his distinctive voice and style, which spanned over five decades.

In response to questions regarding her stance on gender rights concerning her character in the Fifty Shades film series, Johnson stated: \"I'm proud of  [the film] I completely disagree with people who think Ana's weak I think she's actually stronger than he is Everything she does is her choice And if I can be an advocate for women to do what they want to do with their bodies and not be ashamed

Johnson**\n\nDakota Mayi Johnson is an American actress and director born on October 4, 1989, in Austin, Texas. She is the daughter of actors Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, and has a complex family with six half-siblings.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nDakota Johnson was born at Brackenridge Hospital in Austin, Texas, when her father was shooting the film \"The Hot Spot\" in the state. Her maternal grandparents are Peter Griffith, an advertising executive and former child actor, and Tippi Hedren, an actress. Johnson's half-niece is actress Tracy Griffith, and her former stepfather is actor Antonio Banderas. Johnson has a complex family as each of her parents had children with three different people. Her six half-siblings are Jesse Johnson, Alexander Bauer, Stella Banderas, Grace, Jasper, and Deacon Johnson.\n\n**Career**\n\nJohnson made her film debut in 1999 in the film \"Crazy in Alabama,\" where she and her half-sister Stella Banderas played daughters to their real-life mother, Melanie Griffith. The film was directed by Antonio Banderas and was based on the 1993 novel by Mark Childress. In 2006, Johnson was chosen as Miss Golden Globe, where she served as the first second-generation Miss Golden Globe in the Globes' history.\n\n**1999–2014: Beginnings**\n\nJohnson's early career was marked by small roles in films and television shows. She appeared in the 2006 film \"The Social Network\" and the 2010 film \"Beastly.\" In 2012, she played the role of Kate in the film \"21 Jump Street.\" Johnson's breakthrough came in 2013 when she played the lead role of Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele in the film \"Fifty Shades of Grey.\" The film was a commercial success and brought Johnson international recognition.\n\n**2015–2019: Breakthrough**\n\nJohnson's breakthrough came with her leading role as Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele in the erotic romantic drama film \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" which was released in February 2015 and brought her international recognition. Johnson won the role over Lucy Hale, Felicity Jones, Elizabeth Olsen, Danielle Panabaker, and Shailene Woodley. In response to questions regarding her stance on gender rights concerning her character in the \"Fifty Shades\" film series, Johnson stated: \"I'm proud of [the film] I completely disagree with people who think Ana's weak I think she's actually stronger than he is Everything she does is her choice And if I can be an advocate for women to do what they want to do with their bodies and not be ashamed of what they want, then I'm all for that.\"\n\n**2020–present: Professional Expansion**\n\nJohnson founded the production company TeaTime Pictures, alongside former Netflix development executive Ro Donnelly, to develop films and television series.

Johnson starred alongside Tracee Ellis Ross in the dramedy film \"The High Note,\" which was released on May 29, 2020. Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that \"she's lovely to look at and can never be accused of overacting, but in terms of conveying single-minded drive, Johnson is no match for [Tracee Ellis] Ross's carefully calibrated tonal swings between imperiousness, self-awareness, isolation, and down-to-earth intimacy.\" Conversely, Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times saw it as \"maybe her best and certainly most lovable performance.\"\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nJohnson was previously involved in long-term relationships with musician Noah Gersh and actor Jordan Masterson.

with Switzerland in the opening match of Group A when Alan Shearer's 23rd-minute goal was cancelled out by a late Kubilay Türkyilmaz penalty kick [6] England defeated rivals Scotland 2–0 in their next game, and then produced one of their finest performances ever with a 4–1 win over the Netherlands [7] Patrick Kluivert's late goal for the Netherlands secured his team second place in the group and ensured that Scotland would exit another major competition on goals scored [8]\n\n\nGroup matches\nThe hosts, England, drew 1–1 with Switzerland in the opening match of Group A when Alan Shearer's 23rd-minute goal was cancelled out by a late Kubilay Türkyilmaz penalty kick [6] England defeated rivals Scotland 2–0 in their next game, and then produced one of their finest performances ever with a 4–1 win over the Netherlands [7] Patrick Kluivert's late goal for the Netherlands secured his team second place in the group and ensured that Scotland would exit another major competition on goals scored [8]\n\n\nQuarter-finals and semi-finals\nThe knockout stage was characterised by negative, defensive play; as a result, only nine goals were scored in the seven games and four of the matches were decided on penalties The first quarter-final between the hosts and Spain ended goalless, after Spain had two goals disallowed and two claims for a penalty denied [17] The English progressed 4–2 on spot kicks [18] France and Netherlands also played out a 0–0 draw, with France winning the penalty shootout 5–4 [19] Jürgen Klinsmann opened the scoring for Germany in their match against Croatia A goal from Davor Šuker evened the score after 51 minutes, before Matthias Sammer of Germany scored eight minutes later, and the game ended 2–1 to Germany [20] Czech Republic progressed after beating Portugal 1–0 [21] [22]\n\n\nFinal match\nThe final saw the Czech Republic hoping to repeat Euro 1976 when Czechoslovakia defeated West Germany; the Germans were aiming to win their third European Championship Patrik Berger scored from a penalty in 59th minute to put the Czechs ahead German substitute Oliver Bierhoff scored in the 73rd minute to make it 1–1 Five minutes into extra time, Bierhoff's shot was mishandled by Czech goalkeeper Kouba and the ball ended up in the back of the net for the first golden goal in the history of the competition [25] Germany were European champions again, but for the first time as a unified country.\n\n\nQualification\nOn 30 November 1992, UEFA formally decided to expand the tournament to sixteen teams [26] UEFA cited the increased number of international teams following the recent break up of the Soviet Union and of Yugoslavia – rising from 33 UEFA members in 1988 to 48 by 1994 – as a driving factor behind the expansion [27] Forty-seven teams ultimately entered to compete for the fifteen remaining places in the finals, alongside hosts England [28]\n\n\nQualified teams\nWith the extended format, three teams were able to qualify for their first European Championship: Bulgaria, Switzerland, and Turkey Croatia, the Czech Republic, and Russia competed for the first time in their own right since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union (though the Russian team is considered by FIFA to be the direct descendant of the Soviet Union and CIS teams that had appeared in six past tournaments and the Czech team is the descendant of the Czechoslovakia team) Seven of the eight participants at the previous tournament in 1992 were again present, with only Sweden – despite also having finished third in the World Cup two years earlier – missing out Italy and Spain qualified after missing out Euro 1992 and Romania and Portugal after 12 years.\n\n\nFinal draw\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 17 December 1995 at the International Convention Centre in Birmingham [30] Only four teams were seeded: England (as hosts), Denmark (as holders), Spain and Germany (as the two highest ranked teams) The remaining twelve teams were all unseeded and could be drawn in any group [30]\n\n\nVenues\nSince the implementation of the Taylor Report in 1990, following the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster, England now had enough all-seater stadia of sufficient capacity to hold an expanded tournament due to the necessary stadium refurbishment by its leading clubs The stadium capacities listed in the table are for the time of the tournament.\n\n\nSquads\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 22 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers.\n\n\nFinals format\nTo accommodate the expansion from an 8-team finals tournament to 16 teams, the format was changed from that used in 1992 with the addition of two extra groups in the group stage, and an extra round in the knockout phases The four groups (A to D) still contained four teams each, with the top two from each group still going through to the knockout phase 8 teams then went into the new quarter-finals, ahead of the usual semi-finals and final, with 8 teams going out at the group stage The format is exactly the one which was applied to the 1958, 1962, 1966 and 1970 World Cups, except for the absence of a third place play-off.\n\n\nMatch ball\nA custom version of the Adidas Questra, the Questra Europa, was the official match ball of the championships The design of the ball included a reworking of the England badge, and was the first coloured ball in a major football tournament [32]\n\n\nMatch officials\nMatch officials are listed in the two collapsed tables below.\n\n\nGroup stage\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the four groups progress to the quarter-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated from the tournament For the first time at a European Championship three points were awarded for a win, with one for a draw and a none for a defeat.\n\n\nTiebreakers\nFor the first time in the history of the European Championship, the position of teams tied on points was decided by their head-to-head record, and not goal difference [33] If two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:\n\n\nGroup A\nThe knockout stage was a single-elimination tournament with each round eliminating the losers Any game that was undecided by the end of the regular 90 minutes, was followed by up to thirty minutes of extra time For the first time in a major football competition, the golden goal system was applied, whereby the first team to score during the extra time would become the winner If no goal was scored there would be a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner For the first time the final was won by a golden goal.\n\n\nGroup B\nThe knockout stage was a single-elimination tournament with each round eliminating the losers Any game that was undecided by the end of the regular 90 minutes, was followed by up to thirty minutes of

aggregate attendance of 1,276,000 and average attendance of 41,158 per game were the highest for the European Championship (in its 16-team format) until the 2012 tournament [2]  However, these numbers were based on the number of tickets sold rather than the number of spectators in the ground, which was often significantly lower [48] The large number of empty seats in most of the games not involving England was blamed on a number of factors: a lack of travelling fans from most of the other nations concerned, a lack of interest among locals for games not involving England, kick-offs before 5:00 pm that made it hard for children at school and adults at work to attend, steep ticket prices, and UEFA's policy of only selling tickets in blocks (where each block consisted of a set from each of three price bands) [49]\n\n\nDisorder\nAfter England's defeat to Germany in the semi-finals, a large-scale riot took place in Trafalgar Square and the surrounding area Further outbreaks of trouble occurred in the streets of several other towns The police and German-made cars were targeted, with damage also caused to various other properties [50] A Russian student was stabbed in Brighton after attackers

The detonation of a van bomb in the city centre injured 212 people and caused an estimated £700 million worth of damage. Four days after the blast, the Provisional Irish Republican Army issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility, but regretted causing injury to civilians.\n\nEmpty seats\n-------------\n\nThe aggregate attendance of 1,276,000 and average attendance of 41,158 per game were the highest for the European Championship (in its 16-team format) until the 2012 tournament. However, these numbers were based on the number of tickets sold rather than the number of spectators in the ground, which was often significantly lower. The large number of empty seats in most of the games not involving England was blamed on a number of factors: a lack of travelling fans from most of the other nations concerned, a lack of interest among locals for games not involving England, kick-offs before 5:00 pm that made it hard for children at school and adults at work to attend, steep ticket prices, and UEFA's policy of only selling tickets in blocks (where each block consisted of a set from each of three price bands).\n\nDisorder\n---------\n\nAfter England's defeat to Germany in the semi-finals, a large-scale riot took place in Trafalgar Square and the surrounding area. Further outbreaks of trouble occurred in the streets of several other towns. The police and German-made cars were targeted, with damage also caused to various other properties.

bidding process, it had not yet been confirmed that 16 teams would be participating Instead, the bids were largely prepared as if hosting an eight-team tournament, meaning only four venues were due to be required [3] All candidates had to submit their plans by 10 December 1991 [4]\n\n\nSummary\nThe hosts, England, drew 1–1 with Switzerland in the opening match of Group A when Alan Shearer's 23rd-minute goal was cancelled out by a late Kubilay Türkyilmaz penalty kick [6] England defeated rivals Scotland 2–0 in their next game, and then produced one of their finest performances ever with a 4–1 win over the Netherlands [7] Patrick Kluivert's late goal for the Netherlands secured his team second place in the group and ensured that Scotland would exit another major competition on goals scored [8]\n\n\nGroup matches\nThe hosts, England, drew 1–1 with Switzerland in the opening match of Group A when Alan Shearer's 23rd-minute goal was cancelled out by a late Kubilay Türkyilmaz penalty kick [6] England defeated rivals Scotland 2–0 in their next game, and then produced one of their finest performances ever with a 4–1 win over the Netherlands [7] Patrick Kluivert's late goal for the Netherlands secured his team second place in the group and ensured that Scotland would exit another major competition on goals scored [8]\n\n\nQuarter-finals and semi-finals\nThe knockout stage was characterised by negative, defensive play; as a result, only nine goals were scored in the seven games and four of the matches were decided on penalties The first quarter-final between the hosts and Spain ended goalless, after Spain had two goals disallowed and two claims for a penalty denied [17] The English progressed 4–2 on spot kicks [18] France and Netherlands also played out a 0–0 draw, with France winning the penalty shootout 5–4 [19] Jürgen Klinsmann opened the scoring for Germany in their match against Croatia A goal from Davor Šuker evened the score after 51 minutes, before Matthias Sammer of Germany scored eight minutes later, and the game ended 2–1 to Germany [20] Czech Republic progressed after beating Portugal 1–0 [21] [22]\n\n\nFinal match\nThe final saw the Czech Republic hoping to repeat Euro 1976 when Czechoslovakia defeated West Germany; the Germans were aiming to win their third European Championship Patrik Berger scored from a penalty in 59th minute to put the Czechs ahead German substitute Oliver Bierhoff scored in the 73rd minute to make it 1–1 Five minutes into extra time, Bierhoff's shot was mishandled by Czech goalkeeper Kouba and the ball ended up in the back of the net for the first golden goal in the history of the competition [25] Germany were European champions again, but for the first time as a unified country.\n\n\nQualification\nOn 30 November 1992, UEFA formally decided to expand the tournament to sixteen teams [26] UEFA cited the increased number of international teams following the recent break up of the Soviet Union and of Yugoslavia – rising from 33 UEFA members in 1988 to 48 by 1994 – as a driving factor behind the expansion [27] Forty-seven teams ultimately entered to compete for the fifteen remaining places in the finals, alongside hosts England [28]\n\n\nQualified teams\nWith the extended format, three teams were able to qualify for their first European Championship: Bulgaria, Switzerland, and Turkey Croatia, the Czech Republic, and Russia competed for the first time in their own right since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union (though the Russian team is considered by FIFA to be the direct descendant of the Soviet Union and CIS teams that had appeared in six past tournaments and the Czech team is the descendant of the Czechoslovakia team) Seven of the eight participants at the previous tournament in 1992 were again present, with only Sweden – despite also having finished third in the World Cup two years earlier – missing out Italy and Spain qualified after missing out Euro 1992 and Romania and Portugal after 12 years.\n\n\nFinal draw\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 17 December 1995 at the International Convention Centre in Birmingham [30] Only four teams were seeded: England (as hosts), Denmark (as holders), Spain and Germany (as the two highest ranked teams) The remaining twelve teams were all unseeded and could be drawn in any group [30]\n\n\nVenues\nSince the implementation of the Taylor Report in 1990, following the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster, England now had enough all-seater stadia of sufficient capacity to hold an expanded tournament due to the necessary stadium refurbishment by its leading clubs The stadium capacities listed in the table are for the time of the tournament.\n\n\nSquads\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 22 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers.\n\n\nFinals format\nTo accommodate the expansion from an 8-team finals tournament to 16 teams, the format was changed from that used in 1992 with the addition of two extra groups in the group stage, and an extra round in the knockout phases The four groups (A to D) still contained four teams each, with the top two from each group still going through to the knockout phase 8 teams then went into the new quarter-finals, ahead of the usual semi-finals and final, with 8 teams going out at the group stage The format is exactly the one which was applied to the 1958, 1962, 1966 and 1970 World Cups, except for the absence of a third place play-off.\n\n\nMatch ball\nA custom version of the Adidas Questra, the Questra Europa, was the official match ball of the championships The design of the ball included a reworking of the England badge, and was the first coloured ball in a major football tournament [32]\n\n\nMatch officials\nMatch officials are listed in the two collapsed tables below.\n\n\nGroup stage\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the four groups progress to the quarter-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated from the tournament For the first time at a European Championship three points were awarded for a win, with one for a draw and a none for a defeat.\n\n\nTiebreakers\nFor the first time in the history of the European Championship, the position of teams tied on points was decided by their head-to-head record, and not goal difference [33] If two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:\n\n\nGroup A\nThe knockout stage was a single-elimination tournament with each round eliminating the losers Any game that was undecided by the end of the regular 90 minutes, was followed by up to thirty minutes of extra time For the first time in a major football competition, the golden goal system was applied, whereby the first team to score during the extra time would become the winner If no goal was scored

This event marked WWE's return to a major stadium in the United Kingdom after a 30-year hiatus, and it was the company's first major stadium event in the UK since the 1992 SummerSlam at the original Wembley Stadium.\n\n**History**\n\nThe idea of hosting a WWE event in the UK at the Principality Stadium was first proposed in 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the plans were put on hold. In 2022, WWE decided to go ahead with the event, which was initially scheduled to take place at Wembley Stadium. However, they were offered a more lucrative deal to host the event at the Principality Stadium, which led to the change of venue.\n\nThe event was a significant milestone for WWE, marking the company's first major stadium event in the UK in over three decades. The Principality Stadium, with a seating capacity of over 74,000, provided a unique and intimate setting for the event. The name \"Clash at the Castle\" was chosen in reference to the nearby Cardiff Castle, which added to the event's local flavor and cultural significance.\n\n**Pre-Event Buildup**\n\nLeading up to the event, WWE built up the storyline and hype through various promotions and advertisements. The company highlighted the return of Rey Mysterio to the UK, where he was a fan favorite during his early career. However, this time around, Mysterio was accompanied by his son Dominik, who had recently turned heel (bad guy) on his father. This created a unique and complex dynamic, with the crowd divided in their loyalties between the two.\n\nAnother key storyline heading into the event was the return of Edge, who made a surprise appearance on the WWE television show Raw a few weeks prior to the event. Edge had been absent from the company for several years due to a series of injuries, but he made a triumphant return, teasing a possible reunion with his former tag-team partner Rey Mysterio. However, this was short-lived, as Dominik's betrayal of his father led to a heated confrontation between the two, setting the stage for a highly anticipated match at Clash at the Castle.\n\n**Event Card**\n\nThe event card for Clash at the Castle was a mix of established stars and up-and-coming talent. The match between Rey Mysterio and Dominik was one of the most highly anticipated of the night, with many fans expecting a emotional and intense contest. The final WWE appearance of Adrian Street was also a notable highlight, as the veteran wrestler made his way to the ring for a nostalgic and emotional farewell.\n\nThe main roster debut of Solo Sikoa was another significant moment, as the former NXT star made his way to the main event scene. Sikoa's debut was marked by a dominant performance, showcasing his strength and agility in the ring.\n\n**Match Results**\n\nThe event card for Clash at the Castle featured a range of matches, each with its own unique storyline and implications. Here are the results of the matches that took place during the event:\n\n* Rey Mysterio vs. Dominik: Dominik won the match, marking a significant heel turn for the younger wrestler.\n* Adrian Street vs. ????: Adrian Street made his final WWE appearance, losing to an opponent who was not disclosed.\n* Solo Sikoa vs. ????: Solo Sikoa made his main roster debut, defeating an opponent in a dominant performance.\n* The Usos vs. The New Day: The Usos emerged victorious, retaining their titles in a highly competitive match.\n* Brock Lesnar vs. Bobby Lashley: Brock Lesnar won the match, retaining his title in a dominant performance.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nClash at the Castle marked a significant milestone for WWE, as the company returned to a major stadium in the UK after a 30-year hiatus. The event was a huge success, with a sold-out crowd and a range of exciting matches that showcased the best of WWE talent. The event also highlighted the company's commitment to delivering high-quality entertainment to its fans, both in the UK and around the world.\n\nIn the months and years that followed, WWE continued to build on the momentum generated by Clash at the Castle, with a range of new initiatives and events aimed at engaging with fans and promoting the company's brand. The event also marked a significant turning point for Rey Mysterio and Dominik, as the two began to feud in a series of intense and emotional matches that captivated audiences around the world.\n\nOverall, Clash at the Castle was a significant event that marked a new chapter in WWE's history, and its legacy continues to be felt in the world of professional wrestling today.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"WWE_Clash_at_the_Castle\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nIn September 2022, the American professional wrestling promotion WWE hosted a pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event in the United Kingdom (UK) called Clash at the Castle It was held in Cardiff, Wales at the Principality Stadium and its name was in reference to the Cardiff Castle, situated near the stadium This marked the company's first major stadium event to be held in the UK in 30 years Although WWE's last major event to take place in the UK was the 2003 Insurrextion, the promotion's last major event to be held in a stadium in the UK was the 1992 SummerSlam at the original Wembley Stadium [1] WWE had originally planned to host the event at present day Wembley Stadium; however, they were offered more money to host the event at the Principality Stadium [2] [3] It featured the betrayal of Rey Mysterio & Edge by Rey's son Dominik, the final WWE appearance of Adrian Street, and the main roster debut of Solo Sikoa [4]\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

[9] [10] Shooting a suspense scene in It's Murder! inspired them to approach careers in the horror genre; after researching horror cinema at drive-in theaters, Raimi was set on directing a horror film, opting to shoot a proof of concept short film – described by the director as a \"prototype\" – that would attract the interest of financiers, and use the funds raised to shoot a full-length project [10] [11] The short film that Raimi created was called Within the Woods, which was produced for $1,600 [12] For The Evil Dead, Raimi required over $100,000 [13]\n\n\nPre-production and casting\nRaimi asked for help and assistance from several of his friends and past collaborators to make The Evil Dead [16] Campbell offered to produce the film alongside Tapert, and was subsequently cast as Ash Williams, the main character, since his producing responsibilities made him the only actor willing to stay during the production's entirety [17] To acquire more actors for the project, Raimi put an ad in The Detroit News Betsy Baker was one of the actresses who responded, and Ellen Sandweiss, who appeared in Within the Woods, was also cast [16] The crew consisted almost entirely of Raimi and Campbell's friends and family The special make-up effects artist for Within the Woods, Tom Sullivan, was brought on to compose the effects after expressing a positive reaction to working with Raimi [17] He helped create many of the film's foam latex and fake blood effects, and added coffee as an extra ingredient to the traditional fake blood formula of corn syrup and food coloring [18] [19]\n\n\nPrincipal photography\nThe film was made on Kodak 16mm film stock with a rented camera [23] The inexperienced crew made filming a \"comedy of errors\" [24] The first day of filming led to them getting lost in the woods during a scene shot on a bridge [24] Several crew members were injured during the shoot, and because of the cabin's remoteness, securing medical assistance was difficult [25] One notably gruesome moment on set involved ripping off Baker's eyelashes during removal of her face-mask [21] Because of the low budget, contact lenses as thick as glass [clarification needed] had to be applied to the actors to achieve the \"demonic eyes\" effect [21] The lenses took ten minutes to apply, and could only be left on for about 15 minutes because eyes could not \"breathe\" with them applied [21] Campbell later commented that to get the effect of wearing these lenses, they had to put \"Tupperware\" over their eyes [21]\n\n\nEditing\nAfter the extensive filming process, Raimi had a \"mountain of footage\" that he had to put together [25] [37] He chose a Detroit editing association, where he met Edna Paul, to cut the film Paul's assistant was Joel Coen of the Coen brothers, who helped with the film's editing [37] [38] Paul edited a majority of the film, although Coen edited the shed sequence Coen had been inspired by Raimi's Within the Woods and liked the idea of producing a prototype film to help build the interest of investors [38] [39] Joel used the concept to help make Blood Simple with his brother Ethan, and he and Raimi became friends following the editing process [15] [39]\n\n\nPromotion and distribution rights\nWith the film completed, Raimi and the crew decided to celebrate with a \"big premiere\" [41] They chose to screen the film at Detroit's Redford Theatre, which Campbell had often visited as a child [25] Raimi opted to have the most theatrical premiere possible, using custom tickets and wind tracks [clarification needed] set in the theater, and ordering ambulances outside the theater to build atmosphere [41] [42] The premiere setup was inspired by horror director William Castle, who would often attempt to scare his audiences by using gimmicks Local turnout for the premiere exceeded the cast's expectations, with a thousand patrons showing up The audiences responded enthusiastically to the premiere, which led to Raimi's idea of \"touring\" the film to build hype [41]\n\n\nRelease\nBecause of its large promotional campaign, the film performed above expectations at the box office [46] However, the initial domestic gross was described as \"disappointing.\" [58] The movie opened in 15 theaters and grossed $108,000 in its opening weekend [58] Word of mouth later spread, and the film became a \"sleeper hit\" It grossed $2,400,000 domestically, nearly eight times its production budget Sources differ as to whether it grossed $261,944 overseas, for a worldwide gross of $2,661,944, or $27 million overseas, for a worldwide gross of $29.4 million [59] [60] [58] Raimi said in 1990 that the film \"did very well overseas and did very poorly domestically\" and that its investors earned a return of \"about five times their initial investment.\" [3]\n\n\nTheatrical\nBecause of its large promotional campaign, the film performed above expectations at the box office [46] However, the

return of \"about five times their initial investment.\" [3]\n\n\nRating\nThe film's release was met with controversy, as Raimi had made the film as gruesome as possible with neither interest in nor fear of censorship Writer Bruce Kawin described The Evil Dead as one of the most notorious splatter films of its day, along with Cannibal Holocaust and I Spit on Your Grave [40] [61]\n\n\nHome media release\nThe first VHS release of The Evil Dead was released by Thorn EMI in 1983, and Thorn's successor company HBO/Cannon Video later repackaged the film Former HBO Video's partner Congress Video, a company notable for public domain films, issued its version in 1989 [70] [71]\n\n\nReception\nUpon its release, contemporary critical opinion was largely positive [44] Bob Martin, editor of Fangoria, reviewed the film before its formal premiere and proclaimed that it \"might be the exception to the usual run of low-budget horror films\" [57] [76] He followed up on this praise after the film's premiere, stating: \"Since I started editing this magazine, I have not seen any new film that I could recommend to our readers with more confidence that it would be loved, embraced and hailed as a new milestone in graphic horror\" [77] The Los Angeles Times called the film an \"instant classic\", proclaiming it as \"probably the grisliest well-made movie ever.\" [50] [78] In a 1982 review, staff from Variety wrote that the film \"emerges as the ne plus ultra of low-budget gore and shock effect\", commenting that the \"powerful\" and inventive camerawork was key to creating a sense of dread

Tomatoes, 86% of 83 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.70/10 The website's consensus reads: \"So scrappy that it feels as illicit as a book found in the woods, The Evil Dead is a stomach-churning achievement in bad taste that marks a startling debut for wunderkind Sam Raimi.\" [81] Empire stated the film's \"reputation was deserved\", writing that the film was impressive considering its low budget and the cast's inexperience He commented that the film successfully blended the \"bizarre\" combination of Night of the Living Dead, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Three Stooges [82] A reviewer for Film4 rated The Evil Dead four-and-a-half stars out of five, musing that the film was \"energetic, original and icky\" and concluding that Raimi's \"splat-stick debut is a tight little horror classic that deserves its cult reputation, despite the best efforts of the censors.\" [83]\n\n\nAftermath\nWhile The Evil Dead received favorable critical comment when it was initially released, it failed to establish Raimi's reputation [78] It was, however, a box-office success, which led to Campbell and Raimi teaming up again for the release of another movie [93] Joel Coen and his brother Ethan had collaborated as directors and released the film Blood Simple, to critical acclaim [94] According to Campbell, Ethan, then an accountant, expressed surprise when the duo succeeded [93] The Coen brothers and Raimi collaborated on a screenplay, which was released shortly after The Evil Dead The film, Crimewave, was a box-office failure [93] The film's production was a \"disaster\", according to Campbell, who stated that \"missteps\" like Crimewave usually lead to the end of a director's career [95] Other people involved with the film expressed similar disappointment with the project [93] [96] Fortunately, Raimi had the studio support to make a sequel to The Evil Dead, which he initially decided to make out of desperation [95]\n\n\nSequels\nThe Evil Dead was followed by a series of sequels The franchise is noted from attracting attention for each sequel featuring more comedic qualities than the last, progressing into \"weirder\" territory with each film [97] Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn was a black comedy-horror film which released in 1987, and was a box-office success [98] It received general acclaim from critics, and is often considered to be superior to the first film [97] This was followed by Army of Darkness, a comedy fantasy-horror film released in 1992 At that time, Raimi had become a successful director, attracting Hollywood's interest [99] His superhero film Darkman (1990) was another box-office success, which led to an increased budget for Army of Darkness [97] [100] [101] Army of Darkness had 22.8 times the budget of the original Evil Dead, though it was not considered to be a box-office success like its two predecessors [99] [102] It was met with mostly positive critical reception [97] After any additional installments suffered through development hell, a supernatural-horror soft reboot/legacy sequel titled Evil Dead was released in 2013, featuring Jane Levy as the main character Mia Allen Directed and co-written by Fede Álvarez, the film was produced by Raimi and Campbell The film, which was a departure from the humor of the previous two films, was a moderate box office success and was praised for its dark and bloody story While various projects going through varying stages of development, a continuation was released as a television series titled, Ash vs Evil Dead Created and executive produced by Sam Raimi, the series aired from 2015 to 2018.\n\n\nForeign market\nUnofficial sequels were made in Italy, where the film was known as La Casa (\"The House\") Produced by Joe D'Amato's Filmirage, two mostly unrelated films were released and marketed as sequels to Evil Dead II: Umberto Lenzi's La Casa 3: Ghosthouse and La Casa 4: Witchery starring Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff The final film was released in 1990 and titled, La Casa 5: Beyond Darkness [92] [104] The film House II: The Second Story was reissued and retitled in Italy as La Casa 6; followed by The Horror Show which was released in Italy as La Casa 7 [92]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe original Evil Dead trilogy of films has been recognized as one of the most successful cult film series in history [58] [106] [107] David Lavery, in his book The Essential Cult TV Reader, surmised that Campbell's \"career is a practical guide to becoming a cult idol\" [107] The film launched the careers of Raimi and Campbell, who have since collaborated frequently [108] Raimi has worked with Campbell in virtually all of his films since, and Campbell has appeared in cameo roles in all three of Raimi's Spider-Man films [108] (as well as a very brief appearance at the end of Darkman), which have become some of the highest-grossing films in history [108] [109] Though it has often been considered an odd choice for Raimi, a director known for his violent horror films, to direct a family-friendly franchise, the hiring was mostly inspired by Raimi's passion for comic books as a child [108] [110] Raimi returned to the horror-comedy genre in 2009 with Drag Me to Hell [111]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "The Evil Dead is a 1981 American horror film directed by Sam Raimi and written by Raimi and his brother Ivan. The film is considered one of the most influential horror films of all time and has spawned a franchise with numerous sequels, remakes, and spin-offs.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe film follows a group of five friends – Ash Williams, his girlfriend Linda, his sister Cheryl, their friend Scott, and Scott's girlfriend Shelly – who vacation at an isolated cabin in rural Tennessee. As they settle in, strange and terrifying events begin to unfold, and the group soon discovers that the cabin is home to a malevolent force that slowly drives them to madness and ultimately, to death. The film features graphic violence, gore, and dark humor, which have become hallmarks of the horror genre.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe film features a cast of relatively unknown actors at the time, including Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, Ellen Sandweiss as Cheryl, and Betsy Baker as Shelly. The cast's inexperience and lack of professionalism added to the film's DIY aesthetic and helped to create a sense of authenticity.\n\n## Production\n\nThe film was produced on a shoestring budget of $90,000 and was shot on 16mm film stock. The production was plagued by technical difficulties, injuries, and creative differences, but Raimi's determination and vision helped to bring the film to life. The film's cast and crew were largely made up of Raimi's friends and family, who worked for little or no pay.\n\n## Pre-production and casting\n\nRaimi approached several of his friends and past collaborators to help make the film, including Bruce Campbell, who offered to produce the film alongside Rob Tapert. Campbell was subsequently cast as Ash Williams, the main character, since his producing responsibilities made him the only actor willing to stay during the production's entirety.

Its influence can be seen in many other films and TV shows, and it continues to be celebrated by fans around the world. The film's blend of horror and dark humor has made it a beloved favorite among audiences, and its continued popularity is a testament to its enduring appeal.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Evil_Dead\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nFive Michigan State University students – Ash Williams, his girlfriend Linda, his sister Cheryl, their friend Scott, and Scott's girlfriend Shelly – vacation at an isolated cabin in rural Tennessee Approaching the cabin, the group notices the porch swing move on its own but suddenly stop as Scott grabs the door key While Cheryl draws a picture of a clock, the clock stops, and she hears a faint, demonic voice instruct her to \"join us\" Her hand becomes possessed, turns pale and draws a picture of a book with a demonic face on its cover Although shaken, she does not mention the incident.\n\n\nCast\nSam Raimi and Bruce Campbell grew up together, and have been friends from an early age [7] The duo made several low-budget Super 8 mm film projects together [8] Several were comedies, including Clockwork and It's Murder!

[9] [10] Shooting a suspense scene in It's Murder! inspired them to approach careers in the horror genre; after researching horror cinema at drive-in theaters, Raimi was set on directing a horror film, opting to shoot a proof of concept short film – described by the director as a \"prototype\" – that would attract the interest of financiers, and use the funds raised to shoot a full-length project [10] [11] The short film that Raimi created was called Within the Woods, which was produced for $1,600 [12] For The Evil Dead, Raimi required over $100,000 [13]\n\n\nPre-production and casting\nRaimi asked for help and assistance from several of his friends and past collaborators to make The Evil Dead [16] Campbell offered to produce the film alongside Tapert, and was subsequently cast as Ash Williams, the main character, since his producing responsibilities made him the only actor willing to stay during the production's entirety [17] To acquire more actors for the project, Raimi put an ad in The Detroit News Betsy Baker was one of the actresses who responded, and Ellen Sandweiss, who appeared in Within the Woods, was also cast [16] The crew consisted almost entirely of Raimi and Campbell's friends and family The special make-up effects artist for Within the Woods, Tom Sullivan, was brought on to compose the effects after expressing a positive reaction to working with Raimi [17] He helped create many of the film's foam latex and fake blood effects, and added coffee as an extra ingredient to the traditional fake blood formula of corn syrup and food coloring [18] [19]\n\n\nPrincipal photography\nThe film was made on Kodak 16mm film stock with a rented camera [23] The inexperienced crew made filming a \"comedy of errors\" [24] The first day of filming led to them getting lost in the woods during a scene shot on a bridge [24] Several crew members were injured during the shoot, and because of the cabin's remoteness, securing medical assistance was difficult [25] One notably gruesome moment on set involved ripping off Baker's eyelashes during removal of her face-mask [21] Because of the low budget, contact lenses as thick as glass [clarification needed] had to be applied to the actors to achieve the \"demonic eyes\" effect [21] The lenses took ten minutes to apply, and could only be left on for about 15 minutes because eyes could not \"breathe\" with them applied [21] Campbell later commented that to get the effect of wearing these lenses, they had to put \"Tupperware\" over their eyes [21]\n\n\nEditing\nAfter the extensive filming process, Raimi had a \"mountain of footage\" that he had to put together [25] [37] He chose a Detroit editing association, where he met Edna Paul, to cut the film Paul's assistant was Joel Coen of the Coen brothers, who helped with the film's editing [37] [38] Paul edited a majority of the film, although Coen edited the shed sequence Coen had been inspired by Raimi's Within the Woods and liked the idea of producing a prototype film to help build the interest of investors [38] [39] Joel used the concept to help make Blood Simple with his brother Ethan, and he and Raimi became friends following the editing process [15] [39]\n\n\nPromotion and distribution rights\nWith the film completed, Raimi and the crew decided to celebrate with a \"big premiere\" [41] They chose to screen the film at Detroit's Redford Theatre, which Campbell had often visited as a child [25] Raimi opted to have the most theatrical premiere possible, using custom tickets and wind tracks [clarification needed] set in the theater, and ordering ambulances outside the theater to build atmosphere [41] [42] The premiere setup was inspired by horror director William Castle, who would often attempt to scare his audiences by using gimmicks Local turnout for the premiere exceeded the cast's expectations, with a thousand patrons showing up The audiences responded enthusiastically to the premiere, which led to Raimi's idea of \"touring\" the film to build hype [41]\n\n\nRelease\nBecause of its large promotional campaign, the film performed above expectations at the box office [46] However, the initial domestic gross was described as \"disappointing.\" [58] The movie opened in 15 theaters and grossed $108,000 in its opening weekend [58] Word of mouth later spread, and the film became a \"sleeper hit\" It grossed $2,400,000 domestically, nearly eight times its production budget Sources differ as to whether it grossed $261,944 overseas, for a worldwide gross of $2,661,944, or $27 million overseas, for a worldwide gross of $29.4 million [59] [60] [58] Raimi said in 1990 that the film \"did very well overseas and did very poorly domestically\" and that its investors earned a return of \"about five times their initial investment.\" [3]\n\n\nTheatrical\nBecause of its large promotional campaign, the film performed above expectations at the box office [46] However, the

return of \"about five times their initial investment.\" [3]\n\n\nRating\nThe film's release was met with controversy, as Raimi had made the film as gruesome as possible with neither interest in nor fear of censorship Writer Bruce Kawin described The Evil Dead as one of the most notorious splatter films of its day, along with Cannibal Holocaust and I Spit on Your Grave [40] [61]\n\n\nHome media release\nThe first VHS release of The Evil Dead was released by Thorn EMI in 1983, and Thorn's successor company HBO/Cannon Video later repackaged the film Former HBO Video's partner Congress Video, a company notable for public domain films, issued its version in 1989 [70] [71]\n\n\nReception\nUpon its release, contemporary critical opinion was largely positive [44] Bob Martin, editor of Fangoria, reviewed the film before its formal premiere and proclaimed that it \"might be the exception to the usual run of low-budget horror films\" [57] [76] He followed up on this praise after the film's premiere, stating: \"Since I started editing this magazine, I have not seen any new film that I could recommend to our readers with more confidence that it would be loved, embraced and hailed as a new milestone in graphic horror\" [77] The Los Angeles Times called the film an \"instant classic\", proclaiming it as \"probably the grisliest well-made movie ever.\" [50] [78] In a 1982 review, staff from Variety wrote that the film \"emerges as the ne plus ultra of low-budget gore and shock effect\", commenting that the \"powerful\" and inventive camerawork was key to creating a sense of dread

Tomatoes, 86% of 83 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.70/10 The website's consensus reads: \"So scrappy that it feels as illicit as a book found in the woods, The Evil Dead is a stomach-churning achievement in bad taste that marks a startling debut for wunderkind Sam Raimi.\" [81] Empire stated the film's \"reputation was deserved\", writing that the film was impressive considering its low budget and the cast's inexperience He commented that the film successfully blended the \"bizarre\" combination of Night of the Living Dead, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Three Stooges [82] A reviewer for Film4 rated The Evil Dead four-and-a-half stars out of five, musing that the film was \"energetic, original and icky\" and concluding that Raimi's \"splat-stick debut is a tight little horror classic that deserves its cult reputation, despite the best efforts of the censors.\" [83]\n\n\nAftermath\nWhile The Evil Dead received favorable critical comment when it was initially released, it failed to establish Raimi's reputation [78] It was, however, a box-office success, which led to Campbell and Raimi teaming up again for the release of another movie [93] Joel Coen and his brother Ethan had collaborated as directors and released the film Blood Simple, to critical acclaim [94] According to Campbell, Ethan, then an accountant, expressed surprise when the duo succeeded [93] The Coen brothers and Raimi collaborated on a screenplay, which was released shortly after The Evil Dead The film, Crimewave, was a box-office failure [93] The film's production was a \"disaster\", according to Campbell, who stated that \"missteps\" like Crimewave usually lead to the end of a director's career [95] Other people involved with the film expressed similar disappointment with the project [93] [96] Fortunately, Raimi had the studio support to make a sequel to The Evil Dead, which he initially decided to make out of desperation [95]\n\n\nSequels\nThe Evil Dead was followed by a series of sequels The franchise is noted from attracting attention for each sequel featuring more comedic qualities than the last, progressing into \"weirder\" territory with each film [97] Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn was a black comedy-horror film which released in 1987, and was a box-office success [98] It received general acclaim from critics, and is often considered to be superior to the first film [97] This was followed by Army of Darkness, a comedy fantasy-horror film released in 1992 At that time, Raimi had become a successful director, attracting Hollywood's interest [99] His superhero film Darkman (1990) was another box-office success, which led to an increased budget for Army of Darkness [97] [100] [101] Army of Darkness had 22.8 times the budget of the original Evil Dead, though it was not considered to be a box-office success like its two predecessors [99] [102] It was met with mostly positive critical reception [97] After any additional installments suffered through development hell, a supernatural-horror soft reboot/legacy sequel titled Evil Dead was released in 2013, featuring Jane Levy as the main character Mia Allen Directed and co-written by Fede Álvarez, the film was produced by Raimi and Campbell The film, which was a departure from the humor of the previous two films, was a moderate box office success and was praised for its dark and bloody story While various projects going through varying stages of development, a continuation was released as a television series titled, Ash vs Evil Dead Created and executive produced by Sam Raimi, the series aired from 2015 to 2018.\n\n\nForeign market\nUnofficial sequels were made in Italy, where the film was known as La Casa (\"The House\") Produced by Joe D'Amato's Filmirage, two mostly unrelated films were released and marketed as sequels to Evil Dead II: Umberto Lenzi's La Casa 3: Ghosthouse and La Casa 4: Witchery starring Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff The final film was released in 1990 and titled, La Casa 5: Beyond Darkness [92] [104] The film House II: The Second Story was reissued and retitled in Italy as La Casa 6; followed by The Horror Show which was released in Italy as La Casa 7 [92]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe original Evil Dead trilogy of films has been recognized as one of the most successful cult film series in history [58] [106] [107] David Lavery, in his book The Essential Cult TV Reader, surmised that Campbell's \"career is a practical guide to becoming a cult idol\" [107] The film launched the careers of Raimi and Campbell, who have since collaborated frequently [108] Raimi has worked with Campbell in virtually all of his films since, and Campbell has appeared in cameo roles in all three of Raimi's Spider-Man films [108] (as well as a very brief appearance at the end of Darkman), which have become some of the highest-grossing films in history [108] [109] Though it has often been considered an odd choice for Raimi, a director known for his violent horror films, to direct a family-friendly franchise, the hiring was mostly inspired by Raimi's passion for comic books as a child [108] [110] Raimi returned to the horror-comedy genre in 2009 with Drag Me to Hell [111]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

and societal norms [13] The film invites viewers to reconsider preconceived notions of romance and embrace diverse expressions of love and desire that are expressed through the movie and often overlooked in Austen's original writing.\"Fire Island\" serves as both a tribute to Jane Austen's themes and a celebration of queer identity and community [12]\n\n\nClass relations\nThe film portrays the ways in which queer individuals assess one another, drawing from their own experiences of discrimination and marginalization to perpetuate a hierarchical class system seen in a straight community as way to elevate their own social status within the community [14] The characters navigate the intricacies of social class within the queer community, even in a space like Fire Island, where traditional heterosexual norms are absent Joel Kim Booster, the screenwriter, draws parallels between Austen's exploration of class struggles and the dynamics observed within the queer community He emphasizes how, in the absence of straight oppression, queer individuals can inadvertently recreate artificial class systems and hierarchies [14]\n\n\nRace relations\nIn addition to class dynamics, Fire Island tackles issues of race within the queer community, particularly highlighting the experiences of Asian American characters The film features a predominantly POC cast, reflecting the diverse realities of queer individuals Characters like Bowen Yang's Howie represent the intersection of being queer and Asian-American, adding layers to the narrative and offering representation to underrepresented communities within the LGBTQ+ umbrella [14]\n\n\nFire Island as a setting\n\"Fire Island\" serves as a poignant exploration of queer spaces, particularly focusing on the titular island as a haven for the LGBTQ+ community The film celebrates Fire Island's significance as a historic queer hotspot, where individuals could socialize without fear of judgment or persecution Throughout the narrative, there is a deliberate absence of straight characters, allowing queer culture to be glorified and celebrated authentically [17] This specificity highlights Fire Island as a place where queer individuals can exist free from the influence of heteronormativity, exploring the nuances of LGBTQ+ life without the need to cater to cis-het audiences [17]\n\n\nRelease\nThe film was released June 3, 2022, on Hulu in the United States, Star+ in Latin America, and later released on June 17 Disney+ via Star in other international territories [9] [18]\n\n\nReception\nAccording to Whip Media's viewership tracking app TV Time, Fire Island was the eighth most anticipated film during the month of June 2022 [19] According to the streaming aggregator Reelgood, Fire Island was the sixth most streamed movie across all platforms during the week of June 11, 2022 [20]\n\n\nAudience viewership\nAccording to Whip Media's viewership tracking app TV Time, Fire Island was the eighth most anticipated film during the month of June 2022 [19] According to the streaming aggregator Reelgood, Fire Island was the sixth most streamed movie across all platforms during the week of June 11, 2022 [20]\n\n\nCritical reception\nFire Island received positive reviews from critics upon release [21] [22] [23] [24] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 112 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.4/10 The website's consensus reads: \"Brought to life by a tremendously talented cast, the breezily entertaining Fire Island proves there are still fresh ways to

{"title": "2024_South_African_general_election", "content": "\nBackground\nThe election date of 29 May 2024 was declared by the incumbent president Cyril Ramaphosa on 20 February [6] [7]\n\n\nuMkhonto we Sizwe\nOn 16 December 2023, former president Jacob Zuma announced his departure from the ANC, accusing the party and incumbent president Cyril Ramaphosa of serving as a \"proxy for white monopoly capital.\" He was also noted as calling the ANC \"sellouts\" and \"apartheid collaborators\" He also announced establishment of his own political party, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), named after the apartheid-era military wing of the ANC [13] The latter filed a lawsuit against the MK's registration in the Electoral Commission of South Africa, which was dismissed by the Electoral Court of South Africa on 26 March 2024 due to lack of merit The ANC also plans to file a lawsuit against the party's naming after the historic MK [14] According to opinion polling, it was suggested that MK could become the kingmakers after the elections [15]\n\n\nMulti-Party Charter\nA pre-election agreement called the Multi-Party Charter was signed between the Democratic Alliance (DA), Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus), ActionSA and three other parties with the aim of presenting a united front against the three-decade rule of the African National Congress (ANC) party and the rise of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK Party) and the Patriotic Alliance (PA) [25] [26] [27] The Spectrum National Party, Ekhethu People's Party and Unemployed National Party [28] joined the MPC but failed to meet the Independent Electoral Commission's minimum number of signatures required to contest seats in the National Assembly [29] On 7 October 2023, the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) joined the charter Going into the election, the MPC members represented 112 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly [30] During the 2024 election, the parties in the charter collectively won 119 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly, increasing the number of seats by seven On 6 June 2024, ActionSA announced that they would leave the Multi-Party Charter This decision reduced the charter's seat count from 119 to 113 in the 400-seat National Assembly [31] [32]\n\n\nVoter turnout\nVoter turnout has been decreasing since the end of apartheid, when 86% of eligible voters turned out [33] For this election, 27 million people were eligible to vote [34] Fifty-five percent of them were women, while voter registration was highest among those aged between 30 and 39 years old [35] Only 58% of the country's registered voters voted in the election.\n\n\nElectoral system\nSouth Africa has a parliamentary system of government The president of South Africa is unusual among heads of state of countries with a parliamentary system in that the head of government, who holds executive powers, is titled president and also plays the ceremonial role of head of state.\n\n\nRegional ballot\nThe regional ballot is one of the two ballots used in South Africa's national elections, alongside the national ballot Voters were also presented with a third ballot, a single ballot used for the election of members of the nine provincial legislatures, held on the same day The regional ballot is used to elect representatives to the National Assembly from each of the country's nine provinces The regional ballot is proportional, meaning that seats are allocated to parties and independent candidates based on the number of votes received [40]\n\n\nElection of the National Assembly and provincial legislatures\nOn 17 April 2023, president Cyril Ramaphosa signed the South African Electoral Amendment Bill into law allowing independent candidates to stand for election to the National Assembly and provincial legislatures while keeping proportional representation with closed lists Two hundred members will be elected from national party lists, while the remaining 200 seats will be contested by political parties and independent candidates in each of the nine provinces In provincial legislatures, the single-tier multimember proportional system will continue to apply, with political parties and independent candidates contesting for seats Voters will receive three ballot papers as opposed to two in previous elections; the first ballot will be to elect the 200 members of the National Assembly only contested by political parties; the second ballot will be to elect the remaining 200 members of the National Assembly, which will be contested by political parties and independent candidates in each of the nine provinces; and the third ballot will be to elect members of the provincial legislatures with political parties and independent candidates as well [42]\n\n\nElection of the president and premiers\nFollowing the election, the president of South Africa was elected by the National Assembly Although the president is required to be a member of the National Assembly at the time of election, a person who is elected as president must resign their seat in order to assume office [43] The premiers of each province will also be elected by the respective provincial legislatures after the election [37]\n\n\nNCOP elections\nThe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) comprises 90 members, ten of whom are elected by each of the provincial legislatures in proportion to the composition of the legislature The NCOP members will be sworn in the day after the first sitting of the National Assembly [37]\n\n\nParties and candidates\nThe election saw 70 political parties register, the highest number for a general election in South Africa It is also the first general election to allow independent candidates to run for the National Assembly [34]\n\n\nPreliminary candidate lists\nOn 26 March 2024, the Independent Electoral Commission published the preliminary candidate lists, listing the following fifty-two parties as having national candidates (as opposed to regional or provincial candidates): [44] #Hope4SA, Abantu Batho Congress, Able Leadership, Action Alliance Development Party, ActionSA, Africa Africans Reclaim, African Christian Democratic Party, African Congress for Transformation, African Content Movement, African Heart Congress, African Independent Congress, African Movement Congress, African National Congress, African People's Convention, African People's Movement, African Transformation Movement, Al Jama-ah, All Citizens Party, Alliance of Citizens for Change, Allied Movement for Change (AM4C), Azanian People's Organisation, Build One South Africa with Mmusi Maimane, Citizens, Congress of the People, Conservatives in Action, Democratic Alliance, Democratic Liberal Congress, Economic Freedom Fighters, Economic Liberators Forum South Africa, Forum 4 Service Delivery, Free Democrats, Good, Independent South African National Civic Organisation, Inkatha Freedom Party, National Coloured Congress, National Freedom Party, Northern Cape Communities Movement, Organic Humanity Movement, Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, Patriotic Alliance, People's Movement for Change, Referendum Party, Rise Mzansi, Sizwe Ummah Nation, South African Rainbow Alliance, South African Royal Kingdoms Organization, uMkhonto weSizwe, United Africans Transformation, United Democratic Movement, United Independent Movement, Vryheidsfront Plus, and Xiluva.\n\n\nFinal candidate lists and independent candidates\nOn 10 April 2024, the Independent Electoral Commission published the final candidate lists, again listing fifty-two parties as having national compensatory candidates (as opposed to national regional and provincial) The Independent South African National Civic Organisation no longer appeared on the list, whereas the Africa Restoration Alliance was added [45] Six independent candidates appeared on the national regional lists, namely Zackie Achmat, Louis Liebenberg, Anele Mda, Lovemore N'dou, Ntakadzeni Phathela, and Lehlohonolo Ramoba [46]\n\n\nCampaign issues\nOn 15 May 2024, two weeks before the election, president Ramaphosa signed the National Health Insurance (NHI) Act into law, establishing a National Health Insurance state fund to provide more South Africans access to private healthcare [47] The goal of the bill is to eventually phase out the use of private healthcare, replacing it with the NHI as the sole purchaser and provider of health insurance The DA is staunchly opposed to the bill on the premise that it could lead to large tax increases and corruption by ANC \"cadre deployment,\" and have promised to challenge it in court [48] [49]\n\n\nHealthcare\nOn 15 May 2024, two weeks before the election, president Ramaphosa signed the National Health Insurance (NHI) Act into law, establishing a National Health Insurance state fund to provide more South Africans access to private healthcare [47] The goal of the bill is to eventually phase out the use of private healthcare, replacing it with the NHI as the sole purchaser and provider of health insurance The DA is staunchly opposed to the bill on the premise that it could lead to large tax increases and corruption by ANC \"cadre deployment,\" and have promised to challenge it in court [48] [49]\n\n\nIllegal immigration\nThe South African public has blamed many socioeconomic problems on illegal immigration [51] Several parties such as ActionSA, IFP, ATM and PA, [52] call for tighter border controls in response to the perceived strain caused by undocumented migrants on public services and resources [53] [54] [55] This is a widely popular stance, with the country having historically struggled with xenophobic vigilante violence (e.g Operation Dudula) [56]\n\n\nCorruption\nThe Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, known colloquially as the Zondo Commission, completed its work and submitted its final report to the president in June 2022 [57] The Commission cost the South African taxpayer \"almost R1 billion\" [58] Investigator Paul Holden of Shadow World Investigations read into evidence that state capture cost the South African economy at least R49 billion [59]\n\n\nLand reform\nThe ANC's proposed amendment of section 25 of the constitution of South Africa which failed in the Parliament of South Africa, by a vote of 204 MPs in favour, 145 MPs against and 0 abstentions [64] The bill required a two-thirds majority The constitutionality of the amendment was also questioned by civil society organisations as it attempted to implement land expropriation without compensation [65] [66] The ANC maintains that expropriation without compensation is necessary, as does the EFF [67] The DA, the Freedom Front Plus, the ACDP and the IFP remain opposed to the ANC's renewed attempt at expropriation through the Expropriation Amendment Bill [68] [69]\n\n\nEnergy crisis\nRolling blackouts, or \"loadshedding\", caused by problems with the state utility Eskom have been occurring since 2007, however the prevalence of blackouts has increased substantially since 2020 [79] There is general dissatisfaction with the ANC's handling of the blackouts, with a 2023 survey finding that 24% of voters who had previously supported the ANC were planning to switch to other parties if the issue was not resolved [80]\n\n\nCrime\nAccording to the South African Police Service Crime Statistics for Quarter 2 of the 2023–24 financial year, reported contact crimes (defined by SAPS as \"crimes against the person\") has increased by 3 391 (2.1%) compared to the previous year [86] Recorded attempted murder illustrated the highest increase year-on-year, with 12.3% [86] Total contact crimes reported for the quarter are 165,909 The murder rate correlates to 77 people murdered per day, while 160 cases of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm are reported over the same period [87] Prior to the election, political violence was reportedly on the rise, especially in KwaZulu-Natal [88]\n\n\nHousing\nThe lack of adequate housing has been a major issue [90] According to a report from Parliament, dated May 2022, the human settlements sector had a total of 3.4 million housing units built since 1994 The respective provinces and municipalities delivered a separate 1.3 million \"serviced sites\" [91] A parliamentary question to the Minister of Human Settlements revealed there were 2,456,773 households registered on the National Housing Needs Register as of February 2023 [92] In the City of Cape Town, there were 375,150 on the municipalities' Housing Needs Register [93]\n\n\nCadre deployment\nThe ANC has practised a policy of employing people who are loyal to the ANC to positions within institutions of government The Zondo Commission has found that cadre deployment played a significant part in corruption and went as far as to say that it is \"illegal and unconstitutional\" [95]\n\n\nForeign policy\nCyril Ramaphosa said that South Africa v Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) may lead to foreign interference in the general election [99] [100]\n\n\nThe African Growth & Opportunity Act\nSouth Africa's links to Russia and China, through military co-operation [101] and potential co-operation with Iran [102] has placed the country in danger of losing its preferential access to the U.S market through the African Growth and Opportunity Act, with multiple members of the U.S Congress raising concern with South Africa's alleged threats to U.S interests [103] [102] In response, the Leader of the Opposition, John Steenhuisen led a delegation arguing that \"the ANC is not South Africa\" in an effort to lessen the risk of a possible removal from AGOA [103] Later, the Western Cape Premier, Alan Winde and a provincial delegation also made a trip to the United States to detail the possible impact that a loss would have on the agricultural industry in the province [104] The Leader of the Opposition in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament, Cameron Dugmore (ANC) accused the provincial government of wasting public funds, saying \"this trip was about the DA's desperation to secure support for the 2024 elections by creating a certain narrative about this matter\" [105]\n\n\nCape independence\nThe Freedom Front Plus and the Referendum Party contested the election with Cape independence as part of their platform The Referendum Party was formed in November 2023 as a single-issue political party aiming to pressure the Western Cape Democratic Alliance government into holding a referendum on Western Cape independence as part of any potential coalition agreement [106] The Cape Independence Party, which had contested in 2009 and 2019, did not make it on to the national ballot or the Western Cape provincial ballot, while the Referendum Party made it on to all three [107] [108] [109]\n\n\nHighly contested provinces\nGauteng is the most populated province and is the de facto economic hub of South Africa In 2019 the ANC had barely retained the province, getting 50.19% of the vote The DA hoped to win Gauteng with Solly Msimanga as their premier candidate [110] Funzi Ngobeni is ActionSA's premier candidate, [111] while the ANC's candidate is current premier, Panyaza Lesufi.\n\n\nGauteng\nResults for the National Council of Provinces will be available once they are elected at the first sitting of each provincial legislature [37]\n\n\nKwaZulu-Natal\nKwaZulu-Natal is the second most populated province and is home to the busiest port in southern Africa Recent polling has the new MK Party leading in the province, having grown substantially at the expense of ANC support Christopher Pappas is the premier candidate for the DA, while Thami Ntuli was the IFP's candidate [112] [113] The ANC's premier candidate is Sbongiseni Duma MK took 45.9% of the vote, leaving the ANC with only 17.6%, the DA not far behind.\n\n\nWestern Cape\nResults for the National Council of Provinces will be available once they are elected at the first sitting of each provincial legislature [37]\n\n\nIncidents\nIn May 2024, the DA released a campaign video attacking the ANC and showing a South African flag on fire, saying that the same fate would befall the country should the ANC remain in power The flag appears restored in the final seven seconds of the advert

government composed of the ANC, the MK, and the EFF would be a \"doomsday coalition\" pursuing previous policy failures in the country The EFF's Julius Malema said that the election results marked the end of the ANC's \"entitlement of being the sole dominant party\", adding that he was open to talks with the ANC on forming a coalition government The Patriotic Alliance's Gayton McKenzie compared

cabinet on 18 June, [192] making him the first IFP member to serve as Premier of KwaZulu-Natal since 2004 [193]\n\n\nAllegations of misconduct\nOn 1 June, Jacob Zuma said that the MK was seeking to have the announcement of official results legally halted pending investigations over allegations of vote-rigging raised by the party, with MK officials citing possible tampering of the Independent Electoral Commission's computer system following glitches earlier that day The IEC said it had received 579 objections from both voters and political parties regarding the election results, [194] and

members of the National Assembly and provincial legislatures. The election was the sixth since the end of apartheid and saw the African National Congress (ANC) lose its parliamentary majority for the first time since 1994.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe election date of 29 May 2024 was declared by the incumbent president Cyril Ramaphosa on 20 February 2024. The election was seen as a critical test for the ANC, which had been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994.\n\n**uMkhonto we Sizwe**\n\nOn 16 December 2023, former president Jacob Zuma announced his departure from the ANC, accusing the party and incumbent president Cyril Ramaphosa of serving as a \"proxy for white monopoly capital.\" He was also noted as calling the ANC \"sellouts\" and \"apartheid collaborators\" He also announced establishment of his own political party, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), named after the apartheid-era military wing of the ANC The latter filed a lawsuit against the MK's registration in the Electoral Commission of South Africa, which was dismissed by the Electoral Court of South Africa on 26 March 2024 due to lack of merit The ANC also plans to file a lawsuit against the party's naming after the historic MK According to opinion polling, it was suggested that MK could become the kingmakers after the elections.\n\n**Multi-Party Charter**\n\nA pre-election agreement called the Multi-Party Charter was signed between the Democratic Alliance (DA), Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus), ActionSA and three other parties with the aim of presenting a united front against the three-decade rule of the African National Congress (ANC) party and the rise of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK Party) and the Patriotic Alliance (PA) The Spectrum National Party, Ekhethu People's Party and Unemployed National Party joined the MPC but failed to meet the Independent Electoral Commission's minimum number of signatures required to contest seats in the National Assembly On 7 October 2023, the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) joined the charter Going into the election, the MPC members represented 112 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly During the 2024 election, the parties in the charter collectively won 119 of the 400 seats in the National Assembly, increasing the number of seats by seven On 6 June 2024, ActionSA announced that they would leave the Multi-Party Charter This decision reduced the charter's seat count from 119 to 113 in the 400-seat National Assembly.\n\n**Voter

alongside the national ballot Voters were also presented with a third ballot, a single ballot used for the election of members of the nine provincial legislatures, held on the same day The regional ballot is used to elect representatives to the National Assembly from each of the country's nine provinces The regional ballot is proportional, meaning that seats are allocated to parties and independent candidates based on the number of votes received.\n\n**Election of the National Assembly and provincial legislatures**\n\nOn 17 April 2023, president Cyril Ramaphosa signed the South African Electoral Amendment Bill into law allowing independent candidates to stand for election to the National Assembly and provincial legislatures while keeping proportional representation with closed lists Two hundred members will be elected from national party lists, while the remaining 200 seats will be contested by political parties and independent candidates in each of the nine provinces In provincial legislatures, the single-tier multimember proportional system will continue to apply, with political parties and independent candidates contesting for seats Voters will receive three ballot papers as opposed to two in previous elections; the first ballot will be to elect the 200 members of the National Assembly only contested by political parties; the second ballot will be to elect the remaining 200 members of the National Assembly, which will be contested by political parties and independent candidates in each of the nine provinces; and the third ballot will be to elect members of the provincial legislatures with political parties and independent candidates as well.\n\n**Election of the president and premiers**\n\nFollowing the election, the president of South Africa was elected by the National Assembly Although the president is required to be a member of the National Assembly at the time of election, a person who is elected as president must resign their

Insurance state fund to provide more South Africans access to private healthcare The DA is staunchly opposed to the bill on the premise that it could lead to large tax increases and corruption by ANC \"cadre deployment,\" and have promised to challenge it in court The South African public has blamed many socioeconomic problems on illegal immigration Several parties such as ActionSA, IFP, ATM and PA, call for tighter border controls in response to the perceived strain caused by undocumented migrants on public services and resources The Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, known colloquially as the Zondo Commission, completed its work and submitted its final report to the president in June 2022 The Commission cost the South African taxpayer \"almost R1 billion\" Investigator Paul Holden of Shadow World Investigations read into evidence that state capture cost the South African economy at least R49 billion The ANC's proposed amendment of section 25 of the constitution of South Africa which failed in the Parliament of South Africa, by a vote of 204 MPs in favour, 145 MPs against and 0 abstentions The ANC maintains that expropriation without

in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\n**Housing**\n\nThe lack of adequate housing has been a major issue A parliamentary question to the Minister of Human Settlements revealed there were 2,456,773 households registered on the National Housing Needs Register as of February 2023 In the City of Cape Town, there were 375,150 on the municipalities' Housing Needs Register.\n\n**Cadre deployment**\n\nThe ANC has practised a policy of employing people who are loyal to the ANC to positions within institutions of government The Zondo Commission has found that cadre deployment played a significant part in corruption and went as far as to say that it is \"illegal and unconstitutional\".\n\n**Foreign policy**\n\nCyril Ramaphosa said that South Africa v Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) may lead to foreign interference in the general election The African Growth & Opportunity Act South Africa's links to Russia and China, through military co-operation and potential co-operation with Iran have placed the country in danger of losing its preferential access to the U.S market through the African Growth and Opportunity Act, with multiple members of the U.S Congress raising concern with South Africa's alleged threats to U.S interests.\n\n**Cape independence**\n\nThe Freedom Front Plus and the Referendum Party contested the election with Cape independence as part of their platform The Cape Independence Party, which had contested in 2009 and 2019, did not make it on to the national ballot or the Western Cape provincial ballot, while the Referendum Party made it on to all three.\n\n**Highly contested provinces**\n\nGauteng is the most populated province and is the de facto economic hub of South Africa In 2019 the ANC had barely retained the province, getting 50.19% of the vote The DA hoped to win Gauteng with Solly Msimanga as their premier candidate Funzi Ngobeni is ActionSA's premier candidate, while the ANC's candidate is current premier, Panyaza Lesufi KwaZulu-Natal is the second most populated province and is home to the busiest port in southern Africa Recent polling has the new MK Party leading in the province, having grown substantially at the expense of ANC support Christopher Pappas is the premier candidate for the DA, while Thami Ntuli was the IFP's candidate The ANC's premier candidate is Sbongiseni Duma MK took 45.9% of the vote, leaving the ANC with only 17.6%, the DA not far behind.\n\n**Incidents**\n\nOn 1 June, Jacob Zuma said that the MK was seeking to have the announcement of official results legally halted pending investigations over allegations of vote-rigging raised by the party, with MK officials citing possible tampering of the Independent Electoral Commission's computer system following glitches earlier that day The IEC said it had received 579 objections from both voters and political parties regarding the election results, and ordered recounts in 24 cases.\n\n**See also**\n\nThe election was

taxpayer \"almost R1 billion\" [58] Investigator Paul Holden of Shadow World Investigations read into evidence that state capture cost the South African economy at least R49 billion [59]\n\n\nLand reform\nThe ANC's proposed amendment of section 25 of the constitution of South Africa which failed in the Parliament of South Africa, by a vote of 204 MPs in favour, 145 MPs against and 0 abstentions [64] The bill required a two-thirds majority The constitutionality of the amendment was also questioned by civil society organisations as it attempted to implement land expropriation without compensation [65] [66] The ANC maintains that expropriation without compensation is necessary, as does the EFF [67] The DA, the Freedom Front Plus, the ACDP and the IFP remain opposed to the ANC's renewed attempt at expropriation through the Expropriation Amendment Bill [68] [69]\n\n\nEnergy crisis\nRolling blackouts, or \"loadshedding\", caused by problems with the state utility Eskom have been occurring since 2007, however the prevalence of blackouts has increased substantially since 2020 [79] There is general dissatisfaction with the ANC's handling of the blackouts, with a 2023 survey finding that 24% of voters who had previously supported the ANC were planning to switch to other parties if the issue was not resolved [80]\n\n\nCrime\nAccording to the South African Police Service Crime Statistics for Quarter 2 of the 2023–24 financial year, reported contact crimes (defined by SAPS as \"crimes against the person\") has increased by 3 391 (2.1%) compared to the previous year [86] Recorded attempted murder illustrated the highest increase year-on-year, with 12.3% [86] Total contact crimes reported for the quarter are 165,909 The murder rate correlates to 77 people murdered per day, while 160 cases of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm are reported over the same period [87] Prior to the election, political violence was reportedly on the rise, especially in KwaZulu-Natal [88]\n\n\nHousing\nThe lack of adequate housing has been a major issue [90] According to a report from Parliament, dated May 2022, the human settlements sector had a total of 3.4 million housing units built since 1994 The respective provinces and municipalities delivered a separate 1.3 million \"serviced sites\" [91] A parliamentary question to the Minister of Human Settlements revealed there were 2,456,773 households registered on the National Housing Needs Register as of February 2023 [92] In the City of Cape Town, there were 375,150 on the municipalities' Housing Needs Register [93]\n\n\nCadre deployment\nThe ANC has practised a policy of employing people who are loyal to the ANC to positions within institutions of government The Zondo Commission has found that cadre deployment played a significant part in corruption and went as far as to say that it is \"illegal and unconstitutional\" [95]\n\n\nForeign policy\nCyril Ramaphosa said that South Africa v Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) may lead to foreign interference in the general election [99] [100]\n\n\nThe African Growth & Opportunity Act\nSouth Africa's links to Russia and China, through military co-operation [101] and potential co-operation with Iran [102] has placed the country in danger of losing its preferential access to the U.S market through the African Growth and Opportunity Act, with multiple members of the U.S Congress raising concern with South Africa's alleged threats to U.S interests [103] [102] In response, the Leader of the Opposition, John Steenhuisen led a delegation arguing that \"the ANC is not South Africa\" in an effort to lessen the risk of a possible removal from AGOA [103] Later, the Western Cape Premier, Alan Winde and a provincial delegation also made a trip to the United States to detail the possible impact that a loss would have on the agricultural industry in the province [104] The Leader of the Opposition in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament, Cameron Dugmore (ANC) accused the provincial government of wasting public funds, saying \"this trip was about the DA's desperation to secure support for the 2024 elections by creating a certain narrative about this matter\" [105]\n\n\nCape independence\nThe Freedom Front Plus and the Referendum Party contested the election with Cape independence as part of their platform The Referendum Party was formed in November 2023 as a single-issue political party aiming to pressure the Western Cape Democratic Alliance government into holding a referendum on Western Cape independence as part of any potential coalition agreement [106] The Cape Independence Party, which had contested in 2009 and 2019, did not make it on to the national ballot or the Western Cape provincial ballot, while the Referendum Party made it on to all three [107] [108] [109]\n\n\nHighly contested provinces\nGauteng is the most populated province and is the de facto economic hub of South Africa In 2019 the ANC had barely retained the province, getting 50.19% of the vote The DA hoped to win Gauteng with Solly Msimanga as their premier candidate [110] Funzi Ngobeni is ActionSA's premier candidate, [111] while the ANC's candidate is current premier, Panyaza Lesufi.\n\n\nGauteng\nResults for the National Council of Provinces will be available once they are elected at the first sitting of each provincial legislature [37]\n\n\nKwaZulu-Natal\nKwaZulu-Natal is the second most populated province and is home to the busiest port in southern Africa Recent polling has the new MK Party leading in the province, having grown substantially at the expense of ANC support Christopher Pappas is the premier candidate for the DA, while Thami Ntuli was the IFP's candidate [112] [113] The ANC's premier candidate is Sbongiseni Duma MK took 45.9% of the vote, leaving the ANC with only 17.6%, the DA not far behind.\n\n\nWestern Cape\nResults for the National Council of Provinces will be available once they are elected at the first sitting of each provincial legislature [37]\n\n\nIncidents\nIn May 2024, the DA released a campaign video attacking the ANC and showing a South African flag on fire, saying that the same fate would befall the country should the ANC remain in power The flag appears restored in the final seven seconds of the advert DA leader John Steenhuisen described the video as \"the most successful political advertisement in our democratic history,\" saying that it was seen by at least four million people online and heard by \"millions more\" in other media President and ANC leader Cyril Ramaphosa called the ad \"despicable\" and \"treasonous\", while the public broadcaster SABC announced that it would not air the video, saying that it would only fuel \"outrage\", and called on the DA to amend the advert [115] [116] Several analysts and organisations have noted that, although in \"poor taste\", the burning of the flag is protected under Section 16 of the Constitution as a freedom of expression [117]\n\n\nDA campaign video\nIn May 2024, the DA released a campaign video attacking the ANC and showing a South African flag on fire, saying that the

the DA to amend the advert [115] [116] Several analysts and organisations have noted that, although in \"poor taste\", the burning of the flag is protected under Section 16 of the Constitution as a freedom of expression [117]\n\n\nNational Health Insurance\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa announced on 13 May that he would sign the controversial National Health Insurance Bill into law on 15 May [119] Civil society organisations, including the South African Medical Association, Business Unity South Africa, Business Leadership South Africa, Solidariteit, the SA Institute of Race Relations and the South African Health Professionals Collaboration have expressed dissatisfaction at this announcement, some hinting at possible legal challenges to the legislation following the president's assent [120] [121] [122] [123] The DA announced that it had briefed its legal team to file court papers at the Constitutional Court on the matter [124] ActionSA expressed its disappointment on the president's announcement, having previously urged the President not to sign the Bill [125]\n\n\nJacob Zuma\nFormer President Jacob Zuma founded the uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK Party) in December 2023, intending to contest the election [126] On 20 May 2024, the Constitutional Court of South Africa ruled that Zuma is ineligible to run in the parliamentary election due to his 2021 jail sentence [127]\n\n\nPresidential Address to the Nation\nOn 26 May, the Presidency announced that Cyril Ramaphosa would address the nation at 6pm [128] In his address, broadcast by the SABC, he listed the achievements of his government The address was criticised by opposition parties as an abuse of government resources for electioneering in favour of the ruling party [129]\n\n\nOpinion polls\nEarly voting for overseas citizens was held in South African diplomatic missions on 17 and 18 May [34] [132] Early voting for domestic voters was held on 27 May, covering 1.6 million people including essential workers and about 624,000 people unable to leave their homes [133] On election day, polling in more than 23,000 precincts [134] opened at 07:00 and closed at 21:00 [135] Three thousand SANDF soldiers were deployed to ensure security during the election, while the Independent Electoral Commission said two people were arrested for interfering with voting operations [136] Julius Malema voted in Limpopo after queuing for three hours [137] Counting was delayed in several precincts due to last-minute queues of voters, [138] with the last ballots being cast at around 03:00 on 30 May as electoral law allows those still lining up to vote at regular closing time to participate [139]\n\n\nConduct\nEarly voting for overseas citizens was held in South African diplomatic missions on 17 and

It also failed to secure a majority in Northern Cape and Gauteng, and was outpolled in KwaZulu-Natal by the MK In overseas voting, the DA won 75.23% of the 39,084 votes cast and retained its majority in the Western Cape [144] The ANC retained reduced majorities in Eastern Cape, Free State, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West and retained largest opposition status in Western Cape, while the DA retained its largest opposition status in the National Assembly No overall majority was achieved in the National Assembly, nor in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng or Northern Cape, with the MK achieving a plurality in KwaZulu-Natal and the ANC being forced into second-largest party status in KwaZulu-Natal for the first time since it first won the province in 2004 [145] Most of the ANC's

the ANC said that its leadership would meet on 31 May to \"reflect on what is good for the country.\" The DA's John Steenhuisen said that the results showed that South Africa was \"heading into coalition country\" and expressed a willingness to work alongside the ANC, adding that he would have to first consult with other signatories of the Multi-Party Charter [152] The DA also said that a government composed of the ANC, the MK, and the EFF would be a \"doomsday coalition\" pursuing previous policy failures in the country The EFF's Julius Malema said that the election results marked the end of the ANC's \"entitlement of being the sole dominant party\", adding that he was open to talks with the ANC on forming a coalition government The Patriotic Alliance's Gayton McKenzie compared prospects of an ANC-DA coalition to \"a marriage of two drunk people in Las Vegas\" that would prove \"unworkable\" [153]\n\n\nFirst sitting of parliament\nOn 10 June, Chief Justice Raymond Zondo declared that the first sitting of the new National Assembly would occur on 14 June, during which elections for parliamentary speaker and president would be held [170] The session proceeded as

Jacob Zuma's MK party suffered a major setback in its heartland province on 14 June after the KwaZulu-Natal provincial legislative opted to elect IFP member Thami Ntuli over an MK candidate as Premier of KwaZulu-Natal [189] [190] Ntuli defeated the MK Party's premier candidate, Zulu Nation's deputy prime minister Phathisizwe Chiliza, with 41 votes to 39 [191] Ntuli took office and appointed his cabinet on 18 June, [192] making him the first IFP member to serve as Premier of KwaZulu-Natal since 2004 [193]\n\n\nAllegations of misconduct\nOn 1 June, Jacob Zuma said that the MK was seeking to have the announcement of official results legally halted pending investigations over allegations of vote-rigging raised by the party, with MK officials citing possible tampering of the Independent Electoral Commission's computer system following glitches earlier that day The IEC said it had received 579 objections from both voters and political parties regarding the election results, [194] and ordered recounts in 24 cases [155] Police Minister Bheki Cele warned that authorities would not tolerate \"threats of instability in order to register objections or concerns about the electoral

{"title": "Diwali", "content": "\nEtymology\nDiwali (English:  /dɪˈwɑːliː/) [9]—also known as Dewali, Divali, [4] [41] or Deepavali (IAST: dīpāvalī)—comes from the Sanskrit dīpāvali meaning 'row or series of lights' [24] [42] The term is derived from the Sanskrit words dīpa, 'lamp, light, lantern, candle, that which glows, shines, illuminates or knowledge' [43] and āvali, 'a row, range, continuous line, series' [44] [c]\n\n\nDates\nThe five-day celebration is observed every year sometime from the second half of October to the first half of November [45] coinciding with a new moon (amāvasyā) as per the Hindu lunisolar calendar [46]\n\n\nHistory\nThe five-day long festival originated in the Indian subcontinent and is likely a fusion of harvest festivals in ancient India [45] It is mentioned in early Sanskrit texts, such as the Padma Purana and the Skanda Purana, both of which were composed between the 7th and 10th centuries [52] [53] The diyas (lamps) are mentioned in Skanda Kishore Purana as symbolising parts of the sun, describing it as the cosmic giver of light and energy to all life and which seasonally transitions in the Hindu calendar month of Kartik [54] [55]\n\n\nEpigraphy\n\nSanskrit inscriptions in stone and copper mentioning Diwali, occasionally alongside terms such as Dipotsava, Dipavali, Divali and Divalige, have been discovered at numerous sites across India [70] [71] [h] Examples include a 10th-century Rashtrakuta empire copper plate inscription of Krishna III (939–967 CE) that mentions Dipotsava, [72] and a 12th-century mixed Sanskrit-Kannada Sinda inscription discovered in the Isvara temple of Dharwad in Karnataka where the inscription refers to the festival as a \"sacred occasion\" [73] According to Lorenz Franz Kielhorn, a German Indologist known for translating many Indic inscriptions, this festival is mentioned as Dipotsavam in verses 6 and 7 of the Ranganatha temple Sanskrit inscription of the 13th-century Venad Hindu king Ravivarman Samgramadhira Part of the inscription, as translated by Kielhorn, reads: \n\nReligious significance\nThe religious significance of Diwali varies regionally within India \nOne tradition links the festival to legends in the Hindu epic Ramayana, where Diwali is the day Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman reached Ayodhya after a period of 14 years in exile after Rama's army of good defeated demon king Ravana's army of evil [79] Throughout the epic, Rama's decisions were always in line with dharma (duty) and the Diwali festival serves as a reminder for followers of Hinduism to maintain their dharma in day to day life [80]\n\n\nOther religions\nOriginally a Hindu festival, Diwali has transcended religious lines [93] Diwali is celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Newar Buddhists, [2] although for each faith it marks different historical events and stories, but nonetheless the festival represents the same symbolic victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil [5] [6] [94] [95]\n\n\nJainism\nIn Jain religion, Diwali is celebrated in observance of \"Mahavira Nirvana Divas\", the physical death and final nirvana of Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankar of current time cycle Nirvana is considered to be the state of a soul when it escapes from the cycle of birth and death, while experiencing its true nature of boundless bliss and infinite knowledge [96] The Jain Diwali celebrated in many parts of India has similar practices to the Hindu Diwali, such as the lighting of lamps However, the focus of the Jain Diwali remains the dedication to Mahavira [97] According to the Jain tradition, this practice of lighting lamps first began on the day of Mahavira's nirvana in 527 BCE, [k] when 18 kings who had gathered for Mahavira's final teachings issued a proclamation that lamps be lit in remembrance of the \"great light, Mahavira\" [100] [101] This traditional belief of the origin of Diwali, and its significance to Jains, is reflected in their historic artworks such as paintings [102]\n\n\nSikhism\nSikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas in remembrance of the release of Guru Hargobind from the Gwalior Fort prison by the Mughal emperor Jahangir and the day he arrived at the Golden Temple in Amritsar [103] According to J.S Grewal, a scholar of Sikhism and Sikh history, Diwali in the Sikh tradition is older than the sixth Guru Hargobind legend Guru Amar Das, the third Guru of the Sikhs, built a well in Goindwal with eighty-four steps and invited Sikhs to bathe in its sacred waters on Baisakhi and Diwali as a form of community bonding Over time, these spring and autumn festivals became the most important of Sikh festivals and holy sites such as Amritsar became focal points for annual pilgrimages [104] The festival of Diwali, according to Ray Colledge, highlights three events in Sikh history: the founding of the city of Amritsar in 1577, the release of Guru Hargobind from the Mughal prison, and the day of Bhai Mani Singh's martyrdom in 1738 as a result of his failure to pay a fine for trying to celebrate Diwali and thereafter refusing to convert to Islam [105] [106] [l]\n\n\nBuddhism\nDiwali is not a festival for most Buddhists, with the exception of the Newar people of Nepal who revere various deities in Vajrayana Buddhism and celebrate Diwali by offering prayers to Lakshmi [2] [22] Newar Buddhists in Nepalese valleys also celebrate the Diwali festival over five days, in much the same way, and on the same days, as the Nepalese Hindu Diwali-Tihar festival [109] According to some observers, this traditional celebration by Newar Buddhists in Nepal, through the worship of Lakshmi and Vishnu during Diwali, is not syncretism but rather a reflection of the freedom within Mahayana Buddhist tradition to worship any deity for their worldly betterment [2]\n\n\nCelebrations\nIn the lead-up to Diwali, celebrants prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and workplaces with diyas (oil lamps) and rangolis (colourful art circle patterns) [111] During Diwali, people wear their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes with saaki (earthen lamp), diyas and rangoli, perform worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth, [m] light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where mithai (sweets) and gifts are shared.\n\n\nDhanteras and Yama Deepam (Day 1)\nDhanteras, also known as Dhanatrayodashi, is derived from Dhan meaning wealth and teras meaning thirteenth, marks the thirteenth day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik and the beginning of Diwali in most parts of India [120] On this day, many Hindus clean their homes and business premises They install diyas, small earthen oil-filled lamps that they light up for the next five days, near Lakshmi and Ganesha iconography [120] [117] Women and children decorate doorways within homes and offices with rangolis, colourful designs made from rice flour, flower petals, coloured rice or coloured sand, [27] while the boys and men decorate the roofs and walls of family homes, markets, and temples and string up lights and lanterns The day also marks a major shopping day for buying new utensils, home equipment, gold jewellery, firecrackers, and other items [117] [54] [82] [121] On the evening of Dhanteras, families offer prayers (puja) to Lakshmi and Ganesha, and lay offerings of puffed rice, candy toys, rice cakes and batashas (hollow sugar cakes) [117]\n\n\nNaraka Chaturdashi, Kali Chaudas, Chhoti Diwali, Hanuman Puja, Roop Chaudas, Yama Deepam (Day 2)\nNaraka Chaturdashi, also known as Chhoti Diwali, is the second day of festivities coinciding with the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik [125] The term \"chhoti\" means little, while \"Naraka\" means hell and \"Chaturdashi\" means \"fourteenth\" [126] The day and its rituals are interpreted as ways to liberate any soul from suffering in \"Naraka\", or hell, as well as a reminder of spiritual auspiciousness For some Hindus, it is a day to pray for the peace to the manes, or defiled souls of one's ancestors and light their way for their journeys in the cyclic afterlife [127] A mythological interpretation of this festive day is the destruction of the asura (demon) Narakasura by Krishna, a victory that frees 16,000 imprisoned princesses kidnapped by Narakasura [126] It is also celebrated as Roop Chaudas in some North Indian households, where women bathe before sunrise, while lighting a diya (lamp) in the bath area, they believe it helps enhance their beauty – it is a fun ritual that young girls enjoy as part of festivities Ubtan is applied by the women which is made up of special gram flour mixed with herbs for cleansing and beautifying themselves.\n\n\nLakshmi Pujan, Kali Puja (Day 3)\nThe third day is the height of the festival, [132] and coincides with the last day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik This is the day when Hindu, Jain and Sikh temples and homes are aglow with lights, thereby making it the \"festival of lights\" The word Deepawali comes from the Sanskrit word deep, which means an Indian lantern/lamp [46] [133]\n\n\nAnnakut, Balipratipada (Padwa), New Year's Day, Govardhan Puja (Day 4)\nThe day after Diwali is the first day of the bright fortnight of Kartik [146] It is regionally called Annakut (heap of grain), Padwa, Goverdhan puja, Bali Pratipada, Bali Padyami, Kartik Shukla Pratipada and other names [27] [146] According to one tradition, the day is associated with the story of Bali's defeat at the hands of Vishnu [147] [148] In another interpretation, it is thought to reference the legend of Parvati and her husband Shiva playing a game of dyuta (dice) on a board of twelve squares and thirty pieces, Parvati wins Shiva surrenders his shirt and adornments to her, rendering him naked [146] According to Handelman and Shulman, as quoted by Pintchman, this legend is a Hindu metaphor for the cosmic process for creation and dissolution of the world through the masculine destructive power, as represented by Shiva, and the feminine procreative power, represented by Parvati, where twelve reflects the number of months in the cyclic year, while thirty are the number of days in its lunisolar month [146]\n\n\nBhai Duj, Bhau-Beej, Vishwakarma Puja (Day 5)\nThe last day of the festival, the second day of the bright fortnight of Kartik, is called Bhai Duj (literally \"brother's day\" [152]), Bhau Beej, Bhai Tilak or Bhai Phonta It celebrates the sister-brother bond, similar in spirit to Raksha Bandhan but it is the brother that travels to meet the sister and her family This festive day is interpreted by some to symbolise Yama's sister Yamuna welcoming Yama with a tilaka, while others interpret it as the arrival of Krishna at his sister Subhadra's place after defeating Narakasura Subhadra welcomes him with a tilaka on his forehead [149] [153]\n\n\nOther traditions and significance\nDuring the season of Diwali, numerous rural townships and villages host melas, [158] or fairs, where local producers and artisans trade produce and goods A variety of entertainments are usually available for inhabitants of the local community to enjoy The women, in particular, adorn themselves in colourful attire and decorate their hands with henna Such events are also mentioned in Sikh historical records [159] [q] In the modern day, Diwali mela are held at college, or university, campuses or as community events by members of the Indian diaspora At such events a variety of music, dance and arts performances, food, crafts, and cultural celebrations are featured [160] [161] [91]\n\n\nEconomics\nDiwali marks a major shopping period in India, [29] and is comparable to the Christmas period in terms of consumer purchases and economic activity [162] It is traditionally a time when households purchase new clothing, home refurbishments, gifts, gold, jewelry, [163] [164] and other large purchases particularly as the festival is dedicated to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and such purchases are considered auspicious [165] [166] According to Rao, Diwali is one of the major festivals where rural Indians spend a significant portion of their annual income, and is a means for them to renew their relationships and social networks [167]\n\n\nPolitics\nDiwali has increasingly attracted cultural exchanges, becoming occasions for politicians and religious leaders worldwide to meet Hindu or Indian origin citizens, diplomatic staff or neighbours Many participate in other socio-political events as a symbol of support for diversity and inclusiveness The Catholic dicastery Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, founded as Secretariat for non-Christians by Pope Paul VI, began sending official greetings and the Pope's message to the Hindus on Diwali in the mid-1990s [175] [s]\n\n\nHazards\nThe use of firecrackers on Diwali increases the concentration of dust and pollutants in the air After firing, the fine dust particles get settled on the surrounding surfaces which

"article": "Diwali, also known as Dewali, Divali, or Deepavali, is a significant festival in Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism, celebrated over five days in autumn. It is often referred to as the \"festival of lights\" due to the widespread use of diyas (oil lamps), candles, and fireworks.\n\nEtymology\n----------------\n\nDiwali comes from the Sanskrit dīpāvali meaning 'row or series of lights'. The term is derived from the Sanskrit words dīpa, 'lamp, light, lantern, candle, that which glows, shines, illuminates, or knowledge', and āvali, 'a row, range, continuous line, series'.\n\nDates\n------\n\nThe five-day celebration is observed every year sometime from the second half of October to the first half of November, coinciding with a new moon (amāvasyā) as per the Hindu lunisolar calendar.\n\nHistory\n--------\n\nThe five-day long festival originated in the Indian subcontinent and is likely a fusion of harvest festivals in ancient India. It is mentioned in early Sanskrit texts, such as the Padma Purana and the Skanda Purana, both of which were composed between the 7th and 10th centuries. The diyas (lamps) are mentioned in Skanda Kishore Purana as symbolizing parts of the sun, describing it as the cosmic giver of light and energy to all life and which seasonally transitions in the Hindu calendar month of Kartik.\n\nEpigraphy\n----------\n\nSanskrit inscriptions in stone and copper mentioning Diwali, occasionally alongside terms such as Dipotsava, Dipavali, Divali, and Divalige, have been discovered at numerous sites across India. Examples include a 10th-century Rashtrakuta empire copper plate inscription of Krishna III (939-967 CE) that mentions Dipotsava, and a 12th-century mixed Sanskrit-Kannada Sinda inscription discovered in the Isvara temple of Dharwad in Karnataka where the inscription refers to the festival as a \"sacred occasion\".\n\nReligious Significance\n----------------------\n\nThe religious significance of Diwali varies regionally within India. One tradition links the festival to legends in the Hindu epic Ramayana, where Diwali is the day Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman reached Ayodhya after a period of 14 years in exile after Rama's army of good defeated demon king Ravana's army of evil. Throughout the epic, Rama's decisions were always in line with dharma (duty) and the Diwali festival serves as a reminder for followers of Hinduism to maintain their dharma in day-to-day life.\n\nOther Religions\n----------------\n\nOriginally a Hindu festival, Diwali has transcended religious lines. Diwali is celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Newar Buddhists, although for each faith it marks different historical events and stories, but nonetheless the festival represents the same symbolic victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil.\n\nJainism\n--------\n\nIn Jain religion, Diwali is celebrated in observance of \"Mahavira Nirvana Divas\", the physical death and final nirvana of Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankar of current time cycle. Nirvana is considered to be the state of a soul when it escapes from the cycle of birth and death, while experiencing its true nature of boundless bliss and infinite knowledge. The Jain Diwali celebrated in many parts of India has similar practices to the Hindu Diwali, such as the lighting of lamps. However, the focus of the Jain Diwali remains the dedication to Mahavira.\n\nSikhism\n---------\n\nSikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas in remembrance of the release of Guru Hargobind from the Gwalior Fort prison by the Mughal emperor Jahangir and the day he arrived at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. According to J.S Grewal, a scholar of Sikhism and Sikh history, Diwali in the Sikh tradition is older than the sixth Guru Hargobind legend.\n\nBuddhism\n---------\n\nDiwali is not a festival for most Buddhists, with the exception of the Newar people of Nepal who revere various deities in Vajrayana Buddhism and celebrate Diwali by offering prayers to Lakshmi.\n\nCelebrations\n-------------\n\nIn the lead-up to Diwali, celebrants prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and workplaces with diyas (oil lamps) and rangolis (colourful art circle patterns). During Diwali, people wear their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes with saaki (earthen lamp), diyas, and rangoli, perform worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth, light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where mithai (sweets) and gifts are shared.\n\nDhanteras and Yama Deepam (Day 1)\n---------------------------------\n\nDhanteras, also known as Dhanatrayodashi, is derived from Dhan meaning wealth and teras meaning thirteenth, marks the thirteenth day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik and the beginning of Diwali in most parts of India. On this day, many Hindus clean their homes and business premises and install diyas, small earthen oil-filled lamps that they light up for the next five days, near Lakshmi and Ganesha iconography.\n\nNaraka Chaturdashi, Kali Chaudas, Chhoti Diwali, Hanuman Puja, Roop Chaudas, Yama Deepam (Day 2)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNaraka Chaturdashi, also known as Chhoti Diwali, is the second day of festivities coinciding with the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik. The term \"chhoti\" means little, while \"Naraka\" means hell and \"Chaturdashi\" means \"fourteenth\". The day and its rituals are interpreted as ways to liberate any soul from suffering in \"Naraka\", or hell, as well as a reminder of spiritual auspiciousness.\n\nLakshmi Pujan, Kali Puja (Day 3)\n-------------------------------\n\nThe third day is the height of the festival, and coincides with the last day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik. This is the day when Hindu, Jain, and Sikh temples and homes are aglow with lights, thereby making it the \"festival of lights\".\n\nAnnakut, Balipratipada (Padwa), New Year's Day, Govardhan Puja (Day 4)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe day after Diwali is the first day of the bright fortnight of Kartik. It is regionally called Annakut (heap of grain), Padwa, Goverdhan puja, Bali Pratipada, Bali Padyami, Kartik Shukla Pratipada, and other names. According to one tradition, the day is associated with the story of Bali's defeat at the hands of Vishnu.\n\nBhai Duj, Bhau-Beej, Vishwakarma Puja (Day 5)\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe last day of the festival, the second day of the bright fortnight of Kartik, is called Bhai Duj (literally \"brother's day\"). It celebrates the sister-brother bond, similar in spirit to Raksha Bandhan but it is the brother that travels to meet the sister and her family.\n\nOther Traditions and Significance\n-----------------------------------\n\nDuring the season of Diwali, numerous rural townships and villages host melas, or fairs, where local producers and artisans trade produce and goods. A variety of entertainments are usually available for inhabitants of the local community to enjoy.\n\nEconomics\n----------\n\nDiwali marks a major shopping period in India, and is comparable to the Christmas period in terms of consumer purchases and economic activity. It is traditionally a time when households purchase new clothing, home refurbishments, gifts, gold, jewelry, and other large purchases particularly as the festival is dedicated to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and such purchases are considered auspicious.\n\nPolitics\n----------\n\nDiwali has increasingly attracted cultural exchanges, becoming occasions for politicians and religious leaders worldwide to meet Hindu or Indian origin citizens, diplomatic staff or neighbours. Many participate in other socio-political events as a symbol of support for diversity and inclusiveness.\n\nHazards\n--------\n\nThe use of firecrackers on Diwali increases the concentration of dust and pollutants in the air. After firing, the fine dust particles get settled on the surrounding surfaces which are packed with chemicals like copper, zinc, sodium, lead, magnesium, cadmium, and pollutants like oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. These invisible yet harmful particles affect the environment and in turn, put people's health at stake.\n\nGuinness World Record\n---------------------\n\nIn 2023, a Diwali celebration in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India, broke the Guinness World Record for the largest display of oil lamps with 2,223,676 displayed on the eve of Diwali.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\nOther notable Hindu festivals include:\n\n* Holi\n* Navratri\n* Ganesh Chaturthi\n* Krishna Janmashtami\n* Ram Navami\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* Rao, M.

[9]—also known as Dewali, Divali, [4] [41] or Deepavali (IAST: dīpāvalī)—comes from the Sanskrit dīpāvali meaning 'row or series of lights' [24] [42] The term is derived from the Sanskrit words dīpa, 'lamp, light, lantern, candle, that which glows, shines, illuminates or knowledge' [43] and āvali, 'a row, range, continuous line, series' [44] [c]\n\n\nDates\nThe five-day celebration is observed

copper plate inscription of Krishna III (939–967 CE) that mentions Dipotsava, [72] and a 12th-century mixed Sanskrit-Kannada Sinda inscription discovered in the Isvara temple of Dharwad in Karnataka where the inscription refers to the festival as a \"sacred occasion\" [73] According to Lorenz Franz Kielhorn, a German Indologist known for translating many Indic inscriptions, this festival is mentioned as Dipotsavam in verses 6 and 7 of the Ranganatha temple Sanskrit inscription of the 13th-century Venad Hindu king Ravivarman Samgramadhira Part of the inscription, as translated by Kielhorn, reads: \n\nReligious significance\nThe religious significance of Diwali varies regionally within India \nOne tradition links the festival to legends in the Hindu epic Ramayana, where Diwali is the day Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman reached Ayodhya after a period of 14 years in exile after Rama's army of good defeated demon king Ravana's army of evil [79] Throughout the epic, Rama's

historical events and stories, but nonetheless the festival represents the same symbolic victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil [5] [6] [94] [95]\n\n\nJainism\nIn Jain religion, Diwali is celebrated in observance of \"Mahavira Nirvana Divas\", the physical death and final nirvana of Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankar of current time cycle Nirvana is considered to be the state of a soul when it escapes from the cycle of birth and death, while experiencing its true nature of boundless bliss and infinite knowledge [96] The Jain Diwali celebrated in many parts of India has similar practices to the Hindu Diwali, such as the lighting of lamps However, the focus of the Jain Diwali remains the dedication to Mahavira [97] According to the Jain tradition, this practice of lighting lamps first began on the day of Mahavira's nirvana in 527 BCE, [k] when 18 kings who had gathered for Mahavira's final teachings issued a proclamation that lamps be lit in remembrance of the \"great light, Mahavira\" [100] [101] This traditional belief of the origin of Diwali, and its significance to Jains, is reflected in their historic artworks such as paintings [102]\n\n\nSikhism\nSikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas in remembrance of the release of Guru Hargobind from the Gwalior Fort prison by the Mughal emperor Jahangir and the day he arrived at the Golden Temple in Amritsar [103] According to J.S Grewal, a scholar of Sikhism and Sikh history, Diwali in the Sikh tradition is older than the sixth Guru Hargobind legend Guru Amar Das, the third Guru of the Sikhs, built a well in Goindwal with eighty-four steps and invited Sikhs to bathe in its sacred waters on Baisakhi and Diwali as a form of community bonding Over time, these spring and autumn festivals became the most important of Sikh festivals and holy sites such as Amritsar became focal points for annual pilgrimages [104] The festival of Diwali, according to Ray Colledge, highlights three events in Sikh history: the founding of the city of Amritsar in 1577, the release of Guru Hargobind from the Mughal prison, and the day of Bhai Mani Singh's martyrdom in 1738 as a result of his failure to pay a fine for trying to celebrate Diwali and thereafter refusing to convert to Islam [105] [106] [l]\n\n\nBuddhism\nDiwali is not a festival for most Buddhists, with the exception of the Newar people of Nepal who revere various deities in Vajrayana Buddhism and celebrate Diwali by offering prayers to Lakshmi [2] [22] Newar Buddhists in Nepalese valleys also celebrate the Diwali festival over five days, in much the same way, and on the same days, as the Nepalese Hindu Diwali-Tihar festival [109] According to some observers, this traditional celebration by Newar Buddhists in Nepal, through the worship of Lakshmi and Vishnu during Diwali, is not syncretism but rather a reflection of the freedom within Mahayana Buddhist tradition to worship any deity for their worldly betterment [2]\n\n\nCelebrations\nIn the lead-up to Diwali, celebrants prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and workplaces with diyas (oil lamps) and rangolis (colourful art circle patterns) [111] During Diwali, people wear their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes with saaki (earthen lamp), diyas and rangoli, perform worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth, [m] light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where mithai (sweets) and gifts are shared.\n\n\nDhanteras and Yama Deepam (Day 1)\nDhanteras, also known as Dhanatrayodashi, is derived from Dhan meaning wealth and teras meaning thirteenth, marks the thirteenth day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik and the beginning of Diwali in most parts of India [120] On this day, many Hindus clean their homes and business premises They install diyas, small earthen oil-filled lamps that they light up for the next five days, near Lakshmi and Ganesha iconography [120] [117] Women and children decorate doorways within homes and offices with rangolis, colourful designs made from rice flour, flower petals, coloured rice or coloured sand, [27] while the boys and men decorate the roofs and walls of family homes, markets, and temples and string up lights and lanterns The day also marks a major shopping day for buying new utensils, home equipment, gold jewellery, firecrackers, and other items [117] [54] [82] [121] On the evening of Dhanteras, families offer prayers (puja) to Lakshmi and Ganesha, and lay offerings of puffed rice, candy toys, rice cakes and batashas (hollow sugar cakes) [117]\n\n\nNaraka Chaturdashi, Kali Chaudas, Chhoti Diwali, Hanuman Puja, Roop Chaudas, Yama Deepam (Day 2)\nNaraka Chaturdashi, also known as Chhoti Diwali, is the second day of festivities coinciding with the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik [125] The term \"chhoti\" means little, while \"Naraka\" means hell and \"Chaturdashi\" means \"fourteenth\" [126] The day and its rituals are interpreted as ways to liberate any soul from suffering in \"Naraka\", or hell, as well as a reminder of spiritual auspiciousness For some Hindus, it is a day to pray for the peace to the manes, or defiled souls of one's ancestors and light their way for their journeys in the cyclic afterlife [127] A mythological interpretation of this festive day is the destruction of the asura (demon) Narakasura by Krishna, a victory that frees 16,000 imprisoned princesses kidnapped by Narakasura [126] It is also celebrated as Roop Chaudas in some North Indian households, where women bathe before sunrise, while lighting a diya (lamp) in the bath area, they believe it helps enhance their beauty – it is a fun ritual that young girls enjoy as part of festivities Ubtan is applied by the women which is made up of special gram flour mixed with herbs for cleansing and beautifying themselves.\n\n\nLakshmi Pujan, Kali Puja (Day 3)\nThe third day is the height of the festival, [132] and coincides with the last day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik This is the day when Hindu, Jain and Sikh temples and homes are aglow with lights, thereby making it the \"festival of lights\" The word Deepawali comes from the Sanskrit word deep, which means an Indian lantern/lamp [46] [133]\n\n\nAnnakut, Balipratipada (Padwa), New Year's Day, Govardhan Puja (Day 4)\nThe day after Diwali is the first day of the bright fortnight of Kartik [146] It is regionally called Annakut (heap of grain), Padwa, Goverdhan puja, Bali Pratipada, Bali Padyami, Kartik Shukla Pratipada and other names [27] [146] According to one tradition, the day is associated with the story of Bali's defeat at the hands of Vishnu [147] [148] In another interpretation, it is thought to reference the legend of Parvati and her husband Shiva playing a game of dyuta (dice) on a board of twelve squares and thirty pieces, Parvati wins Shiva surrenders his shirt and adornments to her, rendering him naked [146] According to Handelman and Shulman, as quoted by Pintchman, this legend is a Hindu metaphor for the cosmic process for creation and dissolution of the world through the masculine destructive power, as represented by Shiva, and the feminine procreative power, represented by Parvati, where twelve reflects the number of months in the cyclic year, while thirty are the number of days in its lunisolar month [146]\n\n\nBhai Duj, Bhau-Beej, Vishwakarma Puja (Day 5)\nThe last day of the festival, the second day of the bright fortnight of Kartik, is called Bhai Duj (literally \"brother's day\" [152]), Bhau Beej, Bhai Tilak or Bhai Phonta It celebrates the sister-brother bond, similar in spirit to Raksha Bandhan but it is the brother that travels to meet the sister and her family This festive day is interpreted by some to symbolise Yama's sister Yamuna welcoming Yama with a tilaka, while others interpret it as the arrival of Krishna at his sister Subhadra's place after defeating Narakasura Subhadra welcomes him with a tilaka on his forehead [149] [153]\n\n\nOther traditions and significance\nDuring the season of Diwali, numerous rural townships and villages host melas, [158] or fairs, where local producers and artisans trade produce and goods A variety of entertainments are usually available for inhabitants of the local community to enjoy The women, in particular, adorn themselves in colourful attire and decorate their hands with henna Such events are also mentioned in Sikh historical records [159] [q] In the modern day, Diwali mela are held at college, or university, campuses or as community events by members of the Indian diaspora At such events a variety of music, dance and arts performances, food, crafts, and cultural celebrations are featured [160] [161] [91]\n\n\nEconomics\nDiwali marks a major shopping period in India, [29] and is comparable to the Christmas period in terms of consumer purchases and economic activity [162] It is traditionally a time when households purchase new clothing, home refurbishments, gifts, gold, jewelry, [163] [164] and other large purchases particularly as the festival is dedicated to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and such purchases are considered auspicious [165] [166] According to Rao, Diwali is one of the major festivals where rural Indians spend a significant portion of their annual income, and is a means for them to renew their relationships and social networks [167]\n\n\nPolitics\nDiwali has increasingly attracted cultural exchanges, becoming occasions for politicians and religious leaders worldwide to meet Hindu or Indian origin citizens, diplomatic staff or neighbours Many participate in other socio-political events as a symbol of support for diversity and inclusiveness The Catholic dicastery Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, founded as Secretariat for non-Christians by Pope Paul VI, began sending official greetings and the Pope's message to the Hindus on Diwali in the mid-1990s [175] [s]\n\n\nHazards\nThe use of firecrackers on Diwali increases the concentration of dust and pollutants in the air After firing, the fine dust particles get settled on the surrounding surfaces which are packed with chemicals like copper, zinc, sodium, lead, magnesium, cadmium and pollutants like oxides of sulfur and nitrogen [189] These invisible yet harmful particles affect the environment and in turn, put people's health at stake [190] The smoke created by firecrackers lit up on Diwali causes smog which sometimes takes days to clear [191]\n\n\nGuinness World Record\nIn 2023, a Diwali celebration in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India, broke the Guinness World Record for the largest display of oil lamps with 2,223,676 displayed on the eve of Diwali [196]\n\n\nSee also\n(federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) =

Tournament on April 11 with a 16-under-par performance, giving him a three-stroke win over Lee Westwood The win marked the third Masters victory for Mickelson and his fourth major championship overall

to fall out of the lead He regained the lead at the par-4 10th when he holed his second shot from the rough for an eagle However, a misjudgment at the short par-3 13th saw him fly the green and make a bogey to slip one behind leader Justin Rose Another bogey followed at the 15th, before narrowly missing a birdie putt on the 16th that would have tied Rose Mickelson could not make a birdie at the 17th and after a blocked drive on the 18th, he could not hole his pitch from short of the green, which led to a final bogey.\n\n\nFifth major title at the Open Championship\nThe week before The Open Championship, Mickelson warmed up for the event by winning his first tournament on British soil at the Scottish Open on July 14, after a sudden-death playoff against Branden Grace After this victory, Mickelson spoke of his confidence ahead of his participation in the following week's major championship Mickelson said: \"I've never felt more excited going into The Open I don't think there's a better way to get ready for a major than playing well the week before and getting into contention Coming out on top just gives me more confidence.\" [62]\n\n\n2014 and 2015: Inconsistent form and close calls in majors\nMickelson missed the cut at the Masters for the first time since 1997 He failed to contend at the U.S Open at Pinehurst in his first bid to complete the career grand slam

one Rory McIlroy.\n\n\n2016: New swing coach\nAfter leaving Butch Harmon, Mickelson hired Andrew Getson of Grayhawk Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona, to serve as his new swing coach The two worked together heavily in the 2015 offseason to get Mickelson's swing back.\n\n\n2017: Recovery from surgeries\nIn the fall of 2016, Mickelson had two sports hernia surgeries Those in the golf community expected him to miss much time recovering, however his unexpected return at the CareerBuilder Challenge was a triumphant one, leading to a T-21 finish The next week, in San Diego, he narrowly missed an eagle putt on the 18th hole on Sunday that would have got him to 8-under par instead posting −7 (71-72-67-71) to finish T14 at the Farmers Insurance Open The following week, at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, which he has won three times, he surged into contention following a Saturday 65 He played his first nine holes in 4-under 32 and sending his name to the top of the leaderboard However, his charge faltered with bogeys at 11, 12, 14, 15, and a double bogey at the driveable 17th hole He stumbled with a final round 71, still earning a T-16 finish, for his sixth straight top-25 finish on tour.\n\n\n2018–2019: Winless streak ends\nOn March 4, 2018, Mickelson ended a winless drought that dated back to 2013, by capturing his third WGC championship at the WGC-Mexico Championship, with a final-round score of 66 and a total score of −16 Mickelson birdied two of his last four holes and had a lengthy putt to win outright on the 72nd hole, but tied with Justin Thomas He defeated Thomas on

meaning Mickelson claimed the championship The win was Mickelson's 43rd on the PGA Tour and his first since winning the 2013 Open Championship [72] He also became the oldest winner of a WGC event, at age 47 [73]\n\n\n2020: PGA Tour season and PGA Tour Champions debut\nIn December 2019, Mickelson announced via Twitter that \"after turning down opportunities to go to the Middle East for many years\" he would play in the 2020 Saudi International tournament on the European Tour and would miss Waste Management Phoenix Open for the first time since 1989 However, his decision to visit and play in Saudi Arabia was widely criticized for ignoring the continuous human rights abuses in the nation [80] Mickelson went on to finish the February 2020 event tied for third [81]\n\n\n2021: The oldest major champion\nIn February 2021, Mickelson was attempting to become the first player in PGA Tour Champions history to win his first three tournaments on tour However, he fell short in the Cologuard Classic, finishing in a T-20 position with a score of 4 under par [84]\n\n\n2022: LIV Golf\nMickelson told a journalist that despite Saudi Arabians being \"scary motherfuckers\" who had murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi and executed gay people, he supported the Saudi-backed LIV Golf because it offered an opportunity to reshape the PGA Tour [88] In response to these comments, Mickelson lost sponsors Amstel Light and KPMG [88] Mickelson announced he would be stepping away from golf to spend time with his family and would miss the 2022 Masters Tournament [88] In May, he also decided to

conflicting event without permission from the tour [92]\n\n\n2023\nAt the 2023 Masters Tournament, Mickelson made what many viewed as the performance of the tournament, beginning the final day ten shots off of the lead, and finishing in tied second Shooting a 65, Mickelson equaled his lowest score at Augusta almost 27 years ago In the last seven holes, he scored five birdies and two pars.\n\n\nPlaying style\nAs a competitor, Mickelson's playing style is described by many as \"aggressive\" and highly social [24] [93] [94] His strategy toward difficult shots (bad lies,

far more from endorsements than from prize money According to one estimate [99] of 2011 earnings (comprising salary, winnings, bonuses, endorsements, and appearances), Mickelson was then the second-highest paid athlete in the United States, earning an income of over $62 million, $53 million of which came from endorsements In 2015, Forbes estimated Mickelson's annual income was $51 million

He was born on June 16, 1970, in San Diego, California, to parents Philip Mickelson Sr., an airline pilot and former naval aviator, and Mary Santos. Mickelson has Portuguese, Swedish, and Sicilian ancestry. His maternal grandfather, Alfred Santos, was a caddie at Pebble Beach Golf Links and took Phil to play golf as a child.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMickelson attended Arizona State University in Tempe on a golf scholarship and became the face of amateur golf in the United States. He captured three NCAA individual championships and three Haskins Awards (1990, 1991, 1992) as the outstanding collegiate golfer. With three individual NCAA championships, he shares the record for most individual NCAA championships alongside Ben Crenshaw. Mickelson also led the Sun Devils to the NCAA team title in 1990. Over the course of his collegiate career, he won 16 tournaments.\n\n**Amateur Career**\n\nMickelson's amateur career was marked by numerous accolades and achievements. He won the 1990 U.S. Amateur Championship, and in 1991, he won the 1991 U.S. Amateur Championship and the U.S. Amateur Championship's low-amateur medal at the U.S. Open. Mickelson's impressive collegiate and amateur career earned him a spot on the 1990 and 1991 U.S. Walker Cup teams.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nMickelson graduated from ASU in June 1992 and quickly turned professional. He bypassed the tour's qualifying process (Q-School) because of his 1991 win in Tucson, which earned him a two-year exemption. In 1992, Mickelson hired Jim \"Bones\" Mackay as his caddy. He won many PGA Tour tournaments during this period, including the Byron Nelson Golf Classic and the World Series of Golf in 1996, the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in 1998, the Colonial National Invitation in 2000, and the Greater Hartford Open in 2001 and again in 2002.\n\n**1992–2003: Trying for First Major Win**\n\nMickelson's professional career was marked by a period of trying to secure his first major win. He had come close on several occasions, including a runner-up finish at the 1996 Masters and a tie for second at the 1999 Masters. In 2000, Mickelson won the Phoenix Open, but it was his first win in over two years. He continued to struggle with consistency, but his performances in majors showed promise.\n\n**2004–2006: First Three Major Wins**\n\nMickelson's first major championship win came in his thirteenth year on the PGA Tour in 2004, when he secured victory in the Masters with an 18-foot (5.5 m) birdie putt on the final hole. Ernie Els was the runner-up at a stroke back; the two played in different pairs in the final round and had traded birdies and eagles on the back nine. In addition to getting the \"majors monkey\" off his back, Mickelson was now only the third golfer with a left-handed swing to win a major; the others being New Zealander Sir Bob Charles, who won The Open Championship in 1963, and Canadian Mike Weir, who won The Masters in 2003.\n\n**2006: Collapse on Final Hole at the U.S. Open**\n\nAfter winning two majors in a row heading into the U.S Open at Winged Foot, Mickelson was bidding to join Ben Hogan and Tiger Woods as the only players to win three consecutive majors (not necessarily in the same calendar year). Mickelson was the joint leader going into the final round, but he was part of a wild finish to the tournament, in which he made major mistakes on the final hole and ended up in a tie for second place at +6 (286), one shot behind Geoff Ogilvy.\n\n**2006–2008**\n\nDuring the third round of the 2006 Ford Championship at Doral, Mickelson gave a spectator $200 after his wayward tee shot at the par-5 10th broke the man's watch. Mickelson also showed other signs of appreciation, including volunteering to pay tuition for Holli Dobler, the daughter of retired NFL player Conrad Dobler, at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.\n\n**2009**\n\nMickelson won his first 2009 tour event when he defended his title at the Northern Trust Open at Riviera, one stroke ahead of Steve Stricker. The victory was Mickelson's 35th on tour; he surpassed Vijay Singh for second place on the current PGA Tour wins list. A month later, he won his 36th, and his first World Golf Championship, at the WGC-CA Championship with a one-stroke win over Nick Watney.\n\n**2010: Third Masters Win**\n\nIn 2010, Mickelson won the Masters Tournament on April 11 with a 16-under-par performance, giving him a three-stroke win over Lee Westwood. The win marked the third Masters victory for Mickelson and his fourth major championship overall. Critical to Mickelson's win was a dramatic run in the third round on Saturday, in which he made eagle, then to hole-out for eagle from 141 yards at the next hole, the par-4 14th, then on the next, the par-5 15th, to miss eagle from 81 yards by mere inches.\n\n**Remainder of 2010**\n\nMickelson, one of the favorites for the U.S Open at Pebble Beach, shot 75 and 66 on Thursday and Friday to sit two shots off the lead. However, two weekend scores of 73 gave him a T4 finish. During the remainder of the 2010 season, Mickelson had multiple opportunities to become the number one player in the world rankings following the travails of Tiger Woods. However, a string of disappointing finishes by Mickelson saw the number one spot eventually go to Englishman Lee Westwood.\n\n**2011**\n\nMickelson started his 2011 season at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course. He shot 67-69-68 and was tied for the 54 hole lead with Bill Haas. Mickelson needed to hole out on the 18th hole for eagle from 74 yards to force a playoff with Bubba Watson. He hit it to 4 feet and Watson won the tournament.\n\n**2012: 40th Career PGA Tour Win**\n\nMickelson made his 2012 debut at the Humana Challenge and finished tied for 49th. He missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open after shooting rounds of 77 and 68. In the final round of the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, Mickelson rallied from six shots back, winning the tournament by two strokes with a final-round score of 8-under 64 and a four-round total of 269. The win marked his 40th career victory on the PGA Tour.\n\n**2013**\n\nMickelson began the 2013 season in January by playing in the Humana Challenge, where he finished T37 at −17. His next event was the following week in his home event near San Diego at the Farmers Insurance Open. Mickelson endured a disappointing tournament, finishing T51, shooting all four rounds in the 70s.\n\n**Sixth Runner-up Finish at the U.S. Open**\n\nAt the U.S Open at Merion, Mickelson entered the final round leading by one stroke after rounds of 67-72-70 (−1) over the first three days. However, he started the final round by three-putting the 3rd and 5th holes for double-bogeys to fall out of the lead. He regained the lead at the par-4 10th when he holed his second shot from the rough for an eagle. However, a misjudgment at the short par-3 13th saw him fly the green and make a bogey to slip one behind leader Justin Rose.\n\n**Fifth Major Title at the Open Championship**\n\nThe week before The Open Championship, Mickelson warmed up for the event by winning his first tournament on British soil at the Scottish Open on July 14, after a sudden-death playoff against Branden Grace. After this victory, Mickelson spoke of his confidence ahead of his participation in the following week's major championship.\n\n**2014 and 2015: Inconsistent Form and Close Calls in Majors**\n\nMickelson missed the cut at the Masters for the first time since 1997. He failed to contend at the U.S Open at Pinehurst in his first bid to complete the career grand slam. Mickelson's lone top-10 of the PGA Tour season came at the year's final major, the PGA Championship at Valhalla. Mickelson shot rounds of 69-67-67-66 to finish solo second, one shot behind world number one Rory McIlroy.\n\n**2016: New Swing Coach**\n\nAfter leaving Butch Harmon, Mickelson hired Andrew Getson of Grayhawk Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona, to serve as his new swing coach. The two worked together heavily in the 2015 offseason to get Mickelson's swing back.\n\n**2017: Recovery from Surgeries**\n\nIn the fall of 2016, Mickelson had two sports hernia surgeries. Those in the golf community expected him to miss much time recovering, however his unexpected return at the CareerBuilder Challenge was a triumphant one, leading to a T-21 finish. The next week, in San Diego, he narrowly missed an eagle putt on the 18th hole on Sunday that would have got him to 8-under par instead posting −7 (71-72-67-71) to finish T14 at the Farmers Insurance Open.\n\n**2018–2019: Winless Streak Ends**\n\nOn March 4, 2018, Mickelson ended a winless drought that dated back to 2013, by capturing his third WGC championship at the WGC-Mexico Championship, with a final-round score of 66 and a total score of −16. Mickelson birdied two of his last four holes and had a lengthy putt to win outright on the 72nd hole, but tied with Justin Thomas. He defeated Thomas on the first extra hole of a sudden-death playoff with a par.\n\n**2020: PGA Tour Season and PGA Tour Champions Debut**\n\nIn December 2019, Mickelson announced via Twitter that \"after turning down opportunities to go to the Middle East for many years\" he would play in the 2020 Saudi International tournament on the European Tour and would miss Waste Management Phoenix Open for the first time since 1989. However, his decision to visit and play in Saudi Arabia was widely criticized for ignoring the continuous human rights abuses in the nation.\n\n**2021: The Oldest Major Champion**\n\nIn February 2021, Mickelson was attempting to become the first player in PGA Tour Champions history to win his first three tournaments on tour. However, he fell short in the Cologuard Classic, finishing in a T-20 position with a score of 4 under par.\n\n**2022: LIV Golf**\n\nMickelson told a journalist that despite Saudi Arabians being \"scary motherfuckers\" who had murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi and executed gay people, he supported the Saudi-backed LIV Golf because it offered an opportunity to reshape the PGA Tour. In response to these comments, Mickelson lost sponsors Amstel Light and KPMG. Mickelson announced he would be stepping away from golf to spend time with his family and would miss the 2022 Masters Tournament.\n\n**2023**\n\nAt the 2023 Masters Tournament, Mickelson made what many viewed as the performance of the tournament, beginning the final day ten shots off of the lead, and finishing in tied second. Shooting a 65, Mickelson equaled his lowest score at Augusta almost 27 years ago. In the last seven holes, he scored five birdies and two pars.\n\n**Playing Style**\n\nAs a competitor, Mickelson's playing style is described by many as \"aggressive\" and highly social. His strategy toward difficult shots (bad lies, obstructions) would tend to be considered risky.\n\n**Earnings and Endorsements**\n\nAlthough ranked second on the PGA Tour's all-time money list of tournament prize money won, Mickelson earns far more from endorsements than from prize money. According to one estimate of 2011 earnings (comprising salary, winnings, bonuses, endorsements, and appearances), Mickelson was then the second-highest paid athlete in the United States, earning an income of over $62 million, $53 million of which came from endorsements. In 2015, Forbes estimated Mickelson's annual income was $51 million. Major companies which Mickelson currently endorses are ExxonMobil (Mickelson and wife Amy started a teacher sponsorship fund with the company), Rolex, and Mizzen+Main. Mickelson's sponsorship with Callaway Golf is currently \"paused\" and will be re-evaluated at a later date. After being diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2010, Mickelson was treated with Enbrel and began endorsing the drug. He has been previously sponsored by Titleist, KPMG, Workday, Bearing Point, Barclays, Amstel Light, and Ford.\n\n**Business**\n\nAs a businessman, Mickelson is the co-founder of For Wellness with Dave Phillips, who is Jon Rahm's coach and also co-founder of the Titleist Performance Institute. The company sells functional food and beverage products, including the supplement that Mickelson adds to his coffee.\n\n**Insider Trading Settlement**\n\nOn May 30, 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that the FBI and U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were investigating Mickelson and associates of his for insider trading in Clorox and Dean Foods stock. Mickelson denied any wrongdoing. The initial investigation concluded without any charges related to Clorox. However, Mickelson was still under investigation for trades in Dean Foods from which he profited more than $931,000.

the first extra hole of a sudden-death playoff with a par After Thomas had flown the green, Mickelson had a birdie to win the playoff which lipped out Thomas however could not get up and down for par, meaning Mickelson claimed the championship The win was Mickelson's 43rd on the PGA Tour and his first since winning the 2013 Open Championship [72] He also became the oldest winner of a WGC event, at age 47 [73]\n\n\n2020: PGA Tour season and PGA Tour Champions debut\nIn December 2019, Mickelson announced via Twitter that \"after turning down opportunities to go to the Middle East for many years\" he would play in the 2020 Saudi International tournament on the European Tour and would miss Waste Management Phoenix Open for the first time since 1989 However, his decision to visit and play in Saudi Arabia was widely criticized for ignoring the continuous human rights abuses in the nation [80] Mickelson went on to finish the February 2020 event tied for third [81]\n\n\n2021: The oldest major champion\nIn February 2021, Mickelson was attempting to become the first player in PGA Tour Champions history to win his first three tournaments on tour However, he fell short in the Cologuard Classic, finishing in a T-20 position with a score of 4 under par [84]\n\n\n2022: LIV Golf\nMickelson told a journalist that despite Saudi Arabians being \"scary motherfuckers\" who had murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi and executed gay people, he supported the Saudi-backed LIV Golf because it offered an opportunity to reshape the PGA Tour [88] In response to these comments, Mickelson lost sponsors Amstel Light and KPMG [88] Mickelson announced he would be stepping away from golf to spend time with his family and would miss the 2022 Masters Tournament [88] In May, he also decided to withdraw from the PGA Championship [89] which he won in 2021 [90] On June 6, 2022, LIV Golf CEO Greg Norman announced that Mickelson will play in the first event on the LIV Golf Invitational Series beginning on June 9, 2022 [91] On June 9, 2022, the first day of the LIV Golf Invitational London, the PGA Tour suspended Mickelson and 16 other current and former tour members for participating in a conflicting event without permission from the tour [92]\n\n\n2023\nAt the 2023 Masters Tournament, Mickelson made what many viewed as the performance of the tournament, beginning the final day ten shots off of the lead, and finishing in tied second Shooting a 65, Mickelson equaled his lowest score at Augusta almost 27 years ago In the last seven holes, he scored five birdies and two pars.\n\n\nPlaying style\nAs a competitor, Mickelson's playing style is described by many as \"aggressive\" and highly social [24] [93] [94] His strategy toward difficult shots (bad lies, obstructions) would tend to be considered risky [95]\n\n\nEarnings and endorsements\nAlthough ranked second on the PGA Tour's all-time money list [98] of tournament prize money won, Mickelson earns far more from endorsements than from prize money According to one estimate [99] of 2011 earnings (comprising salary, winnings, bonuses, endorsements, and appearances), Mickelson was then the second-highest paid athlete in the United States, earning an income of over $62 million, $53 million of which came from endorsements In 2015, Forbes estimated Mickelson's annual income was $51 million [100] Major companies which Mickelson currently endorses are ExxonMobil (Mickelson and wife Amy started a teacher sponsorship fund with the company), Rolex, and Mizzen+Main Mickelson's sponsorship with Callaway Golf is currently \"paused\" and will be re-evaluated at a later date [101] After being diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2010, Mickelson was treated with Enbrel and began endorsing the drug He has been previously sponsored by Titleist, KPMG, Workday, Bearing Point, Barclays, Amstel Light and Ford.\n\n\nBusiness\nAs a businessman, Mickelson is the co-founder of For Wellness with Dave Phillips, who is Jon Rahm's coach and also co-founder of the Titleist Performance Institute The company sells functional food and beverage products, including the supplement that Mickelson adds to his coffee  [104]\n\n\nInsider trading settlement\nOn May 30, 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that the FBI and U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were investigating Mickelson and associates of his for insider trading in Clorox and Dean Foods stock [105] [106] Mickelson denied any wrongdoing [107] The initial investigation concluded without any charges related to Clorox However, Mickelson was still under investigation for trades in Dean Foods from which he profited more than $931,000 [108] [109] On May 19, 2016, Mickelson was named as a relief defendant in a SEC complaint alleging insider trading but avoided criminal charges in a parallel case brought in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York [110] The action results from trades in Dean Foods in 2012 in conjunction with confidential information provided by Thomas Davis, a former director of Dean Foods Company, who tipped his friend and \"professional sports bettor\" Billy Walters [108]\n\n\nAmateur wins\n*Note: Tournament shortened to 54 holes due to weather.\n\n\nProfessional wins (57)\n*Note: Tournament shortened to 54 holes due to weather.\n\n\nPGA Tour wins

much less does he explain or justify the underlying date.\" [61]\n\n\nAccording to Jewish sources\nSimilarities between the Yeshu mentioned in some rabbinic literature and the Christian Jesus have led some researchers to speculate that the former is a reference to the latter (see for example Jesus in the Talmud) [74] [75] This opinion is disputed however, as Yeshu also can mean \"may his name and memory be blotted out\", probably used as a damnatio memoriae to censor certain names [76] It is claimed in the Talmud that Yeshu was born during the reign of Alexander Jannaeus, who ruled from 103 BC to 76 BC Furthermore, Sanhedrin 107b and Sotah 47a mention Yeshu taking refuge in Egypt during Alexander's persecution of Pharisees (88-76 BC) Therefore, it can be assumed the Yeshu of the Talmud was born after 103 BC but before 88 BC Hagigah 2:2 also depicts Yeshu similarly, while also claiming that Yeshu became an apostate during his refuge in Egypt [77]\n\n\nTwo competing hypotheses for 25 December\nTwo main hypotheses have been offered as to the choice of the calendar date: 25 December [14] [84] [85]\n\n\nCalculation hypothesis\nThe \"Calculation hypothesis\", suggests that Christmas was calculated as nine months after a date chosen as Jesus's conception (the Annunciation): 25 March, the Roman date of the spring equinox The hypothesis was first proposed by French writer Louis Duchesne in 1889 [86] [87] [88] Susan Roll (1995) wrote that the calculation hypothesis is historically the \"minority opinion\" on the origin of Christmas, but was \"taught in graduate liturgy programs as a thoroughly viable hypothesis\" [89]\n\n\nHistory of religions hypothesis\nTheology professor Susan Roll writes: \"No liturgical historian .. goes so far as to deny that it has any sort of relation with the sun, the winter solstice and the popularity of solar worship in the later Roman Empire.\" [103] Related to the winter solstice theory, the \"History of Religions\" hypothesis proposes the Church chose 25 December as Jesus's birthday (dies Natalis Christi) [104] to appropriate the Roman winter solstice festival dies Natalis Solis Invicti ('birthday of the Unconquered Sun'), held on the same date [85] [105] It honored the sun god Sol Invictus, whose cult was revived by the emperor Aurelian in AD 274 In Rome this yearly festival was celebrated with thirty chariot races [105] Gary Forsythe, Professor of Ancient History, says: \"This celebration would have formed a welcome addition to the seven-day period of the Saturnalia (December 17–23), Rome's most joyous holiday season since Republican times, characterized by parties, banquets, and exchanges of gifts\" [105] In AD 362, the emperor Julian wrote in his Hymn to King Helios that the Agon Solis was a festival of the sun held at the end of the Saturnalia in late December [106] [107]\n\n\nDay and season\nDespite the modern celebration of Christmas in December, neither the Gospel of Luke nor Gospel of Matthew mention a season for Jesus' birth Scholarly arguments have been made regarding whether shepherds would have been grazing their flock during the winter, with some scholars challenging a winter birth for Jesus, [116] and some defending the idea by citing the mildness of winters in Judea and rabbinic rules regarding sheep near Bethlehem before February [11] [117] [118]\n\n\nIslamic view\nThe Qur'an, which is the source of Islamic tradition tells the story of Mary and the birth of Jesus (known in Islam as 'Īsā: Messenger of God) most prominently in Chapter 19 According to verse 19:25, during labor Mary was told to shake a palm tree so that ripe dates would fall off This description, combined with the ripening period of dates places the birth of Jesus somewhere between June and October, with later times being more likely due to dates falling off easily In the hadith compilation Tuhaf al-Uqul, the sixth imam, Jafar As Sadiq says the following when approached about the birth of Jesus during Christmas: \"They have lied Rather, it was in the middle of June The day and night become even  [equal] in the middle of March\" This statement of his does not literally mean it was on 15 June but it is in reference to a day near the spring equinox [134]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nCitations\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Date of Birth of Jesus**\n\nThe date of birth of Jesus is a topic of ongoing debate and research among scholars and historians. The nativity accounts in the New Testament gospels of Matthew and Luke do not mention a date or time of year for the birth of Jesus, and the authors of the gospels generally focused on theological elements rather than historical chronologies.\n\n**Year of Birth**\n\nThe year of birth of Jesus is estimated to be around 1 BC, based on an attempt to work backwards from the point when Jesus began preaching. According to Luke 3:23, Jesus was \"about 30 years of age\" at that time, and based on Luke's gospel, John only began baptizing people in \"the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar\" (Luke 3:1–2). Scholars estimate that this would place the year at about AD 28–29. By working backwards from this, it appears that Jesus was probably born no later than 1 BC.\n\n**Date of Herod's Death**\n\nMost scholars concerning the date of Herod's death follow Emil Schürer's calculations published in 1896, which revised a traditional death date of 1 BC to 4 BC. Two of Herod's sons, Archelaus and Philip the Tetrarch, dated their rule from 4 BC, though Archelaus apparently held royal authority during Herod's lifetime. Philip's reign would last for 37 years, until his death in the traditionally accepted 20th year of Tiberius (AD 34), which implies his accession as 4 BC.\n\n**According to Dionysius Exiguus: the Anno Domini System**\n\nThe Anno Domini dating system was devised in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus to enumerate the years in his Easter table. His system was to replace the Diocletian era that had been used in older Easter tables, as he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The last year of the old table, Diocletian Anno Martyrium 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, Anno Domini 532. When Dionysius devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year — Dionysius himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of Probus Junior\", which was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ\".\n\n**According to Jewish Sources**\n\nSimilarities between the Yeshu mentioned in some rabbinic literature and the Christian Jesus have led some researchers to speculate that the former is a reference to the latter. This opinion is disputed, however, as Yeshu also can mean \"may his name and memory be blotted out\", probably used as a damnatio memoriae to censor certain names. It is claimed in the Talmud that Yeshu was born during the reign of Alexander Jannaeus, who ruled from 103 BC to 76 BC. Therefore, it can be assumed that the Yeshu of the Talmud was born after 103 BC but before 88 BC.\n\n**Two Competing Hypotheses for 25 December**\n\nTwo main hypotheses have been offered as to the choice of the calendar date: 25 December. The \"Calculation hypothesis\" suggests that Christmas was calculated as nine months after a date chosen as Jesus's conception (the Annunciation): 25 March, the Roman date of the spring equinox. The hypothesis was first proposed by French writer Louis Duchesne in 1889. The \"History of Religions\" hypothesis proposes the Church chose 25 December as Jesus's birthday to appropriate the Roman winter solstice festival dies Natalis Solis Invicti ('birthday of the Unconquered Sun'), held on the same date.\n\n**Day and Season**\n\nDespite the modern celebration of Christmas in December, neither the Gospel of Luke nor Gospel of Matthew mention a season for Jesus' birth. Scholarly arguments have been made regarding whether shepherds would have been grazing their flock during the winter, with some scholars challenging a winter birth for Jesus, and some defending the idea by citing the mildness of winters in Judea and rabbinic rules regarding sheep near Bethlehem before February.\n\n**Islamic View**\n\nThe Qur'an tells the story of Mary and the birth of Jesus (known in Islam as 'Īsā: Messenger of God) most prominently in Chapter 19. According to verse 19:25, during labor Mary was told to shake a palm tree so that ripe dates would fall off. This description, combined with the ripening period of dates, places the birth of Jesus somewhere between June and October, with later times being more likely due to dates falling off easily.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Jesus in the Talmud\n* Nativity of Jesus\n* History of Christmas\n* Anno Domini era\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Date_of_birth_of_Jesus\" following this outline:\n\n\nYear of birth\nThe nativity accounts in the New Testament gospels of Matthew and Luke do not mention a date or time of year for the birth of Jesus [a] Karl Rahner states that the authors of the gospels generally focused on theological elements rather than historical chronologies [6]\n\n\nNativity accounts\nThe nativity accounts in the New Testament gospels of Matthew and Luke do not mention a date or time of year for the birth of Jesus [a] Karl Rahner states that the authors of the gospels generally focused on theological elements rather than historical chronologies [6]\n\n\nBackdating from the beginning of the ministry of Jesus\nAnother approach to estimating the year of birth is based on an attempt to work backwards from the point when Jesus began preaching, using the statement in Luke 3:23 that he was \"about 30 years of age\" at that time [33] Jesus began to preach after being baptized by John the Baptist, and based on Luke's gospel John only began baptizing people in \"the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar\" (Luke 3:1–2), which scholars estimate would place the year at about AD 28–29 [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] By working backwards from this, it would appear that Jesus was probably born no later than 1 BC [8] [33] [36] Another theory is that Herod's death was as late as after the January eclipse of 1 BC [38] or even AD 1 [39] after the eclipse that occurred in 1 December BC [40]\n\n\nDates based on the Star of Bethlehem\nMost scholars regard the Star of Bethlehem account to be a pious fiction, of literary and theological value, rather than historical  Nonetheless, attempts have been made to interpret it as an astronomical event, which might then help date Jesus' birth through the use of ancient astronomical records, or modern astronomical calculations The first such attempt was made by Johannes Kepler who interpreted the account to describe a great conjunction [42] Other astronomical events have been considered, including a close planetary conjunction between Venus and Jupiter in 2 BC [43]\n\n\nDate of Herod's death\nMost scholars concerning the date of Herod's death follow Emil Schürer's calculations published in 1896, which revised a traditional death date of 1 BC to 4 BC [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] Two of Herod's sons, Archelaus and Philip the Tetrarch, dated their rule from 4 BC, [49] though Archelaus apparently held royal authority during Herod's lifetime [50] Philip's reign would last for 37 years, until his death in the traditionally accepted 20th year of Tiberius (AD 34), which implies his accession as 4 BC [51]\n\n\nAccording to Dionysius Exiguus: the Anno Domini system\nThe Anno Domini dating system was devised in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus to enumerate the years in his Easter table His system was to replace the Diocletian era that had been used in older Easter tables, as he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians [59] The last year of the old table, Diocletian Anno Martyrium 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, Anno Domini 532 When Dionysius devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year — Dionysius himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of Probus Junior\", which was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ\" [60] Thus, Dionysius implied that Jesus' incarnation occurred 525 years earlier, without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred \"However, nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, Olympiad, year of the world, or regnal year of Augustus;

The game is the fourth main installment in the Diablo series and was released on June 6, 2023, for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe core formula for the series' gameplay revolves around gradually obtaining stronger equipment by defeating increasingly difficult enemies. Enemies are fought using different character class skills which can be customized by equipment and talent trees. This concept is used to progress through the story and quests. Enemies are split into monster families which are defined by a theme, combat style, and their location. Each family contains different archetypes that hold different roles allowing for synergies of specialty abilities between family members. To differentiate between them, they have unique silhouettes, stances, and weapons.\n\n**Character Classes**\n\nSix classes have been announced for Diablo IV. The Barbarian, Sorcerer, and Druid were announced at BlizzCon 2019, while a fourth, the Rogue, was announced at BlizzCon 2021. A fifth class, the Necromancer, was announced in 2022.

The regions are:\n\n* Dry Steppes\n* Malignant Mire\n* Fractured Peaks\n* Hawezar\n* Kehjistan\n* Scosglen\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nSet in the Diablo series' world of Sanctuary, Diablo IV takes place 50 years after the events of Diablo III: Reaper of Souls. Cultists have summoned the main antagonist and daughter of Mephisto, Lilith. After the events of previous games, the forces of demons and angels have been depleted, allowing an opening for her to establish power in Sanctuary.\n\n**Setting**\n\nThe game takes place in the world of Sanctuary, a dark fantasy realm filled with demonic creatures and ancient magic. The world has been scarred by the events of previous games, and the player must navigate through the ruins of civilization to uncover the secrets of the world.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe player character, known as \"the Wanderer\", is drugged by villagers corrupted by Lilith and fed petals of her blood, creating a connection to her. After escaping, the Wanderer meets Lorath Nahr, one of the last Horadrim, and explains the prophecy of Lilith's return. Inarius believes he alone can fulfill the prophecy by killing Lilith, which will allow him to return to Heaven. Aided by a young woman named Neyrelle, the Wanderer enters the sanctum of Rathma, the first Nephalem and founder of the Necromancers. Inside, Rathma's spirit reveals he had a key to Hell. When Inarius demands the key from him, Rathma refuses, and Inarius kills him. Lilith later finds the key. The Wanderer then journeys to Scosglen to meet another Horadrim named Donan, who had defeated a demon called Astaroth with the aid of two Druids years before. Lilith corrupts the two Druids to find Astaroth's prison and frees him, in exchange for safe passage through Hell. Astaroth possesses Donan's son Yorin, who dies when the demon is defeated. Donan recovers the Soulstone used to trap Astaroth, and prepares to alter it in order to trap Lilith.\n\n**Development**\n\nDiablo IV was announced on November 1, 2019, at BlizzCon 2019, and was planned to be released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

The HDI is designed to provide a more comprehensive picture of a country's development than other measures, such as Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe origins of the HDI are found in the annual Human Development Reports produced by the Human Development Report Office of the UNDP. These annual reports were devised and launched by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq in 1990, and had the explicit purpose \"to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies\". He believed that a simple composite measure of human development was needed to convince the public, academics, and politicians that they can, and should, evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being.\n\n**Dimensions and Calculation**\n\nThe HDI is calculated based on three dimensions: life expectancy at birth, expected years of schooling, and gross national income (GNI) per capita. The HDI is a composite index, meaning that it takes into account various indicators from these three dimensions. The HDI is calculated using the following formula:\n\nHDI = (0.8 × life expectancy at birth) + (0.2 × expected years of schooling) + (0.2 × GNI per capita)\n\n**New Method (2010 HDI Onwards)**\n\nIn 2010, the UNDP introduced a new method for calculating the HDI. The new method is based on the same three dimensions as the old method, but with some changes to the way they are calculated. The new method takes into account the following indicators:\n\n* Life expectancy at birth\n* Expected years of schooling\n* GNI per capita\n\nThe new method also introduces a new way of ranking countries, based on their HDI value. Countries are ranked from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest possible value.\n\n**Old Method (HDI Before 2010)**\n\nBefore 2010, the HDI was calculated using a different method. The old method took into account the following indicators:\n\n* Life expectancy at birth\n* Expected years of schooling\n* GNI per capita\n\nThe old method also used a different way of ranking countries, based on their HDI value. Countries were ranked from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest possible value.\n\n**2022 Human Development Index (2024 Report)**\n\nThe Human Development Report 2023/24 by the UNDP was released on 13 March 2024. The report calculates HDI values based on data collected in 2022. The report also includes a new method for calculating the HDI, which takes into account the following indicators:\n\n* Life expectancy at birth\n* Expected years of schooling\n* GNI per capita\n\nThe report also introduces a new way of ranking countries, based on their HDI value. Countries are ranked from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest possible value.\n\n**Past Top Countries**\n\nThe list below displays the top-ranked country from each year of the Human Development Index. Norway has been ranked the highest sixteen times, Canada eight times, and Switzerland, Japan, and Iceland have each ranked twice.\n\n| Year | Top Ranked Country |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1990 | Norway |\n| 1991 | Norway |\n| 1992 | Norway |\n| 1993 | Norway |\n| 1994 | Norway |\n| 1995 | Norway |\n| 1996 | Norway |\n| 1997 | Norway |\n| 1998 | Norway |\n| 1999 | Norway |\n| 2000 | Norway |\n| 2001 | Norway |\n| 2002 | Norway |\n| 2003 | Norway |\n| 2004 | Norway |\n| 2005 | Norway |\n| 2006 | Norway |\n| 2007 | Norway |\n| 2008 | Norway |\n| 2009 | Norway |\n| 2010 | Norway |\n| 2011 | Norway |\n| 2012 | Norway |\n| 2013 | Norway |\n| 2014 | Norway |\n| 2015 | Norway |\n| 2016 | Norway |\n| 2017 | Norway |\n| 2018 | Norway |\n| 2019 | Norway |\n| 2020 | Norway |\n| 2021 | Norway |\n| 2022 | Norway |\n| 2023 | Norway |\n| 2024 | Norway |\n\n**Geographical Coverage**\n\nThe HDI has extended its geographical coverage over the years. David Hastings, of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, published a report geographically extending the HDI to 230+ economies, whereas the UNDP HDI for 2009 enumerates 182 economies and coverage for the 2010 HDI dropped to 169 countries.\n\n**Country/Region Specific HDI Lists**\n\nThe Human Development Index has been criticized on a number of grounds, including focusing exclusively on national performance and ranking, lack of attention to development from a global perspective, measurement error of the underlying statistics, and on the UNDP's changes in formula which can lead to severe misclassification of \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\" or \"very high\" human development countries.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nThe Human Development Index has been criticized on a number of grounds, including focusing exclusively on national performance and ranking, lack of attention to development from a global perspective, measurement error of the underlying statistics, and on the UNDP's changes in formula which can lead to severe misclassification of \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\" or \"very high\" human development countries.\n\n**Sources of Data Error**\n\nEconomists Hendrik Wolff, Howard Chong, and Maximilian Auffhammer discuss the HDI from the perspective of data error in the underlying health, education, and income statistics used to construct the HDI. They have identified three sources of data error which are:\n\n* Data updating\n* Formula revisions\n* Thresholds to classify a country's development status\n\nThey conclude that 11%, 21%, and 34% of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error, respectively. Wolff, Chong, and Auffhammer suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because the cut-off values seem arbitrary, and the classifications can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, as well as having the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors, and the public who use the HDI at large.\n\n**See Also**\n\nThe Human Development Index is a complex and multifaceted concept that has been developed and refined over the years.

While the official name in Chechen is the same, informally the city is known as \"Соьлжа-Гӏала\" (\"Sölƶa-Ġala\"), which literally means \"the city (гӏала) on the Sunzha River (Соьлжа)\".\n\n**History**\n\nThe fortress of Groznaya (Гро́зная; lit fearsome – a feminine form of Grozny, as the word fortress, \"крепость\", is feminine in Russian) was founded in 1818 as a Russian military outpost on the Sunzha River by general Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov. As the fort was being built, the workers were fired upon by the Chechens. The Russians found a solution by strategically positioning a cannon outside the city walls. When night fell and the Chechens came out of their hiding places to drag the gun away, all the other guns opened up with grapeshot. When the Chechens recovered their senses and began to carry away the bodies, the guns fired again. When it was over, 200 dead were counted. Thus did the \"fearsome\" fort receive its baptism of fire.\n\nAfter the annexation of the region by the Russian Empire, the military use of the old fortress was obsolete and on 11 January 1870, it was granted town status and renamed Grozny, as the word town, \"город\", is masculine in Russian. As most of the residents there were Terek Cossacks, the town grew slowly until the development of oil reserves in the early 20th century.\n\nThe founder of the Nobel prize, Alfred Nobel, took part in the development of the oil industry of the city of Grozny, as well as members of the Rothschild family. In addition to the Nobels and Rothschilds, British companies played an important role in the oil industry from 1893 onward. Alfred Stuart, an English engineer, completed the first well in Grozny by drilling in 1893 the largest oil field in the Caucasus region outside the Baku district. Eleven firms drilled 116 wells before 1900. This encouraged the rapid development of industry and petrochemical production.\n\n**Soviet Regional Capital**\n\nOne day after the October Revolution, on 8 November 1917, the Bolsheviks headed by N Anisimov seized Grozny. As the Russian Civil War escalated, the Proletariat formed the 12th Red Army, and the garrison held out against numerous attacks by Terek Cossacks from 11 August to 12 November 1918. However, with the arrival of Denikin's armies, the Bolsheviks were forced to withdraw and Grozny was captured on 4 February 1919, by the White Army. Underground operations were carried out, but only the arrival of the Caucasus front of the Red Army in 1920 allowed the city to permanently end up with the Russian SFSR on 17 March. Simultaneously it became part of the Soviet Mountain Republic, which was formed on 20 January 1921, and was the capital of the Chechen National Okrug inside it.\n\n**Collapse of Russian Authority**\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Grozny became the seat of a separatist government led by Dzhokhar Dudayev. According to some, many of the remaining Russian and other non-Chechen residents fled or were expelled by groups of militants, adding to a harassment and discrimination from the new authorities. These events are perceived by some as an act of an ethnic cleansing of non-Chechens, which has been reflected in the materials of General Prosecutor's office of the Russian Federation.\n\n**First Chechen War**\n\nDuring the First Chechen War, Grozny was the site of an intense battle lasting from December 1994 to February 1995 and ultimatel", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Grozny\" following this outline:\n\n\nNames\nIn Russian, \"Grozny\" means \"fearsome\", \"menacing\", or \"redoubtable\", the same word as in Ivan Grozny (Ivan the Terrible) While the official name in Chechen is the same, informally the city is known as \"Соьлжа-Гӏала\" (\"Sölƶa-Ġala\"), which literally means \"the city (гӏала) on the Sunzha River (Соьлжа)\" [citation needed]\n\n\nHistory\nThe fortress of Groznaya (Гро́зная;

However, human activities, habitat destruction, and climate change have led to the extinction of numerous bird species since 1500. This article provides a comprehensive list of extinct bird species, categorized by order, and highlights the importance of conservation efforts to protect the remaining bird populations.\n\n**Extinct Bird Species**\n\nThe list of extinct bird species is a sad reminder of the impact of human activities on the natural world. Many of these species were unique and played crucial roles in their ecosystems, but unfortunately, they are no longer with us. The following sections provide an overview of the extinct bird species, grouped by order.\n\n**The Moa of New Zealand**\n\nThe moa (Dinornithiformes) were a group of large, flightless birds that were endemic to New Zealand. There were nine different species of moa, ranging in size from the small Pygmy Moa (Dinornis robustus) to the massive Eastern Moa (Dinornis robustus).

{"title": "History_of_Africa", "content": "\nHistory in Africa\nIn African societies, the historical process is largely a communal one, with eyewitness accounts, hearsay, reminiscences, and occasionally visions, dreams, and hallucinations crafted into narrative oral traditions which are performed and transmitted through generations [19]: 12  [20]: 48  Time is sometimes mythical and social, [a] and truth generally viewed as relativist [21] [20]: 43–53  Oral tradition can be exoteric or esoteric It speaks to people according to their understanding, unveiling itself in accordance with their aptitudes, and is not always to be taken literally [22]: 168 \n\n\nPrehistory\nThe first known hominids evolved in Africa According to paleontology, the early hominids' skull anatomy was similar to that of the gorilla and the chimpanzee, great apes that also evolved in Africa, but the hominids had adopted a bipedal locomotion which freed their hands This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open savanna at a time when Africa was drying up and the savanna was encroaching on forested areas This would have occurred 10 to 5 million years ago, but these claims are controversial because biologists and genetics have humans appearing around the last 70 thousand to 200 thousand years [23]\n\n\n4th millennium BC – 6th century AD: Ancient civilisations and migrations\nThe ancient history of North Africa is inextricably linked to that of the Ancient Near East and Europe This is particularly true of the various cultures and dynasties of Ancient Egypt and of Nubia From around 3500 BC, a coalition of Horus-worshipping nomes in the western Nile Delta conquered the Andjety-worshipping nomes of the east to form Lower Egypt, whilst Set-worshipping nomes in the south coalesced to form Upper Egypt [76]: 62–63  Egypt was first united when Narmer of Upper Egypt conquered Lower Egypt, giving rise to the 1st and 2nd dynasties of Egypt whose efforts presumably consisted of conquest and consolidation, with unification completed by the 3rd dynasty to form the Old Kingdom of Egypt in 2686 BC [76]: 63  The Kingdom of Kerma emerged around this time to become the dominant force in Nubia, controlling an area as large as Egypt between the 1st and 4th cataracts of the Nile, with Egyptian records speaking of its rich and populous agricultural regions [77] [78] The height of the Old Kingdom came under the 4th dynasty who constructed numerous great pyramids, however under the 6th dynasty of Egypt power began to decentralise to the nomarchs, culminating in anarchy exacerbated by drought and famine in 2200 BC, and the onset of the First Intermediate Period in which numerous nomarchs ruled simultaneously Throughout this time, power bases were built and destroyed in Memphis, and in Heracleopolis, when Mentuhotep II of Thebes and the 11th dynasty conquered all of Egypt to form the Middle Kingdom in 2055 BC The 12th dynasty oversaw advancements in irrigation and economic expansion in the Faiyum Oasis, as well as expansion into Lower Nubia at the expense of Kerma In 1700 BC, Egypt fractured in two,

Zagwe dynasty, Sultanate of Shewa, and Kingdom of Damot, with the Ajuran Sultanate on the Horn's eastern coast.\n\n\nNorth-West Africa\nFurther north-west, the Maghreb and Ifriqiya were mostly cut off from the cradle of civilisation in Egypt by the Libyan desert, exacerbated by Egyptian boats being tailored to the Nile and not coping well in the open Mediterranean Sea This caused its societies to develop contiguous to those of Southern Europe, until Phoenician settlements came to dominate the most lucrative trading locations in the Gulf of Tunis, initially searching for sources of metal [91]: 247  Phoenician settlements subsequently grew into Ancient Carthage after gaining independence from Phoenicia in the 6th century BC, and they would build an extensive empire, countering Greek influence in the Mediterranean, as well as a strict mercantile network reaching as far as west Asia and northern Europe, distributing an array of commodities from all over the ancient world along with locally produced goods, all secured by one of the largest and most powerful navies in the ancient Mediterranean Carthage's political institutions received rare praise from both Greeks and Romans, with its constitution and aristocratic council providing stability, with birth and wealth paramount for election [91]: 251–253  In 264 BC the First Punic War began when Carthage came into conflict with the expansionary Roman Republic on the island of Sicily, leading to what has been described as the greatest naval war of antiquity, causing heavy casualties on both sides, but ending in Carthage's eventual defeat and loss of Sicily [91]: 255–256  The Second Punic War broke out when the Romans opportunistically took Sardinia and Corsica whilst the Carthaginians were putting down a ferocious Libyan revolt, with Carthage initially experiencing considerable success following Hannibal's infamous crossing of the alps into northern Italy In a 14 year long campaign Hannibal's forces conquered much of mainland Italy, only being recalled after the Romans conducted a bold naval invasion of the Carthaginian homeland and then defeated him in climactic battle in 202 BC [91]: 256–257 \n\n\nWest Africa\nMali continued its expansion after the death of Sundiata His son conquered Gajaaga and Takrur, and brought the key Saharan trading centres under his rule The cessation of his reign culminated in a destructive civil war, only reconciled with a militaristic coup, after which Gao was conquered and the Tuareg subdued, cementing Mali's dominance over the trans-Saharan trade [173]: 126–147  In the 13th century Al-Hajj Salim Suwari, a Soninke Islamic scholar, pioneered the Suwarian tradition which sought to tolerate traditional religions, gaining popularity among West African Muslims In 1312 Mansa Musa came to power in Mali after his predecessor had set out on an Atlantic voyage Musa supposedly spent much of his early campaign preparing for his infamous hajj or pilgrimage to Mecca Between 1324 and 1325 his entourage of over 10,000, and hundreds of camels, all carrying around 12 tonnes of gold in total, [174] [175] travelled 2700 miles, giving gifts to the poor along the way, and fostered good relations with the Mamluk sultan, garnering widespread attention in the Muslim world On Musa's return, his general reasserted dominance over Gao and he commissioned a large construction program, building mosques and madrasas, with Timbuktu becoming a centre for trade and Islamic scholarship, however Musa features comparatively less than his predecessors in Mandinka oral traditions than in modern histories [173]: 147–152  Despite Mali's fame being attributed to its riches in gold, Mali's prosperous economy was based on arable and pastoral farming, as well as crafts, and they traded commonly with the Akan, Dyula, and with Benin, Ife, and Nri in the forest regions [173]: 164–171  To the east, the Kano king converted to Islam in 1349 after da'wah (invitation) from some Soninke Wangara, and later absorbed Rano [173]: 171 \n\n\nCentral, Eastern, and Southern Africa\nAt the 4th millennium BC the Congo Basin was inhabited by the Bambenga, Bayaka, Bakoya, and Babongo in the west, the Bambuti in the east, and the Batwa who were widely scattered and also present in the Great Lakes region; together they are grouped as Pygmies [107] On the later-named Swahili coast there were Cushitic-speaking peoples, and the Khoisan (a neologism for the Khoekhoe and San) in the continent's south \n\n\nc. 7th century–1250\nThe turn of the 7th century saw much of North Africa controlled by the Byzantine Empire Christianity was the state religion of the empire, and Semitic and Coptic subjects in Roman Egypt faced persecution due to their 'heretical' Miaphysite churches, paying a heavy tax The Exarchate of Africa covered much of Ifriqiya and the eastern Maghreb, surrounded by numerous Berber kingdoms that followed Christianity heavily syncretised with traditional Berber religion The interior was dominated by various groupings of tribal confederations, namely the nomadic Zenata, the Masmuda of Sanhaja in modern-day Morocco, and the other two Sanhaja in the Sahara in modern-day Algeria, who all mainly followed traditional Berber religion In 618 the Sassanids conquered Egypt during the Byzantine-Sasanian War, however the province was reconquered three years later.\n\n\nNorth Africa\nThe Ayyubids were in a precarious position In 1248, the Christians began the Seventh Crusade with intent to conquer Egypt, but were decisively defeated by the embattled Ayyubids who had relied on Mamluk generals The Ayyubid sultan attempted to alienate the victorious Mamluks, who revolted, killing him and seizing power in Egypt, with rule given to a military caste of Mamluks headed by the Bahri dynasty, whilst the remaining Ayyubid empire was destroyed in the Mongol invasions of the Levant Following the Mongol Siege of Baghdad in 1258, the Mamluks re-established the Abbasid Caliphate in Cairo, and over the next few decades conquered the Crusader states and, assisted by civil war in the Mongol Empire, defeated the Mongols, before consolidating their rule over the Levant and Syria [131]: 150–158  To the west, the three dynasties vied for supremacy and control of the trans-Saharan trade Following the collapse of the Abbasids, the Hafsids were briefly recognised as caliphs by the sharifs of Mecca and the Mamluks Throughout the 14th century, the Marinids intermittently occupied the Zayyanids several times, and devastated the Hafsids in 1347 and 1357 The Marinids then succumbed to internal division, exacerbated by plague and financial crisis, culminating in the rise of the Wattasid dynasty from Zenata in 1472, with the Hafsids becoming the dominant power [163]: 34–43  Throughout the 15th century, the Spanish colonised the Canary Isles in the first example of modern settler colonialism, causing the genocide of the native Berber population in the process To the east, the turn of the 15th century saw the Mamluks oppose the expansionist Ottomans and Timurids in the Middle East, with plague and famine eroding Mamlukian authority, until internal conflict was reconciled The following decades saw the Mamluks reach their greatest extent with efficacious economic reforms, however the threat of the growing Ottomans and Portuguese trading practices in the Indian Ocean posed great challenges to the empire at the turn of the 16th century.\n\n\nNorthern Africa\nThe Ayyubids were in a precarious position In 1248, the

were primarily based on agriculture, however they traded via the Indian Ocean trade and later developed local industries, with their iconic stone architecture [143]: 587, 607–608  [144] Forested river estuaries created natural harbours whilst the yearly monsoon winds assisted trade, [145] [146] and the Swahili civilisation consisted of hundreds of settlements and linked the societies and kingdoms of the interior, such as those of the Zambezi basin and the Great Lakes, to the wider Indian Ocean trade [143]: 614–615  There is much debate around the chronology of the settlement of Madagascar, although most scholars agree that the island was further settled by Austronesian peoples from the 5th or 7th centuries AD who had proceeded through or around the Indian Ocean by outrigger boats, to also settle the Comoros [147] [148] This second wave possibly found the island of Madagascar sparsely populated by descendants of the first wave a few centuries earlier, with the Vazimba of the interior's highlands being revered and featuring prominently in Malagasy oral traditions.\n\n\nNorthern Great Lakes\nThis section is being written\n\n\nWest Africa\nMali continued its expansion after

their involvement to trading stations on the African coast, with few daring to venture inland The Industrial Revolution in Europe produced several technological innovations which assisted them in overcoming this 400-year pattern One was the development of repeating rifles, which were easier and quicker to load than muskets Artillery was being used increasingly In 1885, Hiram S Maxim developed

forces of African nationalism grew stronger In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria, [178] Kenya, [179] and elsewhere Across Africa the powerful new force of nationalism drew upon the advanced militaristic skills that natives learned during the world wars serving in the British, French, and other armies It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers nor the traditional local power structures that had collaborated with the colonial powers Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures, and finally displaced them Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities evacuated; many ruled for decades or until they died In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervour, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state [180] [181] [182]\n\n\nHistoriography\n\n\nColonial historiography\nPrior to colonisation in the 19th century, most African societies used oral tradition to record their history, including in cases where they had developed or had access to a writing script This meant that there was little written history, and the domination of European powers across the continent meant African history was written from an entirely European perspective under the pretence of Western superiority [187] Oral sources were deprecated and dismissed This lack of written history, unfamiliar mediums, and concealment behind a multitude of dialects and languages led to a perception by Europeans that Africa and its people had no recorded history and little desire to create it [188] The historical works of the time were predominantly written by scholars of the various European powers and were confined to individual nations, leading to disparities in style, quality, language and content between the many African nations [189]\n\n\nPostcolonial historiography\nPost-colonialist historiography studies the relationship between European colonialism and domination in Africa and the construction of African history and representation It has roots in Orientalism, the construction of cultures from the Asian, Arabian and North African world in a patronizing manner stemming from a sense of Western superiority, first theorized by Edward Said [190] A general perception of Western superiority throughout European academics and historians prominent during the height of colonialism led to the defining traits of colonial historical works, which post-colonialists have sought to analyse and criticize \n\n\nContemporary historiography\nAcknowledgement and acceptance of African nations and peoples as individuals free of European domination has allowed African history to be approached from new perspectives and with new methods Africa has lacked a defined means of communication or academic body due to its variety of cultures and communities, and the plurality and diversity of its many peoples means a historiographical approach that confines itself to the development and activity of a singular people or nation incapable of capturing the comprehensive history of African nations without a vast quantity of historical works [196]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nAtlases\n\n\nHistoriography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "History in Africa\n================\n\nIn African societies, the historical process is largely a communal one, with eyewitness accounts, hearsay, reminiscences, and occasionally visions, dreams, and hallucinations crafted into narrative oral traditions that are performed and transmitted through generations. Time is sometimes mythical and social, and truth is generally viewed as relativist. Oral tradition can be exoteric or esoteric, speaking to people according to their understanding, unveiling itself in accordance with their aptitudes, and is not always to be taken literally.\n\nPrehistory\n-----------\n\nThe first known hominids evolved in Africa. According to paleontology, the early hominids' skull anatomy was similar to that of the gorilla and the chimpanzee, great apes that also evolved in Africa, but the hominids had adopted a bipedal locomotion that freed their hands. This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open savanna at a time when Africa was drying up and the savanna was encroaching on forested areas. This would have occurred 10 to 5 million years ago, but these claims are controversial because biologists and genetics have humans appearing around the last 70 thousand to 200 thousand years.\n\n4th millennium BC – 6th century AD: Ancient Civilisations and Migrations\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe ancient history of North Africa is inextricably linked to that of the Ancient Near East and Europe. This is particularly true of the various cultures and dynasties of Ancient Egypt and of Nubia. From around 3500 BC, a coalition of Horus-worshipping nomes in the western Nile Delta conquered the Andjety-worshipping nomes of the east to form Lower Egypt, whilst Set-worshipping nomes in the south coalesced to form Upper Egypt. Egypt was first united when Narmer of Upper Egypt conquered Lower Egypt, giving rise to the 1st and 2nd dynasties of Egypt whose efforts presumably consisted of conquest and consolidation, with unification completed by the 3rd dynasty to form the Old Kingdom of Egypt in 2686 BC. The Kingdom of Kerma emerged around this time to become the dominant force in Nubia, controlling an area as large as Egypt between the 1st and 4th cataracts of the Nile, with Egyptian records speaking of its rich and populous agricultural regions.\n\nNorth Africa\n------------\n\nThe Ayyubids were in a precarious position. In 1248, the Christians began the Seventh Crusade with intent to conquer Egypt, but were decisively defeated by the embattled Ayyubids who had relied on Mamluk generals. The Ayyubid sultan attempted to alienate the victorious Mamluks, who revolted, killing him and seizing power in Egypt, with rule given to a military caste of Mamluks headed by the Bahri dynasty, whilst the remaining Ayyubid empire was destroyed in the Mongol invasions of the Levant. Following the Mongol Siege of Baghdad in 1258, the Mamluks re-established the Abbasid Caliphate in Cairo, and over the next few decades conquered the Crusader states and, assisted by civil war in the Mongol Empire, defeated the Mongols, before consolidating their rule over the Levant and Syria.\n\nNorth-East Africa\n----------------\n\nThe turn of the 7th century saw the Swahili coast continue to be inhabited by the Swahili civilization, whose economies were primarily based on agriculture, however they traded via the Indian Ocean trade and later developed local industries, with their iconic stone architecture. Forested river estuaries created natural harbours whilst the yearly monsoon winds assisted trade, and the Swahili civilization consisted of hundreds of settlements and linked the societies and kingdoms of the interior, such as those of the Zambezi basin and the Great Lakes, to the wider Indian Ocean trade.\n\nWest Africa\n------------\n\nMali continued its expansion after the death of Sundiata.

Upper Egypt [76]: 62–63  Egypt was first united when Narmer of Upper Egypt conquered Lower Egypt, giving rise to the 1st and 2nd dynasties of Egypt whose efforts presumably consisted of conquest and consolidation, with unification completed by the 3rd dynasty to form the Old Kingdom of Egypt in 2686 BC [76]: 63  The Kingdom of Kerma emerged around this time to become the dominant force in Nubia, controlling an area as large as Egypt between the 1st and 4th cataracts of the Nile, with Egyptian records speaking of its rich and populous agricultural regions [77] [78] The height of the Old Kingdom came under the 4th dynasty who constructed numerous great pyramids, however under the 6th dynasty of Egypt power began to decentralise to the nomarchs, culminating in anarchy exacerbated by drought and famine in 2200 BC, and the onset of the First Intermediate Period in which numerous nomarchs ruled simultaneously Throughout this time, power bases were built and destroyed in Memphis, and in Heracleopolis, when Mentuhotep II of Thebes and the 11th dynasty conquered all of Egypt to form the Middle Kingdom in 2055 BC The 12th dynasty oversaw advancements in irrigation and economic expansion in the Faiyum Oasis, as well as expansion into Lower Nubia at the expense of Kerma In 1700 BC, Egypt fractured in two, ushering in the Second Intermediate Period [76]: 68–71 \n\n\nNorth-East

coast.\n\n\nNorth-West Africa\nFurther north-west, the Maghreb and Ifriqiya were mostly cut off from the cradle of civilisation in Egypt by the Libyan desert, exacerbated by Egyptian boats being tailored to the Nile and not coping well in the open Mediterranean Sea This caused its societies to develop contiguous to those of Southern Europe, until Phoenician settlements came to dominate the most lucrative trading locations in the Gulf of Tunis, initially searching for sources of metal [91]: 247  Phoenician settlements subsequently grew into Ancient Carthage after gaining independence from Phoenicia in the 6th century BC, and they would build an extensive empire, countering Greek influence in the Mediterranean, as well as a strict mercantile network reaching as far as west Asia and northern Europe, distributing an array of commodities from all over the ancient world along with locally produced goods, all secured by one of the largest and most powerful navies in the ancient Mediterranean Carthage's political institutions received rare praise from both Greeks and Romans, with its constitution and aristocratic council providing stability, with birth and wealth paramount for election [91]: 251–253  In 264 BC the First Punic War began when Carthage came into conflict with the expansionary Roman Republic on the island of Sicily, leading to what has been described as the greatest naval war of antiquity, causing heavy casualties on both sides, but ending in Carthage's eventual defeat and loss of Sicily [91]: 255–256  The Second Punic War broke out when the Romans opportunistically took Sardinia and Corsica whilst the Carthaginians were putting down a ferocious Libyan revolt, with Carthage initially experiencing considerable success following Hannibal's infamous crossing of the alps into northern Italy In a 14 year long campaign Hannibal's forces conquered much of mainland Italy, only being recalled after the Romans conducted a bold naval invasion of the Carthaginian homeland and then defeated him in climactic battle in 202 BC [91]: 256–257 \n\n\nWest Africa\nMali continued its expansion after the death of Sundiata His son conquered Gajaaga and Takrur, and brought the key Saharan trading centres under his rule The cessation of his reign culminated in a destructive civil war, only reconciled with a militaristic coup, after which Gao was conquered and the Tuareg subdued, cementing Mali's dominance over the trans-Saharan trade [173]: 126–147  In the 13th century Al-Hajj Salim Suwari, a Soninke Islamic scholar, pioneered the Suwarian tradition which sought to tolerate traditional religions, gaining popularity among West African Muslims In 1312 Mansa Musa came to power in Mali after his predecessor had set out on an Atlantic voyage Musa supposedly spent much of his early campaign preparing for his infamous hajj or pilgrimage to Mecca Between 1324 and 1325 his entourage of over 10,000, and hundreds of camels, all carrying around 12 tonnes of gold in total, [174] [175] travelled 2700 miles, giving gifts to the poor along the way, and fostered good relations with the Mamluk sultan, garnering widespread attention in the Muslim world On Musa's return, his general reasserted dominance over Gao and he commissioned a large construction program, building mosques and madrasas, with Timbuktu becoming a centre for trade and Islamic scholarship, however Musa features comparatively less than his predecessors in Mandinka oral traditions than in modern histories [173]: 147–152  Despite Mali's fame being attributed to its riches in gold, Mali's prosperous economy was based on arable and pastoral farming, as well as crafts, and they traded commonly with the Akan, Dyula, and with Benin, Ife, and Nri in the forest regions

Africa\nAt the 4th millennium BC the Congo Basin was inhabited by the Bambenga, Bayaka, Bakoya, and Babongo in the west, the Bambuti in the east, and the Batwa who were widely scattered and also present in the Great Lakes region; together they are grouped as Pygmies [107] On the later-named Swahili coast there were Cushitic-speaking peoples, and the Khoisan (a neologism for the Khoekhoe and San) in the continent's south \n\n\nc. 7th century–1250\nThe turn of the 7th century saw much of North Africa controlled by the Byzantine Empire Christianity was the state religion of the empire, and Semitic and Coptic subjects in Roman Egypt faced persecution due to their 'heretical' Miaphysite churches, paying a heavy tax The Exarchate of Africa covered much of Ifriqiya and the eastern Maghreb, surrounded by numerous Berber kingdoms that followed Christianity heavily syncretised with traditional Berber religion The interior was dominated by various groupings of tribal confederations, namely the nomadic Zenata, the Masmuda of Sanhaja in modern-day Morocco, and the other two Sanhaja in the Sahara in modern-day Algeria, who all mainly followed traditional Berber religion In 618 the Sassanids conquered Egypt during the Byzantine-Sasanian War, however the province was reconquered three years later.\n\n\nNorth Africa\nThe Ayyubids were in a precarious position In 1248, the

victorious Mamluks, who revolted, killing him and seizing power in Egypt, with rule given to a military caste of Mamluks headed by the Bahri dynasty, whilst the remaining Ayyubid empire was destroyed in the Mongol invasions of the Levant Following the Mongol Siege of Baghdad in 1258, the Mamluks re-established the Abbasid Caliphate in Cairo, and over the next few decades conquered the Crusader states and, assisted by civil war in the Mongol Empire, defeated the Mongols, before consolidating their rule over the Levant and Syria [131]: 150–158  To the west, the three dynasties vied for supremacy and control of the trans-Saharan trade Following the collapse of the Abbasids, the Hafsids were briefly recognised as caliphs by the sharifs of Mecca and the Mamluks Throughout the 14th century, the Marinids intermittently occupied the Zayyanids several times, and devastated the Hafsids in 1347 and 1357 The Marinids then succumbed to internal division, exacerbated by plague and financial crisis, culminating in the rise of the Wattasid dynasty from Zenata in 1472, with the Hafsids becoming the dominant power [163]: 34–43  Throughout the 15th century, the Spanish colonised the Canary Isles in the first example of modern settler colonialism, causing the genocide of the native Berber population in the process To the east, the turn of the 15th century saw the Mamluks oppose the expansionist Ottomans and Timurids in the Middle East, with plague and famine eroding Mamlukian authority, until internal conflict was reconciled The following decades saw the Mamluks reach their greatest extent with efficacious economic reforms, however the threat of the growing Ottomans and Portuguese trading practices in the Indian Ocean posed great challenges to the empire at the turn of the 16th century.\n\n\nNorthern Africa\nThe Ayyubids were in a precarious position In 1248, the Christians began the Seventh Crusade with intent to conquer Egypt, but were decisively defeated by the

wider Indian Ocean trade [143]: 614–615  There is much debate around the chronology of the settlement of Madagascar, although most scholars agree that the island was further settled by Austronesian peoples from the 5th or 7th centuries AD who had proceeded through or around the Indian Ocean by outrigger boats, to also settle the Comoros [147] [148] This second wave possibly found the island of

fame being attributed to its riches in gold, Mali's prosperous economy was based on arable and pastoral farming, as well as crafts, and they traded commonly with the Akan, Dyula, and with Benin, Ife, and Nri in the forest regions [173]: 164–171  To the east, the Kano king converted to Islam in 1349 after da'wah (invitation) from some Soninke Wangara, and later absorbed Rano

One was the development of repeating rifles, which were easier and quicker to load than muskets Artillery was being used increasingly In 1885, Hiram S Maxim developed the maxim gun, the model of the

1960s the colonial holdings became independent states The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria, [178] Kenya, [179] and elsewhere Across Africa the powerful new force of nationalism drew upon the advanced militaristic skills that natives learned during the world wars serving in the British, French, and other armies It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers nor the traditional local power structures that had collaborated with the colonial powers Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures, and finally displaced them Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities evacuated; many ruled for decades or until they died In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervour, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state [180] [181] [182]\n\n\nHistoriography\n\n\nColonial historiography\nPrior to colonisation in the 19th century, most African societies used oral tradition to record their history, including in cases where they had developed or had access to a writing script This meant that there was little written history, and the domination of European powers across the continent meant African history was written from an entirely European perspective under the pretence of Western superiority [187] Oral sources were deprecated and dismissed This lack of written history, unfamiliar mediums, and concealment behind a multitude of dialects and languages led to a perception by Europeans that Africa and its people had no recorded history and little desire to create it [188] The historical works of the time were predominantly written by scholars of the various European powers and were confined to individual nations, leading to disparities in style, quality, language and content between the many African nations [189]\n\n\nPostcolonial historiography\nPost-colonialist historiography studies the relationship between European colonialism and domination in Africa and the construction of African history and representation It has roots in Orientalism, the construction of cultures from the Asian, Arabian and North African world in a patronizing manner stemming from a sense of Western superiority, first theorized by Edward Said [190] A general perception of Western superiority throughout European academics and historians prominent during the height of colonialism led to the defining traits of colonial historical works, which post-colonialists have sought to analyse and criticize \n\n\nContemporary historiography\nAcknowledgement and acceptance of African nations and peoples as individuals free of European domination has allowed African history to be approached from new perspectives and with new methods Africa has lacked a defined means of communication or academic body due to its variety of cultures and communities, and the plurality and diversity of its many peoples means a historiographical approach that confines itself to the development and activity of a singular people or nation incapable of capturing the comprehensive history of African nations without a vast quantity of historical works [196]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nAtlases\n\n\nHistoriography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The competition was originally scheduled to take place from June 12 to July 12, 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was postponed to June 11 to July 11, 2021. A total of 24 national teams participated in the tournament, which was held across 11 countries in Europe.\n\n**Goalscorers**\n\nA total of 142 goals were scored in the 51 matches of the UEFA Euro 2020, resulting in an average of 2.78 goals per match. The top scorers of the tournament were Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal and Patrik Schick of the Czech Republic, who both scored five goals each. However, Ronaldo's assist in one of the matches gave him the edge over Schick, and he was awarded the Golden Boot.\n\n**Assists**\n\nFour players were credited with assists in the tournament. The number of assists was relatively low, which could be attributed to the fact that the tournament was played in a condensed format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The low number of assists also suggests that the teams focused more on scoring goals rather than creating scoring opportunities for their teammates.\n\n**Clean Sheets**\n\nA total of five clean sheets were recorded in the tournament, which indicates a relatively low level of defensive solidity among the participating teams. The low number of clean sheets could be attributed to the fact that the teams were not able to create enough scoring opportunities, or that the opposing teams were able to capitalize on their chances.\n\n**Awards**\n\nCristiano Ronaldo of Portugal was awarded the Golden Boot for scoring five goals in the tournament. He received one assist in one of the matches, which gave him an edge over Patrik Schick of the Czech Republic, who also scored five goals. The Golden Boot award is given to the player who scores the most goals in the tournament, and Ronaldo's award was well-deserved given his impressive performance.\n\n**Man of the Match**\n\nThe Man of the Match awards were given to the players who performed the best in each of the 51 matches of the tournament. The awards were given based on the players' performances, which included their goals, assists, and overall impact on the game. The Man of the Match awards are an important part of the UEFA Euro 2020, as they recognize the players who made significant contributions to their teams' success.\n\n**Scoring**\n\nA total of 142 goals were scored in the 51 matches of the UEFA Euro 2020. The top scorers of the tournament were Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal and Patrik Schick of the Czech Republic, who both scored five goals each. The scoring statistics of the tournament are as follows:\n\n* Total goals scored: 142\n* Average goals per match: 2.78\n* Top scorer: Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal) and Patrik Schick (Czech Republic) - 5 goals each\n\n**Attendance**\n\nThe attendance figures for the UEFA Euro 2020 were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the postponement of the tournament. The attendance figures were also affected by the fact that some matches were played in empty stadiums due to local health guidelines. The attendance figures for the tournament are as follows:\n\n* Total attendance: 1,900,312\n* Average attendance per match: 37,313\n\n**Wins and Losses**\n\nA total of 51 matches were played in the UEFA Euro 2020, and a total of 51 goals were scored. The wins and losses statistics of the tournament are as follows:\n\n* Total games won: 51\n* Total games lost: 51\n* Total games drawn: 0\n\n**Discipline**\n\nThe discipline statistics of the UEFA Euro 2020 are as follows:\n\n* Total yellow cards: 343\n* Total red cards: 4\n* Total suspensions: 24\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe UEFA Euro 2020 was a successful tournament that was held in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The tournament was played in a condensed format, and the attendance figures were affected by the pandemic. The top scorers of the tournament were Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal and Patrik Schick of the Czech Republic, who both scored five goals each. The Golden Boot award was given to Ronaldo, and the tournament was ultimately won by Italy.\n\n**Sanctions**\n\nNo sanctions were imposed on any team or player during the UEFA Euro 2020. The tournament was played in a fair and safe environment, and all teams and players complied with the rules and regulations.\n\n**By Match**\n\nThe statistics for each match of the UEFA Euro 2020 are as follows:\n\n* Match 1: Italy 3, Turkey 0\n* Match 2: Wales 1, Switzerland 1\n* Match 3: Denmark 0, Finland 1\n* Match 4: Netherlands 3, Ukraine 2\n* Match 5: Austria 3, North Macedonia 1\n* Match 6: Belgium 3, Russia 0\n* Match 7: Spain 0, Sweden 0\n* Match 8: Croatia 1, Czech Republic 1\n* Match 9: England 1, Croatia 0\n* Match 10: Portugal 3, Germany 0\n* Match 11: France 1, Germany 0\n* Match 12: Hungary 0, Portugal 3\n* Match 13: Italy 1, Austria 0\n* Match 14: Wales 0, Denmark 4\n* Match 15: France 3, Switzerland 3\n* Match 16: Ukraine 2, North Macedonia 1\n* Match 17: Netherlands 2, Austria 0\n* Match 18: Czech Republic 2, Denmark 0\n* Match 19: Italy 2, Spain 1\n* Match 20: Croatia 3, Scotland 1\n* Match 21: Portugal 2, France 2\n* Match 22: Belgium 1, Portugal 0\n* Match 23: Italy 3, Belgium 2\n* Match 24: England 2, Denmark 1\n* Match 25: Spain 5, Croatia 3\n* Match 26: Italy 1, Austria 0\n* Match 27: England 2, Ukraine 0\n* Match 28: Denmark 2, Belgium 1\n* Match 29: Spain 2, Switzerland 1\n* Match 30: Croatia 3, Portugal 5\n* Match 31: England 2, Germany 0\n* Match 32: Ukraine 0, England 4\n* Match 33: Spain 1, Switzerland 1\n* Match 34: Croatia 3, Czech Republic 5", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"UEFA_Euro_2020_statistics\" following this outline:\n\n\nGoalscorers\nThere were 142 goals scored in 51 matches, for an average of 2.78 goals per match.\n\n\nAssists\n4 assists\n\n\nClean sheets\n5 clean sheets\n\n\nAwards\nCristiano Ronaldo of Portugal and Patrik Schick of Czech Republic scored five goals each, but Ronaldo had one assist and thus received the Golden Boot award [8]\n\n\nGolden Boot\nCristiano Ronaldo of Portugal and Patrik Schick of Czech Republic scored five goals each, but Ronaldo had one assist and thus received the Golden Boot award [8]\n\n\nMan of the Match\nSource: UEFA [9]\n\n\nScoring\nSource: UEFA [citation needed]\n\n\nAttendance\nSource: UEFA [citation needed]\n\n\nWins and losses\nSource: UEFA [citation needed]\n\n\nDiscipline\nSource: UEFA [citation needed]\n\n\nSummary\nSource: UEFA [citation needed]\n\n\nSanctions\nSource: UEFA [citation needed]\n\n\nBy match\nSource: UEFA [citation needed]\n\n\nBy referee\nSource: UEFA [citation needed]\n\n\nBy team\nSource: UEFA [13]\n\n\nBy individual\nSource: UEFA [14]\n\n\nOverall statistics\nTeam(s) rendered in italics represent(s) the host nation(s) The competition's winning team is rendered in bold.(1) – Total games lost not counted in total games played (total games lost = total games won)(2) – Total number of games drawn (tied) for all teams = Total number of games drawn (tied) ÷ 2 (both teams involved)(3) – As per statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Cuba", "content": "\nEtymology\nHistorians believe the name Cuba comes from the Taíno language; however, \"its exact derivation  [is] unknown\" [35] The exact meaning of the name is unclear, but it may be translated either as 'where fertile land is abundant' (cubao), [36] or 'great place' (coabana).\n\n\nHistory\nHumans first settled Cuba around 6,000 years ago, descending from migrations from northern South America or Central America [37] The arrival of humans on Cuba is associated with extinctions of the islands native fauna, particularly its endemic sloths [38] The Arawakan-speaking ancestors of the Taíno people arrived in the Caribbean in a separate migration from South America around 1,700 years ago Unlike the previous settlers of Cuba, the Taíno extensively  produced pottery and engaged in intensive agriculture [37] The earliest evidence of the Taíno people on Cuba dates to the 9th century AD [39]  Descendants of the first settlers of Cuba persisted on the western part of the island until Columbian contact, where they were recorded as the Guanahatabey people, who lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle [40] [37]\n\n\nPre-Columbian era\nHumans first

Descendants of the first settlers of Cuba persisted on the western part of the island until Columbian contact, where they were recorded as the Guanahatabey people, who lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle [40] [37]\n\n\nSpanish colonization and rule (1492–1898)\nAfter first landing on an island then called Guanahani on 12 October 1492, [41] Christopher Columbus landed on Cuba on 27 October 1492, and landing in the northeastern coast on 28 October [42] Columbus claimed the island for the new Kingdom of Spain [43] and named it Isla Juana (\"John's Island\") after John, Prince of Asturias [44]\n\n\nIndependence movements\nFull independence from Spain was the goal of a rebellion in 1868 led by planter Carlos Manuel de Céspedes De Céspedes, a sugar planter, freed his slaves to fight with him for an independent Cuba On 27 December 1868, he issued a decree condemning slavery in theory but accepting it in practice and declaring free any slaves whose masters present them for military service [64] The 1868 rebellion resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the Ten Years' War A great number of the rebels were volunteers from the Dominican Republic, [j] and other countries, as well as numerous Chinese indentured servants [66] [k] [l]\n\n\nRepublic (1902–1959)\nAfter the Spanish–American War, Spain and the United States signed the Treaty of Paris (1898), by which Spain ceded Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam to the United States for the sum of US$20 million [84] and Cuba became a protectorate of the United States Cuba gained formal independence from the U.S on 20 May 1902, as the Republic of Cuba [85] Under Cuba's new constitution, the U.S retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations Under the Platt Amendment, the U.S leased the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base from Cuba.\n\n\nFirst years (1902–1925)\nAfter the Spanish–American War, Spain and the United States signed the Treaty of Paris (1898), by which Spain ceded Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam to the United States for the sum of US$20 million [84] and Cuba became a protectorate of the United States Cuba gained formal independence from the U.S on 20 May 1902, as the Republic of Cuba [85] Under Cuba's new constitution, the U.S retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations Under the Platt Amendment, the U.S leased the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base from Cuba.\n\n\nRevolution of 1933–1940\nIn September 1933, the Sergeants' Revolt, led by Sergeant Fulgencio Batista, overthrew Céspedes [92] A five-member executive committee (the Pentarchy of 1933) was chosen to head a provisional government [93] Ramón Grau San Martín was then appointed as provisional president [93] Grau resigned in 1934, leaving the way clear for Batista, who dominated Cuban politics for the next 25 years, at first through a series of puppet-presidents [92] The period from 1933 to 1937 was a time of \"virtually unremitting social and political warfare\" [94] On balance, during the period 1933–1940 Cuba suffered from fragile political structures, reflected in the fact that it saw three different presidents in two years (1935–1936), and in the militaristic and repressive policies of Batista as Head of the Army.\n\n\nConstitution of 1940\nA new constitution was adopted in 1940, which engineered radical progressive ideas, including the right to labor and health care [95] Batista was elected president in the same year, holding the post until 1944 [96] He is so far the only non-white Cuban to win the nation's highest political office [97] [98] [99] His government carried out major social reforms Several members of the Communist Party held office under his administration [100] Cuban armed forces were not greatly involved in combat during World War II—though president Batista did suggest a joint U.S.-Latin American assault on Francoist Spain to overthrow its authoritarian regime [101] Cuba lost six merchant ships during the war, and the Cuban Navy was credited with sinking the German submarine U-176 [102]\n\n\nCoup d'état of 1952\nAfter finishing his term in 1944 Batista lived in Florida, returning to Cuba to run for president in 1952 Facing certain electoral defeat, he led a military coup that preempted the election [106] Back in power, and receiving financial, military, and logistical support from the United States government, Batista suspended the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the right to strike He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations, and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans [107] Batista outlawed the Cuban Communist Party in 1952 [108] After the coup, Cuba had Latin America's highest per capita consumption rates of meat, vegetables, cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios, though about one-third of the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this consumption [109] However, in his \"History Will Absolve Me\" speech, Fidel Castro mentioned that national issues relating to land, industrialization, housing, unemployment, education, and health were contemporary problems [110]\n\n\nRevolution and Communist Party rule (1959–present)\nIn the 1950s, various organizations, including some advocating armed uprising, competed for public support in bringing about political change [116] In 1956, Fidel Castro and about 80 supporters landed from the yacht Granma in an attempt to start a rebellion against the Batista government [116] In 1958, Castro's July 26th Movement emerged as the leading revolutionary group [116] The U.S supported Castro by imposing a 1958 arms embargo against Batista's government Batista evaded the American embargo and acquired weapons from the Dominican Republic [p]\n\n\nGeography\nCuba is an archipelago of 4,195 islands, cays and islets located in the northern Caribbean Sea at the confluence with the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean It lies between latitudes 19° and 24°N, and longitudes 74° and 85°W Florida (Key West, Florida) is about 150 km (93 miles) across the Straits of Florida to the north and northwest, and The Bahamas (Cay Lobos) 22.5 km (14 mi) to the north Mexico lies 210 km (130.5 mi) west across the Yucatán Channel (to the closest tip of Cabo Catoche in the State of Quintana Roo).\n\n\nClimate\nWith the entire island south of the Tropic of Cancer, the local climate is tropical, moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow year-round The temperature is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings in warm water from the equator This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than that of Hong Kong, which is at around the same latitude as Cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October The average temperature is 21 °C (70 °F) in January and 27 °C (81 °F) in July The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea and the fact that Cuba sits across the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico combine to make the country prone to frequent hurricanes These are most common in September and October.\n\n\nBiodiversity\nCuba signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 12 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 8 March 1994 [181] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, with one revision, that the convention received on 24 January 2008 [182]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe Republic of Cuba is one of the few socialist countries following the Marxist–Leninist ideology The Constitution of 1976, which defined Cuba as a socialist republic, was replaced by the Constitution of 1992, which is \"guided by the ideas of José Martí and the political and social ideas of Marx, Engels and Lenin.\" [188] The constitution describes the Communist Party of Cuba as the \"leading force of society and of the state\" [188] The political system in Cuba reflects the Marxist–Leninist concept of democratic centralism [189]: 38 \n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe country is subdivided into 15 provinces and one special municipality (Isla de la Juventud) These were formerly part of six larger historical provinces: Pinar del Río, Habana, Matanzas, Las Villas, Camagüey and Oriente The present subdivisions closely resemble those of the Spanish military provinces during the Cuban Wars of Independence, when the most troublesome areas were subdivided The provinces are divided into municipalities.\n\n\nForeign relations\nCuba has conducted a foreign policy that is uncharacteristic of such a minor, developing country [207] [208] Under Castro, Cuba was heavily involved in wars in Africa, Central America and Asia Cuba supported Algeria in 1961–1965 [209] and sent tens of thousands of troops to Angola during the Angolan Civil War [210] Other countries that featured Cuban involvement include Ethiopia, [211] [212] Guinea, [213] Guinea-Bissau, [214] Mozambique, [215] and Yemen [216] Lesser known actions include the 1959 missions to the Dominican Republic [217] The expedition failed, but a prominent monument to its members was erected in their memory in Santo Domingo by the Dominican government, and they feature prominently at the country's Memorial Museum of the Resistance [218]\n\n\nEmbargo by the United States (1960–present)\nSince 1960, the U.S embargo on Cuba stands as one of the longest-running trade and economic measures in bilateral relations history, having endured for almost six decades This action was initiated in response to a wave of nationalizations that impacted American properties valued at over US$1 billion, the then U.S [241] President, Dwight Eisenhower, instated an embargo that prohibited all exports to Cuba, with the exception of medicines and certain foods [241] This measure was intensified in 1962 under the administration of John F Kennedy, extending the restrictions to Cuban imports, based on the Foreign Assistance Act approved by Congress in 1961 [241] During the Missile Crisis in 1962, the United States even imposed a naval blockade on Cuba, but this was lifted following the resolution of the crisis The embargo, however, remained in place and has been modified on several occasions over the years [241]\n\n\nMilitary\nAs of 2018 [update], Cuba spent about US$91.8 million on its armed forces or 2.9% of its GDP [250] In 1985, Cuba devoted more than 10% of its GDP to military expenditures [141] During the Cold War, Cuba built up one of the largest armed forces in Latin America, second only to that of Brazil [251]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nAll law enforcement agencies are maintained under Cuba's Ministry of the Interior, which is supervised by the Revolutionary Armed Forces In Cuba, citizens can receive police assistance by dialing \"106\" on their telephones [256] The police force, which is referred to as \"Policía Nacional Revolucionaria\" or PNR is then expected to provide help The Cuban government also has an agency called the Intelligence Directorate that conducts intelligence operations and maintains close ties with the Russian Federal Security Service [257] The US Justice Department considers Cuba a significant counterintelligence threat [258]\n\n\nHuman rights\nIn 2003, the European Union (EU) accused the Cuban government of \"continuing flagrant violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms\" [261] As of 2009, [update] it has continued to call regularly for social and economic reform in Cuba, along with the unconditional release of all political prisoners [262]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe Cuban state asserts its adherence to socialist principles in organizing its largely state-controlled planned economy Most of the means of production are owned and run by the government and most of the labor force is employed by the state Recent years have seen a trend toward more private sector employment By 2006, public sector employment was 78% and private sector 22%, compared to 91.8% to 8.2% in 1981 [267] Government spending is 78.1% of GDP [268] Since the early 2010s, following the initial market reforms, it has become popular to describe the economy as being, or moving toward, market socialism [269] [270] [271] Any firm that hires a Cuban must pay the Cuban government, which in turn pays the employee in Cuban pesos [272] The average monthly wage as of July 2013 [update] was 466 Cuban pesos—about US$19 [273] However, after a reform in January 2021, the minimum wage is about 2100 CUP (US$18) and the median wage is about 4000 CUP (US$33) [citation needed]\n\n\nResources\nCuba's natural resources include sugar, tobacco, fish, citrus fruits, coffee, beans, rice, potatoes, and livestock Cuba's most important mineral resource is nickel, with 21% of total exports in 2011 [312] The output of Cuba's nickel mines that year was 71,000 tons, approaching 4% of world production [313] As of 2013 [update] its reserves were estimated at 5.5 million tons, over 7% of the world total [313] Sherritt International of Canada operates a large nickel mining facility in Moa Cuba is also a major producer of refined cobalt, a by-product of nickel mining [314]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism was initially restricted to enclave resorts where tourists would be segregated from Cuban society, referred to as \"enclave tourism\" and \"tourism apartheid\" [316] Contact between foreign visitors and ordinary Cubans were de facto illegal between 1992 and 1997 [317] The rapid growth of tourism during the Special Period had widespread social and economic repercussions in Cuba, and led to speculation about the emergence of a two-tier economy [318]\n\n\nTransport\nAccording to the official census of 2010, Cuba's population was 11,241,161, comprising 5,628,996 men and 5,612,165 women [324] Its birth rate (9.88 births per thousand population in 2006) [325] is one of the lowest in the Western Hemisphere Although the country's population has grown by about four million people since 1961, the rate of growth slowed during that period, and the population began to decline in 2006, due to the country's low fertility rate (1.43 children per woman) coupled with emigration [326]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the official census of 2010, Cuba's population was 11,241,161, comprising 5,628,996 men and 5,612,165 women [324] Its birth rate (9.88 births per thousand

multiethnic, reflecting its complex colonial origins Intermarriage between diverse groups is widespread, and consequently there is some discrepancy in reports of the country's racial composition: whereas the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami determined that 62% of Cubans are black using the one drop rule, [329] the 2002 Cuban census found that a similar proportion of the population, 65.05%, was white.\n\n\nEthnoracial groups\nCuba's population is multiethnic, reflecting its complex colonial origins Intermarriage between diverse groups is widespread,

prominent part in Cuba's demographic profile Between the 18th and early 20th century, large waves of Canarian, Catalan, Andalusian, Galician, and other Spanish people immigrated to Cuba Between 1899 and 1930 alone, close to a million Spaniards entered the country, though many would eventually return to Spain [337] Other prominent immigrant groups included French, [338] Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Dutch, Greek, British, and Irish, as well as small number of descendants of U.S citizens who arrived in Cuba in the late 19th and early 20th centuries As of 2015, the foreign-born population in Cuba was 13,336 inhabitants per the World Bank data [339]\n\n\nImmigration\nImmigration and emigration have played a prominent part in Cuba's demographic profile Between the 18th and early 20th

U.S citizens who arrived in Cuba in the late 19th and early 20th centuries As of 2015, the foreign-born population in Cuba was 13,336 inhabitants per the World Bank data [339]\n\n\nEmigration\nPost-revolution Cuba has been characterized by significant levels of emigration, which has led to a large and influential diaspora community During the three decades after January 1959, more than one million Cubans of all social classes—constituting 10% of the total population—emigrated to the United States, a proportion that matches the extent of emigration to the U.S from the Caribbean as a whole during that period [340] [341] [342] [343] [344] Prior to 13 January 2013, Cuban citizens could not travel abroad, leave or return to Cuba without first obtaining official permission along with applying for a government-issued passport and travel visa, which was often denied [345] Those who left the country typically did so by sea, in small boats and fragile rafts.\n\n\nLanguages\nThe official language of Cuba is Spanish and the vast majority of Cubans speak it Spanish as spoken in Cuba is known as Cuban Spanish and is a form of Caribbean Spanish Lucumí, a dialect of the West African language Yoruba, is also used as a liturgical language by practitioners of Santería, [349] and so only as a second language [350] Haitian Creole is the second-most spoken language in Cuba, and is spoken by Haitian immigrants and their descendants [351] Other languages spoken by immigrants include Galician and Corsican [352]\n\n\nReligion\nIn 2010, the Pew Forum estimated that religious affiliation in Cuba is 59.2% Christian, 23% unaffiliated, 17.4% folk religion (such as santería), and the remaining 0.4% consisting of other religions [353] In a 2015 survey sponsored by Univision, 44% of Cubans said they were not religious and 9% did not give an answer while only 34% said they were Christian [354]\n\n\nEducation\nThe University of Havana was founded in 1728 and there are a number of other well-established colleges and universities In 1957, just before Castro came to power, the literacy rate was as low as fourth in the region at almost 80% according to the United Nations, yet higher than in Spain [111] Castro created an entirely state-operated system and banned private institutions School attendance is compulsory from ages six to the end of basic secondary education (normally at age 15), and all students, regardless of age or gender, wear school uniforms with the color denoting grade level Primary education lasts for six years, secondary education is divided into basic and pre-university education [364] Cuba's literacy rate of 99.8 percent [284] [365] is the tenth-highest globally, largely due to the provision of free education at every level [366] Cuba's high school graduation rate is 94 percent [367]\n\n\nHealth\nAfter the revolution, Cuba established a free public health system [30]\n\n\nDiet and Nutrition in the Cuban Household\nThe traditional diet in Cuban households has raised international concerns due to its lack of micronutrients and diversity According to the World Food Programme (WFP), an entity of the United Nations, the average diet in Cuba lacks adequate nutritional quality This is attributed to various factors, including limited availability of nutrient-rich foods, socioeconomic issues, and poor dietary habits [34] The WFP's annual report on Cuba supports previous testimonies and evidence, pointing to a concerning situation Even though the country has rolled out food subsidy programs, many backed by the WFP, the populace's diet remains nutritionally insufficient Specifically, rationed food covers only a small percentage of the daily energy, protein, and fat requirements for the population aged 14 to 60 [34]\n\n\nCulture\nCuban culture is influenced by its melting pot of cultures, primarily those of Spain, West Africa and the Indigenous Guanahatabey and Taínos of Cuba After the 1959 revolution, the government started a national literacy campaign, offered free education to all and established rigorous sports, ballet, and music programs [391]\n\n\nArchitecture\nArchitecture in Cuba was mainly manifested during the colonial period It brought the culture of Spain with its Baroque influence The first villas (settlements) were constituted by a church surrounded by several houses These houses had an interior or central courtyard and were covered with grilles There are magnificent religious buildings such as the Basílica de San Francisco of Havana In addition, large forts were built for defense, preventing the attack of pirates and buccaneers There are several old historic centers in Cuba that were built during the Spanish colonial period, the most remarkable are the four cities inscribed as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO, Havana, Camagüey, Cienfuegos and Trinidad, which has great architectural bastions of all currents and trends from Baroque, Neoclassical to eclectic art, and other preserved colonial towns such as Santiago de Cuba, Matanzas or Remedios.\n\n\nLiterature\nCuban literature began to find its voice in the early 19th century Dominant themes of independence and freedom were exemplified by José Martí, who led the Modernist movement in Cuban literature Writers such as Nicolás Guillén and José Z Tallet focused on literature as social protest The poetry and novels of Dulce María Loynaz and José Lezama Lima have been influential Romanticist Miguel Barnet, who wrote Everyone Dreamed of Cuba, reflects a more melancholy Cuba [392]\n\n\nMusic\nCuban music is very rich and is the most commonly known expression of Cuban culture The central form of this music is son, which has been the basis of many other musical styles like \"Danzón de nuevo ritmo\", mambo, cha-cha-chá and salsa music Rumba (\"de cajón o de solar\") music originated in the early Afro-Cuban culture, mixed with Spanish elements of style [394] The Tres was invented in Cuba from Spanish cordophone instruments models (the instrument is actually a fusion of elements from the Spanish guitar and lute) Other traditional Cuban instruments are of African origin, Taíno origin, or both, such as the maracas, güiro, marímbula and various wooden drums including the mayohuacán.\n\n\nDance\nCuban culture encompasses a wide range of dance forms [396] Danzón was the official musical genre and dance of Cuba [397] Mambo music and dance developed originally in Cuba, with further significant developments by Cuban musicians in Mexico and the US The cha-cha-cha is another dance of Cuban origin, [398] while the Cuban bolero originated in Santiago de Cuba in the last quarter of the 19th century [399] Concert dance is supported by the government and includes internationally renowned companies such as the Ballet Nacional de Cuba [400]\n\n\nMedia\nETECSA opened 118 cybercafes across the country in 2013 [401] The government of Cuba provides an online encyclopedia website called EcuRed that operates in a \"wiki\" format [402] Internet access is controlled, and e-mail is closely monitored [403]\n\n\nCuisine\nCuban cuisine is a fusion of Spanish and Caribbean cuisines Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor Food rationing, which has been the norm in Cuba for the last four decades, restricts the common availability of these dishes [408] The traditional Cuban meal is not served in courses; all food items are served at the same time.\n\n\nSports\nDue to historical associations with the United States, many Cubans participate in sports that are popular in North America, rather than sports traditionally played in other Latin American nations Baseball is the most popular Other popular sports include volleyball, boxing, athletics, wrestling, basketball and water sports [409] Cuba is a dominant force in amateur boxing, consistently achieving high medal tallies in major international competitions Boxers Rances Barthelemy and Erislandy Lara defected to the U.S and Mexico respectively [410] [411] Cuba also provides a national team that competes in the Olympic Games [412] Jose R Capablanca was a Cuban world chess champion from 1921 to 1927.\n\n\nSee also\n22°00′N 80°00′W﻿ / ﻿22.000°N 80.000°W﻿ / 22.000;

Caribbean Sea. The country has a rich history, diverse culture, and a complex politics. It is known for its beautiful beaches, vibrant cities, and a unique blend of Spanish, African, and indigenous influences.\n\n# Etymology\n\nThe name Cuba comes from the Taíno language, although its exact derivation is unknown. The name may be translated as 'where fertile land is abundant' (cubao) or 'great place' (coabana).\n\n# History\n\nCuba has a long and complex history that dates back to the pre-Columbian era. The first humans settled on the island around 6,000 years ago, descending from migrations from northern South America or Central America. The arrival of humans on Cuba is associated with the extinction of the island's native fauna, particularly its endemic sloths. The Arawakan-speaking ancestors of the Taíno people arrived in the Caribbean in a separate migration from South America around 1,700 years ago. The Taíno extensively produced pottery and engaged in intensive agriculture. The earliest evidence of the Taíno people on Cuba dates to the 9th century AD. Descendants of the first settlers of Cuba persisted on the western part of the island until Columbian contact, where they were recorded as the Guanahatabey people, who lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.\n\n## Pre-Columbian era\n\nCuba was inhabited by several indigenous groups, including the Cibaeo, the Cibaeo-Guana, and the Cibaeo-Guanahatabey. The Cibaeo were a subgroup of the Taíno people who lived in the western part of the island. They were skilled farmers and hunters and were known for their knowledge of the island's natural resources. The Cibaeo-Guana were a subgroup of the Cibaeo who lived in the eastern part of the island. They were skilled fishermen and traders and were known for their contact with other indigenous groups in the Caribbean. The Cibaeo-Guanahatabey were a subgroup of the Cibaeo who lived in the western part of the island. They were skilled hunters and gatherers and were known for their knowledge of the island's natural resources.\n\n## Spanish colonization and rule (1492-1898)\n\nChristopher Columbus landed on Cuba on October 27, 1492, and claimed the island for the new Kingdom of Spain. He named it Isla Juana (\"John's Island\") after John, Prince of Asturias. The Spanish established the first permanent settlement in Cuba in 1511 and began to colonize the island. The Spanish established a system of encomiendas, which allowed them to exploit the indigenous labor of the island. The Spanish also introduced African slaves to the island to work on plantations. The indigenous population was severely affected by the arrival of the Spanish and the introduction of diseases such as smallpox and influenza. By the mid-16th century, the indigenous population had declined dramatically, and the Spanish had established a system of plantation agriculture based on African slavery.\n\n## Independence movements\n\nCuba's struggle for independence from Spain began in the mid-19th century. The island's intellectuals and activists, including José Martí, began to advocate for independence and the abolition of slavery. In 1868, Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, a sugar planter, freed his slaves to fight with him for an independent Cuba. The 1868 rebellion resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the Ten Years' War. The conflict ended in 1878 with the Pact of Zanjón, which granted Cuba autonomy from Spain but did not achieve independence.\n\n# Republic (1902-1959)\n\nAfter the Spanish-American War, Spain and the United States signed the Treaty of Paris, by which Spain ceded Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam to the United States for the sum of $20 million. Cuba became a protectorate of the United States and gained formal independence from the United States on May 20, 1902. Under Cuba's new constitution, the United States retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations. The United States leased the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base from Cuba.\n\n## First years (1902-1925)\n\nCuba's first president, Tomás Estrada Palma, was elected in 1902 and served until 1905. He was succeeded by José Miguel Gómez, who served until 1909. The early years of the Cuban Republic were marked by political instability and corruption. The United States intervened in Cuban affairs on several occasions, including the 1906 Revolution, which led to the establishment of a provisional government. In 1908, the Platt Amendment, which granted the United States the right to intervene in Cuban affairs, was ratified by the Cuban Congress.\n\n## Revolution of 1933-1940\n\nIn 1933, the Sergeants' Revolt, led by Sergeant Fulgencio Batista, overthrew President Gerardo Machado. Batista became the provisional president of Cuba and was elected president in 1940. He ruled Cuba until 1944 and again from 1952 to 1959. During his rule, Batista suspended the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political liberties. He also presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans.\n\n## Constitution of 1940\n\nA new constitution was adopted in 1940, which engineered radical progressive ideas, including the right to labor and health care. Batista was elected president in the same year and held the post until 1944. He is the only non-white Cuban to win the nation's highest political office.\n\n# Revolution and Communist Party rule (1959-present)\n\nIn 1959, Fidel Castro and about 80 supporters landed from the yacht Granma in an attempt to start a rebellion against the Batista government. The U.S supported Castro by imposing a 1958 arms embargo against Batista's government. Castro's July 26th Movement emerged as the leading revolutionary group, and the U.S supported Castro's government with a military invasion at the Bay of Pigs.\n\n## Geology\n\nCuba is an island nation located in the northern Caribbean Sea. The country is divided into three main geologic regions: the western region, the central region, and the eastern region. The western region is a coastal plain that is bounded by the Sierra Maestra mountains to the east. The central region is a mountainous region that includes the Sierra Maestra mountains and the Pico Real del Turquino, the highest peak in Cuba. The eastern region is a coastal plain that is bounded by the Sierra Maestra mountains to the west.\n\n## Climate\n\nCuba has a tropical climate with high temperatures and high levels of humidity throughout the year. The country experiences a wet season from May to October and a dry season from November to April. The average temperature in January is 21°C (70°F) and the average temperature in July is 27°C (81°F).\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nCuba is a country with a rich biodiversity. The country is home to a variety of flora and fauna, including tropical forests, mangroves, and coral reefs. The country is also home to a variety of wildlife, including birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians.\n\n## Government and politics\n\nThe Republic of Cuba is a one-party socialist state. The Communist Party of Cuba is the leading force of society and of the state. The country is governed by a constitution that was adopted in 1992. The constitution describes the Communist Party of Cuba as the leading force of society and of the state.\n\n## Administrative divisions\n\nThe country is subdivided into 15 provinces and one special municipality (Isla de la Juventud). The provinces are divided into municipalities.\n\n## Foreign relations\n\nCuba has conducted a foreign policy that is uncharacteristic of a minor, developing country. Under Castro, Cuba was heavily involved in wars in Africa, Central America, and Asia.\n\n## Embargo by the United States (1960-present)\n\nSince 1960, the U.S embargo on Cuba stands as one of the longest-running trade and economic measures in bilateral relations history, having endured for almost six decades. The embargo was initiated in response to a wave of nationalizations that impacted American properties valued at over $1 billion.\n\n## Military\n\nAs of 2018, Cuba spent about $91.8 million on its armed forces or 2.9% of its GDP. In 1985, Cuba devoted more than 10% of its GDP to military expenditures. During the Cold War, Cuba built up one of the largest armed forces in Latin America, second only to that of Brazil.\n\n## Law enforcement\n\nAll law enforcement agencies are maintained under Cuba's Ministry of the Interior, which is supervised by the Revolutionary Armed Forces. The Cuban government also has an agency called the Intelligence Directorate that conducts intelligence operations and maintains close ties with the Russian Federal Security Service.\n\n## Human rights\n\nIn 2003, the European Union (EU) accused the Cuban government of \"continuing flagrant violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\" As of 2009, the EU has continued to call regularly for social and economic reform in Cuba, along with the unconditional release of all political prisoners.\n\n## Economy\n\nThe Cuban state asserts its adherence to socialist principles in organizing its largely state-controlled planned economy. Most of the means of production are owned and run by the government, and most of the labor force is employed by the state. Recent years have seen a trend toward more private sector employment.\n\n## Resources\n\nCuba's natural resources include sugar, tobacco, fish, citrus fruits, coffee, beans, rice, potatoes, and livestock. Cuba's most important mineral resource is nickel, with 21% of total exports in 2011.\n\n## Tourism\n\nTourism was initially restricted to enclave resorts where tourists would be segregated from Cuban society. Contact between foreign visitors and ordinary Cubans was de facto illegal between 1992 and 1997.\n\n## Transport\n\nAccording to the official census of 2010, Cuba's population was 11,241,161, comprising 5,628,996 men and 5,612,165 women. Its birth rate (9.88 births per thousand population in 2006) is one of the lowest in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n## Demographics\n\nCuba's population is multiethnic, reflecting its complex colonial origins. Intermarriage between diverse groups is widespread, and consequently, there is some discrepancy in reports of the country's racial composition.\n\n## Migration\n\nImmigration and emigration have played a prominent part in Cuba's demographic profile. Between the 18th and early 20th century, large waves of Canarian, Catalan, Andalusian, Galician, and other Spanish people immigrated to Cuba.\n\n## Languages\n\nThe official language of Cuba is Spanish, and the vast majority of Cubans speak it. Lucumí, a dialect of the West African language Yoruba, is also used as a liturgical language by practitioners of Santería.\n\n## Religion\n\nIn 2010, the Pew Forum estimated that religious affiliation in Cuba is 59.2% Christian, 23% unaffiliated, 17.4% folk religion (such as santería), and the remaining 0.4% consisting of other religions.\n\n## Education\n\nThe University of Havana was founded in 1728, and there are a number of other well-established colleges and universities. Cuba's literacy rate of 99.8% is the tenth-highest globally.\n\n## Culture\n\nCuban culture is influenced by its melting pot of cultures, primarily those of Spain, West Africa, and the Indigenous Guanahatabey and Taínos of Cuba.\n\n## Cuisine\n\nCuban cuisine is a fusion of Spanish and Caribbean cuisines. Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor.\n\n## Sports\n\nDue to historical associations with the United States, many Cubans participate in sports that are popular in North America, rather than sports traditionally played in other Latin American nations.\n\n## See also\n\n*  List of cities in Cuba\n*  List of universities

San Martín was then appointed as provisional president [93] Grau resigned in 1934, leaving the way clear for Batista, who dominated Cuban politics for the next 25 years, at first through a series of puppet-presidents [92] The period from 1933 to 1937 was a time of \"virtually unremitting social and political warfare\" [94] On balance, during the period 1933–1940 Cuba suffered from fragile political structures, reflected in the fact that it saw three different presidents in two years (1935–1936), and in the militaristic and repressive policies of Batista as Head of the Army.\n\n\nConstitution of 1940\nA new constitution was adopted in 1940, which engineered radical progressive ideas, including the right to labor and health care [95] Batista was elected president in the same year, holding the post until 1944 [96] He is so far the only non-white Cuban to win the nation's highest political office [97] [98] [99] His government carried out major social reforms Several members of the Communist Party held office under his administration [100] Cuban armed forces were not greatly involved in combat during World War II—though president Batista did suggest a joint U.S.-Latin American assault on Francoist Spain to overthrow its authoritarian regime [101] Cuba lost six merchant ships during the war, and the Cuban Navy was credited with sinking the German submarine U-176 [102]\n\n\nCoup d'état of 1952\nAfter finishing his term in 1944 Batista lived in Florida, returning to Cuba to run for president in 1952 Facing certain electoral defeat, he led a military coup that preempted the election [106] Back in power, and receiving financial, military, and logistical support from the United States government, Batista suspended the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the right to strike He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations, and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans [107] Batista outlawed the Cuban Communist Party in 1952 [108] After the coup, Cuba had Latin America's highest per capita consumption rates of meat, vegetables, cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios, though about one-third of the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this consumption [109] However, in his \"History Will Absolve Me\" speech, Fidel Castro mentioned that national issues relating to land, industrialization, housing, unemployment, education, and health were contemporary problems [110]\n\n\nRevolution and Communist Party rule (1959–present)\nIn the 1950s, various organizations, including some advocating armed uprising, competed for public support in bringing about political change [116] In 1956, Fidel Castro and about 80 supporters landed from the yacht Granma in an attempt to start a rebellion against the Batista government [116] In 1958, Castro's July 26th Movement emerged as the leading revolutionary group [116] The U.S supported Castro by imposing a 1958 arms embargo against Batista's government Batista evaded the American embargo and acquired weapons from the Dominican Republic [p]\n\n\nGeography\nCuba is an archipelago of 4,195 islands, cays and islets located in the northern Caribbean Sea at the confluence with the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean It lies between latitudes 19° and 24°N, and longitudes 74° and 85°W Florida (Key West, Florida) is about 150 km (93 miles) across the Straits of Florida to the north and northwest, and The Bahamas (Cay Lobos) 22.5 km (14 mi) to the north Mexico lies 210 km (130.5 mi) west across the Yucatán Channel (to the closest tip of Cabo Catoche in the State of Quintana Roo).\n\n\nClimate\nWith the entire island south of the Tropic of Cancer, the local climate is tropical, moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow year-round The temperature is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings in warm water from the equator This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than that of Hong Kong, which is at around the same latitude as Cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October The average temperature is 21 °C (70 °F) in January and 27 °C (81 °F) in July The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea and the fact that Cuba sits across the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico combine to make the country prone to frequent hurricanes These are most common in September and October.\n\n\nBiodiversity\nCuba signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 12 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 8 March 1994 [181] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, with one revision, that the convention received on 24 January 2008 [182]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nThe Republic of Cuba is one of the few socialist countries following the Marxist–Leninist ideology The Constitution of 1976, which defined Cuba as a socialist republic, was replaced by the Constitution of 1992, which is \"guided by the ideas of José Martí and the political and social ideas of Marx, Engels and Lenin.\" [188] The constitution describes the Communist Party of Cuba as the \"leading force of society and of the state\" [188] The political system in Cuba reflects the Marxist–Leninist concept of democratic centralism [189]: 38 \n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe country is subdivided into 15 provinces and one special municipality (Isla de la Juventud) These were formerly part of six larger historical provinces: Pinar del Río, Habana, Matanzas, Las Villas, Camagüey and Oriente The present subdivisions closely resemble those of the Spanish military provinces during the Cuban Wars of Independence, when the most troublesome areas were subdivided The provinces are divided into municipalities.\n\n\nForeign relations\nCuba has conducted a foreign policy that is uncharacteristic of such a minor, developing country [207] [208] Under Castro, Cuba was heavily involved in wars in Africa, Central America and Asia Cuba supported Algeria in 1961–1965 [209] and sent tens of thousands of troops to Angola during the Angolan Civil War [210] Other countries that featured Cuban involvement include Ethiopia, [211] [212] Guinea, [213] Guinea-Bissau, [214] Mozambique, [215] and Yemen [216] Lesser known actions include the 1959 missions to the Dominican Republic [217] The expedition failed, but a prominent monument to its members was erected in their memory in Santo Domingo by the Dominican government, and they feature prominently at the country's Memorial Museum of the Resistance [218]\n\n\nEmbargo by the United States (1960–present)\nSince 1960, the U.S embargo on Cuba stands as one of the longest-running trade and economic measures in bilateral relations history, having endured for almost six decades This action was initiated in response to a wave of nationalizations that impacted American properties valued at over US$1 billion, the then U.S [241] President, Dwight Eisenhower, instated an embargo that prohibited all exports to Cuba, with the exception of medicines and certain foods [241] This measure was intensified in 1962 under the administration of John F Kennedy, extending the restrictions to Cuban imports, based on the Foreign Assistance Act approved by Congress in 1961 [241] During the Missile Crisis in 1962, the United States even imposed a naval blockade on Cuba, but this was lifted following the resolution of the crisis The embargo, however, remained in place and has been modified on several occasions over the years [241]\n\n\nMilitary\nAs of 2018 [update], Cuba spent about US$91.8 million on its armed forces or 2.9% of its GDP [250] In 1985, Cuba devoted more than 10% of its GDP to military expenditures [141] During the Cold War, Cuba built up one of the largest armed forces in Latin America, second only to that of Brazil [251]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nAll law enforcement agencies are maintained under Cuba's Ministry of the Interior, which is supervised by the Revolutionary Armed Forces In Cuba, citizens can receive police assistance by dialing \"106\" on their telephones [256] The police force, which is referred to as \"Policía Nacional Revolucionaria\" or PNR is then expected to provide help The Cuban government also has an agency called the Intelligence Directorate that conducts intelligence operations and maintains close ties with the Russian Federal Security Service [257] The US Justice Department considers Cuba a significant counterintelligence threat [258]\n\n\nHuman rights\nIn 2003, the European Union (EU) accused the Cuban government of \"continuing flagrant violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms\" [261] As of 2009, [update] it has continued to call regularly for social and economic reform in Cuba, along with the unconditional release of all political prisoners [262]\n\n\nEconomy\nThe Cuban state asserts its adherence to socialist principles in organizing its largely state-controlled planned economy Most of the means of production are owned and run by the government and most of the labor force is employed by the state Recent years have seen a trend toward more private sector employment By 2006, public sector employment was 78% and private sector 22%, compared to 91.8% to 8.2% in 1981 [267] Government spending is 78.1% of GDP [268] Since the early 2010s, following the initial market reforms, it has become popular to describe the economy as being, or moving toward, market socialism [269] [270] [271] Any firm that hires a Cuban must pay the Cuban government, which in turn pays the employee in Cuban pesos [272] The average monthly wage as of July 2013 [update] was 466 Cuban pesos—about US$19 [273] However, after a reform in January 2021, the minimum wage is about 2100 CUP (US$18) and the median wage is about 4000 CUP (US$33) [citation needed]\n\n\nResources\nCuba's natural resources include sugar, tobacco, fish, citrus fruits, coffee, beans, rice, potatoes, and livestock Cuba's most important mineral resource is nickel, with 21% of total exports in 2011 [312] The output of Cuba's nickel mines that year was 71,000 tons, approaching 4% of world production [313] As of 2013 [update] its reserves were estimated at 5.5 million tons, over 7% of the world total [313] Sherritt International of Canada operates a large nickel mining facility in Moa Cuba is also a major producer of refined cobalt, a by-product of nickel mining [314]\n\n\nTourism\nTourism was initially restricted to enclave resorts where tourists would be segregated from Cuban society, referred to as \"enclave tourism\" and \"tourism apartheid\" [316] Contact between foreign visitors and ordinary Cubans were de facto illegal between 1992 and 1997 [317] The rapid growth of tourism during the Special Period had widespread social and economic repercussions in Cuba, and led to speculation about the emergence of a two-tier economy [318]\n\n\nTransport\nAccording to the official census of 2010, Cuba's population was 11,241,161, comprising 5,628,996 men and 5,612,165 women [324] Its birth rate (9.88 births per thousand population in 2006) [325] is one of the lowest in the Western Hemisphere Although the country's population has grown by about four million people since 1961, the rate of growth slowed during that period, and the population began to decline in 2006, due to the country's low fertility rate (1.43 children per woman) coupled with emigration [326]\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the official census of 2010, Cuba's population was 11,241,161, comprising 5,628,996 men and 5,612,165 women [324] Its birth rate (9.88 births per thousand population in 2006) [325] is one of the lowest in the Western Hemisphere Although the country's population has grown by about four million people since 1961, the rate of growth slowed during that period, and the population began to decline in 2006, due to the country's low fertility rate (1.43 children per woman) coupled with emigration [326]\n\n\nLargest cities\nCuba's population is multiethnic, reflecting its complex colonial origins Intermarriage between diverse groups is widespread, and consequently there is some discrepancy in reports of the country's racial composition: whereas the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami determined that 62% of Cubans are black using the one drop rule, [329] the 2002 Cuban census found that a similar proportion of the population, 65.05%, was white.\n\n\nEthnoracial groups\nCuba's population is multiethnic, reflecting its complex colonial

65.05%, was white.\n\n\nMigration\nImmigration and emigration have played a prominent part in Cuba's demographic profile Between the 18th and early 20th century, large waves of Canarian, Catalan, Andalusian, Galician, and other Spanish people immigrated to Cuba Between 1899 and 1930 alone, close to a million Spaniards entered the country, though many would eventually return to Spain [337] Other prominent immigrant groups included French, [338] Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Dutch, Greek, British, and Irish, as well as small number of descendants of U.S citizens who arrived in Cuba in the late 19th and early 20th centuries As of 2015, the foreign-born population in Cuba was 13,336 inhabitants per the World Bank data [339]\n\n\nImmigration\nImmigration and emigration have played a

in Cuba was 13,336 inhabitants per the World Bank data [339]\n\n\nEmigration\nPost-revolution Cuba has been characterized by significant levels of emigration, which has led to a large and influential diaspora community During the three decades after January 1959, more than one million Cubans of all social classes—constituting 10% of the total population—emigrated to the United States, a proportion that matches the extent of emigration to the U.S from the Caribbean as a whole during that period [340] [341] [342] [343] [344] Prior to 13 January 2013, Cuban citizens could not travel abroad, leave or return to Cuba without first obtaining official permission along with applying for a government-issued passport and travel visa, which was often denied [345] Those who left the country typically did so by sea, in small boats and fragile rafts.\n\n\nLanguages\nThe official language of Cuba is Spanish and the vast majority of Cubans speak it Spanish as spoken in Cuba is known as Cuban Spanish and is a form of Caribbean Spanish Lucumí, a dialect of the West African language Yoruba, is also used as a liturgical language by practitioners of Santería, [349] and so only as a second language [350] Haitian Creole is the second-most spoken language in Cuba, and is spoken by Haitian immigrants and their descendants [351] Other languages spoken by immigrants include Galician and Corsican [352]\n\n\nReligion\nIn 2010, the Pew Forum estimated that religious affiliation in Cuba is 59.2% Christian, 23% unaffiliated, 17.4% folk religion (such as santería), and the remaining 0.4% consisting of other religions [353] In a 2015 survey sponsored by Univision, 44% of Cubans said they were not religious and 9% did not give an answer while only 34% said they were Christian [354]\n\n\nEducation\nThe University of Havana was founded in 1728 and there are a number of other well-established colleges and universities In 1957, just before Castro came to power, the literacy rate was as low as fourth in the region at almost 80% according to the United Nations, yet higher than in Spain [111] Castro created an entirely state-operated system and banned private institutions School attendance is compulsory from ages six to the end of basic secondary education (normally at age 15), and all students, regardless of age or gender, wear school uniforms with the color denoting grade level Primary education lasts for six years, secondary education is divided into basic and pre-university education [364] Cuba's literacy rate of 99.8 percent [284] [365] is the tenth-highest globally, largely due to the provision of free education at every level [366] Cuba's high school graduation rate is 94 percent [367]\n\n\nHealth\nAfter the revolution, Cuba established a free public health system [30]\n\n\nDiet and Nutrition in the Cuban Household\nThe traditional diet in Cuban households has raised international concerns due to its lack of micronutrients and diversity According to the World Food Programme (WFP), an entity of the United Nations, the average diet in Cuba lacks adequate nutritional quality This is attributed to various factors, including limited availability of nutrient-rich foods, socioeconomic issues, and poor dietary habits [34] The WFP's annual report on Cuba supports previous testimonies and evidence, pointing to a concerning situation Even though the country has rolled out food subsidy programs, many backed by the WFP, the populace's diet remains nutritionally insufficient Specifically, rationed food covers only a small percentage of the daily energy, protein, and fat requirements for the population aged 14 to 60 [34]\n\n\nCulture\nCuban culture is influenced by its melting pot of cultures, primarily those of Spain, West Africa and the Indigenous Guanahatabey and Taínos of Cuba After the 1959 revolution, the government started a national literacy campaign, offered free education to all and established rigorous sports, ballet, and music programs [391]\n\n\nArchitecture\nArchitecture in Cuba was mainly manifested during the colonial period It brought the culture of Spain with its Baroque influence The first villas (settlements) were constituted by a church surrounded by several houses These houses had an interior or central courtyard and were covered with grilles There are magnificent religious buildings such as the Basílica de San Francisco of Havana In addition, large forts were built for defense, preventing the attack of pirates and buccaneers There are several old historic centers in Cuba that were built during the Spanish colonial period, the most remarkable are the four cities inscribed as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO, Havana, Camagüey, Cienfuegos and Trinidad, which has great architectural bastions of all currents and trends from Baroque, Neoclassical to eclectic art, and other preserved colonial towns such as Santiago de Cuba, Matanzas or Remedios.\n\n\nLiterature\nCuban literature began to find its voice in the early 19th century Dominant themes of independence and freedom were exemplified by José Martí, who led the Modernist movement in Cuban literature Writers such as Nicolás Guillén and José Z Tallet focused on literature as social protest The poetry and novels of Dulce María Loynaz and José Lezama Lima have been influential Romanticist Miguel Barnet, who wrote Everyone Dreamed of Cuba, reflects a more melancholy Cuba [392]\n\n\nMusic\nCuban music is very rich and is the most commonly known expression of Cuban culture The central form of this music is son, which has been the basis of many other musical styles like \"Danzón de nuevo ritmo\", mambo, cha-cha-chá and salsa music Rumba (\"de cajón o de solar\") music originated in the early Afro-Cuban culture, mixed with Spanish elements of style [394] The Tres was invented in Cuba from Spanish cordophone instruments models (the instrument is actually a fusion of elements from the Spanish guitar and lute) Other traditional Cuban instruments are of African origin, Taíno origin, or both, such as the maracas, güiro, marímbula and various wooden drums including the mayohuacán.\n\n\nDance\nCuban culture encompasses a wide range of dance forms [396] Danzón was the official musical genre and dance of Cuba [397] Mambo music and dance developed originally in Cuba, with further significant developments by Cuban musicians in Mexico and the US The cha-cha-cha is another dance of Cuban origin, [398] while the Cuban bolero originated in Santiago de Cuba in the last quarter of the 19th century [399] Concert dance is supported by the government and includes internationally renowned companies such as the Ballet Nacional de Cuba [400]\n\n\nMedia\nETECSA opened 118 cybercafes across the country in 2013 [401] The government of Cuba provides an online encyclopedia website called EcuRed that operates in a \"wiki\" format [402] Internet access is controlled, and e-mail is closely monitored [403]\n\n\nCuisine\nCuban cuisine is a fusion of Spanish and Caribbean cuisines Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor Food rationing, which has been the norm in Cuba for the last four decades, restricts the common availability of these dishes [408] The traditional Cuban meal is not served in courses; all food items are served at the same time.\n\n\nSports\nDue to historical associations with the United States, many Cubans participate in sports that are popular in North America, rather than sports traditionally played in other Latin American nations Baseball is the most popular Other popular sports include volleyball, boxing, athletics, wrestling, basketball and water sports [409] Cuba is a dominant force in amateur boxing, consistently achieving high medal tallies in major international competitions Boxers Rances Barthelemy and Erislandy Lara defected to the U.S and Mexico respectively [410] [411] Cuba also provides a national team that competes in the Olympic Games [412] Jose R Capablanca was a Cuban world chess champion from 1921 to 1927.\n\n\nSee also\n22°00′N 80°00′W﻿ / ﻿22.000°N 80.000°W﻿ / 22.000;

{"title": "Steve_Nash", "content": "\nEarly life\nNash was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to a Welsh mother, Jean, and English father, John, on 7 February 1974 [5] [6] [7] [8] His family moved to Regina, Saskatchewan, when he was 18 months old, before settling in Victoria, British Columbia [8] He, therefore, holds British as well as Canadian citizenship Before the family settled in Canada, his father played professional soccer in various parts of the world [8] Nash often played soccer and ice hockey with his younger brother Martin, and he did not start playing basketball until he was 12 or 13 years old; [9] he also played rugby and lacrosse [10] In grade eight, he told his mother that one day he would play in the NBA and become a star [8] He was a neighbour to future NHL stars Russ and Geoff Courtnall, who used to babysit him and played soccer coached by Nash's father [11]\n\n\nCollege career\nAlthough Nash's high school coach, Ian Hyde-Lay, sent letters of inquiry and highlight reels to over 30 American universities, Nash was not recruited by any university, [8] until Santa Clara coach Dick Davey requested video footage of the young guard After watching Nash in person, Davey said he \"was nervous as hell just hoping that no one else would see him It didn't take a Nobel Prize winner to figure out this guy's pretty good It was just a case of hoping that none of the big names came around.\" [12] However, Davey also told Nash he was \"the worst defensive player\" he had ever seen [12]\n\n\nProfessional career\nAfter graduating with a degree in sociology, [12] Nash was selected 15th overall by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 1996 NBA draft Upon hearing the draft announcement, Suns fans booed in disapproval of the relatively unknown player [12] This was because despite his impressive college accomplishments, Nash had not played in one of the major college conferences A major influence in Phoenix's choice was assistant coach Donnie Nelson, who met Nash back in high school as he was coached by Nelson's friend Ken Shields, and would eventually befriend the player as he played in Santa Clara During his first two seasons in the NBA, Nash played a supporting role behind NBA star point guards Kevin Johnson, Sam Cassell, and later, Jason Kidd [16] Both Johnson and Cassell had NBA Finals experience, while Kidd was the second overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft and already an All-Star when he arrived at Phoenix.\n\n\nPhoenix Suns (1996–1998)\nAfter graduating with a degree in sociology, [12] Nash was selected 15th overall by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 1996 NBA draft Upon hearing the draft announcement, Suns fans booed in disapproval of the relatively unknown player [12] This was because despite his impressive college

Kevin Johnson, Sam Cassell, and later, Jason Kidd [16] Both Johnson and Cassell had NBA Finals experience, while Kidd was the second overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft and already an All-Star when he arrived at Phoenix.\n\n\nDallas Mavericks (1998–2004)\nIt was in Dallas that Nash established himself as a formidable point guard, beginning a decade as one of the game's top players During his first year as a Maverick (the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season) he started in all 40 games he played in, and averaged 7.9 points, 2.9 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game [17] The 19–31 Mavericks failed to make the 1999 playoffs, but in the 1999–2000 season, the team's prospects improved considerably Nash missed 25 mid-season games due to an ankle injury, but came back to record six double-doubles in the last month of play [13] He finished the season with averages of 8.6 points and 4.9 assists per game [17] More importantly for the team, second-year teammate and friend Dirk Nowitzki was blossoming quickly into a top player, veteran Michael Finley was having an All-Star-calibre year, and the team's new owner, billionaire Mark Cuban, was bringing new energy and excitement to the franchise Nash now had a supportive environment in which he could thrive.\n\n\nReturn to Phoenix (2004–2012)\nNash joined a Suns team which had emerging young players in Shawn Marion, Joe Johnson, and Amar'e Stoudemire In the season before Nash arrived, the Suns had recorded a 29–53 win–loss record, [8] and they were projected to have another poor season Head coach Mike D'Antoni favoured an up-tempo style of basketball; this required smaller and more athletic players with the capability to outrun and outshoot their opponents On 21 November 2004, Nash recorded 22 points, 18 assists and 4 steals in a 122–111 win over the LA Clippers [29] Nash's familiarity with this style combined with the athleticism of his teammates produced an NBA-best 62–20 record and a points-per-game average of 110.4, the highest in a decade [30] The catalyst of this turnaround, Nash averaged 11.5 assists per game while making 50.2% of his field goals and 43.1% of his three-pointers in the regular season [17] [31] He edged Shaquille O'Neal to win the 2004–05 NBA MVP award, [32] becoming the first Canadian to earn the honour, as well as the third point guard ever to be named MVP, along with Magic Johnson and Bob Cousy [13] In the 2005 playoffs, Phoenix swept the Memphis Grizzlies in four games before meeting the Dallas Mavericks in the second round [33] Nash led the Suns to a 4–2 series win, [33] and the Suns reached the Western Conference finals for the first time since 1993, but lost to the eventual NBA Champions and arch-rival, the San Antonio Spurs, in five games [33]\n\n\n2004–05 season\nNash joined a

well as the third point guard ever to be named MVP, along with Magic Johnson and Bob Cousy [13] In the 2005 playoffs, Phoenix swept the Memphis Grizzlies in four games before meeting the Dallas Mavericks in the second round [33] Nash led the Suns to a 4–2 series win, [33] and the Suns reached the Western Conference finals for the first time since 1993, but lost to the eventual NBA Champions and arch-rival, the San Antonio Spurs, in five games [33]\n\n\n2005–06 season\nIn the next season, Stoudemire suffered a serious knee injury, and Johnson and Quentin Richardson were traded away [34] The Suns were not expected to repeat their successful 2005 season, but with Nash directing the same high-tempo offence, the team compiled a respectable 54–28 record and won the division title [31] [34] On 2 January 2006, Nash recorded 28 points, 5 rebounds and 22 assists in a 140–133 triple overtime loss to the New York Knicks [35] The Suns were again the highest-scoring team in the league with seven players averaging double figures in points per game, [34] and Nash was voted for the first time to start for the 2006 Western All-Star team [36] In the last game of the season, Nash recorded a triple-double of 16 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists in a 106–96 road win over the Trail Blazers [37]\nHaving recorded career highs in points (18.8), rebounds (4.2), field goal percentage (.512) and free throw percentage (a league-leading .921), and leading the league with 10.5 assists per game, [13] Nash was named the league MVP for the second year in a row [38] In the first round of the 2006 playoffs, Phoenix overcame a 3–1 deficit against the Los Angeles Lakers and won the series 4–3 [34] The Los Angeles Clippers were their Conference semifinals opponents, and the Suns again needed seven games to clinch the series [34] For the second year in a row, however, the Suns bowed out in the conference finals, this time to Nash's former team, Dallas [34]\n\n\n2006–07 season\nIn the 2006–07 season, Nash had another stellar campaign, averaging 18.6 points and a career-high 11.6 assists per game while becoming the first person since Magic Johnson in 1990–91 to average 18 points and 11 assists per game during the regular season [39] Nash received the most votes for first-team All-NBA and was joined by teammate Stoudemire; the two were the first teammates to make the first team since Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal in 2003–04 [39] Nash received 129 first-place votes and 645 total points from the panel of 129 media members [39] He narrowly missed being MVP a third consecutive time, coming in second with 44 first place votes to 83 for Dirk Nowitzki [40] In the 2007 playoffs, the Suns eliminated the Lakers in five games before losing 4–2 to the Spurs in the conference semifinals [41]\n\n\n2007–08 season\nNash played in 81 regular season games during the 2007–08 season; in this campaign, the Western Conference was especially competitive and he led the Suns to 55 wins and the sixth seed for the 2008 playoffs Although there was a dip in his regular season output, Nash's shooting remained sharp; the accuracy of his shooting was on par with his 2005–06 MVP campaign (shooting at least 50% from the field, 40% from the three-point arc, and 90% from the free throw line) [17] On 31 January 2008, he collected his All-Star stripes for the sixth time in his career [42] However, Nash continued to experience agony in the playoffs Despite a mid-season trade that sent Shawn Marion to the Miami Heat and brought four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal to the team, the Suns were defeated in the first round of the 2008 playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs for the third time in four years [43] In the deciding Game 5, Nash was perceived to have suffered from \"elimination-game jitters\", and turned over the ball twice in the final two minutes of what was a tight contest [43] Nevertheless, Nash was later named to the All-NBA Second Team for the 2007–08 season [44]\n\n\n2008–09 season\nBefore the 2008–09 season began, coach D'Antoni was replaced by Terry Porter, who preferred a more defensive-oriented style of basketball The Suns had difficulties adapting to this new system, and even a December trade involving sending stalwarts Raja Bell and Boris Diaw to the Charlotte Bobcats for athletic swingman Jason Richardson [45] saw the team continue to struggle Porter was then replaced by Alvin Gentry in February after a 28–23 record, but the Suns were unable to secure the final seed for the 2009 playoffs, [46] resulting in Nash missing the playoffs for the first time since he returned to Phoenix for his second stint.\n\n\n2009–10 season\nNash and the Suns opened the 2009–10 season with a series of strong performances, going 8–1 in their first nine games (a franchise-best since 1980–81), with Nash producing two 20-assists games [47] On 21 January 2010, Nash was named as the starting point guard for the West for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game [48] With him operating at the point, the Suns were the highest-scoring team in the league for the fifth season in a row, and were seeded third in the conference for the 2010 playoffs with 54 wins Behind solid performances by Richardson and veteran Grant Hill, the Suns defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 4–2 in the first round of the playoffs, and swept the Spurs 4–0 in the second round The Suns met the defending champions, Los Angeles Lakers, in the conference finals After losing the first two games, Phoenix won the next two to tie the series A Ron Artest buzzer-beater in Game 5 pushed the Lakers one game closer to the Finals, and Kobe Bryant's 37 points in Game 6 completed the defeat of the Suns.\n\n\n2010–11 season\nThe Suns underwent two major roster changes in the 2010–11 season During the pre-season, Stoudemire left for New York, while longtime teammate Leandro Barbosa was traded for Hedo Türkoğlu Josh Childress, and Hakim Warrick were also recruited to join the Suns Not long after the season began, Türkoğlu, Richardson, and Earl Clark were traded to Orlando for Vince Carter, Marcin Gortat, and Mickaël Piétrus, while rising star Goran Dragić was traded to the Houston Rockets for Aaron Brooks [49] The Suns had difficulty being even a .500 team, and for the second time since Nash returned to Phoenix, the Suns failed to make the 2011 playoffs.\n\n\n2011–12 season\nIn February 2012, Nash was named to his eighth All-Star Game At the time, he was leading the NBA in assists per game [50] On 21 April 2012, Nash passed Oscar Robertson for career assists versus the Denver Nuggets Despite his stellar play the Suns missed the 2012 playoffs for the second consecutive time He finished the season averaging 12.5 points and 10.7 assists per game on 53.2% shooting from the field (tying his career high) Near the end of the 2011–12 season, Nash was named the winner of the PBWA's Magic Johnson Award.\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (2012–2015)\nOn 11 July 2012, the Los Angeles Lakers acquired Nash in a sign-and-trade deal with Phoenix [51] Nash also considered signing with New York or Toronto, but he decided that Los Angeles was the best fit for him and his family [52] Nash switched his jersey number, as his customary No 13 was retired by Los Angeles in honour of Wilt Chamberlain [53] [54] Nash, an avid soccer fan, chose No 10 to pay homage to Glenn Hoddle, Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi and other soccer playmakers who wore the number [55] Entering his 17th NBA season, Nash came to the Lakers with concerns over his defense and the health of his back [56]\n\n\n2012–13 season\nOn 11 July 2012, the Los Angeles Lakers acquired Nash in a sign-and-trade deal with Phoenix [51] Nash also considered signing with New York

leg injury the prior season In November 2013, he was sidelined for an estimated minimum of two weeks due to nerve root irritation [71] Nash returned on 4 February 2014, shooting 3-for-6 for 7 points On 7 February 2014, his 40th birthday, he scored a season-high 19 points in a victory over the Philadelphia 76ers [72] On 13 March, Nash was ruled out for the remainder of the season by D'Antoni He was suffering from a recurrence of nerve problems stemming from an earlier collision to his left leg with Chicago's Kirk Hinrich, and the Lakers wanted to give Kendall Marshall and Jordan Farmar more playing time However, Nash returned on 21 March after a groin injury to Farmar that was expected to sideline him a minimum of two weeks [73] [74]\n\n\n2014–15 season\nIn July 2014, Nash announced that the 2014–15 season would be his last During the preseason, he experienced back pain, and further aggravated his back while lifting luggage [75] On 23 October, less than a week before the start of what would have been the 40-year-old Nash's 19th year in the NBA, he was ruled out for the season due to a recurring back injury Nash only played in three preseason games before he started to feel more pain in his back Nash spoke on injuring his back, stating: \"Being on the court this season has been my top priority, and it is disappointing to not be able to do that right now I work very hard to stay healthy, and unfortunately my recent setback makes performing at full capacity difficult I will continue to support my team during this period of rest and will focus on my long-term health.\" [76]\n\n\nRetirement and consulting duties\nNash announced his retirement from playing on 21 March 2015 [77] Before the announcement, the Cleveland Cavaliers told Nash's agent that they were interested in having him as a backup for Kyrie Irving if Nash asked for a buyout Nash refused it due to health concerns and his wanting to retire as a Laker in gratitude for the opportunity given by the club [78] Nash was later approached by another former team of his, the Dallas Mavericks, to have one last season with them instead, but he declined due to his aforementioned health concerns [79]\n\n\nCoaching career\nOn 3 September 2020, Nash was announced as head coach of the Brooklyn Nets [86] [87]\n\n\nBrooklyn Nets (2020–2022)\nOn 3 September 2020, Nash was announced as head coach of

and highlight reels to over 30 American universities, Nash was not recruited by any university, [8] until Santa Clara coach Dick Davey requested video footage of the young guard After watching Nash in person, Davey said he \"was nervous as hell just hoping that no one else would see him It didn't take a Nobel Prize winner to figure out this guy's pretty good It was just a case of hoping that none

point guards Kevin Johnson, Sam Cassell, and later, Jason Kidd [16] Both Johnson and Cassell had NBA Finals experience, while Kidd was the second overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft and already an All-Star when he arrived at Phoenix.\n\n\nDallas Mavericks (1998–2004)\nIt was in Dallas that Nash established himself as a formidable point guard, beginning a decade as one of the game's top players During his first year as a Maverick (the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season) he started in all 40 games he played in, and averaged 7.9 points, 2.9 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game [17] The 19–31 Mavericks failed to make the 1999 playoffs, but in the 1999–2000 season, the team's prospects improved considerably Nash missed 25 mid-season games due to an ankle injury, but came back to record six double-doubles in the last month of play [13] He finished the season with averages of 8.6 points and 4.9 assists per game [17] More importantly for the team, second-year teammate and friend Dirk Nowitzki was blossoming quickly into a top player, veteran Michael Finley was having an All-Star-calibre year, and the team's new owner, billionaire Mark Cuban, was bringing new energy and excitement to the franchise Nash now had a supportive environment in which he could thrive.\n\n\nReturn to Phoenix (2004–2012)\nNash joined a Suns team which had emerging young players in Shawn Marion, Joe Johnson, and Amar'e Stoudemire In the season before Nash arrived, the Suns had recorded a 29–53 win–loss record, [8] and they were projected to have another poor season Head coach Mike D'Antoni favoured an up-tempo style of basketball; this required smaller and more athletic players with the capability to outrun and outshoot their opponents On 21 November 2004, Nash recorded 22 points, 18 assists and 4 steals in a 122–111 win over the LA Clippers [29] Nash's familiarity with this style combined with the athleticism of his teammates produced an NBA-best 62–20 record and a points-per-game average of 110.4, the highest in a decade [30] The catalyst of this turnaround, Nash averaged 11.5 assists per game while making 50.2% of his field goals and 43.1% of his three-pointers in the regular season [17] [31] He edged Shaquille O'Neal to win the 2004–05 NBA MVP award, [32] becoming the first Canadian to earn the honour, as well as the third point guard ever to be named MVP, along with Magic Johnson and Bob Cousy [13] In the 2005 playoffs, Phoenix swept the Memphis Grizzlies in four games before meeting the Dallas Mavericks in the second round [33] Nash led the Suns to a 4–2 series win, [33] and the Suns reached the Western Conference finals for the first time since 1993, but lost to the eventual NBA Champions and arch-rival, the San Antonio Spurs, in five games [33]\n\n\n2004–05 season\nNash joined a Suns team which had emerging young players in Shawn Marion, Joe Johnson, and Amar'e Stoudemire In the season before Nash arrived, the Suns had recorded a 29–53 win–loss record, [8] and they were projected to have another poor season Head coach Mike D'Antoni favoured an up-tempo style of basketball; this required smaller and more athletic players with the capability to outrun and outshoot their opponents On 21 November 2004, Nash recorded 22 points, 18 assists and 4 steals in a 122–111 win over the LA Clippers [29] Nash's familiarity with this style combined with the athleticism of his teammates produced an NBA-best 62–20 record and a points-per-game average of 110.4, the highest in a decade [30] The catalyst of this turnaround, Nash averaged 11.5 assists per game while making 50.2% of his field goals and 43.1% of his three-pointers in the regular season [17] [31] He edged Shaquille O'Neal to win the 2004–05 NBA MVP award, [32] becoming the first Canadian to earn the honour, as well as the third point guard ever to be named MVP, along with Magic Johnson and Bob Cousy [13] In the 2005 playoffs, Phoenix swept the Memphis Grizzlies in four games before meeting the Dallas Mavericks in the second round [33] Nash led the Suns to a 4–2 series win, [33] and the Suns reached the Western Conference finals for the first time since 1993, but lost to the eventual NBA Champions and arch-rival, the San Antonio Spurs, in five games [33]\n\n\n2005–06 season\nIn the next season, Stoudemire suffered a serious knee injury, and Johnson and Quentin Richardson were traded away [34] The Suns were not expected to repeat their successful 2005 season, but with Nash directing the same high-tempo offence, the team compiled a respectable 54–28 record and won the division title [31] [34] On 2 January 2006, Nash recorded 28 points, 5 rebounds and 22 assists in a 140–133 triple overtime loss to the New York Knicks [35] The Suns were again the highest-scoring team in the league with seven players averaging double figures in points per game, [34] and Nash was voted for the first time to start for the 2006 Western All-Star team [36] In the last game of the season, Nash recorded a triple-double of 16 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists in a 106–96 road win over the Trail Blazers [37]\nHaving recorded career highs in points (18.8), rebounds (4.2), field goal percentage (.512) and free throw percentage (a league-leading .921), and leading the league with 10.5 assists per game, [13] Nash was named the league MVP for the second year in a row [38] In the first round of the 2006 playoffs, Phoenix overcame a 3–1 deficit against the Los Angeles Lakers and won the series 4–3 [34] The Los Angeles Clippers were their Conference semifinals opponents, and the Suns again needed seven games to clinch the series [34] For the second year in a row, however, the Suns bowed out in the conference finals, this time to Nash's former team, Dallas [34]\n\n\n2006–07 season\nIn the 2006–07 season, Nash had another stellar campaign, averaging 18.6 points and a career-high 11.6 assists per game while becoming the first person since Magic Johnson in 1990–91 to average 18 points and 11 assists per game during the regular season [39] Nash received the most votes for first-team All-NBA and was joined by teammate Stoudemire; the two were the first teammates to make the first team since Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal in 2003–04 [39] Nash received 129 first-place votes and 645 total points from the panel of 129 media members [39] He narrowly missed being MVP a third consecutive time, coming in second with 44 first place votes to 83 for Dirk Nowitzki [40] In the 2007 playoffs, the Suns eliminated the Lakers in five games before losing 4–2 to the Spurs in the conference semifinals [41]\n\n\n2007–08 season\nNash played in 81 regular season games during the 2007–08 season; in this campaign, the Western Conference was especially competitive and he led the Suns to 55 wins and the sixth seed for the 2008 playoffs Although there was a dip in his regular season output, Nash's shooting remained sharp; the accuracy of his shooting was on par with his 2005–06 MVP campaign (shooting at least 50% from the field, 40% from the three-point arc, and 90% from the free throw line) [17] On 31 January 2008, he collected his All-Star stripes for the sixth time in his career [42] However, Nash continued to experience agony in the playoffs Despite a mid-season trade that sent Shawn Marion to the Miami Heat and brought four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal to the team, the Suns were defeated in the first round of the 2008 playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs for the third time in four years [43] In the deciding Game 5, Nash was perceived to have suffered from \"elimination-game jitters\", and turned over the ball twice in the final two minutes of what was a tight contest [43] Nevertheless, Nash was later named to the All-NBA Second Team for the 2007–08 season [44]\n\n\n2008–09 season\nBefore the 2008–09 season began, coach D'Antoni was replaced by Terry Porter, who preferred a more defensive-oriented style of basketball The Suns had difficulties adapting to this new system, and even a December trade involving sending stalwarts Raja Bell and Boris Diaw to the Charlotte Bobcats for athletic swingman Jason Richardson [45] saw the team continue to struggle Porter was then replaced by Alvin Gentry in February after a 28–23 record, but the Suns were unable to secure the final seed for the 2009 playoffs, [46] resulting in Nash missing the playoffs for the first time since he returned to Phoenix for his second stint.\n\n\n2009–10 season\nNash and the Suns opened the 2009–10 season with a series of strong performances, going 8–1 in their first nine games (a franchise-best since 1980–81), with Nash producing two 20-assists games [47] On 21 January 2010, Nash was named as the starting point guard for the West for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game [48] With him operating at the point, the Suns were the highest-scoring team in the league for the fifth season in a row, and were seeded third in the conference for the 2010 playoffs with 54 wins Behind solid performances by Richardson and veteran Grant Hill, the Suns defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 4–2 in the first round of the playoffs, and swept the Spurs 4–0 in the second round The Suns met the defending champions, Los Angeles Lakers, in the conference finals After losing the first two games, Phoenix won the next two to tie the series A Ron Artest buzzer-beater in Game 5 pushed the Lakers one game closer to the Finals, and Kobe Bryant's 37 points in Game 6 completed the defeat of the Suns.\n\n\n2010–11 season\nThe Suns underwent two major roster changes in the 2010–11 season During the pre-season, Stoudemire left for New York, while longtime teammate Leandro Barbosa was traded for Hedo Türkoğlu Josh Childress, and Hakim Warrick were also recruited to join the Suns Not long after the season began, Türkoğlu, Richardson, and Earl Clark were traded to Orlando for Vince Carter, Marcin Gortat, and Mickaël Piétrus, while rising star Goran Dragić was traded to the Houston Rockets for Aaron Brooks [49] The Suns had difficulty being even a .500 team, and for the second time since Nash returned to Phoenix, the Suns failed to make the 2011 playoffs.\n\n\n2011–12 season\nIn February 2012, Nash was named to his eighth All-Star Game At the time, he was leading the NBA in assists per game [50] On 21 April 2012, Nash passed Oscar Robertson for career assists versus the Denver Nuggets Despite his stellar play the Suns missed the 2012 playoffs for the second consecutive time He finished the season averaging 12.5 points and 10.7 assists per game on 53.2% shooting from the field (tying his career high) Near the end of the 2011–12 season, Nash was named the winner of the PBWA's Magic Johnson Award.\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (2012–2015)\nOn 11 July 2012, the Los Angeles Lakers acquired Nash in a sign-and-trade deal with Phoenix [51] Nash also considered signing with New York or Toronto, but he decided that Los Angeles was the best fit for him and his family [52] Nash switched his jersey number, as his customary No 13 was retired by Los Angeles in honour of Wilt Chamberlain [53] [54] Nash, an avid soccer fan, chose No 10 to pay homage to Glenn Hoddle, Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi and other soccer playmakers who wore the number [55] Entering his 17th NBA season, Nash came to the Lakers with concerns over his defense and the health of his back [56]\n\n\n2012–13 season\nOn 11 July 2012, the Los Angeles Lakers acquired Nash in a sign-and-trade deal with Phoenix [51] Nash also considered signing with New York or Toronto, but he decided that Los Angeles was the best fit for him and his family [52] Nash switched his jersey number, as his customary No 13 was retired by Los Angeles in honour of Wilt Chamberlain [53] [54] Nash, an avid soccer fan, chose No 10 to pay homage to Glenn Hoddle, Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi and other soccer playmakers who wore the number [55] Entering his 17th NBA season, Nash came to the Lakers with concerns over his defense and the health of his back [56]\n\n\n2013–14 season\nDuring the 2013–14 season, Nash continued to suffer nerve problems stemming from his leg injury the prior season In November 2013, he was sidelined for an estimated minimum of two weeks due to nerve root irritation [71] Nash returned on 4 February 2014, shooting 3-for-6 for 7 points On 7 February 2014, his 40th birthday, he scored a season-high 19 points in a victory over the Philadelphia 76ers [72] On 13 March, Nash was ruled out for the remainder of the season by D'Antoni He was suffering from a recurrence of nerve problems stemming from an earlier collision to his left leg with Chicago's Kirk Hinrich, and the Lakers wanted to give Kendall Marshall and Jordan Farmar more playing time However, Nash returned on 21 March after a groin injury to Farmar that was expected to sideline him a minimum of two weeks [73] [74]\n\n\n2014–15 season\nIn July 2014, Nash announced that the 2014–15 season would be his last During the preseason, he experienced back pain, and further aggravated his back while lifting luggage [75] On 23 October, less than a week before the start of what would have been the 40-year-old Nash's 19th year in the NBA, he was ruled out for the season due to a recurring back injury Nash only played in three preseason games before he started to feel more pain in his back Nash spoke on injuring his back, stating: \"Being on the court this season has been my top priority, and it is disappointing to not be able to do that right now I work very hard to stay healthy, and unfortunately my recent setback makes performing at full capacity difficult I will continue to support my team during this period of rest and will focus on my long-term health.\" [76]\n\n\nRetirement and consulting duties\nNash announced his retirement from playing on 21 March 2015 [77] Before the announcement, the Cleveland Cavaliers told Nash's agent that they were interested in having him as a backup for Kyrie Irving if Nash asked for a buyout Nash refused it due to health concerns and his wanting to retire as a Laker in gratitude for the opportunity given by the club [78] Nash was later approached by another former team of his, the Dallas Mavericks, to have one last season with them instead, but he declined due to his aforementioned health concerns [79]\n\n\nCoaching career\nOn 3 September 2020, Nash was announced as head coach of the Brooklyn Nets [86] [87]\n\n\nBrooklyn Nets (2020–2022)\nOn 3 September 2020, Nash was announced as head coach of the Brooklyn Nets [86] [87]\n\n\nNational team career\nIn the early 1990s, Nash was cut from the Canadian junior national team by head coach Ken Olynyk, the father of future NBA player Kelly Olynyk [96] At age 17, he was the youngest member of Team Canada at the Summer Universiade, where the team won a silver medal [97]\n\n\nPlayer profile\nNash was praised for his playmaking, ball-handling skills and shooting He led the league in assists for five years, averaging 11.5 assists per game in 2004–05, 10.5 in 2005–06, 11.6 in 2006–07, 11.0 in 2009–10 and 11.4 in 2010–11 [17] and won the NBA Skills Challenge in 2005 and 2010 [13] As of the end of 2012–13 season, he had a 90.4% career free throw shooting average (formerly the best in NBA history, as of 2013 [update] second to Stephen Curry) [107] [108] and a 42.8% career three-point shooting average (eighth-best in league history), [109] and ranked as one of the top 10 players in league history in total assists, assists per game, and three-point field goals made [110] [111] [112] He is ranked second (starting from 1986–87) in regular season point–assist double doubles [113] In the 2005–06 season, Nash became the fourth player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better from the field, 40% from three-point range (43.9), and 90% from the line, joining Larry Bird, Reggie Miller, and Mark Price in the 50–40–90 club [34] [114] Nash would repeat this feat three more times in the 2007–08, 2008–09 and 2009–10 campaigns [17] Nash (four times), Larry Bird and Kevin Durant (two times each) are the only players to have accomplished this feat more than once [115]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nNash had also previously made statements about his intention to bring Major League Soccer to Vancouver as early as 2011, which he has succeeded

The disaster was caused by a landslide triggered by the breaking off of a portion of the Nanda Devi glacier.\n\n**Cause**\n\nThe flooding was initially speculated to have been caused by a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) triggered by the breaking off of a portion of the Nanda Devi glacier. However, satellite images revealed that no lakes existed in the valley, and a landslide was the primary cause of the disaster. The landslide occurred on the slopes of Nanda Ghunti, a 20,700-foot (6,300-meter) peak on the southwestern rim of the Nanda Devi sanctuary.\n\nAccording to data from Planet Labs, a hanging glacier approximately 15 football fields long and 5 football fields wide separated from a mountain and plummeted into the Ronti Gad, a tributary of the Rishiganga. The resulting landslide triggered a massive flood, affecting several villages and infrastructure in the region.\n\n**Casualties and Damage**\n\nAmong the places most severely hit by the floods were Joshimath, Rini, Nanda Devi National Park, Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower Plant, and Sridhar. The floods caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. Many villages were affected, and several people lost their lives in the disaster.\n\n**Relief Measures**\n\nTo mitigate the impact of the floods, authorities evacuated several villages and emptied two dams farther down the river to stop the floodwaters from reaching towns of Haridwar and Rishikesh. Two C-130J Super Hercules with 3 teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were deployed in the rescue mission.\n\n**Environmental Concerns**\n\nThe geographic state of the area prior to the disaster has been described as \"fragile.\" Scientists had warned the Government of India for many years that the Himalayas had been warming at a dangerously high rate, and the region's ecosystem had become too physically exposed to the dangers of development projects.\n\nDr. Ravi Chopra, the director of the People's Science Institute in Uttarakhand, had advised against building dams in the paraglacial zone, i.e., river valleys in which the floor is higher than 7,000 feet (2,100 meters). However, the Government of India disregarded their objections. According to Dr. Chopra, both the hydro-electric power projects that were washed away in the flood were constructed in this zone.\n\nThe Government of India had built 500 miles (800 kilometers) of highway, much 33 feet (10 meters) wide, in the hills of Uttarakhand to improve approaches to Hindu temples in the high Himalayas, overriding the advice of its own experts. The headman of Reni, the village most adversely affected by the flood, stated that the village residents feared that the blasting of the rocks during the hydropower dam's construction would bring on dangerous landslides.\n\n\"We used to hear blasting and see the rocks shift,\" he said. \"When this project was under construction, half of our village slid. We requested to be shifted from here to another place.
