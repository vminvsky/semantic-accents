{"title": "Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "content": "\nHistory\nDemocratic Party officials often trace its origins to the Democratic-Republican Party, founded by Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and other influential opponents of the conservative Federalists in 1792 [59] [60] That party died out before the modern Democratic Party was organized; [61] the Jeffersonian party also inspired the Whigs and modern Republicans [62] Historians argue that the modern Democratic Party was first organized in the late 1820s with the election of war hero Andrew Jackson [16] of Tennessee, making it the world's oldest active political party [15] It was predominately built by Martin Van Buren, who assembled a wide cadre of politicians in every state behind Jackson [14] [16]\n\n\nBackground\nThe Democratic Party evolved from the Jeffersonian Republican or Democratic-Republican Party organized by Jefferson and Madison in opposition to the Federalist Party [64] The Democratic-Republican Party favored republicanism; a weak federal government; states' rights; agrarian interests (especially Southern planters); and strict adherence to the Constitution The party opposed a national bank and Great Britain [65] After the War of 1812, the Federalists virtually disappeared and the only national political party left was the Democratic-Republicans, which was prone to splinter along regional lines [66] The era of one-party rule in the United States, known as the Era of Good Feelings, lasted from 1816 until 1828, when Andrew Jackson became president Jackson and Martin Van Buren worked with allies in each state to form a new Democratic Party on a national basis In the 1830s, the Whig Party coalesced into the main rival to the Democrats.\n\n\n19th century\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party split over the choice of a successor to President James Monroe [67] The faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, became the modern Democratic Party [68] Historian Mary Beth Norton explains the transformation in 1828: \n\n20th century\nAgrarian Democrats demanding free silver, drawing on Populist ideas, overthrew the Bourbon Democrats in 1896 and nominated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency (a nomination repeated by Democrats in 1900 and 1908) Bryan waged a vigorous campaign attacking Eastern moneyed interests, but he lost to Republican William McKinley [78]\n\n\nEarly 20th century\nAgrarian Democrats demanding free silver, drawing on Populist ideas, overthrew the Bourbon Democrats in 1896 and nominated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency (a nomination repeated by Democrats in 1900 and 1908) Bryan waged a vigorous campaign attacking Eastern moneyed interests, but he lost to Republican William McKinley [78]\n\n\n1930s–1960s and the rise of the New Deal coalition\nThe Great Depression in 1929 that began under Republican President Herbert Hoover and the Republican Congress set the stage for a more liberal government as the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives nearly uninterrupted from 1930 until 1994, the Senate for 44 of 48 years from 1930, and won most presidential elections until 1968 Franklin D Roosevelt, elected to the presidency in 1932, came forth with federal government programs called the New Deal New Deal liberalism meant the regulation of business (especially finance and banking) and the promotion of labor unions as well as federal spending to aid the unemployed, help distressed farmers and undertake large-scale public works projects It marked the start of the American welfare state [82] The opponents, who stressed opposition to unions, support for business and low taxes, started calling themselves \"conservatives\" [83]\n\n\n1960s–1980s and the collapse of the New Deal coalition\nIssues facing parties and the United States after World War II included the Cold War and the civil rights movement Republicans attracted conservatives and, after the 1960s, white Southerners from the Democratic coalition with their use of the Southern strategy and resistance to New Deal and Great Society liberalism Until the 1950s, African Americans had traditionally supported the Republican Party because of its anti-slavery civil rights policies Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Southern states became more reliably Republican in presidential politics, while Northeastern states became more reliably Democratic [86] [87] [88] [45] Studies show that Southern whites, which were a core constituency in the Democratic Party, shifted to the Republican Party due to racial backlash and social conservatism [89] [90] [91]\n\n\n1990s and Third Way centrism\nWith the ascendancy of the Republicans under Ronald Reagan, the Democrats searched for ways to respond yet were unable to succeed by running traditional candidates, such as former vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale and Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, who lost to Reagan and George H.W Bush in the 1984 and 1988 presidential elections, respectively Many Democrats attached their hopes to the future star of Gary Hart, who had challenged Mondale in the 1984 primaries running on a theme of \"New Ideas\"; and in the subsequent 1988 primaries became the de facto front-runner and virtual \"shoo-in\" for the Democratic presidential nomination before a sex scandal ended his campaign The party nevertheless began to seek out a younger generation of leaders, who like Hart had been inspired by the pragmatic idealism of John F Kennedy [97]\n\n\n21st century\nIn the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon as well as the growing concern over global warming, some of the party's key issues in the early 21st century have included combating terrorism while preserving human rights, expanding access to health care, labor rights, and environmental protection Democrats regained majority control of both the House and the Senate in the 2006 elections Barack Obama won the Democratic Party's nomination and was elected as the first African American president in 2008 Under the Obama presidency, the party moved forward reforms including an economic stimulus package, the Dodd–Frank financial reform act, and the Affordable Care Act [101]\n\n\n2000s\nIn the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon as well as the growing concern over global warming, some of the party's key issues in the early 21st century have included combating terrorism while preserving human rights, expanding access to health care, labor rights, and environmental protection Democrats regained majority control of both the House and the Senate in the 2006 elections Barack Obama won the Democratic Party's nomination and was elected as the first African American president in 2008 Under the Obama presidency, the party moved forward reforms including an economic stimulus package, the Dodd–Frank financial reform act, and the Affordable Care Act [101]\n\n\n2010s\nIn the 2010 midterm elections, the Democratic Party lost control of the House as well as its majorities in several state legislatures and governorships In the 2012 elections, President Obama was re-elected, but the party remained in the minority in the House of Representatives and lost control of the Senate in the 2014 midterm elections After the 2016 election of Donald Trump, who lost the popular vote to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party transitioned into the role of an opposition party and held neither the presidency nor Congress for two years [102] However, the party won back the House in the 2018 midterm elections under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\n2020s\nIn November 2020, Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump to win the 2020 presidential election [107] He began his term with extremely narrow Democratic majorities in the U.S House and Senate [108] [109] During the Biden presidency, the party has been characterized as adopting an increasingly progressive economic agenda [33] In 2022, Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman on the Supreme Court However, she was replacing liberal justice Stephen Breyer, so she did not alter the court's 6–3 split between conservatives (the majority) and liberals [110] [111] [112] [113] After Dobbs v Jackson (decided June 24, 2022), which led to abortion bans in much of the country, the Democratic Party rallied behind abortion rights [47]\n\n\nName and symbols\nThe Democratic-Republican Party splintered in 1824 into the short-lived National Republican Party and the Jacksonian movement which in 1828 became the Democratic Party Under the Jacksonian era, the term \"The Democracy\" was in use by the party, but the name \"Democratic Party\" was eventually settled upon [127] and became the official name in 1844 [128] Members of the party are called \"Democrats\" or \"Dems\".\n\n\nStructure\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) is responsible for promoting Democratic campaign activities While the DNC is responsible for overseeing the process of writing the Democratic Platform, the DNC is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than public policy In presidential elections, it supervises the Democratic National Convention The national convention is subject to the charter of the party and the ultimate authority within the Democratic Party when it is in session, with the DNC running the party's organization at other times Since 2021, the DNC has been chaired by Jaime Harrison [142]\n\n\nNational committee\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) is responsible for promoting Democratic campaign activities While the DNC is responsible for overseeing the process of writing the Democratic Platform, the DNC is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than public policy In presidential elections, it supervises the Democratic National Convention The national convention is subject to the charter of the party and the ultimate authority within the Democratic Party when it is in session, with the DNC running the party's organization at other times Since 2021, the DNC has been chaired by Jaime Harrison [142]\n\n\nState parties\nEach state also has a state committee, made up of elected committee members as well as ex officio committee members (usually elected officials and representatives of major constituencies), which in turn elects a chair County, town, city, and ward committees generally are composed of individuals elected at the local level State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions, and in some cases primaries or caucuses, and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law Rarely do they have much direct funding, but in 2005 DNC Chairman Dean began a program (called the \"50 State Strategy\") of using DNC national funds to assist all state parties and pay for full-time professional staffers [143]\n\n\nMajor party committees and groups\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) assists party candidates in House races and is chaired by Representative Suzan DelBene of Washington Similarly, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), chaired by Senator Gary Peters of Michigan, raises funds for Senate races The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), chaired by Majority Leader of the New York State Senate Andrea Stewart-Cousins, is a smaller organization that focuses on state legislative races The Democratic Governors Association (DGA) is an organization supporting the candidacies of Democratic gubernatorial nominees and incumbents Likewise, the mayors of the largest cities and urban centers convene as the National Conference of Democratic Mayors [144]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nThe party's platform blends civil liberty and social equality with support for a mixed capitalist economy [145] On social issues, it advocates for the continued legality of abortion, [47] the legalization of marijuana, [51] and LGBT rights [49]\n\n\nEconomic issues\nThe social safety net and strong labor unions have been at the heart of Democratic economic policy since the New Deal in the 1930s [145] The Democratic Party's economic policy positions, as measured by votes in Congress, tend to align with those of the middle class [46] [167] [168] [169] [170] Democrats support a progressive tax system, higher minimum wages, equal opportunity employment, Social Security, universal health care, public education, and subsidized housing [145] They also support infrastructure development and clean energy investments to achieve economic development and job creation [171]\n\n\nFiscal policy\nDemocrats support a more progressive tax structure to provide more services and reduce economic inequality by making sure that the wealthiest Americans pay more in taxes [174]\nDemocrats and Republicans traditionally take differing stances on eradicating poverty Brady said \"Our poverty level is the direct consequence of our weak social policies, which are a direct consequence of weak political actors\" [175]\nThey oppose the cutting of social services, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, [176] believing it to be harmful to efficiency and social justice Democrats believe the benefits of social services in monetary and non-monetary terms are a more productive labor force and cultured population and believe that the benefits of this are greater than any benefits that could be derived from lower taxes, especially on top earners, or cuts to social services Furthermore, Democrats see social services as essential toward providing positive freedom, freedom derived from economic opportunity The Democratic-led House of Representatives reinstated the PAYGO (pay-as-you-go) budget rule at the start of the 110th Congress [177]\n\n\nMinimum wage\nThe Democratic Party favors raising the minimum wage The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 was an early component of the Democrats' agenda during the 110th Congress In 2006, the Democrats supported six state-ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage and all six initiatives passed [178]\n\n\nHealth care\nDemocrats call for \"affordable and quality health care\" and favor moving toward universal health care in a variety of forms to address rising healthcare costs Progressive Democrats politicians favor a single-payer program or Medicare for All, while liberals prefer creating a public health insurance option [53]\n\n\nEducation\nThe victory of Republican Donald Trump in 2016 brought about a realignment in which many voters without college degrees, also referred to as \"working class\" voters by many sources, voted Republican [310] [311] Until 2016, white voters with college degrees were a Republican-leaning group [38] Despite Obama's decisive 2008 victory, Republican nominee John McCain won a majority of white voters with college degrees 51-47% [312] In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney won white voters with college degrees 56-42%, though Obama won voters with college degrees as a whole 50-48% while winning re-election [313]\n\n\nEnvironment\nDemocrats believe that the government should protect the environment and have a history of environmentalism In more recent years, this stance has emphasized renewable energy generation as the basis for an improved economy, greater national security, and general environmental benefits [190] The Democratic Party is substantially more likely than the Republican Party to support environmental regulation and policies that are supportive of renewable energy [191] [192]\n\n\nRenewable energy and fossil fuels\nDemocrats have supported increased domestic renewable energy development, including wind and solar power farms, in an effort to reduce carbon pollution The party's platform calls for an \"all of the above\" energy policy including clean energy, natural gas and domestic oil, with the desire of becoming energy independent [178] The party has supported higher taxes on oil companies and increased regulations on coal power plants, favoring a policy of reducing long-term reliance on fossil fuels [195] [196] Additionally, the party supports stricter fuel emissions standards to prevent air pollution.\n\n\nTrade\nLike the Republican Party, the Democratic Party has taken widely varying views on international trade throughout its history The Democratic Party has usually been more supportive of free trade than the Republican Party.\n\n\nSocial issues\nThe modern Democratic Party emphasizes social equality and equal opportunity Democrats support voting rights and minority rights, including LGBT rights Democratic president Lyndon B Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed racial segregation Carmines and Stimson wrote \"the Democratic Party appropriated racial liberalism and assumed federal responsibility for ending racial discrimination.\" [210] [211] [212]\n\n\nEqual opportunity\nThe Democratic Party supports equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of sex, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, or national origin The Democratic Party has broad appeal across most socioeconomic and ethnic demographics, as seen in recent exit polls [213] Democrats also strongly support the Americans with Disabilities Act to prohibit discrimination against people based on physical or mental disability As such, the Democrats pushed as well the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, a disability rights expansion that became law [214]\n\n\nVoting rights\nThe party is very supportive of improving voting rights as well as election accuracy and accessibility [216] They support extensions of voting time, including making election day a holiday They support reforming the electoral system to eliminate gerrymandering, abolishing the electoral college, as well as passing comprehensive campaign finance reform [161]\n\n\nAbortion and reproductive rights\nThe Democratic position on abortion has changed significantly over time [217] [218] During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Republicans generally favored legalized abortion more than Democrats, [219] although significant heterogeneity could be found within both parties [220] During this time, opposition to abortion tended to be concentrated within the political left in the United States Liberal Protestants and Catholics (many of whom were Democratic voters) opposed abortion, while most conservative Protestants supported legal access to abortion services [217] [clarification needed]\n\n\nImmigration\nLike the Republican Party, the Democratic Party has taken widely varying views on immigration throughout its history Since the 1990s, the Democratic Party has been more supportive overall of immigration than the Republican Party [223] Many Democratic politicians have called for systematic reform of the immigration system such that residents that have come into the United States illegally have a pathway to legal citizenship President Obama remarked in November 2013 that he felt it was \"long past time to fix our broken immigration system,\" particularly to allow \"incredibly bright young people\" that came over as students to become full citizens [224] In 2013, Democrats in the Senate passed S 744, which would reform immigration policy to allow citizenship for illegal immigrants in the United States The law failed to pass in the House and was never re-introduced after the 113th Congress [225]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nThe Democratic position on LGBT rights has changed significantly over time [230] [231] Before the 2000s, like the Republicans, the Democratic Party often took positions hostile to LGBT rights As of the 2020s, both voters and elected representatives within the Democratic Party are overwhelmingly supportive of LGBT rights [230]\n\n\nStatus of Puerto Rico and D.C.\nThe 2016 Democratic Party platform declares, regarding the status of Puerto Rico: \"We are committed to addressing the extraordinary challenges faced by our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico Many stem from the fundamental question of Puerto Rico's political status Democrats believe that the people of Puerto Rico should determine their ultimate political status from permanent options that do not conflict with the Constitution, laws, and policies of the United States Democrats are committed to promoting economic opportunity and good-paying jobs for the hardworking people of Puerto Rico We also believe that Puerto Ricans must be treated equally by Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs that benefit families Puerto Ricans should be able to vote for the people who make their laws, just as they should be treated equally All American citizens, no matter where they reside, should have the right to vote for the president of the United States Finally, we believe that federal officials must respect Puerto Rico's local self-government as laws are implemented and Puerto Rico's budget and debt are restructured so that it can get on a path towards stability and prosperity\" [152]\n\n\nLegal issues\nWith a stated goal of reducing crime and homicide, the Democratic Party has introduced various gun control measures, most notably the Gun Control Act of 1968, the Brady Bill of 1993 and Crime Control Act of 1994 In its national platform for 2008, the only statement explicitly favoring gun control was a plan calling for renewal of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban [251] In 2022, Democratic president Joe Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which among other things expanded background checks and provided incentives for states to pass red flag laws [252] According to a 2023 Pew Research Center poll, 20% of Democrats owned firearms, compared to 32% of the general public and 45% of Republicans [253]\n\n\nGun control\nWith a stated goal of reducing crime and homicide, the Democratic Party has introduced various gun

Republicans [253]\n\n\nDeath penalty\nThe Democratic Party's 2020 platform states its opposition to the death penalty [166] Although most Democrats in Congress have never seriously moved to overturn the rarely used federal death penalty, both Russ Feingold and Dennis Kucinich have introduced such bills with little success Democrats have led efforts to overturn state death penalty laws, and prevent the reinstatement of the death penalty in those states which prohibit it, including Massachusetts, New York, and Delaware During the Clinton administration, Democrats led the expansion of the federal death penalty These efforts resulted in the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, signed into law by President Clinton, which heavily limited appeals in death penalty cases.\nIn 1972, the Democratic Party platform called for the abolition of capital punishment [254]\n\n\nTorture\nMany Democrats are opposed to the use of torture against individuals apprehended and held prisoner by the United States military, and hold that categorizing such prisoners as unlawful combatants does not release the United States from its obligations under the Geneva Conventions Democrats contend that torture is inhumane, damages the United States' moral standing in the world, and produces questionable results Democrats are largely against waterboarding [259]\n\n\nPrivacy\nThe Democratic Party believes that individuals should have a right to privacy For example, many Democrats have opposed the NSA warrantless surveillance of American citizens [261] [262]\n\n\nForeign policy issues\nThe foreign policy of the voters of the two major parties has largely overlapped since the 1990s A Gallup poll in early 2013 showed broad agreement on the top issues, albeit with some divergence regarding human rights and international cooperation through agencies such as the United Nations [264]\n\n\nIran sanctions\nThe Democratic Party has been critical of Iran's nuclear weapon program and supported economic sanctions against the Iranian government In 2013, the Democratic-led administration worked to reach a diplomatic agreement with the government of Iran to halt the Iranian nuclear weapon program in exchange for international economic sanction relief [266] As of 2014 [update], negotiations had been successful and the party called for more cooperation with Iran in the future [267] In 2015, the Obama administration agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which provides sanction relief in exchange for international oversight of the Iranian nuclear program In February 2019, the Democratic National Committee passed a resolution calling on the United States to re-enter the JCPOA, which President Trump withdrew from in 2018 [268]\n\n\nInvasion of Afghanistan\nDemocrats in the House of Representatives and in the Senate near-unanimously voted for the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists against \"those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United States\" in Afghanistan in 2001, supporting the NATO coalition invasion of the nation Most elected Democrats continued to support the Afghanistan conflict during George W Bush's presidency [269] [270] During the 2008 Presidential Election, then-candidate Barack Obama called for a \"surge\" of troops into Afghanistan [270] After winning the presidency, Obama followed through, sending additional troops to Afghanistan Troop levels were 94,000 in December 2011 and kept falling, with a target of 68,000 by fall 2012 [271]\n\n\nIsrael\nDemocrats have historically been a stronger supporter of Israel than Republicans [278] During the 1940s, the party advocated for the cause of an independent Jewish state over the objections of many conservatives in the Old Right, who strongly opposed it [278] In 1948, Democratic President Harry Truman became the first world leader to recognize an independent state of Israel [279]\n\n\nEurope, Russia, and Ukraine\nThe 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine was politically and economically opposed by the Biden Administration, who promptly began an increased arming of Ukraine [287] [288] In October 2023, the Biden administration requested an additional $61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine for the year ahead, [289] but delays in the passage of further aid by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives inhibited progress, with the additional $61 billion in aid to Ukraine added in April 2024 [290] [291] [292]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs of 2024, the party performs best among voters who are upper income, [293] live in urban regions, [36] [37] college graduates, [38] [13] [39] [40] identify as either Atheist or Agnostic, or are Jewish, [41] [42] Black, LGBT+, and unmarried [45] [46] [43]\n\n\nEducation\nThe victory of Republican Donald Trump in 2016 brought about a realignment in which many voters without college degrees, also referred to as \"working class\" voters by many sources, voted Republican [310] [311] Until 2016, white voters with college degrees were a Republican-leaning group [38] Despite Obama's decisive 2008 victory, Republican nominee John McCain won a majority of white voters with college degrees 51-47% [312] In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney won white voters with college degrees 56-42%, though Obama won voters with college degrees as a whole 50-48% while winning re-election [313]\n\n\nFactions\nUpon foundation, the Democratic Party supported agrarianism and the Jacksonian democracy movement of President Andrew Jackson, representing farmers and rural interests and traditional Jeffersonian democrats [322] Since the 1890s, especially in northern states, the party began to favor more liberal positions (the term \"liberal\" in this sense describes modern liberalism, rather than classical liberalism or economic liberalism) Historically, the party has represented farmers, laborers, and religious and ethnic minorities as it has opposed unregulated business and finance and favored progressive income taxes.\n\n\nLiberals\nModern liberals are a large portion of the Democratic base According to 2018 exit polls, liberals constituted 27% of the electorate, and 91% of American liberals favored the candidate of the Democratic Party [338] White-collar college-educated professionals were mostly Republican until the 1950s, but they had become a vital component of the Democratic Party by the early 2000s [339]\n\n\nModerates\nModerate Democrats, or New Democrats, are an ideologically centrist faction within the Democratic Party that emerged after the victory of Republican George H W Bush in the 1988 presidential election [344] Running as a New Democrat, Bill Clinton won the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections [345] They are an economically liberal and \"Third Way\" faction that dominated the party for around 20 years, until the beginning of Obama's presidency [324] [346] They are represented by organizations such as the New Democrat Network and the New Democrat Coalition.\n\n\nProgressives\nProgressives are the most left-leaning faction in the party and support strong business regulations, social programs, and workers' rights [355] [356] Many progressive Democrats are descendants of the New Left of Democratic presidential candidate Senator George McGovern of South Dakota whereas others were involved in the 2016 presidential candidacy of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders [357] [358]\n\n\nDemocratic presidents\nAs of 2021 [update], there have been

party in the United States. Founded in 1828, the party has a long history of promoting democracy, equality, and freedom. With a diverse range of ideologies and factions, the Democratic Party has played a significant role in shaping American politics.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Democratic Party evolved from the Jeffersonian Republican or Democratic-Republican Party organized by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in opposition to the Federalist Party. The party favored republicanism, a weak federal government, states' rights, and agrarian interests. The Democratic-Republican Party opposed a national bank and Great Britain. After the War of 1812, the Federalists virtually disappeared, and the Democratic-Republicans became the only national political party. The party was prone to splinter along regional lines, and the Era of Good Feelings lasted from 1816 until 1828, when Andrew Jackson became president.\n\n**19th Century**\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party split over the choice of a successor to President James Monroe. The faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, became the modern Democratic Party. Historian Mary Beth Norton explains the transformation in 1828: \"The Democratic Party, with its emphasis on popular democracy, agrarianism, and states' rights, began to take shape as a distinct entity.\"\n\n**20th Century**\n\nAgrarian Democrats demanding free silver, drawing on Populist ideas, overthrew the Bourbon Democrats in 1896 and nominated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency. Bryan waged a vigorous campaign attacking Eastern moneyed interests but lost to Republican William McKinley.\n\n**1930s-1960s and the Rise of the New Deal Coalition**\n\nThe Great Depression in 1929 set the stage for a more liberal government as the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives nearly uninterrupted from 1930 until 1994, the Senate for 44 of 48 years from 1930, and won most presidential elections until 1968. Franklin D. Roosevelt, elected to the presidency in 1932, came forth with federal government programs called the New Deal. New Deal liberalism meant the regulation of business, especially finance and banking, and the promotion of labor unions as well as federal spending to aid the unemployed, help distressed farmers, and undertake large-scale public works projects.\n\n**1960s-1980s and the Collapse of the New Deal Coalition**\n\nIssues facing parties and the United States after World War II included the Cold War and the civil rights movement. Republicans attracted conservatives and, after the 1960s, white Southerners from the Democratic coalition with their use of the Southern strategy and resistance to New Deal and Great Society liberalism. Until the 1950s, African Americans had traditionally supported the Republican Party because of its anti-slavery civil rights policies. Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Southern states became more reliably Republican in presidential politics, while Northeastern states became more reliably Democratic.\n\n**1990s and Third Way Centrism**\n\nWith the ascendancy of the Republicans under Ronald Reagan, the Democrats searched for ways to respond but were unable to succeed by running traditional candidates. Many Democrats attached their hopes to the future star of Gary Hart, who had challenged Mondale in the 1984 primaries running on a theme of \"New Ideas.\" The party began to seek out a younger generation of leaders, who like Hart had been inspired by the pragmatic idealism of John F. Kennedy.\n\n**21st Century**\n\nIn the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, some of the party's key issues in the early 21st century have included combating terrorism while preserving human rights, expanding access to health care, labor rights, and environmental protection. Democrats regained majority control of both the House and the Senate in the 2006 elections. Barack Obama won the Democratic Party's nomination and was elected as the first African American president in 2008. Under the Obama presidency, the party moved forward reforms including an economic stimulus package, the Dodd-Frank financial reform act, and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n**Name and Symbols**\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party splintered in 1824 into the short-lived National Republican Party and the Jacksonian movement, which in 1828 became the Democratic Party. Under the Jacksonian era, the term \"The Democracy\" was in use by the party, but the name \"Democratic Party\" was eventually settled upon and became the official name in 1844. Members of the party are called \"Democrats\" or \"Dems.\"\n\n**Structure**\n\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) is responsible for promoting Democratic campaign activities. The DNC is responsible for overseeing the process of writing the Democratic Platform, but is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than public policy. In presidential elections, it supervises the Democratic National Convention. The national convention is subject to the charter of the party and the ultimate authority within the Democratic Party when it is in session, with the DNC running the party's organization at other times.\n\n**Major Party Committees and Groups**\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) assists party candidates in House races and is chaired by Representative Suzan DelBene of Washington. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), chaired by Senator Gary Peters of Michigan, raises funds for Senate races. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), chaired by Majority Leader of the New York State Senate Andrea Stewart-Cousins, is a smaller organization that focuses on state legislative races. The Democratic Governors Association (DGA) is an organization supporting the candidacies of Democratic gubernatorial nominees and incumbents.\n\n**Political Positions**\n\nThe party's platform blends civil liberty and social equality with support for a mixed capitalist economy. On social issues, it advocates for the continued legality of abortion, the legalization of marijuana, and LGBT rights. On economic issues, it supports a progressive tax system, higher minimum wages, equal opportunity employment, Social Security, universal health care, public education, and subsidized housing.\n\n**Fiscal Policy**\n\nDemocrats support a more progressive tax structure to provide more services and reduce economic inequality by making sure that the wealthiest Americans pay more in taxes. They oppose the cutting of social services, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, believing it to be harmful to efficiency and social justice.\n\n**Gun Control**\n\nWith a stated goal of reducing crime and homicide, the Democratic Party has introduced various gun control measures, most notably the Gun Control Act of 1968, the Brady Bill of 1993, and Crime Control Act of 1994. In 2022, Democratic President Joe Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which among other things expanded background checks and provided incentives for states to pass red flag laws.\n\n**Death Penalty**\n\nThe Democratic Party's 2020 platform states its opposition to the death penalty. Although most Democrats in Congress have never seriously moved to overturn the rarely used federal death penalty, both Russ Feingold and Dennis Kucinich have introduced such bills with little success.\n\n**Torture**\n\nMany Democrats are opposed to the use of torture against individuals apprehended and held prisoner by the United States military, and hold that categorizing such prisoners as unlawful combatants does not release the United States from its obligations under the Geneva Conventions.\n\n**Foreign Policy**\n\nThe Democratic Party has been critical of Iran's nuclear weapon program and supported economic sanctions against the Iranian government. In 2013, the Democratic-led administration worked to reach a diplomatic agreement with the government of Iran to halt the Iranian nuclear weapon program in exchange for international economic sanction relief.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nAs of 2024, the party performs best among voters who are upper income, live in urban regions, college graduates, identify as either Atheist or Agnostic, or are Jewish, Black, LGBT+, and unmarried.\n\n**Education**\n\nThe victory of Republican Donald Trump in 2016 brought about a realignment in which many voters without college degrees, also referred to as \"working class\" voters by many sources, voted Republican.\n\n**Factions**\n\nThe Democratic Party has a diverse range of ideologies and factions.

party died out before the modern Democratic Party was organized; [61] the Jeffersonian party also inspired the Whigs and modern Republicans [62] Historians argue that the modern Democratic Party was first organized in the late 1820s with the election of war hero Andrew Jackson [16] of Tennessee, making it the world's oldest active political party [15] It was predominately built by Martin Van Buren, who assembled a wide cadre of politicians in every state behind Jackson [14] [16]\n\n\nBackground\nThe Democratic Party evolved from the Jeffersonian Republican or Democratic-Republican Party

Feelings, lasted from 1816 until 1828, when Andrew Jackson became president Jackson and Martin Van Buren worked with allies in each state to form a new Democratic Party on a national basis In the

Mondale in the 1984 primaries running on a theme of \"New Ideas\"; and in the subsequent 1988 primaries became the de facto front-runner and virtual \"shoo-in\" for the Democratic presidential

the party and the ultimate authority within the Democratic Party when it is in session, with the DNC running the party's organization at other times Since 2021, the DNC has been chaired by Jaime Harrison [142]\n\n\nNational committee\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) is responsible for promoting Democratic campaign activities While the DNC is responsible for overseeing the process of writing the Democratic Platform, the DNC is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than public policy In presidential elections, it supervises the Democratic National Convention The national convention is subject to the charter of the party and the ultimate authority within the Democratic Party when it is in session, with the DNC running the party's organization at other times Since 2021, the DNC has been chaired by Jaime Harrison [142]\n\n\nState parties\nEach state also has a state committee, made up of elected committee members as well as ex officio committee members (usually elected officials and representatives of major constituencies), which in turn elects a chair County, town, city, and ward committees generally are composed of individuals elected at the local level State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions, and in some cases primaries or caucuses, and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law Rarely do they have much direct funding, but in 2005 DNC Chairman Dean began a program (called the \"50 State Strategy\") of using DNC national funds to assist all state parties and pay for full-time professional staffers [143]\n\n\nMajor party committees and groups\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) assists party candidates in House races and is chaired by Representative Suzan DelBene of Washington Similarly, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), chaired by Senator Gary Peters of Michigan, raises funds for Senate races The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), chaired by Majority Leader of the New York State Senate Andrea Stewart-Cousins, is a smaller organization that focuses on state legislative races The Democratic Governors Association (DGA) is an organization supporting the candidacies of Democratic gubernatorial nominees and incumbents Likewise, the mayors of the largest cities and urban centers convene as the National Conference of Democratic Mayors [144]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nThe party's platform blends civil liberty and social equality with support for a mixed capitalist economy [145] On social issues, it advocates for the continued legality of abortion, [47] the legalization of marijuana, [51] and LGBT rights [49]\n\n\nEconomic issues\nThe social safety net and strong labor unions have been at the heart of Democratic economic policy since the New Deal in the 1930s [145] The Democratic Party's economic policy positions, as measured by votes in Congress, tend to align with those of the middle class [46] [167] [168] [169] [170] Democrats support a progressive tax system, higher minimum wages, equal opportunity employment, Social Security, universal health care, public education, and subsidized housing [145] They also support infrastructure development and clean energy investments to achieve economic development and job creation [171]\n\n\nFiscal policy\nDemocrats support a more progressive tax structure to provide more services and reduce economic inequality by making sure that the wealthiest Americans pay more in taxes [174]\nDemocrats and Republicans traditionally take differing stances on eradicating poverty Brady said \"Our poverty level is the direct consequence of our weak social policies, which are a direct consequence of weak political actors\" [175]\nThey oppose the cutting of social services, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, [176] believing it to be harmful to efficiency and social justice Democrats believe the benefits of social services in monetary and non-monetary terms are a more productive labor force and cultured population and believe that the benefits of this are greater than any benefits that could be derived from lower taxes, especially on top earners, or cuts to social services Furthermore, Democrats see social services as essential toward providing positive freedom, freedom derived from economic opportunity The Democratic-led House of Representatives reinstated the PAYGO (pay-as-you-go) budget rule at the start of the 110th Congress [177]\n\n\nMinimum wage\nThe Democratic Party favors raising the minimum wage The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 was an early component of the Democrats' agenda during the 110th Congress In 2006, the Democrats supported six state-ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage and all six initiatives passed [178]\n\n\nHealth care\nDemocrats call for \"affordable and quality health care\" and favor moving toward universal health care in a variety of forms to address rising healthcare costs Progressive Democrats politicians favor a single-payer program or Medicare for All, while liberals prefer creating a public health insurance option [53]\n\n\nEducation\nThe victory of Republican Donald Trump in 2016 brought about a realignment in which many voters without college degrees, also referred to as \"working class\" voters by many sources, voted Republican [310] [311] Until 2016, white voters with college degrees were a Republican-leaning group [38] Despite Obama's decisive 2008 victory, Republican nominee John McCain won a majority of white voters with college degrees 51-47% [312] In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney won white voters with college degrees 56-42%, though Obama won voters with college degrees as a whole 50-48% while winning re-election [313]\n\n\nEnvironment\nDemocrats believe that the government should protect the environment and have a history of environmentalism In more recent years, this stance has emphasized renewable energy generation as the basis for an improved economy, greater national security, and general environmental benefits [190] The Democratic Party is substantially more likely than the Republican Party to support environmental regulation and policies that are supportive of renewable energy [191] [192]\n\n\nRenewable energy and fossil fuels\nDemocrats have supported increased domestic renewable energy development, including wind and solar power farms, in an effort to reduce carbon pollution The party's platform calls for an \"all of the above\" energy policy including clean energy, natural gas and domestic oil, with the desire of becoming energy independent [178] The party has supported higher taxes on oil companies and increased regulations on coal power plants, favoring a policy of reducing long-term reliance on fossil fuels [195] [196] Additionally, the party supports stricter fuel emissions standards to prevent air pollution.\n\n\nTrade\nLike the Republican Party, the Democratic Party has taken widely varying views on international trade throughout its history The Democratic Party has usually been more supportive of free trade than the Republican Party.\n\n\nSocial issues\nThe modern Democratic Party emphasizes social equality and equal opportunity Democrats support voting rights and minority rights, including LGBT rights Democratic president Lyndon B Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed racial segregation Carmines and Stimson wrote \"the Democratic Party appropriated racial liberalism and assumed federal responsibility for ending racial discrimination.\" [210] [211] [212]\n\n\nEqual opportunity\nThe Democratic Party supports equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of sex, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, or national origin The Democratic Party has broad appeal across most socioeconomic and ethnic demographics, as seen in recent exit polls [213] Democrats also strongly support the Americans with Disabilities Act to prohibit discrimination against people based on physical or mental disability As such, the Democrats pushed as well the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, a disability rights expansion that became law [214]\n\n\nVoting rights\nThe party is very supportive of improving voting rights as well as election accuracy and accessibility [216] They support extensions of voting time, including making election day a holiday They support reforming the electoral system to eliminate gerrymandering, abolishing the electoral college, as well as passing comprehensive campaign finance reform [161]\n\n\nAbortion and reproductive rights\nThe Democratic position on abortion has changed significantly over time [217] [218] During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Republicans generally favored legalized abortion more than Democrats, [219] although significant heterogeneity could be found within both parties [220] During this time, opposition to abortion tended to be concentrated within the political left in the United States Liberal Protestants and Catholics (many of whom were Democratic voters) opposed abortion, while most conservative Protestants supported legal access to abortion services [217] [clarification needed]\n\n\nImmigration\nLike the Republican Party, the Democratic Party has taken widely varying views on immigration throughout its history Since the 1990s, the Democratic Party has been more supportive overall of immigration than the Republican Party [223] Many Democratic politicians have called for systematic reform of the immigration system such that residents that have come into the United States illegally have a pathway to legal citizenship President Obama remarked in November 2013 that he felt it was \"long past time to fix our broken immigration system,\" particularly to allow \"incredibly bright young people\" that came over as students to become full citizens [224] In 2013, Democrats in the Senate passed S 744, which would reform immigration policy to allow citizenship for illegal immigrants in the United States The law failed to pass in the House and was never re-introduced after the 113th Congress [225]\n\n\nLGBT rights\nThe Democratic position on LGBT rights has changed significantly over time [230] [231] Before the 2000s, like the Republicans, the Democratic Party often took positions hostile to LGBT rights As of the 2020s, both voters and elected representatives within the Democratic Party are overwhelmingly supportive of LGBT rights [230]\n\n\nStatus of Puerto Rico and D.C.\nThe 2016 Democratic Party platform declares, regarding the status of Puerto Rico: \"We are committed to addressing the extraordinary challenges faced by our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico Many stem from the fundamental question of Puerto Rico's political status Democrats believe that the people of Puerto Rico should determine their ultimate political status from permanent options that do not conflict with the Constitution, laws, and policies of the United States Democrats are committed to promoting economic opportunity and good-paying jobs for the hardworking people of Puerto Rico We also believe that Puerto Ricans must be treated equally by Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs that benefit families Puerto Ricans should be able to vote for the people who make their laws, just as they should be treated equally All American citizens, no matter where they reside, should have the right to vote for the president of the United States Finally, we believe that federal officials must respect Puerto Rico's local self-government as laws are implemented and Puerto Rico's budget and debt are restructured so that it can get on a path towards stability and prosperity\" [152]\n\n\nLegal issues\nWith a stated goal of reducing crime and homicide, the Democratic Party has introduced various gun control measures, most notably the Gun Control Act of 1968, the Brady Bill of 1993 and Crime Control Act of 1994 In its national platform for 2008, the only statement explicitly favoring gun control was a plan calling for renewal of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban [251] In 2022, Democratic president Joe Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which among other things expanded background checks and provided incentives for states to pass red flag laws [252] According to a 2023 Pew Research Center poll, 20% of Democrats owned firearms, compared to 32% of the general public and 45% of Republicans [253]\n\n\nGun control\nWith a stated goal of reducing crime and homicide, the Democratic Party has introduced various gun control measures, most notably the Gun Control Act of 1968, the Brady Bill of 1993 and Crime Control Act of 1994 In its national platform for 2008, the only statement explicitly favoring gun control was a plan calling for renewal of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban [251] In 2022, Democratic president Joe Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which among other things expanded background checks and provided incentives for states to pass red flag laws [252] According to a 2023 Pew Research Center poll, 20% of Democrats owned firearms, compared to 32% of the general public and 45% of Republicans [253]\n\n\nDeath penalty\nThe Democratic Party's 2020 platform states its opposition to the death penalty [166] Although most Democrats in Congress have never seriously moved to overturn the rarely used federal death penalty, both Russ Feingold and Dennis Kucinich have introduced such bills with little success Democrats have led efforts to overturn state death penalty laws, and prevent the reinstatement of the death penalty in those states which prohibit it, including Massachusetts, New York, and Delaware During the Clinton administration, Democrats led the expansion of the federal death penalty These efforts resulted in the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, signed into law by President Clinton, which heavily limited appeals in death penalty cases.\nIn 1972, the Democratic Party platform called for the abolition of capital punishment [254]\n\n\nTorture\nMany Democrats are opposed to the use of torture against individuals apprehended and held prisoner by the United States military, and hold that categorizing such prisoners as unlawful combatants does not release the United States from its obligations under the Geneva Conventions Democrats contend that torture is inhumane, damages the United States' moral standing in the world, and produces questionable results Democrats are largely against waterboarding [259]\n\n\nPrivacy\nThe Democratic Party believes that individuals should have a right to privacy For example, many Democrats have opposed the NSA warrantless surveillance of American citizens [261] [262]\n\n\nForeign policy issues\nThe foreign policy of the voters of the two major parties has largely overlapped since the 1990s A Gallup poll in early 2013 showed broad agreement on the top issues, albeit with some divergence regarding human rights and international cooperation through agencies such as the United Nations [264]\n\n\nIran sanctions\nThe Democratic Party has been critical of Iran's nuclear weapon program and supported economic sanctions against the Iranian government In 2013, the Democratic-led administration worked to reach a diplomatic agreement with the government of Iran to halt the Iranian nuclear weapon program in exchange for international economic sanction relief [266] As of 2014 [update], negotiations had been successful and the party called for more cooperation with Iran in the future [267] In 2015, the Obama administration agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which provides sanction relief in exchange for international oversight of the Iranian nuclear program In February 2019, the Democratic National Committee passed a resolution calling on the United States to re-enter the JCPOA, which President Trump withdrew from in 2018 [268]\n\n\nInvasion of Afghanistan\nDemocrats in the House of Representatives and in the Senate near-unanimously voted for the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists against \"those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United States\" in Afghanistan in 2001, supporting the NATO coalition invasion of the nation Most elected Democrats continued to support the Afghanistan conflict during George W Bush's presidency [269] [270] During the 2008 Presidential Election, then-candidate Barack Obama called for a \"surge\" of troops into Afghanistan [270] After winning the presidency, Obama followed through, sending additional troops to Afghanistan Troop levels were 94,000 in December 2011 and kept falling, with a target of 68,000 by fall 2012 [271]\n\n\nIsrael\nDemocrats have historically been a stronger supporter of Israel than Republicans [278] During the 1940s, the party advocated for the cause of an independent Jewish state over the objections of many conservatives in the Old Right, who strongly opposed it [278] In 1948, Democratic President Harry Truman became the first world leader to recognize an independent state of Israel [279]\n\n\nEurope, Russia, and Ukraine\nThe 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine was politically and economically opposed by the Biden Administration, who promptly began an increased arming of Ukraine [287] [288] In October 2023, the Biden administration requested an additional $61.4 billion in aid for Ukraine for the year ahead, [289] but delays in the passage of further aid by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives inhibited progress, with the additional $61 billion in aid to Ukraine added in April 2024 [290] [291] [292]\n\n\nDemographics\nAs of 2024, the party performs best among voters who are upper income, [293] live in urban regions, [36] [37] college graduates, [38] [13] [39] [40] identify as either Atheist or Agnostic, or are Jewish, [41] [42] Black, LGBT+, and unmarried [45] [46] [43]\n\n\nEducation\nThe victory of Republican Donald Trump in 2016 brought about a realignment in which many voters without college degrees, also referred to as \"working class\" voters by many sources, voted Republican [310] [311] Until 2016, white voters with college degrees were a Republican-leaning group [38] Despite Obama's decisive 2008 victory, Republican nominee John McCain won a majority of white voters with college degrees 51-47% [312] In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney won white voters with college degrees 56-42%, though Obama won voters with college degrees as a whole 50-48% while winning re-election [313]\n\n\nFactions\nUpon foundation, the Democratic Party supported agrarianism and the Jacksonian democracy movement of President Andrew Jackson, representing farmers and rural interests and traditional Jeffersonian democrats [322] Since the 1890s, especially in northern states, the party began to favor more liberal positions (the term \"liberal\" in this sense describes modern liberalism, rather than classical liberalism or economic liberalism) Historically, the party has represented farmers, laborers, and religious and ethnic minorities as it has opposed unregulated business and finance and favored progressive income taxes.\n\n\nLiberals\nModern liberals are a large portion of the Democratic base According to 2018 exit polls, liberals constituted 27% of the electorate, and 91% of American liberals favored the candidate of the Democratic Party [338] White-collar college-educated professionals were mostly Republican until the 1950s, but they had become a vital component of the Democratic Party by the early 2000s [339]\n\n\nModerates\nModerate Democrats, or New Democrats, are an ideologically centrist faction within the Democratic Party that emerged after the victory of Republican George H W Bush in the 1988 presidential election [344] Running as a New Democrat, Bill Clinton won the 1992 and 1996 presidential elections [345] They are an economically liberal and \"Third Way\" faction that dominated the party for around 20 years, until the beginning of Obama's presidency [324] [346] They are represented by organizations such as the New Democrat Network and the New Democrat Coalition.\n\n\nProgressives\nProgressives are the most left-leaning faction in the party and support strong business regulations, social programs, and workers' rights [355] [356] Many progressive Democrats are descendants of the New Left of Democratic presidential candidate Senator George McGovern of South Dakota whereas others were involved in the 2016 presidential candidacy of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders [357] [358]\n\n\nDemocratic presidents\nAs of 2021 [update], there have been a total of 16 Democratic presidents.\n\n\nRecent electoral

{"title": "Jürgen_Klopp", "content": "\nEarly life and playing career\nJürgen Norbert Klopp was born on 16 June 1967 in Stuttgart, [5] [6] [7] the state capital of Baden-Württemberg, to Elisabeth (1939-2021) [8] and Norbert Klopp (1932-2000) [9] a travelling salesman and a former goalkeeper [10] [11] [12] Klopp grew up in the countryside in the Black Forest village of Glatten near Freudenstadt with two older sisters [7] [12] [13] He started playing for local club SV Glatten and later TuS Ergenzingen as a junior player, [12] with the next stint at 1 FC Pforzheim and then at three Frankfurt clubs, Eintracht Frankfurt II, Viktoria Sindlingen and Rot-Weiss Frankfurt during his adolescence [14] Introduced to football through his father, Klopp was a supporter of VfB Stuttgart in his youth [12] [15] As a young boy, Klopp aspired to become a doctor, but he did not believe he \"was ever smart enough for a medical career,\" saying \"when they were handing out our A-Level certificates, my headmaster said to me, 'I hope it works out with football, otherwise it's not looking too good for you.'\" [16]\n\n\nManagerial career\nUpon his retirement from playing for Mainz 05 in 2 Bundesliga, Klopp was appointed as the club's manager on 27 February 2001 following the dismissal of Eckhard Krautzun [24] [25] The day after, Klopp took charge of their first match, which saw Mainz 05 secure a 1–0 home win over MSV Duisburg [12] [26] [27] Klopp went on to win six out of his first seven games in charge, eventually finishing in 14th place, avoiding relegation with one game to spare [28] In his first full season in charge in 2001–02, Klopp guided Mainz to finish 4th in the league as he implemented his favoured pressing and counter-pressing tactics, narrowly missing promotion Mainz again finished 4th in 2002–03, denied promotion again on the final day on goal difference [12] After two seasons of disappointment, Klopp led Mainz to a third-place finish in the 2003–04 season, securing promotion to the Bundesliga for the first time in the club's history [12] [29]\n\n\nMainz 05\nUpon his retirement from playing for Mainz 05 in 2 Bundesliga, Klopp was appointed as the club's manager on 27 February 2001 following the dismissal of Eckhard Krautzun [24] [25] The day after, Klopp took charge of their first match, which saw Mainz 05 secure a 1–0 home win over MSV Duisburg [12] [26]

again on the final day on goal difference [12] After two seasons of disappointment, Klopp led Mainz to a third-place finish in the 2003–04 season, securing promotion to the Bundesliga for the first time in the club's history [12] [29]\n\n\nBorussia Dortmund\nIn May 2008, Klopp was approached to become the new manager of Borussia Dortmund Despite having interest from German champions Bayern Munich, [15] Klopp eventually signed a two-year contract at the club, which had finished in a disappointing 13th place under previous manager Thomas Doll [33] [34] [35] Klopp's opening game as manager was on 9 August in a 3–1 DFB-Pokal victory away to Rot-Weiss Essen [36] In his first season, Klopp won his first trophy with the club after defeating German champions Bayern Munich to claim the 2008 German Supercup [37] He led the club to a sixth-place finish in his first season in charge [38] The next season Klopp secured European football as he led Dortmund to a fifth-place finish, despite having one of the youngest squads in the league [15] [39]\n\n\n2008–2013: Consecutive league titles; first European final\nIn May 2008, Klopp was approached to become the new manager of Borussia Dortmund Despite having interest from German champions Bayern Munich, [15] Klopp eventually signed a two-year contract at the club, which had finished in a disappointing 13th place under previous manager Thomas Doll [33] [34] [35] Klopp's opening game as manager was on 9 August in a 3–1 DFB-Pokal victory away to Rot-Weiss Essen [36] In his first season, Klopp won his first trophy with the club

football as he led Dortmund to a fifth-place finish, despite having one of the youngest squads in the league [15] [39]\n\n\n2013–2015: Final years at Dortmund\nAt the beginning of the 2013–14 season, Klopp extended his contract until June 2018 [67] Klopp received a fine of €10,000 on 17 March 2014 after getting sent off from a Bundesliga match against Borussia Mönchengladbach [68] The ejection was a result of \"verbal attack\" on the referee, Deniz Aytekin, who stated that Klopp's behaviour was \"rude on more than one occasion\" [69] Borussia Dortmund Vorstand chairman Hans-Joachim Watzke stated that \"I have to support Jürgen Klopp 100 percent in this case\" because he saw no reason for a fine and denied that Klopp insulted the fourth official [69] Dortmund finished the 2013–14 season in second place [70] On 4 January 2014, it was announced that Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowski signed a pre-contract agreement to join Bayern Munich at the end of the season, becoming the second key player after Götze to leave the club within a year [71] Also during the 2013–14 season, Dortmund won the 2013 DFL-Supercup, [72] but were knocked out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals by eventual champions Real Madrid [73]\n\n\nLiverpool\nOn 8 October 2015, Klopp agreed a three-year deal to become Liverpool manager, replacing Brendan Rodgers According to El País, Liverpool co-owner John W Henry did not trust public opinion so he looked for a mathematical method similar to Moneyball, the approach that Henry used for Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox in guiding them to three World Series wins, which he also owns via Fenway Sports Group [83] The mathematical model turned out to be that of Cambridge physicist Ian Graham, which was used to select the manager, Klopp, and players essential for Liverpool to win the Champions League [84] In his first press conference, Klopp described his new side saying \"it is not a normal club, it is a special club I had two very special clubs with Mainz and Dortmund It is the perfect next step for me to be here and try and help\" and stating his intention to deliver trophies within four years [85] [86] During his first conference, Klopp dubbed himself 'The Normal One' in a parody of José Mourinho's famous 'The Special One' statement in 2004 [87]\n\n\n2015–2017: European runners-up and return to Champions League\nOn 8 October 2015, Klopp agreed a three-year deal to become Liverpool manager, replacing Brendan Rodgers According to El País, Liverpool co-owner John W Henry did not trust public opinion so he looked for a mathematical method similar to Moneyball, the approach that Henry used for Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox in guiding them to three World Series wins, which he also owns via Fenway Sports

Mourinho's famous 'The Special One' statement in 2004 [87]\n\n\n2017–2019: First Champions League title\nKlopp's side finished fourth in the 2017–18 Premier League, securing qualification for the Champions League for a second consecutive season [101] Along with the emergence of Andrew Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold as regular starters at fullback, Virgil van Dijk and Dejan Lovren built a strong partnership at the heart of Liverpool's defence, with the Dutchman being credited for improving Liverpool's previous defensive issues [102] [103] [104] Klopp guided Liverpool to their first Champions League final since 2007 in 2018 after a 5–1 aggregate quarter-final win against eventual Premier League champions, Manchester City [105] and a 7–6 aggregate win over Roma in the semi-final [106] However, Liverpool went on to lose in the final 3–1 to Real Madrid [107] This was Klopp's sixth defeat in seven major finals [108] Despite their attacking prowess, Klopp's side had been criticised for their relatively high number of goals conceded, something which Klopp sought to improve by signing defender Virgil van Dijk in the January transfer window, [109] [110] for a reported fee of £75 million, a world record transfer fee for a defender [111] In the summer transfer window, Klopp made a number of high-profile signings including midfielders Naby Keïta and Fabinho, [112] [113] forward Xherdan Shaqiri [114] and goalkeeper Alisson [115]\n\n\n2019–2020: First Premier League title\nKlopp's side started the 2019–20 season by playing Manchester City in the 2019 FA Community Shield, against whom they lost 5–4 on penalties [138] Having qualified as winners of the Champions League, Klopp's side played Europa League champions Chelsea in the Super Cup With the scores level after extra-time, Klopp's side won 5–4 on penalties, giving Klopp his second trophy with the club It was Liverpool's fourth triumph in the tournament, placing them behind only Barcelona and AC Milan with five titles apiece [139] In the 2019–20 Premier League, Klopp's Liverpool won their first six matches to move five points clear at the top of the table After the fourth match week, Klopp was named Premier League Manager of the Month for August, his fourth award of the monthly prize [140] Their 2–1 away victory over Chelsea set a club-record seven successive away league wins and made Liverpool the first Premier League club to win their first six games in successive seasons [141] [142] On 23 September, Klopp was named as The Best FIFA Men's Coach for 2019, ahead of Pep Guardiola and Mauricio Pochettino At the awards ceremony, Klopp revealed that he had signed up to the Common Goal movement, donating 1% of his salary to a charity which funds organisations around the world using football to tackle social issues [143] [144] On 11 October, it was announced that Klopp had been named Manager of the Month for September, winning the award for the second consecutive month [145]\n\n\n2020–2022: Domestic and international success\nAfter winning the opening three league games of the 2020–21 season against Leeds United, Chelsea and Arsenal, on 4 October 2020, Klopp's side lost 7–2 away to Aston Villa It was the first time Liverpool conceded seven goals in a league match since 1963 [171] However, following a controversial draw in the first Merseyside derby of the season, in which defender Virgil van Dijk was injured for the rest of the season, they then bounced back with wins against Sheffield United and West Ham United [172] They went into the international break third in the league and top of their group in the Champions League after a 5–0 win against Atalanta [173] On 22 November, Klopp led Liverpool to a club record 64th consecutive league match unbeaten at Anfield – surpassing the previous record of 63 games under Bob Paisley between 1978 and 1981 – with a 3–0 win over Leicester City [174] On 17 December, Klopp was named the Best FIFA Men's Coach for the second successive year having guided the club to their first league title triumph in 30 years [175] On 20 December, Klopp won the BBC's Sports Coach of the Year [176] A poor run of form in the early part of 2021 – which coincided with Liverpool being without their three senior central defenders who were out injured for the remainder of the season – saw Liverpool as low as eighth in March The club then rallied to go undefeated in their last ten league games, with eight wins and two draws, which saw Liverpool finish 3rd in the league [177] This run of form saw Klopp rely on a new defensive partnership of Nat Phillips and Rhys Williams, both of whom had no prior experience in the Premier League, and included Klopp's first win at Old Trafford, home of arch rivals Manchester United, with Liverpool winning 4–2 [178] The five league wins in May saw Klopp named Premier League Manager of the Month, the ninth time he has received the award [179]\n\n\n2022–2024: Complete set of

[191] On 27 August, Klopp led Liverpool to a 9–0 win over Bournemouth, [192] which was the joint-largest win in the history of the Premier League [193] On 12 October, Klopp led Liverpool to a 7–1 away victory over Rangers in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League, with Mohamed Salah breaking Bafétimbi Gomis' record for the fastest Champions League hat-trick of all time [194] [195] On 5 March 2023, Liverpool recorded their biggest competitive win against Manchester United with a 7–0 victory at Anfield This surpassed Liverpool's previous record set in October 1895, a 7–1 victory in the Second Division [196] [197] Long-term injuries to players such as Thiago Alcântara throughout the season led to the emergence of academy player Curtis Jones as a regular presence in Liverpool's starting line-up towards the end of the season [198] [199] [200] [201] At the end of the 2022–23 season, Liverpool narrowly missed out on UEFA Champions League qualification [202] It was suggested that reasons for this failure to qualify for the Champions League included the declining form of key members of the team [203] [204] [205] [206] [207] and the vast amount of injuries suffered by Liverpool players

best moment to win the ball is immediately after your team just lost it The opponent is still looking for orientation where to pass the ball He will have taken his eyes off the game to make his tackle or interception and he will have expended energy Both make him vulnerable\" [231] The tactic requires great amounts of speed, organisation and stamina, with the idea of regaining possession of the ball as far up the pitch as possible to counter possible counter-attacks [232] It also requires high levels of discipline: The team must be compact to close down spaces for the opponent to thread passes through, and must learn when to stop pressing to avoid exhaustion and protect from long balls passed into the space behind the pressing defence [231] Despite Klopp's pressing tactics resulting in a high attacking output, his Liverpool side was criticised at times for its inability to control games and tendency to concede goals as well as score them [233] However, Klopp developed his tactics to incorporate more possession based football and more defensive and midfield organisation, [234] as well as overseeing the transfers of Alisson Becker, Virgil Van Dijk, Naby Keïta and Fabinho ahead of the 2018–19 season which saw Liverpool achieve their best league start in the club's history, and equal the all-time record for the fewest goals conceded at the mid-point of a top-flight season,

right-hand man, and Klopp reportedly affectionately nicknamed Buvač as \"the brain\", to indicate his importance in the coaching setup [260] Buvač left Liverpool in 2018 The reason given by the club at the time was that he was going to spend time away from the club for \"personal reasons\" [259] [261] However, there were rumours even at the time that Buvač had fallen out with Klopp, and these

He is considered one of the most successful and influential managers in the world, known for his intense and high-intensity playing style, which has been dubbed \"Gegenpressing.\"\n\nEarly life and playing career\n\nJürgen Klopp was born on 16 June 1967 in Stuttgart, the state capital of Baden-Württemberg, to Elisabeth (1939-2021) and Norbert Klopp (1932-2000), a travelling salesman and a former goalkeeper. Klopp grew up in the countryside in the Black Forest village of Glatten near Freudenstadt with two older sisters. He started playing for local club SV Glatten and later TuS Ergenzingen as a junior player, with the next stint at 1 FC Pforzheim and then at three Frankfurt clubs, Eintracht Frankfurt II, Viktoria Sindlingen, and Rot-Weiss Frankfurt during his adolescence. Introduced to football through his father, Klopp was a supporter of VfB Stuttgart in his youth. As a young boy, Klopp aspired to become a doctor, but he did not believe he \"was ever smart enough for a medical career,\" saying \"when they were handing out our A-Level certificates, my headmaster said to me, 'I hope it works out with football, otherwise it's not looking too good for you.'\"\n\nManagerial career\n\nUpon his retirement from playing for Mainz 05 in 2 Bundesliga, Klopp was appointed as the club's manager on 27 February 2001 following the dismissal of Eckhard Krautzun. The day after, Klopp took charge of their first match, which saw Mainz 05 secure a 1–0 home win over MSV Duisburg. Klopp went on to win six out of his first seven games in charge, eventually finishing in 14th place, avoiding relegation with one game to spare. In his first full season in charge in 2001–02, Klopp guided Mainz to finish 4th in the league as he implemented his favoured pressing and counter-pressing tactics, narrowly missing promotion. Mainz again finished 4th in 2002–03, denied promotion again on the final day on goal difference. After two seasons of disappointment, Klopp led Mainz to a third-place finish in the 2003–04 season, securing promotion to the Bundesliga for the first time in the club's history.\n\nMainz 05\n\nUpon his retirement from playing for Mainz 05 in 2 Bundesliga, Klopp was appointed as the club's manager on 27 February 2001 following the dismissal of Eckhard Krautzun.

Despite having interest from German champions Bayern Munich, Klopp eventually signed a two-year contract at the club, which had finished in a disappointing 13th place under previous manager Thomas Doll. Klopp's opening game as manager was on 9 August in a 3–1 DFB-Pokal victory away to Rot-Weiss Essen. In his first season, Klopp won his first trophy with the club after defeating German champions Bayern Munich to claim the 2008 German Supercup. He led the club to a sixth-place finish in his first season in charge. The next season Klopp secured European football as he led Dortmund to a fifth-place finish, despite having one of the youngest squads in the league.\n\n2008–2013: Consecutive league titles; first European final\n\nIn May 2008, Klopp was approached to become the new manager of Borussia Dortmund.

Klopp received a fine of €10,000 on 17 March 2014 after getting sent off from a Bundesliga match against Borussia Mönchengladbach. The ejection was a result of \"verbal attack\" on the referee, Deniz Aytekin, who stated that Klopp's behaviour was \"rude on more than one occasion.\" Borussia Dortmund Vorstand chairman Hans-Joachim Watzke stated that \"I have to support Jürgen Klopp 100 percent in this case\" because he saw no reason for a fine and denied that Klopp insulted the fourth official. Dortmund finished the 2013–14 season in second place. On 4 January 2014, it was announced that Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowski signed a pre-contract agreement to join Bayern Munich at the end of the season, becoming the second key player after Götze to leave the club within a year. Also during the 2013–14 season, Dortmund won the 2013 DFL-Supercup, but were knocked out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals by eventual champions Real Madrid.\n\nLiverpool\n\nOn 8 October 2015, Klopp agreed a three-year deal to become Liverpool manager, replacing Brendan Rodgers. According to El País, Liverpool co-owner John W Henry did not trust public opinion so he looked for a mathematical method similar to Moneyball, the approach that Henry used for Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox in guiding them to three World Series wins, which he also owns via Fenway Sports Group. The mathematical model turned out to be that of Cambridge physicist Ian Graham, which was used to select the manager, Klopp, and players essential for Liverpool to win the Champions League. In his first press conference, Klopp described his new side saying \"it is not a normal club, it is a special club I had two very special clubs with Mainz and Dortmund It is the perfect next step for me to be here and try and help\" and stating his intention to deliver trophies within four years. During his first conference, Klopp dubbed himself 'The Normal One' in a parody of José Mourinho's famous 'The Special One' statement in 2004.\n\n2015–2017: European runners-up and return to Champions League\n\nOn 8 October 2015, Klopp agreed a three-year deal to become Liverpool manager, replacing Brendan Rodgers.

Along with the emergence of Andrew Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold as regular starters at fullback, Virgil van Dijk and Dejan Lovren built a strong partnership at the heart of Liverpool's defence, with the Dutchman being credited for improving Liverpool's previous defensive issues. Klopp guided Liverpool to their first Champions League final since 2007 in 2018 after a 5–1 aggregate quarter-final win against eventual Premier League champions, Manchester City, and a 7–6 aggregate win over Roma in the semi-final. However, Liverpool went on to lose in the final 3–1 to Real Madrid. This was Klopp's sixth defeat in seven major finals. Despite their attacking prowess, Klopp's side had been criticised for their relatively high number of goals conceded, something which Klopp sought to improve by signing defender Virgil van Dijk in the January transfer window, for a reported fee of £75 million, a world record transfer fee for a defender. In the summer transfer window, Klopp made a number of high-profile signings including midfielders Naby Keïta and Fabinho, forward Xherdan Shaqiri, and goalkeeper Alisson.\n\n2019–2020: First Premier League title\n\nKlopp's side started the 2019–20 season by playing Manchester City in the 2019 FA Community Shield, against whom they lost 5–4 on penalties. Having qualified as winners of the Champions League, Klopp's side played Europa League champions Chelsea in the Super Cup. With the scores level after extra-time, Klopp's side won 5–4 on penalties, giving Klopp his second trophy with the club. It was Liverpool's fourth triumph in the tournament, placing them behind only Barcelona and AC Milan with five titles apiece. In the 2019–20 Premier League, Klopp's Liverpool won their first six matches to move five points clear at the top of the table. After the fourth match week, Klopp was named Premier League Manager of the Month for August, his fourth award of the monthly prize. Their 2–1 away victory over Chelsea set a club-record seven successive away league wins and made Liverpool the first Premier League club to win their first six games in successive seasons. On 23 September, Klopp was named as The Best FIFA Men's Coach for 2019, ahead of Pep Guardiola and Mauricio Pochettino. At the awards ceremony, Klopp revealed that he had signed up to the Common Goal movement, donating 1% of his salary to a charity which funds organisations around the world using football to tackle social issues. On 11 October, it was announced that Klopp had been named Manager of the Month for September, winning the award for the second consecutive month.\n\n2020–2022: Domestic and international success\n\nAfter winning the opening three league games of the 2020–21 season against Leeds United, Chelsea, and Arsenal, on 4 October 2020, Klopp's side lost 7–2 away to Aston Villa. It was the first time Liverpool conceded seven goals in a league match since 1963.

in his youth [12] [15] As a young boy, Klopp aspired to become a doctor, but he did not believe he \"was ever smart enough for a medical career,\" saying \"when they were handing out our A-Level certificates, my headmaster said to me, 'I hope it works out with football, otherwise it's not looking too good for you.'\" [16]\n\n\nManagerial career\nUpon his retirement from playing for Mainz 05

from German champions Bayern Munich, [15] Klopp eventually signed a two-year contract at the club, which had finished in a disappointing 13th place under previous manager Thomas Doll [33] [34] [35] Klopp's opening game as manager was on 9 August in a 3–1 DFB-Pokal victory away to Rot-Weiss Essen [36] In his first season, Klopp won his first trophy with the club after defeating German champions

of the 2013–14 season, Klopp extended his contract until June 2018 [67] Klopp received a fine of €10,000 on 17 March 2014 after getting sent off from a Bundesliga match against Borussia Mönchengladbach [68] The ejection was a result of \"verbal attack\" on the referee, Deniz Aytekin, who stated that Klopp's behaviour was \"rude on more than one occasion\" [69] Borussia Dortmund Vorstand chairman Hans-Joachim Watzke stated that \"I have to support Jürgen Klopp 100 percent in this case\" because he saw no reason for a fine and denied that Klopp insulted the fourth official

According to El País, Liverpool co-owner John W Henry did not trust public opinion so he looked for a mathematical method similar to Moneyball, the approach that Henry used for Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox in guiding them to three World Series wins, which he also owns via Fenway Sports Group [83] The mathematical model turned out to be that of Cambridge physicist Ian Graham, which was used to select the manager, Klopp, and players essential for Liverpool to win the Champions League [84] In his first press conference, Klopp described his new side saying \"it is not a normal club, it is a special club I had two very special clubs with Mainz and Dortmund It is the perfect next step for me to be here and try and help\" and stating his intention to deliver trophies within four years [85] [86] During his first conference, Klopp dubbed himself 'The Normal One' in a parody of José Mourinho's famous 'The Special One' statement in 2004 [87]\n\n\n2015–2017: European runners-up and

One' in a parody of José Mourinho's famous 'The Special One' statement in 2004 [87]\n\n\n2017–2019: First Champions League title\nKlopp's side finished fourth in the 2017–18 Premier League, securing qualification for the Champions League for a second consecutive season [101] Along with the emergence of Andrew Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold as regular starters at fullback, Virgil van Dijk and Dejan Lovren built a strong partnership at the heart of Liverpool's defence, with the Dutchman being credited for improving Liverpool's previous defensive issues [102] [103] [104] Klopp guided Liverpool to their first Champions League final since 2007 in 2018 after a 5–1 aggregate quarter-final win against eventual Premier League champions, Manchester City [105] and a 7–6 aggregate win over Roma in the semi-final [106] However, Liverpool went on to lose in the final 3–1 to Real Madrid [107] This was Klopp's sixth defeat in seven major finals [108] Despite their attacking prowess, Klopp's side had been criticised for their relatively high number of goals conceded, something which Klopp sought to improve by signing defender Virgil van Dijk in the January transfer window, [109] [110] for a reported fee of £75 million, a world record transfer fee for a defender [111] In the summer transfer window, Klopp made a number of high-profile signings including midfielders Naby Keïta and Fabinho, [112] [113] forward Xherdan Shaqiri [114] and goalkeeper Alisson [115]\n\n\n2019–2020: First Premier League title\nKlopp's side started the 2019–20 season by playing Manchester City in the 2019 FA Community Shield, against whom they lost 5–4 on penalties [138] Having qualified as winners of the Champions League, Klopp's side played Europa League champions Chelsea in the Super Cup With

the second consecutive month [145]\n\n\n2020–2022: Domestic and international success\nAfter winning the opening three league games of the 2020–21 season against Leeds United, Chelsea and Arsenal, on 4 October 2020, Klopp's side lost 7–2 away to Aston Villa It was the first time Liverpool conceded seven goals in a league match since 1963 [171] However, following a controversial draw in the first Merseyside derby of the season, in which defender Virgil van Dijk was injured for the rest of the season, they then bounced back with wins against Sheffield United and West Ham United [172] They went into the international break third in the league and top of their group in the Champions League after a 5–0 win against Atalanta [173] On 22 November, Klopp led Liverpool to a club record 64th consecutive league match unbeaten at Anfield – surpassing the previous record of 63 games under Bob Paisley between 1978 and 1981 – with a 3–0 win over Leicester City [174] On 17 December, Klopp was named the Best FIFA Men's Coach for the second successive year having guided the club to their first league title triumph in 30 years [175] On 20 December, Klopp won the BBC's Sports Coach of the Year [176] A poor run of form in the early part of 2021 – which coincided with Liverpool being without their three senior central defenders who were out injured for the remainder of the season – saw Liverpool as low as eighth in March The club then rallied to go undefeated in their last ten league games, with eight wins and two draws, which saw Liverpool finish 3rd in the league [177] This run of form saw Klopp rely on a new defensive partnership of Nat Phillips and Rhys Williams, both of whom had no prior experience in the Premier League, and included Klopp's first win at Old Trafford, home of arch rivals Manchester United, with Liverpool winning 4–2 [178] The five league wins in May saw Klopp named Premier League Manager of the Month, the ninth time he has received the award

all time [194] [195] On 5 March 2023, Liverpool recorded their biggest competitive win against Manchester United with a 7–0 victory at Anfield This surpassed Liverpool's previous record set in October 1895, a 7–1 victory in the Second Division [196] [197] Long-term injuries to players such as Thiago Alcântara throughout the season led to the emergence of academy player Curtis Jones as a regular presence in Liverpool's starting line-up towards the end of the season [198] [199] [200] [201] At the end of the 2022–23 season, Liverpool narrowly missed out on UEFA Champions League qualification [202] It was suggested that reasons for this failure to qualify for the Champions League included the declining form of key members of the team [203] [204] [205] [206] [207] and the vast amount of injuries suffered by Liverpool players [208] [209] [210] On 21 May 2023, addressing the reality of being in the Europa League next season, Klopp stated that Liverpool would \"make  [the Europa League] our competition\" [211]\n\n\nManager profile\nKlopp is a notable proponent of Gegenpressing, a tactic in which the team immediately attempts to win back possession after losing the ball, rather than falling back to regroup [228] [229] Klopp has stated that a well-executed counter-pressing system can be more effective than any playmaker when it comes to creating chances [230] Commenting on his pressing tactics, Klopp said that \"The best moment to win the ball is immediately after your team just lost it The opponent is still looking for orientation where to pass the ball He will have taken his eyes off the game to make his tackle or interception and he will have expended energy Both make him vulnerable\" [231] The tactic requires great amounts of speed, organisation and stamina, with the idea of regaining possession of the ball as far up the pitch as possible to counter possible counter-attacks [232] It also requires high levels of discipline: The team must be compact to close down spaces for the opponent to thread passes through, and must learn when to stop pressing to avoid exhaustion and protect from long balls passed into the space behind the pressing defence [231] Despite Klopp's pressing tactics resulting in a high attacking output, his Liverpool side was criticised at times for its inability to control games and tendency to concede goals as well as score them [233] However, Klopp developed his tactics to incorporate more possession based football and more defensive and midfield organisation, [234] as well as overseeing the transfers of Alisson Becker, Virgil Van Dijk, Naby Keïta and Fabinho ahead of the 2018–19 season which saw Liverpool achieve their best league start in the club's history, and equal the all-time record for the fewest goals conceded at the mid-point of a top-flight season, conceding just 7 goals and keeping 12 clean sheets [120]\n\n\nTactics\nKlopp is a notable proponent of Gegenpressing, a tactic in which the team

[120]\n\n\nReception\nKlopp is often credited with pioneering the resurgence of Gegenpressing in modern football, and is regarded by fellow professional managers and players as one of the best managers in the world [244] [245] [246] [247] In 2016, Guardiola suggested that Klopp could be \"the best manager in the world at creating teams who attack\" [248] Klopp has also received praise for building competitive teams without spending as much as many direct rivals, placing emphasis on sustainability over purely short-term success [249]\n\n\nColleagues\nKlopp worked closely with Željko Buvač as his assistant manager, from 2001 until 2018 [259] [260] This 17-year collaboration spanned Klopp's tenures at German football clubs Mainz 05, Borussia Dortmund, and Liverpool Buvač, a Bosnian former professional player, was often referred to as Klopp's right-hand man, and Klopp reportedly affectionately nicknamed Buvač as \"the brain\", to indicate his importance in the coaching setup [260] Buvač left Liverpool in 2018 The reason given by the club at the time was that he was going to spend time away from the club for \"personal reasons\" [259] [261] However, there were rumours even at the time that Buvač had fallen out with Klopp, and these seemed to be confirmed shortly after with reports that Buvač had taken issue with the increasing influence of Pep Lijnders on the coaching setup [262] [263] [264] [265] [260]\n\n\nPost-managerial career\nIn October 2024, Klopp signed with Red Bull as their new Head of Global Football He will start his new role on 1 January 2025 on a four-year contract It was also reported his contract has an exit clause that allows him to apply for the German national job, if and when Julian Nagelsmann steps down [271] The move received widespread condemnation in Germany [272] Fans and journalists alike have criticized Klopp for joining an organisation that uses the multi-club model, something he has been critical of in the past

{"title": "Kratos_(God_of_War)", "content": "\nConcept and design\nWhen designing Kratos, God of War (2005) creator and game director David Jaffe attempted to create a brutal-looking character that did not resemble a typical traditional Greek hero [6] Jaffe wanted the character to be individualistic so Kratos would not wear traditional armor [6] Use of a fully masked character was initially approved but the concept was abandoned because the design seemed \"soulless\" and lacked a \"defined personality\" [6] Some models included unconventional elements, such as Kratos carrying an infant on his back, [6] while others had excessive detail, such as long hair and other \"flowing things\" [6]\n\n\nVoice and actor portrayal\nChristopher Judge, who is best known for his portrayal of Teal'c in Stargate SG-1, replaced Terrence C Carson, who had voiced Kratos since the original God of War, as the voice of Kratos in the 2018 game Commenting in response to the change, Carson said: \"Sony went in a new direction\" [23] Barlog said due to the way the earlier games were made, the studio was able to have someone other than the voice actor perform motion capture Although Carson performed motion capture for Kratos in Ascension, Barlog said the actor change was made because of the type of camera work they wanted to do They needed someone who was closer to Kratos's size to perform motion capture along with 10-year-old Sunny Suljic, who played Kratos's son, Atreus Carson was unsuitable for this because he is much shorter than Kratos, who is over six feet (1.8 m) tall: \"Offsetting  [Carson's height] for the size of a child, it turned out it was going to be almost impossible to try and actually shoot them and go in and redo the animations\" Judge was chosen because he is six feet three inches (1.91 m) tall and had the body of a professional football player Judge accepted the role as an opportunity to add something new to the character He researched the character and Carson's performance but decided not to imitate Carson, instead deciding to start anew because Santa Monica was going in a new direction [24]\n\n\nRole in the God of War series\nThroughout the series, Kratos is portrayed as an antihero, [26] often performing questionable actions His backstory is seen in the original God of War, Kratos's childhood is revealed in Ghost of Sparta, and the birth of his daughter is explored in the God of War comic series (2010–2011) In Ghost of Sparta, it is revealed the oracle had foretold the demise of Olympus would not happen by the hands of the Titans, who were imprisoned after the Great War, but rather by a marked mortal warrior The Olympians Zeus, Athena, and Ares believed this warrior to be Deimos, Kratos's younger brother, due to his strange birthmark Ares and Athena interrupted Kratos and Deimos's childhood training in Sparta and kidnapped Deimos Kratos attempted to stop Ares, who swept him aside and scarred him across his right eye Deimos was then taken to Death's Domain and imprisoned and tortured for many years by the god of death Thanatos Believing Deimos to be dead, Kratos marked himself with a red tattoo identical to his brother's birthmark to honor him [12]\n\n\nGreek era\nThroughout the series, Kratos is portrayed as an antihero, [26] often performing questionable actions His backstory is seen in the original God of War,

of Olympus, and God of War (2005)\nIn Ascension, it is revealed because Kratos renounced and broke his blood oath to Ares, he was imprisoned and tortured by the three Furies The oath keeper Orkos helped Kratos to overcome and kill the Furies To be completely free of Ares's oath, however, Kratos was forced to kill Orkos, who begged Kratos to do so so that he too could be free Although free of his oath to Ares, Kratos was flooded with the memories of killing his family [31] He then vowed to serve the other gods in hopes that they would erase his memories and to receive forgiveness and relief from the nightmares of his past deeds, but he was openly defiant [30]\n\n\nComics (2010–11), Ghost of Sparta, and Betrayal\nThe comic book series (2010–11) shows Kratos's present search for the

Atlantis Callisto attemptsled to reveal the identity of Kratos's father but was transformed against her will into a beast that Kratos was forced to kill Before dying, Callisto advised Kratos to search for his brother Deimos in Sparta Kratos then freed the Titan Thera from imprisonment, causing the destruction of Atlantis and consequently earning him the wrath of Poseidon In Sparta, Kratos learns that Deimos is located in the Domain of Death He finds and frees Deimos, who remained hostile toward his brother The siblings skirmished until Thanatos attacked Deimos, who was rescued by Kratos, and the pair joined forces to battle the god At this point, Thanatos realizes Ares, Athena, and Zeus chose the wrong Spartan; it was Kratos who should have been taken, the mark being his red tattoo and his skin turned white from his family's ashes Thanatos then kills Deimos and Kratos in turn kills Thanatos Kratos then returns to Olympus, enraged at the gods [12] In Betrayal, the other gods have

banished to Tartarus with the other surviving Titans after the First Great War Gaia and her brethren seek Zeus's death Kratos, fueled by anger at his betrayal, agrees to aid the Titans and is instructed to find the Sisters of Fate, who are capable of returning him to the moment of Zeus's treachery Kratos becomes determined and utterly ruthless; in the pursuit of his goal, he wounds a Titan, kills several Greek heroes without hesitation, and sacrifices two scholars, restoring his god powers All three of the Sisters of Fate are killed when they oppose Kratos, who is prepared to kill Zeus in a final confrontation Zeus is saved when Athena intervenes and sacrifices herself for him; only then does Kratos show remorse Kratos learns from a dying Athena that Zeus is his father, a fact Zeus kept secret because he wished to avoid a repetition of what he did to his own father, Cronos Kratos rejects any notion of a relationship and vows to kill Zeus and destroy Olympus Encouraged by Gaia, Kratos uses the power of the Fates to retrieve the Titans before their defeat in the Great War and, with their assistance, storms Mount Olympus [34]\n\n\nGod of War III\nKratos kills Poseidon but Gaia abandons him when his first encounter with Zeus goes poorly Stranded in the Underworld, and now betrayed by both the Olympians and Titans, Kratos learns from the spirit of Athena, who also provides the Blades of Exile, he needs to find the Flame of Olympus, which is the key to defeating Zeus In his quest for the Flame, Kratos murders Titans and gods, ignoring the warnings of his victims Kratos realizes Pandora is the key to pacifying the Flame and reaching Pandora's Box, which is engulfed by the Flame Kratos comes to care for Pandora, who reminds him of his lost daughter Calliope Kratos shows humanity when he attempts to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to quench the Flame but reluctantly allows the act when she says there is no other option Zeus provokes Pandora into sacrificing herself after he states Kratos would fail her like he failed his own family, causing Kratos to release Pandora and attack Zeus in a rage Kratos finds Pandora's Box empty, and is driven berserk by Zeus's mockery Kratos engages Zeus in another fierce battle Gaia interrupts and tries to kill Kratos and Zeus Kratos destroys Gaia and then apparently defeats Zeus Zeus returns in spirit form and attacks Kratos, who retreats into his psyche and forgives himself for his past sins with the help of Pandora Pandora appears and tells Kratos hope would save him Kratos is revived and easily destroys Zeus Athena confronts Kratos and demands he return the power of hope, the contents of Pandora's Box In a selfless act, Kratos refuses, stating his need for vengeance is gone and impales himself with the Blade of Olympus, which disperses the power across the world for mankind's use Athena, disappointed with Kratos, removes the Blade and departes as Kratos collapses next to the Blade of Olympus The post-credits scene shows a trail of blood leading away from the Blade with Kratos's whereabouts unknown [35]\n\n\nNorse era\nDecades after the events of God of War III, Kratos, having

Developed by Santa Monica Studio, the character has undergone significant changes throughout the series, evolving from a brutal and violent anti-hero to a more complex and nuanced character. This article will explore the concept and design of Kratos, his role in the God of War series, and his impact on popular culture.\n\n**Concept and Design**\n\nWhen designing Kratos, God of War (2005) creator and game director David Jaffe attempted to create a brutal-looking character that did not resemble a typical traditional Greek hero. Jaffe wanted the character to be individualistic, so Kratos would not wear traditional armor. The use of a fully masked character was initially approved, but the concept was abandoned because the design seemed \"soulless\" and lacked a \"defined personality.\" Some models included unconventional elements, such as Kratos carrying an infant on his back, while others had excessive detail, such as long hair and other \"flowing things.\"\n\n**Voice and Actor Portrayal**\n\nChristopher Judge, best known for his portrayal of Teal'c in Stargate SG-1, replaced Terrence C. Carson as the voice of Kratos in the 2018 game. Commenting on the change, Carson said, \"Sony went in a new direction.\" Barlog stated that due to the way the earlier games were made, the studio was able to have someone other than the voice actor perform motion capture. Although Carson performed motion capture for Kratos in Ascension, Barlog said the actor change was made because of the type of camera work they wanted to do. Judge was chosen because he is six feet three inches (1.91 m) tall and had the body of a professional football player.\n\n**Role in the God of War Series**\n\nThroughout the series, Kratos is portrayed as an anti-hero, often performing questionable actions. His backstory is seen in the original God of War, Kratos's childhood is revealed in Ghost of Sparta, and the birth of his daughter is explored in the God of War comic series (2010-2011). In Ghost of Sparta, it is revealed the oracle had foretold the demise of Olympus would not happen by the hands of the Titans, but rather by a marked mortal warrior. The Olympians Zeus, Athena, and Ares believed this warrior to be Deimos, Kratos's younger brother, due to his strange birthmark.\n\n**Greek Era**\n\nIn the original God of War, Kratos renounces and breaks his blood oath to Ares, imprisoning and torturing him. To be completely free of Ares's oath, however, Kratos is forced to kill Orkos, who begs Kratos to do so so that he too can be free. Although free of his oath to Ares, Kratos is flooded with the memories of killing his family. He then vows to serve the other gods in hopes that they will erase his memories and to receive forgiveness and relief from the nightmares of his past deeds.\n\n**Comics (2010-11), Ghost of Sparta, and Betrayal**\n\nThe comic book series (2010-11) shows Kratos's present search for the Ambrosia of Asclepius, as he plans to destroy the Ambrosia to prevent worshipers of Ares from resurrecting their former master. Kratos overcomes several enemies, including the Chaos Giant Gyges, before destroying the Ambrosia. Still haunted by the visions of his mortal past in Ghost of Sparta, and against the advice of Athena, Kratos embarked on a quest to find his mother Callisto in the city of Atlantis. Callisto attempts to reveal the identity of Kratos's father but is transformed against her will into a beast that Kratos is forced to kill. Before dying, Callisto advises Kratos to search for his brother Deimos in Sparta. Kratos then frees the Titan Thera from imprisonment, causing the destruction of Atlantis and consequently earning him the wrath of Poseidon.\n\n**God of War II**\n\nKratos joins the Spartan army in Rhodes, intent on destruction. Zeus weakens Kratos and tricks him into abandoning his godly powers into the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus uses to kill him. Kratos overcomes all obstacles but is stunned at Zeus's betrayal and swears revenge as he dies. Kratos falls into the Underworld but is rescued by Gaia, who is banished to Tartarus with the other surviving Titans after the First Great War. Gaia and her brethren seek Zeus's death, and Kratos, fueled by anger at his betrayal, agrees to aid the Titans and is instructed to find the Sisters of Fate, who are capable of returning him to the moment of Zeus's treachery.\n\n**God of War III**\n\nKratos kills Poseidon but Gaia abandons him when his first encounter with Zeus goes poorly. Stranded in the Underworld, and now betrayed by both the Olympians and Titans, Kratos learns from the spirit of Athena, who also provides the Blades of Exile, that he needs to find the Flame of Olympus, which is the key to defeating Zeus. In his quest for the Flame, Kratos murders Titans and gods, ignoring the warnings of his victims. Kratos realizes Pandora is the key to pacifying the Flame and reaching Pandora's Box, which is engulfed by the Flame. Kratos comes to care for Pandora, who reminds him of his lost daughter Calliope. Kratos shows humanity when he attempts to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to quench the Flame but reluctantly allows the act when she says there is no other option. Zeus provokes Pandora into sacrificing herself after he states Kratos would fail her like he failed his own family, causing Kratos to release Pandora and attack Zeus in a rage. Kratos finds Pandora's Box empty and is driven berserk by Zeus's mockery. Kratos engages Zeus in another fierce battle. Gaia interrupts and tries to kill Kratos and Zeus. Kratos destroys Gaia and then apparently defeats Zeus. Zeus returns in spirit form and attacks Kratos, who retreats into his psyche and forgives himself for his past sins with the help of Pandora. Pandora appears and tells Kratos hope would save him. Kratos is revived and easily destroys Zeus. Athena confronts Kratos and demands he return the power of hope, the contents of Pandora's Box. In a selfless act, Kratos refuses, stating his need for vengeance is gone and impales himself with the Blade of Olympus, which disperses the power across the world for mankind's use. Athena, disappointed with Kratos, removes the Blade and departs as Kratos collapses next to the Blade of Olympus.\n\n**Norse Era**\n\nDecades after the events of God of War III, Kratos, having survived his apparent death from releasing the power of hope in Greece, arrives in ancient Scandinavia in the Norse realm of Midgard, and fathers a boy named Atreus, who is unaware of his true nature. Kratos has abandoned his double-chained blades as a symbol of the abandonment his old persona; instead, he uses a battle ax called the Leviathan Axe, which originally belonged to his second wife and Atreus's mother, Laufey (called Faye by Kratos), who recently died. Faye's last wish was for her ashes to be spread at the highest peak of the nine realms. At Midgard's peak, they learn from Mímir that the highest peak is in Jötunheim. During their journey, the Æsir god Baldur confronts them. Thor's sons Modi and Magni help Baldur but are killed by Kratos and Atreus. Around this time, Atreus falls ill; to cure him, Kratos must recover his old weapons, the Blades of Chaos, to battle the beings of Helheim because the Leviathan Axe, which inflicts frost damage, is useless there. While retrieving the blades, Athena appears and goads him about his past. Kratos travels to Hel, killing the troll that guards the realm, and retrieves the cure. After curing him, Kratos reveals to Atreus that he is a god. The pair receives assistance from a witch, who is later revealed to be the Vanir goddess Freya, Baldur's mother, who cast a spell of immortality on him; the spell protects Baldur but causes him to no longer physically feel anything, for which he resents Freya.\n\n**God of War (2018)**\n\nKratos, having survived his apparent death from releasing the power of hope in Greece, arrives in ancient Scandinavia in the Norse realm of Midgard, and fathers a boy named Atreus, who is unaware of his true nature.

relief from the nightmares of his past deeds, but he was openly defiant [30]\n\n\nComics (2010–11), Ghost of Sparta, and Betrayal\nThe comic book series (2010–11) shows Kratos's present search for the Ambrosia of Asclepius, as he plans to destroy the Ambrosia to prevent worshipers of Ares from resurrecting their former master Kratos overcomes several enemies, including the Chaos Giant Gyges, before destroying the Ambrosia [27] Still haunted by the visions of his mortal past in Ghost of Sparta, and against the advice of Athena, Kratos embarked on a quest to find his mother Callisto in the city of Atlantis Callisto attemptsled to reveal the identity of Kratos's father but was transformed against her will into a beast that Kratos was forced to kill Before dying, Callisto advised Kratos to search for his brother Deimos in Sparta Kratos then freed the Titan Thera from imprisonment, causing the destruction of Atlantis and consequently earning him the wrath of Poseidon In Sparta, Kratos learns that Deimos is located in the Domain of Death He finds and frees Deimos, who remained hostile toward his brother The siblings skirmished until Thanatos attacked Deimos, who was rescued by Kratos, and the pair joined forces to battle the god At this point, Thanatos realizes Ares, Athena, and Zeus chose the wrong Spartan; it was Kratos who should have been taken, the mark being his red tattoo and his skin turned white from his family's ashes Thanatos then kills Deimos and Kratos in turn kills Thanatos Kratos then returns to Olympus, enraged at the gods [12] In Betrayal, the other gods have shunned Kratos, who decides to lead his Spartan army to overrun Greece He is falsely accused of murdering Argos and he kills Ceryx, the son of Hermes, for interfering in his search for the true assassin, who escapes [33]\n\n\nGod of War II\nKratos joins the Spartan army in Rhodes, intent on destruction Zeus weakens Kratos and tricks him into abandoning his godly powers into the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus uses to kill him Kratos overomes all obstacles but is stunned at Zeus's betrayal and swears revenge as he dies Kratos falls into the Underworld but was rescued by Gaia, who was banished to Tartarus with the other surviving Titans after the First Great War Gaia and her brethren seek Zeus's death Kratos, fueled by anger at his betrayal, agrees to aid the Titans and is instructed to find the Sisters of Fate, who are capable of returning him to the moment of Zeus's treachery Kratos becomes determined and utterly ruthless; in the pursuit of his goal, he wounds a Titan, kills several Greek heroes without hesitation, and sacrifices two scholars, restoring his god powers All three of the Sisters of Fate are killed when they oppose Kratos, who is prepared to kill Zeus in a final confrontation Zeus is saved when Athena intervenes and sacrifices herself for him; only then does Kratos show remorse Kratos learns from a dying Athena that Zeus is his father, a fact Zeus kept secret because he wished to avoid a repetition of what he did to his own father, Cronos Kratos rejects any notion of a relationship and vows to kill Zeus and destroy Olympus Encouraged by Gaia, Kratos uses the power of the Fates to retrieve the Titans before their defeat in the Great War and, with their assistance, storms Mount Olympus [34]\n\n\nGod of War III\nKratos kills Poseidon but Gaia abandons him when his first encounter with Zeus goes poorly Stranded in the Underworld, and now betrayed by both the Olympians and Titans, Kratos learns from the spirit of Athena, who also provides the Blades of Exile, he needs to find the Flame of Olympus, which is the key to defeating Zeus In his quest for the Flame, Kratos murders Titans and gods, ignoring the warnings of his victims Kratos realizes Pandora is the key to pacifying the Flame and reaching Pandora's Box, which is engulfed by the Flame Kratos comes to care for Pandora, who reminds him of his lost daughter Calliope Kratos shows humanity when he attempts to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to quench the Flame but reluctantly allows the act when she says there is no other option Zeus provokes Pandora into sacrificing herself after he states Kratos would fail her like he failed his own family, causing Kratos to release Pandora and attack Zeus in a rage Kratos finds Pandora's Box empty, and is driven berserk by Zeus's mockery Kratos engages Zeus in another fierce battle Gaia interrupts and tries to kill Kratos and Zeus Kratos destroys Gaia and then apparently defeats Zeus Zeus returns in spirit form and attacks Kratos, who retreats into his psyche and forgives himself for his past sins with the help of Pandora Pandora appears and tells Kratos hope would save him Kratos is revived and easily destroys Zeus Athena confronts Kratos and demands he return the power of hope, the contents of Pandora's Box In a selfless act, Kratos refuses, stating his need for vengeance is gone and impales himself with the Blade of Olympus, which disperses the power across the world for mankind's use Athena, disappointed with Kratos, removes the Blade and departes as Kratos collapses next to the Blade of Olympus The post-credits scene shows a trail of blood leading away from the Blade with Kratos's whereabouts unknown [35]\n\n\nNorse era\nDecades after the events of God of War III, Kratos, having survived his apparent death from releasing the power of hope in Greece, arrives in ancient Scandinavia in the Norse realm of Midgard, and fathers a boy named Atreus, who is unaware of his true nature Kratos has abandoned his double-chained blades as a symbol of the abandonment his old persona; instead, he uses a battle ax called the Leviathan Axe, which originally belonged to his second wife and Atreus's mother, Laufey (called Faye by Kratos), who recently died Faye's last wish was for her ashes to be spread at the highest peak of the nine realms At Midgard's peak, they learn from Mímir the highest peak is in Jötunheim During their journey, the Æsir god Baldur, the brother of Thor, confronts them Thor's sons Modi and Magni help Baldur but are killed by Kratos and Atreus Around this time, Atreus falls ill; to cure him, Kratos must recover his old weapons, the Blades of Chaos, to battle the beings of Helheim because the Leviathan Axe, which inflicts frost damage, is useless there While retrieving the blades, Athena appears and goads him about his past Kratos travels to Hel, killing the troll that guards the realm, and retrieves the cure After curing him, Kratos reveals to Atreus he is a god The pair receives assistance from a witch, who is later revealed to be the Vanir goddess Freya, Baldur's mother, who cast a spell of immortality on him; the spell protects baldur but causes him to no longer physically feel anything, for which he resents Freya.\n\n\nGod of War (2018)\nDecades after the events of God of War III, Kratos, having survived his apparent death from releasing the

stages [82] GamesRadar+ included Kratos as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade, stating while he appeared at first to be a generic character, players eventually learn Kratos is both an \"unstoppable force of nature\" and a \"broken, tragic man\" [83]\n\n\nReception\nVideo game publications have given Kratos a positive reception Magazines, including Guinness World Records Gamer's

player's gameplay style, with a sixth attribute — Relic, being introduced in the Phantom Liberty expansion.\n\n\nSynopsis\nCyberpunk 2077 takes place in Night City, an American megacity in the Free State of North California which functions as a corporatocracy unaffected by federal or state legislation The city suffers from rampant gang violence and corporate warfare, exacerbated by an ineffectual and corrupt municipal government and police force Night City relies on robotic technology for everyday functions such as waste management, building and infrastructure maintenance, and

starting a new life in Night City with local thug Jackie Welles and working together as mercenaries with a netrunner, T-Bug.\n\n\nDevelopment\nPreliminary work on Cyberpunk 2077 began following the release of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition (2012) CD Projekt Red—CD Projekt's internal development studio—approached Mike Pondsmith, the writer of Cyberpunk and founder of R Talsorian Games, in early 2012, sending him a copy of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings (2011) Impressed with the studio's unparalleled knowledge of the Cyberpunk universe at the time, Pondsmith and CD Projekt Red reached an agreement to license Cyberpunk's story from the year 2077 onward to CD Projekt Red, while Pondsmith retained the rights for media in the Cyberpunk universe set up until the year 2077 To ensure Cyberpunk's story remained cohesive during development, Pondsmith served as a consultant on Cyberpunk 2077 Pondsmith's experience at Microsoft developing games such as Crimson Skies (2000) and Blood Wake (2001), and at Monolith Productions developing The Matrix Online (2005), provided valuable wisdom to CD Projekt Red, in comparison to Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski's indifference towards the studio during the development of The Witcher (2007) and The Witcher 2 [37]\n\n\nConcept\nThe concept of Cyberpunk 2077 was adapted from Pondsmith's Cyberpunk series Antithetical to the stereotypical cyberpunk genre, the concepts explored in Cyberpunk evoke a sense of rebellion and whimsy while retaining the genre's grim tone The protagonist of Cyberpunk—in comparison to the typical archetype of a hero attempting to save the world—attempts to save himself, from a downtrodden and lowly perspective [37] Lead gameplay designer Marcin Janiszewski sought to remind players of its connection to the Cyberpunk universe, writing, \"We want to assure fans of the pen-and-paper game that this is still the same Cyberpunk you know\" In comparison to CD Projekt Red's development on The Witcher series, the time difference between the events of Cyberpunk and Cyberpunk 2077 allotted the studio more freedom towards adapting the series, although they attempted to stay true to Pondsmith's original works [38]\n\n\nGame design\nCD Projekt Red used a first-person perspective to immerse the player further in the world and hone in on the megacorporation motif [42] To seamlessly blend cutscenes with gameplay, CD Projekt Red decided to frame cutscenes in first-person, including the sex scenes, with limited exceptions Players can, however, drive in third-person, and the player's character is visible in areas such as mirrors and security cameras [43] The decision by game director Adam Badowski to include nudity was tactfully planned, with Badowski stating, \"Nudity is important for us because of one reason This is cyberpunk, so people augment their body So the body is no longer  [sacred]; it's  [profane]\", expanding upon transhumanist beliefs [44]\n\n\nTechnology\nCyberpunk 2077 was developed using REDengine 4, the fourth iteration of CD Projekt Red's internal game engine [47] REDengine 3, REDengine 4's predecessor, implemented improvements to terrain and vegetation rendering To achieve this, regions are streamed from a clipped mipmap (through a method known as clipmapping) in memory Six clipmaps are created in total; the elevation, control map, and colour clipmaps are streamed, while the vertical error, normal, and terrain shadow clipmaps are generated at runtime In addition, a technique known as tessellation is used, where polygons are divided In particular, polygon triangulation is used, where data is tessellated into triangles The error maps are downsampled prior to hardware tessellation This avoids costly computation, as large areas with high levels of tessellation aren't rendered Furthermore, REDengine3 employs a radical approach to texturing; textures are painted using two textures: a background texture and an overlay texture For slopes, the slope angle is computed and compared against a threshold value Creating a thick cover on slopes was made possible through boosting the overlay texture when the vertex normal looked up; however, this presented complications in ground features, such as cobblestones, where improper distribution was applied To address this, damping was added, along with blend sharpening These measures created an ultimately low memory footprint [48] Other advancements made by REDengine 3 include refined animations, volumetric effects allowing for advanced rendering of particle effects, such as clouds, dynamic physics, and an advanced dialogue mimic system These improvements allowed The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to have a more immersive open-world [49]\n\n\nArt\nWhen designing Night City, the art design team at CD Projekt Red took multiple sources of inspiration German industrial designer Dieter Rams and American neo-futurist concept artist Syd Mead inspired the team, who used Rams' elegance to juxtapose the low-class neighborhoods in Night City and Mead's vibrant colours and materialism to create the demeanor of Night City, in what the team called \"kitsch\" Building these environments took the team eight years [59] To create a cyberpunk look for Night City, the team incorporated retro and futuristic elements To accomplish this, the team looked at dilapidated or old-fashioned buildings—aspects of a familiar reality—with futurism \"For example, you could have a run down building with an old wooden door, but an LED light might be attached to that door, which could be a part of a high-tech security system,\" Hiroshi Sakakibara, Environment City Coordinator at CD Projekt Red, said during a Cyberpunk 2077 livestream at Tokyo Game Show 2020 A key source of inspiration for the team was Blade Runner (1982), which Sakakibara referred to as the \"Bible of all cyberpunk\" [60] Other sources of inspiration for the team include the manga and anime series Ghost in the Shell, and other video games such as System Shock (1994) and the first part of Deus Ex (2000) [61] To design the buildings in Night City, the team consulted with urban planners and drew upon the themes of Brutalist architecture [62] [60] The game's yellow-themed design serves as the antithesis to typical neon art [63] The designs of Marcello Gandini helped shape the appearance of many of the cars in the game [64] A motorbike akin to the one in the Akira manga and anime film appears in the game, as well as a car inspired by Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) [65] [66]\n\n\nAudio\nV is voiced by Gavin Drea and Cherami Leigh for the male and female versions of V, respectively [70] CD Projekt Red sought a suitable voice actor for the role of Johnny Silverhand Keanu Reeves was approached in July 2018 for the role, and noted for his work as Neo in The Matrix franchise Reeves' performance was recorded using motion capture technology, a process he had previously used for his performance as Neo in The Matrix (1999) Although a newcomer to the video game format, Reeves enjoyed the script [71] Silverhand is featured prominently in the game, with CD Projekt co-founder Marcin Iwiński recalling in an interview with Bloomberg News that Silverhand's dialogue count is second only to V [72]\n\n\nMarketing and release\nCyberpunk 2077 was announced in May 2012 [81] Trailers for the game were released in January 2013, [82] at E3 2018, [83] and at E3 2019 [84] The game was initially confirmed for Windows, [85] with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One announced at E3 2018 [83] Stadia was announced in August 2019 [86]\n\n\nRetail editions\nA \"Collector's Edition\" consisting of a custom box, steelbook case, figurine depicting a male V, hardcover artbook, metal pin set and keychain, A Visitor's Guide to Night City, embroidered patches, world compendium, Night City postcards and map, and stickers was released along with the game The standard edition also contains the compendium, postcards, map, and stickers [131] Digital items that come with every copy are the soundtrack, art booklet, Cyberpunk 2020 sourcebook, wallpapers, and Cyberpunk 2077: Your Voice comic [132] Purchases through CD Projekt's subsidiary GOG.com include the digital comic Cyberpunk 2077: Big City Dreams [133]\n\n\nDownloadable content\nPrior to the announcement of the game's only planned expansion, Phantom Liberty, CD Projekt Red released 18 different DLCs for the game which added cosmetics and additional gameplay content One of the DLCs released included content from the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime [136] The expansion, which stars Idris Elba, was released in September 2023 [137]\n\n\nRelated media\nThe World of Cyberpunk 2077, a 192-page art book, [140] was published by Dark

GamesRadar+ [153] The second trailer was considered one of the best at the expo, [154] [155] [156] [157] although writer William Gibson, credited with pioneering the cyberpunk subgenre, described it as \"GTA skinned-over with a generic 80s retro-future\" [158] Gibson later responded more positively to the first gameplay demo [159] The first-person perspective, in contrast with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's third-person, was subject to criticism [160] [161] Cyberpunk 2077 was the most widely discussed game of E3 2019, [162] where it was presented awards for Best of E3 at GamesRadar+, PC Gamer, Rock, Paper, Shotgun, and Ars Technica, [163] [164] [165] [166] and Best Game, People's Choice, Best PS4 Game, Best Xbox One Game, Best PC Game, and Best RPG at IGN [167] The third trailer was lauded

lauded with emphasis on Reeves' reveal [168] [169]\n\n\nPost-release\nThe PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series releases of Cyberpunk 2077 received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic [176] [178] [180] The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game received \"mixed or average\" reviews [177] [179]\n\n\nTechnical issues\nThe release of Cyberpunk 2077 was a high-profile event and was considered a disastrous launch [202] [203] as a result of the game suffering from numerous bugs and performance issues, particularly on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions [b] The Guardian called the release \"a shambles\", [208] while The New York Times said it was among the most conspicuous disasters in the industry's history, with CD Projekt Red prominently failing to meet expectations for what was anticipated to be the biggest game release of the year [202] Other gaming industry commentators have described the post-launch reception of Cyberpunk 2077 as a fall from grace for CD Projekt Red, who had previously enjoyed a fiercely pro-consumer reputation [209] [210]\n\n\nEdgerunners release\nDespite the rampant technical issues that were prevalent during its initial release that affected the game's sales, Cyberpunk 2077 saw an increase in the number of units sold during the year 2022 of up to 18%, with 94% of the sales being digital [231] [232] This increase was partially attributed to the release of the Netflix anime series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, which garnered positive reviews from both critics and fans, [233] [234] and the concurrent release of a game update which added material from the series in the form of multiple items CD Projekt Red recognized the success of Edgerunners having driven sales of Cyberpunk 2077 by stating that \"a significant increase in the amount of the Group's Sales in the third quarter of 2022 in relation to the reference period was mainly due to a good reception of the Cyberpunk Edgerunner update 1.6 which preceded the release on Netflix of the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime series.\" [235] The series would again be referenced in the Cyberpunk 2.0 update that came alongside the Phantom Liberty downloadable content [236]\n\n\nFinancials\nCyberpunk 2077 received eight million pre-orders on all platforms, of which 74% were digital, [237] and it received more pre-orders than The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt; [238] one third of PC sales were through GOG.com [239] It was a best-seller on Steam in China [240] CD Projekt Red has stated that digital preorders for the title alone recouped the game's production cost as well as the game's 2020 marketing cost [241] According to a CD Projekt investors call, sales saw a drastic decline four days after release owing to the technical issues present [242] After the launch, analyst estimations for sales over 12 months fell from 30 million to 25.6 million [243]\n\n\nAwards\nA sequel, internally codenamed \"Project Orion\", was announced in

(1982), which Sakakibara referred to as the \"Bible of all cyberpunk\" [60] Other sources of inspiration for the team include the manga and anime series Ghost in the Shell, and other video games such as System Shock (1994) and the first part of Deus Ex (2000) [61] To design the buildings in Night City, the team consulted with urban planners and drew upon the themes of Brutalist architecture [62] [60] The game's yellow-themed design serves as the antithesis to typical neon art [63] The designs of Marcello Gandini helped shape the appearance of many of the cars in the game [64] A motorbike akin to the one in the Akira manga and anime film appears in the game, as well as a car inspired by Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) [65] [66]\n\n\nAudio\nV is voiced by Gavin Drea and Cherami Leigh for the male

as Neo in The Matrix franchise Reeves' performance was recorded using motion capture technology, a process he had previously used for his performance as Neo in The Matrix (1999) Although a newcomer to the video game format, Reeves enjoyed the script [71] Silverhand is featured prominently in the game, with CD Projekt co-founder Marcin Iwiński recalling in an interview with Bloomberg News that Silverhand's dialogue count is second only to V [72]\n\n\nMarketing and release\nCyberpunk 2077 was announced in May 2012 [81] Trailers for the game were released in January 2013, [82] at E3 2018,

[169]\n\n\nPost-release\nThe PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series releases of Cyberpunk 2077 received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic [176] [178] [180] The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game received \"mixed or average\" reviews [177] [179]\n\n\nTechnical issues\nThe release of Cyberpunk 2077 was a high-profile event and was considered a disastrous launch [202] [203] as a result of the game suffering from numerous bugs and performance issues, particularly on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions [b] The Guardian called the release \"a shambles\", [208] while The New York Times said it was among the most conspicuous disasters in the industry's history, with CD Projekt Red prominently failing to meet expectations for what was anticipated to be the biggest game release of the year [202] Other gaming industry commentators have described the post-launch reception of Cyberpunk 2077 as a fall from grace for CD Projekt Red, who had previously enjoyed a fiercely pro-consumer reputation [209] [210]\n\n\nEdgerunners release\nDespite the rampant technical issues that were prevalent during its initial release that affected the game's sales, Cyberpunk 2077 saw an increase in the number of units sold during the year 2022 of up to 18%, with 94% of the sales being digital [231] [232] This increase was partially attributed to the release of the Netflix anime series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, which garnered positive reviews from both critics and fans, [233] [234] and the concurrent release of a game update which added material from the series in the form of multiple items CD Projekt Red recognized the success of Edgerunners having driven sales of Cyberpunk 2077 by stating that \"a significant increase in the amount of the Group's Sales in the third quarter of 2022 in relation to the reference period was mainly due to a good reception of the Cyberpunk Edgerunner update 1.6 which preceded the release on Netflix of the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime series.\" [235] The series would again be referenced in the Cyberpunk 2.0 update that came alongside the Phantom Liberty downloadable content [236]\n\n\nFinancials\nCyberpunk 2077 received eight million pre-orders on all platforms, of which 74% were digital, [237] and it received more pre-orders than The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt; [238] one third of PC sales were through GOG.com [239] It was a best-seller on Steam in China [240] CD Projekt Red has stated that digital preorders for the title alone recouped the game's production cost as well as the game's 2020 marketing cost [241] According to a CD Projekt investors call, sales saw a drastic decline four days after release owing to the technical issues present [242] After the launch, analyst estimations for sales over 12 months fell from 30 million to 25.6 million [243]\n\n\nAwards\nA sequel, internally codenamed \"Project Orion\", was announced in October 2022 It is being

of Isidore written by the philosopher Damascius in the following century [2]\n\n\nPhilosophy\nOne challenge with determining Proclus' specific doctrines is that the Neoplatonists of his time did not consider themselves innovators; they believed themselves to be the transmitters of the correct interpretations of Plato himself [5] Although the neoplatonic doctrines are much different from the doctrines in Plato's dialogues, it's often difficult to distinguish between different Neoplatonic thinkers and determine what is original to each one [5] For Proclus, this is largely only possible

Cratylus, Parmenides, Republic, Timaeus) In these commentaries, he presents his own philosophical system as a faithful interpretation of Plato, and in this he did not differ from other Neoplatonists, as he considered that \"nothing in Plato's corpus is unintended or there by chance\", that \"Plato's writings were divinely inspired\" (ὁ θεῖος Πλάτων ho theios Platon—the divine Plato, inspired by the gods), that \"the formal structure and the content of Platonic texts imitated those of the universe\", [6] and therefore that they spoke often of things under a veil, hiding the truth from the

ideas.\n\n\nSystematic works\nIn addition to his commentaries, Proclus wrote two major systematic works [7] The Elements of Theology (Στοιχείωσις θεολογική) consists of 211 propositions, each followed by a proof, beginning from the existence of the One (divine Unity) and ending with the descent of individual souls into the material world The Platonic Theology (Περὶ τῆς κατὰ Πλάτωνα θεολογίας) is a

mathematician, and commentator on Plato. He was a prominent figure in the Neoplatonist school in Athens, and his works had a significant influence on Western philosophy, particularly in the areas of metaphysics and epistemology.\n\n## Biography\n\nThe primary source for the life of Proclus is the eulogy Proclus, or On Happiness that was written for him upon his death by his successor, Marinus. Marinus' biography set out to prove that Proclus reached the peak of virtue and attained eudaimonia. There are also a few details about the time in which he lived in the similarly structured Life of Isidore written by the philosopher Damascius in the following century.\n\nProclus was born in Constantinople in 412 CE. His family was of noble descent, and his father, a philosopher and mathematician, died when Proclus was young. Proclus was educated in mathematics, philosophy, and rhetoric, and he showed a particular aptitude for philosophy. He moved to Athens to study with the renowned Neoplatonist teacher, Plutarch of Athens. After Plutarch's death, Proclus succeeded him as the head of the Neoplatonist school in Athens.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nOne challenge with determining Proclus' specific doctrines is that the Neoplatonists of his time did not consider themselves innovators; they believed themselves to be the transmitters of the correct interpretations of Plato himself.

For Proclus, this is largely only possible with Plotinus, the only other Neoplatonic writer for whom a significant amount of writings survive.\n\nProclus' philosophy was heavily influenced by Plato, and he saw himself as a faithful interpreter of Plato's ideas. He believed that the universe is governed by a complex hierarchy of being, with the One at the top and matter at the bottom. He also believed in the concept of the World Soul, which is a divine, eternal, and immortal entity that animates the universe.\n\n## Works\n\nThe majority of Proclus' works are commentaries on dialogues of Plato (Alcibiades, Cratylus, Parmenides, Republic, Timaeus).

February 2009 to register their interest [3] Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, [4] and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid [5] During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain [6]\n\n\nHost selection criticism\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, [9] [10] [11] human rights abuses by Russian authorities, [12] [13] and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society [14] [15] Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea [16] [17] In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that \"the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work\" [18]\n\n\nTeams\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process [49] Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, [50] [51] while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition [citation needed] Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup [52] [53] The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC's qualification, [54] [55] [56] and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015 [57] [58]\n\n\nQualification\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically

qualification, [54] [55] [56] and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015 [57] [58]\n\n\nDraw\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow [63] [64] The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\n\nSquads\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35 [67] From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad [68]\n\n\nOfficiating\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches [70] On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament [71]\n\n\nVideo assistant referees\nShortly after the International Football Association Board's decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament [76] [77]\n\n\nVenues\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg [85] Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, [86] which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\" [87]\n\n\nStadiums\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup Between

upgraded with automated air traffic control systems Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed [120] Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities [121] In Samara, new tram lines were laid [122] Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment [123] Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint

24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later [131] [132] On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times [133] [134]\n\n\nOpening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia [137] [138]\n\n\nGroup stage\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H) Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage

As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\n\n**Host selection criticism**\n\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial. Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government and wider Russian society. Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea. In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that \"the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work.\"\n\n**Teams**\n\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.

Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg [85] Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, [86] which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\" [87]\n\n\nStadiums\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were

Through the next six tournaments, the United States went undefeated, collecting gold while not losing a single contest in the games held in London, Helsinki, Melbourne, Rome, Tokyo, and Mexico City Participation in these tournaments was limited to amateurs, but the US teams during this period featured players who would later go on to become superstars in professional basketball, including all-time greats Bill Russell, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, and Jerry Lucas; the latter three competed on the 1960 Rome team often credited as the best US roster until the formation of the 1992 Dream

medal game, marking the first ever loss for the US in Olympic play, ranks among the most controversial events in Olympic history The United States rode their seven consecutive gold medals and 63–0 Olympic record to Munich for the 1972 Summer Olympics The team won its first eight games in convincing fashion, setting up a final against the Soviet Union, holding a 6–0 advantage over the Soviets in Olympic play [15]\n\n\n1992–2000\nThe decade started with a semifinal loss to Yugoslavia in the 1990 FIBA World Championship, followed by another semifinal defeat to Puerto Rico in the 1991 Pan American Games in Havana The 1990 championship marked the last time that the US was represented by college players at a major international tournament (World Championship & Olympics).\n\n\n2002–2004\nThe 2002 team competed in the World Championship in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States Coached by George Karl, the team finished a surprisingly disappointing sixth in the competition During the tournament, Argentina defeated the US in the second preliminary round group stage, thus becoming the first team ever to defeat a US team composed of NBA players Yugoslavia knocked out the US in the quarterfinals, becoming the first team ever to defeat US team of NBA players in knockout stage Then Spain repeated the outcome in the 5th place playoff [40] To a greater degree than in 2000, a number of top NBA players declined to participate, forcing USA Basketball to resort to picking mostly second-tier players.\nGeorge Karl had a dispute with Paul Pierce, one of the few superstars on the team, which led to Karl benching Pierce, the team's leading scorer, in Team USA's final game The group has been considered one of sport's greatest flops, as they failed to produce as previous teams had The United States lost 3 games in the tournament to countries with current or future NBA stars, like Argentina (led by Manu Ginóbili), Yugoslavia (led by Peja Stojaković and Vlade Divac) and Spain (led by Pau Gasol).\n\n\n2006–2016\nFollowing the disappointments in 2002 and 2004, USA Basketball appointed Jerry Colangelo to be solely responsible for selecting the team Colangelo made it clear that he would ask players for a three-year commitment—the 2006 FIBA World Championship and the 2008 Summer Olympics In the 2006 Worlds, the team was eliminated by Greece in the semifinal, losing the game 101–95 The head coach was Duke University's Mike Krzyzewski, with assistants Jim Boeheim, Mike D'Antoni, and Nate McMillan While some prominent players, such as Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett, stated that they did not plan to play for the team, superstars Dwyane Wade, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James publicly announced their commitment for the 2006 Worlds and the ensuing 2008 Olympics Wade, James and Carmelo Anthony were named captains of the 2006 US World Championship Team.\n\n\n2017–present\nIn 2017, the United States would win a record 7th championship in the FIBA AmeriCup [53] In 2019, the team struggled and finished in 7th place at the FIBA World Cup Despite featuring many young NBA players, it was a huge shock and disappointment [54] The team competed in the 2019 Military World Games and finished with the silver medal behind Team Lithuania [55] [56] At the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, the United States reclaimed their glory by winning the fourth consecutive gold medal Led by top scorers Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, and Devin Booker, the team was able to dominate the tournament and defeat France in the final, despite losing to them early on in the group stage [57]\n\n\nHonors\nOlympic Games\n\n\nOther awards\nPan American Games\n\n\nCompetitive record\nThe US team has achieved unparalleled success in the Olympic games While historically at a disadvantage to the Eastern Bloc countries that had used their best and most experienced professional players listed as soldiers or workers in a profession to subvert the amateur rules, [3] [69] [70] the US team (typically composed of AAU or collegiate players) did surprisingly well, winning nine out of eleven Olympic tournaments they had entered before the introduction of NBA players [9] [10] The US is the only Western country that achieved success in a team sport during the Eastern Bloc dominance Canada's results in ice hockey and Western European teams' results in soccer significantly deteriorated after the introduction of the Eastern Bloc countries and their quasi-professional players in the late 1940s and early 1950s In 1992, the US team was represented by the NBA players for the first time and defeated its opponents by an average of 44 points en route to the gold medal against Croatia [71] The Americans have continued to dominate the Olympic tournaments ever since, excluding underachieving performance at the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\n\nOlympic Games\nThe US team has achieved unparalleled success in the Olympic games While historically at a disadvantage to the Eastern Bloc

national basketball team, also known as the USA Basketball Men's National Team, is the national basketball team of the United States. The team competes in international competitions, including the Olympic Games and the FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\n**History**\n\nThe United States joined FIBA at the end of 1934 under the supervision of the Amateur Athletic Union. The US men were dominant from the first Olympic tournament to hold basketball, held in Berlin in 1936, going 5–0 to win the gold, and joined by continental neighbors Canada and Mexico on the medal platform. Through the next six tournaments, the United States went undefeated, collecting gold while not losing a single contest in the games held in London, Helsinki, Melbourne, Rome, Tokyo, and Mexico City.\n\n**1936–1968**\n\nThe United States joined FIBA at the end of 1934 under the supervision of the Amateur Athletic Union. The US men were dominant from the first Olympic tournament to hold basketball, held in Berlin in 1936, going 5–0 to win the gold, and joined by continental neighbors Canada and Mexico on the medal platform. Through the next six tournaments, the United States went undefeated, collecting gold while not losing a single contest in the games held in London, Helsinki, Melbourne, Rome, Tokyo, and Mexico City. Participation in these tournaments was limited to amateurs, but the US teams during this period featured players who would later go on to become superstars in professional basketball, including all-time greats Bill Russell, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, and Jerry Lucas; the latter three competed on the 1960 Rome team often credited as the best US roster until the formation of the 1992 Dream Team.\n\n**1972–1988**\n\nThe 1972 Olympic men's basketball gold medal game, marking the first ever loss for the US in Olympic play, ranks among the most controversial events in Olympic history. The United States rode their seven consecutive gold medals and 63–0 Olympic record to Munich for the 1972 Summer Olympics. The team won its first eight games in convincing fashion, setting up a final against the Soviet Union, holding a 6–0 advantage over the Soviets in Olympic play.\n\n**1992–2000**\n\nThe decade started with a semifinal loss to Yugoslavia in the 1990 FIBA World Championship, followed by another semifinal defeat to Puerto Rico in the 1991 Pan American Games in Havana. The 1990 championship marked the last time that the US was represented by college players at a major international tournament (World Championship & Olympics).\n\n**2002–2004**\n\nThe 2002 team competed in the World Championship in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. Coached by George Karl, the team finished a surprisingly disappointing sixth in the competition. During the tournament, Argentina defeated the US in the second preliminary round group stage, thus becoming the first team ever to defeat a US team composed of NBA players. Yugoslavia knocked out the US in the quarterfinals, becoming the first team ever to defeat US team of NBA players in knockout stage. Then Spain repeated the outcome in the 5th place playoff. To a greater degree than in 2000, a number of top NBA players declined to participate, forcing USA Basketball to resort to picking mostly second-tier players.\n\n**2006–2016**\n\nFollowing the disappointments in 2002 and 2004, USA Basketball appointed Jerry Colangelo to be solely responsible for selecting the team. Colangelo made it clear that he would ask players for a three-year commitment—the 2006 FIBA World Championship and the 2008 Summer Olympics. In the 2006 Worlds, the team was eliminated by Greece in the semifinal, losing the game 101–95. The head coach was Duke University's Mike Krzyzewski, with assistants Jim Boeheim, Mike D'Antoni, and Nate McMillan. While some prominent players, such as Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett, stated that they did not plan to play for the team, superstars Dwyane Wade, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James publicly announced their commitment for the 2006 Worlds and the ensuing 2008 Olympics. Wade, James and Carmelo Anthony were named captains of the 2006 US World Championship Team.\n\n**2017–present**\n\nIn 2017, the United States would win a record 7th championship in the FIBA AmeriCup. In 2019, the team struggled and finished in 7th place at the FIBA World Cup. Despite featuring many young NBA players, it was a huge shock and disappointment. The team competed in the 2019 Military World Games and finished with the silver medal behind Team Lithuania. At the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, the United States reclaimed their glory by winning the fourth consecutive gold medal. Led by top scorers Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, and Devin Booker, the team was able to dominate the tournament and defeat France in the final, despite losing to them early on in the group stage.\n\n**Honors**\n\n* Olympic Games:\n\t+ Gold medal (1936, 1948, 1952, 1956, 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012, 2016)\n\t+ Silver medal (1976, 1984, 1992)\n* FIBA Basketball World Cup:\n\t+ Gold medal (1954, 1986, 1994, 2014)\n\t+ Silver medal (1959, 1967, 1974)\n* FIBA AmeriCup:\n\t+ Gold medal (1992, 1993, 1997, 2003, 2007, 2017)\n\n**Competitive record**\n\nThe United States men's national basketball team has achieved unparalleled success in the Olympic games. While historically at a disadvantage to the Eastern Bloc countries that had used their best and most experienced professional players listed as soldiers or workers in a profession to subvert the amateur rules, the US team (typically composed of AAU or collegiate players) did surprisingly well, winning nine out of eleven Olympic tournaments they had entered before the introduction of NBA players. The US is the only Western country that achieved success in a team sport during the Eastern Bloc dominance. Canada's results in ice hockey and Western European teams' results in soccer significantly deteriorated after the introduction of the Eastern Bloc countries and their quasi-professional players in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

a moment when mannered indie-pop and roughshod garage-rock were infiltrating the mainstream,  [the band] was earnest, dramatic and unapologetically massive, in a way that made it conspicuously

Born on April 24, 1930, in the Bronx, New York City, Donner has had a storied career spanning over six decades, with a wide range of critically acclaimed and commercially successful films to his credit.\n\n**Early Years**\n\nRichard Donald Schwartzberg was born to Russian Jewish parents, Hattie (Horowitz) and Fred Schwartzberg. His father owned a small furniture-manufacturing business, and his mother was a stay-at-home mother. Donner had a sister, Joan, and his grandfather owned a movie theater in Brooklyn, which had an early influence on his perception of film. Donner's family moved to a small town in New Jersey, where he spent most of his childhood.\n\n**Television**\n\nDonner began his career in television in the late 1950s, working as a writer and director for several popular shows, including _77 Sunset Strip_ and _The Rifleman_. He was nominated for a CableACE Award for Best Dramatic Series for his work on _L.A. Law_. Donner's television work laid the foundation for his future success in film.\n\n**Films**\n\nDonner's first feature film was _X-15_ (1961), which starred David McLean, Charles Bronson, and Mary Tyler Moore. Seven years passed before he directed his next film, _Salt and Pepper_ (1968), with Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford. Donner's breakthrough film was _The Omen_ (1976), a supernatural horror made in the wake of the success of _The Exorcist_. The film stars Gregory Peck, David Warner, and Lee Remick and was the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1976.\n\n**Superman (1978)**\n\nIn 1978, Donner directed _Superman: The Movie_, starring Christopher Reeve in the title role. Donner approached the film with the concept of creating verisimilitude, an intuitive feeling evoked in the audience that makes the fantasy story feel real within the story's context. It was a hit worldwide, projecting Reeve to international fame. The film co-starred Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, Marlon Brando as Jor-El, and Gene Hackman as archvillain Lex Luthor. At the box office, it grossed $134 million domestically.\n\n**1980s and 1990s**\n\nDonner directed mixed commercial flops (_Inside Moves, Radio Flyer_) and successes (_The Goonies, the Lethal Weapon series, Scrooged, and Conspiracy Theory_). Donner's next blockbuster film was the action comedy _Lethal Weapon_, written by Shane Black. It starred Mel Gibson as a widowed narcotics detective with a suicidal bent \"who breaks every rule for the sheer joy of it.\" It co-starred Danny Glover as a calm homicide detective with a loving family and consideration for retirement. The film's action sequences were considered \"truly spectacular\" and made the film one of the year's biggest hits.\n\n**Lethal Weapon (1987-1998)**\n\nDonner's _Lethal Weapon_ series became one of the most successful franchises of the 1980s and 1990s, with four films released between 1987 and 1998. The series followed the adventures of Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) as they battled crime and corruption in Los Angeles.\n\n**X-Men**\n\nDonner became the executive producer for the 2000 Marvel Comics film _X-Men_, then also an executive producer for the 2009 X-Men prequel, _X-Men Origins: Wolverine_. In addition, Donner's wife has produced all of the films in the X-Men film series under their Donners' Company brand.\n\n**Unrealized Projects**\n\nDonner was the first choice to direct the \"unofficial\" James Bond film _Never Say Never Again_, but turned it down after he decided he disliked Lorenzo Semple Jr.'s script. He would have served as director of _Jurassic Park_ had Columbia/TriStar won the bidding war for the screen rights against other studios. Donner was also considered as director for _The Lost Boys, The Last Boy Scout, Memoirs of an Invisible Man, Dave, Forever Young, and The Sandlot_. In 2001, Donner claimed he planned to direct a sequel to _The Goonies_ after _Timeline_, and he planned to direct the fifth and final _Lethal Weapon_ film before his death in 2021.\n\n**Books**\n\nOne of Donner's assistants in the late 1990s was comic book writer Geoff Johns. In October 2006, Donner, Johns, and artist Adam Kubert became the new creative team on _Action Comics_, the publisher's most time honored publication and one of DC Comics' two main Superman titles. Together, Johns and Donner collaborated on the stories _Last Son_ and _Escape from Bizarro World_, both of which have been released in collected book form. Donner and Johns also co-wrote a story for _Action Comics #1000_, released in April 2018.\n\n**Comic Books**\n\nDonner was an avid comic book fan and had a long-standing relationship with DC Comics. He worked closely with writer Geoff Johns on several projects, including _Action Comics_ and _Superman: Last Son_.\n\n**Biography**\n\nIn 2010, Donner's authorized biography titled _You're the Director.. You Figure It Out: The Life and Films of Richard Donner_ by James Christie was published by BearManor Media. The book features a foreword by Mel Gibson.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nDonner married film producer Lauren Shuler on November 27, 1985. The two merged their respective production companies to create Shuler-Donner Productions (now The Donners' Company) the same year. Donner and Shuler remained together until the former's death.\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\n* CableACE Award for Best Dramatic Series\n* Academy Award nomination for _The Omen_ (1976)\n* Emmy Award nomination for _L.A.

[15]\n\n\nFounding and initial growth (2005–2006)\nYouTube was founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim The trio were early employees of PayPal, which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay [14] Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign [15]\n\n\n\"Broadcast Yourself\" era (2006–2013)\nOn October 9, 2006, Google announced that they had acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock [40] [41] The deal was finalized on November 13, 2006 [42] [43] Google's acquisition launched newfound interest in video-sharing sites; IAC, which now owned Vimeo, focused on supporting the content creators to distinguish itself from YouTube [32] It is at this time YouTube issued the slogan \"Broadcast Yourself\".\nThe company experienced rapid growth The Daily Telegraph wrote that in 2007, YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000 [44] By 2010, the company had reached a market share of around 43% and more than 14 billion views of videos, according to comScore [45] That year, the company simplified its interface to increase the time users would spend on the site [46] In 2011, more than three billion videos were being watched each day with 48 hours of new videos uploaded every minute [47] [48] [49] However, most of these views came from a relatively small number of videos; according to a software engineer at that time, 30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site [50] That year, the company again changed its interface and at the same time, introduced a new logo with a darker shade of red [51] [52] A subsequent interface change, designed to unify the experience across desktop, TV, and mobile, was rolled out in 2013 [53] By that point, more than 100 hours were being uploaded every minute, increasing to 300 hours by November 2014 [54] [55]\n\n\nSusan Wojcicki and going mainstream (2014–2018)\nSusan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube in February 2014 [61] In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215 million The complex has 51,468 square metres (554,000 square feet) of space and can house up to 2,800 employees [62] YouTube officially launched the \"polymer\" redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design language as its default, as well a redesigned logo that is built around the service's play button emblem in August 2017 [63]\n\n\nRecent history (2019–present)\nBy February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube videos were being watched every day, and 400 hours worth of videos were uploaded every minute [7] [76] Two years later, the uploads had risen to more than 500 hours per minute [8] During the COVID-19 pandemic, when most of the world was under stay-at-home orders, usage of services like YouTube significantly increased One data firm [which?] estimated that YouTube was accounting for 15% of all internet traffic, twice its pre-pandemic level [77] In response to EU officials requesting that such services reduce bandwidth as to make sure medical entities had sufficient bandwidth to share information, YouTube and Netflix stated they would reduce streaming quality for at least thirty days as to cut bandwidth use of their services by 25% to comply with the EU's request [78] YouTube later announced that they would continue with this move worldwide: \"We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation.\" [79]\n\n\nSenior leadership\nYouTube has been led by a CEO since its founding in 2005, beginning with Chad Hurley, who led the company until 2010 After Google's acquisition of YouTube, the CEO role was retained Salar Kamangar took over Hurley's position and kept the job until 2014 He was replaced by Susan Wojcicki, who later resigned in 2023 [98] The current CEO is Neal Mohan, who was appointed on February 16, 2023 [98]\n\n\nFeatures\nYouTube offers different features based on user verification, such as standard or basic features like uploading videos, creating playlists, and using YouTube Music, with limits based on daily activity (verification via phone number or channel history increases feature availability and daily usage limits); intermediate or additional features like longer videos (over 15 minutes), live streaming, custom thumbnails, and creating podcasts; advanced features like content ID appeals, embedding live streams, applying for monetization, clickable links, adding chapters, and pinning comments on videos or posts [103]\n\n\nVideos\nIn January 2012, it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site, in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical US citizen watching television [104] In 2017, viewers on average watched YouTube on mobile devices for more than an hour every day [105]\n\n\nCopyright issues\nYouTube has faced numerous challenges and criticisms in its attempts to deal with copyright, including the site's first viral video, Lazy Sunday, which had to be taken down, due to copyright concerns [33] At the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws [115] Despite this advice, many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted [116] [117] From 2007 to 2009 organizations including Viacom, Mediaset, and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material [118] [119] [120]\n\n\nContent ID\nIn June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright Google CEO Eric Schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom, which alleged that YouTube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute [131] The system, which was initially called \"Video Identification\" [132] [133] and later became known as Content ID, [134] creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found [135] When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video.\n\n\nModeration and offensive content\nYouTube has a set of community guidelines aimed to reduce abuse of the site's features The uploading of videos containing defamation, pornography, and material encouraging criminal conduct is forbidden by YouTube's \"Community Guidelines\" [142] [better source needed] Generally prohibited material includes sexually explicit content, videos of animal abuse, shock videos, content uploaded without the copyright holder's consent, hate speech, spam, and predatory behavior [142] YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate, and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site's guidelines [142] Despite the guidelines,YouTube has faced criticism over aspects of its operations, [143] its recommendation algorithms perpetuating videos that promote conspiracy theories and falsehoods, [144] hosting videos ostensibly targeting children but containing violent or sexually suggestive content involving popular characters, [145] videos of minors attracting pedophilic activities in their comment sections, [146] and fluctuating policies on the types of content that is eligible to be monetized with advertising [143]\n\n\nConspiracy theories and far-right content\nYouTube has been criticized for using an algorithm that gives great prominence to videos that promote conspiracy theories, falsehoods and incendiary fringe discourse [157] [158] [159] [160] According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal, \"YouTube's recommendations often lead users to channels that feature conspiracy theories, partisan viewpoints and misleading videos, even when those users haven't shown interest in such content When users show a political bias in what they choose to view, YouTube typically recommends videos that echo those biases, often with more-extreme viewpoints.\" [157] [161] After YouTube drew controversy for giving top billing to videos promoting falsehoods and conspiracy when people made breaking-news queries during the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, YouTube changed its algorithm to give greater prominence to mainstream media sources [157] [162] [163] [164]\n\n\nUse among white supremacists\nBefore 2019, YouTube took steps to remove specific videos or channels related to supremacist content that had violated its acceptable use policies but otherwise did not have site-wide policies against hate speech [168]\n\n\nMisinformation and handling of the COVID-19 pandemic\nMultiple research studies have investigated cases of misinformation in YouTube In a July 2019 study based on ten YouTube searches using the Tor Browser related to climate and climate change, the majority of videos were videos that communicated views contrary to the scientific consensus on climate change [177] A May 2023 study found that YouTube was monetizing and profiting from videos that included misinformation about climate change [178] A 2019 BBC investigation of YouTube searches in ten different languages found that YouTube's algorithm promoted health misinformation, including fake cancer cures [179] In Brazil, YouTube has been linked to pushing pseudoscientific misinformation on health matters, as well as elevated far-right fringe discourse and conspiracy theories [180] In the Philippines, numerous channels disseminated misinformation related to the 2022 Philippine elections [181] Additionally, research on the dissemination of Flat Earth beliefs in social media, has shown that networks of YouTube channels form an echo chamber that polarizes audiences by appearing to confirm preexisting beliefs [182]\n\n\nChild safety and wellbeing\nLeading into 2017, there was a significant increase in the number of videos related to children, coupled between the popularity of parents vlogging their family's activities, and previous content creators moving away from content that often was criticized or demonetized into family-friendly material In 2017, YouTube reported that time watching family vloggers had increased by 90% [199] [200] However, with the increase in videos featuring children, the site began to face several controversies related to child safety, including with popular channels FamilyOFive and Fantastic Adventures [201] [202] [203] [204] [205]\n\n\nSexualization of children and pedophilia\nIn November 2017, it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children—often uploaded by the minors themselves, and showing innocent content such as the children playing with toys or performing gymnastics—were attracting comments from pedophiles [219] [220] with predators finding the videos through private YouTube playlists or typing in certain keywords in Russian [220] Other child-centric videos originally uploaded to YouTube began propagating on the dark web, and uploaded or embedded onto forums known to be used by pedophiles [221]\n\n\nRussia\nIn 2021, two accounts linked to RT Deutsch, the German channel of the Russian RT network were removed as well for breaching YouTube's policies relating to COVID-19 [193] Russia threatened to ban YouTube after the platform deleted two German RT channels in September 2021 [234]\n\n\nApril Fools gags\nYouTube featured an April Fools prank on the site on April 1 of every year from 2008 to 2016 In 2008, all links to videos on the main page were redirected to Rick Astley's music video \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", a prank known as \"rickrolling\" [243] [244] The next year, when clicking on a video on the main page, the whole page turned upside down, which YouTube claimed was a \"new layout\" [245] In 2010, YouTube temporarily released a \"TEXTp\" mode which rendered video imagery into ASCII art letters \"in order to reduce bandwidth costs by $1 per second.\" [246]\n\n\nServices\nYouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) is YouTube's premium subscription service It offers advertising-free streaming, access to

subscription add-on stores operated by Apple, Prime Video and Roku The add-ons can be purchased through the YouTube Movies & TV hub or through the official YouTube channels of the available services;

Showtime, Starz, MGM+, AMC+ and ViX+) were initially available for purchase [271] [272]\n\n\nYouTube TV\nOn February 28, 2017, in a press announcement held at YouTube Space Los Angeles, YouTube announced YouTube TV, an over-the-top MVPD-style subscription service that would be available for United States customers at a price of US$65 per month Initially launching in five major markets (New

Freeform, FX and ESPN) [279] [280]\n\n\nYouTube Go\nIn September 2016, YouTube Go was announced, [282] as an Android app created for making YouTube easier to access on mobile devices in emerging markets It was distinct from the company's main Android app and allowed videos to be downloaded and shared with other users It also allowed users to preview videos, share downloaded videos through Bluetooth, and offered more options for mobile data control and video resolution [283]\n\n\nYouTube Shorts\nIn September 2020, YouTube announced that it would be launching a beta version of a new platform of 15-second videos, similar to TikTok, called YouTube Shorts [289] [290] The platform was first tested in India but as of March 2021 has expanded to other countries including the United States with videos now able to be up to 1 minute long [291] The platform is not a standalone app, but is integrated into the main YouTube app Like TikTok, it gives users access to built-in creative tools, including the possibility of adding licensed music to their videos [292] The platform had its global beta launch in July 2021 [293]\n\n\nYouTube Stories\nIn 2018, YouTube started testing a new

[299]\n\n\nSocial impact\nPrivate individuals [301] and large production corporations [302] have used YouTube to grow their audiences Indie creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort, while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic [301] Concurrently, old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television [302] While YouTube's revenue-sharing \"Partner Program\" made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually [303] and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $2.5 million to $12 million [304]—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as \"a free-to-use .. promotional platform for the music labels.\" [305] In 2013 Forbes' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media [306] Videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as \"mega\", \"mainstream\" and \"mid-sized\" received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo in that year [307] By early 2013, Billboard had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the Billboard Hot 100 and related genre charts [308]\n\n\nFinances\nPrior to 2020, Google did not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as \"not material\" in a regulatory filing [340] In June 2008, a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales [341] In 2012, YouTube's revenue from its ads program was estimated at $3.7 billion [342] In 2013, it nearly doubled and estimated to hit $5.6 billion according to e-Marketer, [342] [343] while others estimated $4.7 billion [342] The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by advertising [64] In May 2013, YouTube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices ranging from $0.99 to $6.99 a month [344] The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online subscription services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu [64]\n\n\nPartnership with corporations\nYouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006 [350] In March 2007, it struck a deal with BBC for three channels with BBC content, one for news and two for entertainment [351] In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for U.S viewers called \"Shows\" The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney [352] [353] In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of \"Shows\" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners [354] In January 2010, YouTube introduced an online film rentals service, [355] which is only available to users in the United States, Canada, and the UK as of 2010 [356] [357] [needs update] The service offers over 6,000 films [358]\n\n\n2017 advertiser boycott\nIn March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube, after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content The government demanded assurances that its advertising would \"be delivered safely and appropriately\" The Guardian newspaper, as well as other major British and U.S brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content Google stated that it had \"begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear\" [359] [360] In early April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a Wall Street Journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video [361] [362]\n\n\nYouTuber earnings\nIn May 2007, YouTube launched its Partner Program (YPP), a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site [364] YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader [365] [366]\n\n\nRevenue to copyright holders\nThe majority of YouTube's advertising revenue goes to the publishers and video producers who hold the rights to their videos; the company retains 45% of the ad revenue [386] In 2010, it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue [387] In May 2013, Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games [388] In February 2015, Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators through the Nintendo Creators Program [389] [390] [391] On March 20, 2019, Nintendo announced on Twitter that the company will end the Creators program Operations for the program ceased on March 20, 2019 [392] [393]\n\n\nCensorship and bans\nYouTube has been

The deal was finalized on November 13, 2006. Google's acquisition launched newfound interest in video-sharing sites; IAC, which now owned Vimeo, focused on supporting the content creators to distinguish itself from YouTube. It is at this time YouTube issued the slogan \"Broadcast Yourself\".\n\n## Senior Leadership\n\nYouTube has been led by a CEO since its founding in 2005, beginning with Chad Hurley, who led the company until 2010. After Google's acquisition of YouTube, the CEO role was retained. Salar Kamangar took over Hurley's position and kept the job until 2014. He was replaced by Susan Wojcicki, who later resigned in 2023. The current CEO is Neal Mohan, who was appointed on February 16, 2023.\n\n## Features\n\nYouTube offers different features based on user verification, such as standard or basic features like uploading videos, creating playlists, and using YouTube Music, with limits based on daily activity (verification via phone number or channel history increases feature availability and daily usage limits); intermediate or additional features like longer videos (over 15 minutes), live streaming, custom thumbnails, and creating podcasts; advanced features like content ID appeals, embedding live streams, applying for monetization, clickable links, adding chapters, and pinning comments on videos or posts.\n\n## Videos\n\nIn January 2012, it was estimated that visitors to YouTube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site, in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical US citizen watching television. In 2017, viewers on average watched YouTube on mobile devices for more than an hour every day.\n\n## Copyright Issues\n\nYouTube has faced numerous challenges and criticisms in its attempts to deal with copyright. At the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws. Despite this advice, many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube. YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act.\n\n## Content ID\n\nIn June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright.

video-sharing sites; IAC, which now owned Vimeo, focused on supporting the content creators to distinguish itself from YouTube [32] It is at this time YouTube issued the slogan \"Broadcast Yourself\".\nThe company experienced rapid growth The Daily Telegraph wrote that in 2007, YouTube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire Internet in 2000 [44] By 2010, the company had reached a market share of around 43% and more than 14 billion views of videos, according to comScore [45] That year, the company simplified its interface to increase the time users would spend on the site [46] In 2011, more than three billion videos were being watched each day with 48 hours of new videos uploaded every minute [47] [48] [49] However, most of these views came from a relatively small number of videos; according to a software engineer at that time, 30% of videos accounted for 99% of views on the site [50] That year, the company again changed its interface and at the same time, introduced a new logo with a darker shade of red [51] [52] A subsequent interface change, designed to unify the experience across desktop, TV, and mobile, was rolled out in 2013 [53] By that point, more than 100 hours were being uploaded every minute, increasing to 300 hours by November 2014 [54] [55]\n\n\nSusan Wojcicki and going mainstream (2014–2018)\nSusan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube in February 2014 [61] In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215 million The complex has 51,468 square metres (554,000 square feet) of space and can house up to 2,800 employees [62] YouTube officially launched the \"polymer\" redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design language as its default, as well a redesigned logo that is built around the service's play button emblem in August 2017 [63]\n\n\nRecent history (2019–present)\nBy February 2017, one billion hours of YouTube videos were being watched every day, and 400 hours worth of videos were uploaded every minute [7] [76] Two years later, the uploads had risen to more than 500 hours per minute [8] During the COVID-19 pandemic, when most of the world was under stay-at-home orders, usage of services like YouTube significantly increased One data firm [which?] estimated that YouTube was accounting for 15% of all internet traffic, twice its pre-pandemic level [77] In response to EU officials requesting that such services reduce bandwidth as to make sure medical entities had sufficient bandwidth to share information, YouTube and Netflix stated they would reduce streaming quality for at least thirty days as to cut bandwidth use of their services by 25% to comply with the EU's request [78] YouTube later announced that they would continue with this move worldwide: \"We continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimize stress on the system during this unprecedented situation.\" [79]\n\n\nSenior

has faced numerous challenges and criticisms in its attempts to deal with copyright, including the site's first viral video, Lazy Sunday, which had to be taken down, due to copyright concerns [33] At the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws [115] Despite this advice, many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material remain on YouTube YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a DMCA takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a YouTube copyright strike Three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted [116] [117] From 2007 to 2009 organizations including Viacom, Mediaset, and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material [118] [119] [120]\n\n\nContent ID\nIn June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of

partisan viewpoints and misleading videos, even when those users haven't shown interest in such content When users show a political bias in what they choose to view, YouTube typically recommends videos that echo those biases, often with more-extreme viewpoints.\" [157] [161] After YouTube drew controversy for giving top billing to videos promoting falsehoods and conspiracy when people made breaking-news queries during the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, YouTube changed its algorithm to give greater prominence to mainstream media sources [157] [162] [163] [164]\n\n\nUse among white supremacists\nBefore 2019, YouTube took steps to remove specific videos or channels related to supremacist content that had violated its acceptable use policies but otherwise did not have site-wide policies against hate speech [168]\n\n\nMisinformation and handling of the COVID-19 pandemic\nMultiple research studies have investigated cases of misinformation in YouTube In a July 2019 study based on ten YouTube searches using the Tor Browser related to climate and climate change, the majority of videos were videos that communicated views contrary to the scientific consensus on climate change [177] A May 2023 study found that YouTube was monetizing and profiting from videos that included misinformation about climate change [178] A 2019 BBC investigation of YouTube searches in ten different languages found that YouTube's algorithm promoted health misinformation, including fake cancer cures [179] In Brazil, YouTube has been linked to pushing pseudoscientific misinformation on health matters, as well as elevated far-right fringe discourse and conspiracy theories [180] In the Philippines, numerous channels disseminated misinformation related to the 2022 Philippine elections [181] Additionally, research on the dissemination of Flat Earth beliefs in social media, has shown that networks of YouTube channels form an echo chamber that polarizes audiences by appearing to confirm preexisting beliefs [182]\n\n\nChild safety and wellbeing\nLeading into 2017, there was a significant increase in the number of videos related to children, coupled between the popularity of parents vlogging their family's activities, and previous content creators moving away from content that often was criticized or demonetized into family-friendly material In 2017, YouTube reported that time watching family vloggers had increased by 90% [199] [200] However, with the increase in videos featuring children, the site began to face several controversies related to child safety, including with popular channels FamilyOFive and Fantastic Adventures [201] [202] [203] [204] [205]\n\n\nSexualization of children and pedophilia\nIn November 2017, it was revealed in the media that many videos featuring children—often uploaded by the minors themselves, and showing innocent content such as the children playing with toys or performing gymnastics—were attracting comments from pedophiles [219] [220] with predators finding the videos through private YouTube playlists or typing in certain keywords in Russian [220] Other child-centric videos originally uploaded to YouTube began propagating on the dark web, and uploaded or embedded onto forums known to be used by pedophiles [221]\n\n\nRussia\nIn 2021, two accounts linked to RT Deutsch, the German channel of the Russian RT network were removed as well for breaching YouTube's policies relating to COVID-19 [193] Russia threatened to ban YouTube after the platform deleted two German RT channels in September 2021 [234]\n\n\nApril Fools gags\nYouTube featured an April Fools prank on the site on April 1 of every year from 2008 to 2016 In 2008, all links to videos on the main page were redirected to Rick Astley's music video \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", a prank known as \"rickrolling\" [243] [244] The next year, when clicking on a video on the main page, the whole page turned upside down, which YouTube claimed was a \"new layout\" [245] In 2010, YouTube temporarily released a \"TEXTp\" mode which rendered video imagery into ASCII art letters \"in order to reduce bandwidth costs by $1 per second.\" [246]\n\n\nServices\nYouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) is YouTube's premium subscription service It offers advertising-free streaming, access to original programming, and background and offline video playback on mobile devices [254] YouTube Premium was originally announced on November 12, 2014, as \"Music Key\", a subscription music streaming service, and was intended to integrate with and

2018; selections of new movies are added and others removed, unannounced each month [267]\n\n\nYouTube Primetime Channels\nOn November 1, 2022, YouTube launched Primetime Channels, a channel store platform offering third-party subscription streaming add-ons sold a la carte through the YouTube website and app, competing with similar subscription add-on stores operated by Apple, Prime Video and Roku The add-ons can be purchased through the YouTube Movies & TV hub or through the official YouTube channels of the available services; subscribers of YouTube TV add-ons that are sold through Primetime Channels can also access their content via the YouTube app and website A total of 34 streaming services (including Paramount+, Showtime, Starz, MGM+, AMC+ and ViX+) were initially available for purchase [271] [272]\n\n\nYouTube TV\nOn February 28, 2017, in a press announcement held at YouTube Space Los Angeles, YouTube announced YouTube TV, an over-the-top MVPD-style subscription service that would be available for United States customers at a price of US$65 per month Initially launching in five major markets (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco) on April 5, 2017, [277] [278] the service offers live streams of programming from the five major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox and NBC, along with selected MyNetworkTV affiliates and independent stations in certain markets), as well as approximately 60 cable channels owned by companies such as The Walt Disney Company, Paramount Global, Fox Corporation, NBCUniversal, Allen Media Group and Warner Bros Discovery (including among others Bravo, USA Network, Syfy, Disney Channel, CNN, Cartoon Network, E!, Fox Sports 1, Freeform, FX and ESPN) [279] [280]\n\n\nYouTube Go\nIn September 2016, YouTube Go was announced, [282] as an Android app created for making YouTube easier to access on mobile devices in emerging markets It was distinct from the company's main Android app and allowed videos to be downloaded and shared with other users It also allowed users to preview videos, share downloaded videos through Bluetooth, and offered more options for mobile data control and video resolution [283]\n\n\nYouTube Shorts\nIn September 2020, YouTube announced that it would be launching a beta version of a new platform of 15-second videos, similar to TikTok, called YouTube Shorts [289] [290] The platform was first tested in India but as of March 2021 has expanded to other countries including the United States with videos now able to be up to 1 minute long [291] The platform is not a standalone app, but is integrated into the main YouTube app Like TikTok, it gives users access to built-in creative tools, including the possibility of adding licensed music to their videos [292] The platform had its global beta launch in July 2021 [293]\n\n\nYouTube Stories\nIn 2018, YouTube started testing a new feature initially called \"YouTube Reels\" [294] The feature was nearly identical to Instagram Stories and Snapchat Stories YouTube later renamed the feature \"YouTube Stories\" It was only available to creators who had more than 10,000 subscribers and could only be posted/seen in the YouTube mobile app [295] On May 25, 2023, YouTube announced that they would be shutting down this feature on June 26, 2023 [296] [297]\n\n\nYouTube VR\nIn November 2016, YouTube released YouTube VR, a dedicated version with an interface for VR devices, for Google's Daydream mobile VR platform on Android [298] In November 2018, YouTube VR was released on the Oculus Store for the Oculus Go headset [298] YouTube VR was updated since for compatibility with successive Quest devices, and was ported to Pico 4 [299]\n\n\nSocial impact\nPrivate individuals [301] and large production corporations [302] have used YouTube to grow their audiences Indie creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort, while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic [301] Concurrently, old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a YouTube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television [302] While YouTube's revenue-sharing \"Partner Program\" made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer—its top five hundred partners each earning more than $100,000 annually [303] and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from $2.5 million to $12 million [304]—in 2012 CMU business editor characterized YouTube as \"a free-to-use .. promotional platform for the music labels.\" [305] In 2013 Forbes' Katheryn Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media [306] Videos of the 2.5% of artists categorized as \"mega\", \"mainstream\" and \"mid-sized\" received 90.3% of the relevant views on YouTube and Vevo in that year [307] By early 2013, Billboard had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the Billboard Hot 100 and related genre charts [308]\n\n\nFinances\nPrior to 2020, Google did not provide detailed figures for YouTube's running costs, and YouTube's revenues in 2007 were noted as \"not material\" in a regulatory filing [340] In June 2008, a Forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at $200 million, noting progress in advertising sales [341] In 2012, YouTube's revenue from its ads program was estimated at $3.7 billion [342] In 2013, it nearly doubled and estimated to hit $5.6 billion according to e-Marketer, [342] [343] while others estimated $4.7 billion [342] The vast majority of videos on YouTube are free to view and supported by advertising [64] In May 2013, YouTube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices ranging from $0.99 to $6.99 a month [344] The move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online subscription services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu [64]\n\n\nPartnership with corporations\nYouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006 [350] In March 2007, it struck a deal with BBC for three channels with BBC content, one for news and two for entertainment [351] In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for U.S viewers called \"Shows\" The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney [352] [353] In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of \"Shows\" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners [354] In January 2010, YouTube introduced an online film rentals service, [355] which is only available to users in the United States, Canada, and the UK as of 2010 [356] [357] [needs update] The service offers over 6,000 films [358]\n\n\n2017 advertiser boycott\nIn March 2017, the government of the United Kingdom pulled its advertising campaigns from YouTube, after reports that its ads had appeared on videos containing extremist content The government demanded assurances that its advertising would \"be delivered safely and appropriately\" The Guardian newspaper, as well as other major British and U.S brands, similarly suspended their advertising on YouTube in response to their advertising appearing near offensive content Google stated that it had \"begun an extensive review of our advertising policies and have made a public commitment to put in place changes that give brands more control over where their ads appear\" [359] [360] In early April 2017, the YouTube channel h3h3Productions presented evidence claiming that a Wall Street Journal article had fabricated screenshots showing major brand advertising on an offensive video containing Johnny Rebel music overlaid on a Chief Keef music video, citing that the video itself had not earned any ad revenue for the uploader The video was retracted after it was found that the ads had been triggered by the use of copyrighted content in the video [361] [362]\n\n\nYouTuber earnings\nIn May 2007, YouTube launched its Partner Program (YPP), a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site [364] YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader [365] [366]\n\n\nRevenue to copyright holders\nThe majority of YouTube's advertising revenue goes to the publishers and video producers who hold the rights to their videos; the company retains 45% of the ad revenue [386] In 2010, it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders YouTube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue [387] In May 2013, Nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games [388] In February 2015, Nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators through the Nintendo Creators Program [389] [390] [391] On March 20, 2019, Nintendo announced on Twitter that the company will end the Creators program Operations for the program ceased on March 20, 2019 [392] [393]\n\n\nCensorship and bans\nYouTube has been censored, filtered, or banned for a variety of reasons, including: [394]\n\n\nSee

{"title": "Paul_McCartney", "content": "\nEarly life\nMcCartney was born on 18 June 1942 at Walton Hospital in the Walton area of Liverpool, where his mother, Mary Patricia (née Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse Both of his parents were of Irish descent [7] McCartney has a younger brother, Peter Michael, and a younger stepsister, Ruth, born to his father Jim's second wife, Angie, during her first marriage [8] Paul and Michael were baptised in their mother's Catholic faith, even though their father was a former Protestant who had turned agnostic Religion was not emphasised in the household [9]\n\n\nCareer\nAt the age of fifteen on 6 July 1957, McCartney met John Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall fête in Woolton [28] The Quarrymen played a mix of rock and roll and skiffle, a type of popular music with jazz, blues and folk influences [29] Soon afterwards, the members of the band invited McCartney to join as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe on bass, in 1960 [30] By May 1960, the band had tried several names, including Johnny and the Moondogs, Beatals and the Silver Beetles [31] They adopted the name the Beatles in August 1960 and recruited drummer Pete Best shortly before a five-engagement residency in Hamburg [32]\n\n\n1957–1960: The Quarrymen\nAt the age of fifteen on 6 July 1957, McCartney met John Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall fête in Woolton [28] The Quarrymen played a mix of rock and roll and skiffle, a type of popular music with jazz, blues and folk influences [29] Soon afterwards, the members of the band invited McCartney to join as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe on bass, in 1960 [30] By May 1960, the band had tried several names, including Johnny and the Moondogs, Beatals and the Silver Beetles [31] They adopted the name the Beatles in August 1960 and recruited drummer Pete Best shortly before a five-engagement residency in Hamburg [32]\n\n\n1960–1970: The Beatles\nIn 1961, Sutcliffe left the band, and McCartney became their bass player It is disputed whether he did so reluctantly or actively sought out the role [33] [34] While in Hamburg, they recorded professionally for the first time and were credited as the Beat Brothers, who were the backing band for English singer Tony Sheridan on the single \"My Bonnie\" [35] This resulted in attention from Brian Epstein, who was a key figure in their subsequent development and success He became their manager in January 1962 [36] Ringo Starr replaced Best in August, and the band had their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in October, becoming popular in the UK in 1963, and in the US a year later The fan hysteria became known as \"Beatlemania\", and the press sometimes referred to McCartney as the \"cute Beatle\" [37] [nb 2] McCartney co-wrote (with Lennon) several of their early hits, including \"I Saw Her Standing There\", \"She Loves You\", \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" (1963) and \"Can't Buy Me Love\" (1964) [39]\n\n\n1970–1981: Wings\nI didn't really want to keep going as a solo artist .. so it became obvious that I had to get a band together .. Linda and I talked it through and it was like, \"Yeah, but let's not put together a supergroup, let's go back to square one.\" [81]\n\n\n1982–1990\nIn 1982, McCartney collaborated with Stevie Wonder on the Martin-produced number-one hit \"Ebony and Ivory\", included on McCartney's Tug of War LP, and with Michael Jackson on \"The Girl Is Mine\" from Thriller [120] [nb 18] \"Ebony and Ivory\" was McCartney's record 28th single to hit number one on the Billboard 100 [122] The following year, he and Jackson worked on \"Say Say Say\", McCartney's most recent US number one as of 2014 [update] McCartney earned his latest UK number one as of 2014 [update] with the title track of his LP release that year, \"Pipes of Peace\" [123] [nb 19]\n\n\n1991–1999\nMcCartney ventured into orchestral music in 1991 when the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society commissioned a musical piece by him to celebrate its sesquicentennial He collaborated with composer Carl Davis, producing Liverpool Oratorio The performance featured opera singers Kiri Te Kanawa, Sally Burgess, Jerry Hadley and Willard White with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir of Liverpool Cathedral [143] Reviews were negative The Guardian was especially critical, describing the music as \"afraid of anything approaching a fast tempo\", and adding that the piece has \"little awareness of the need for recurrent ideas that will bind the work into a whole\" [144] The paper published a letter McCartney submitted in response in which he noted several of the work's faster tempos and added, \"happily, history shows that many good pieces of music were not liked by the critics of the time so I am content to .. let people judge for themselves the merits of the work.\" [144] The New York Times was slightly more generous, stating, \"There are moments of beauty and pleasure in this dramatic miscellany .. the music's innocent sincerity makes it difficult to be put off by its ambitions\" [145] Performed around the world after its London premiere, the Liverpool Oratorio reached number one on the UK classical chart, Music Week [146]\nIn 1991, McCartney performed a selection of acoustic-only songs on MTV Unplugged and released a live album of the performance titled Unplugged (The Official Bootleg) [147] [nb 26] During the 1990s, McCartney collaborated twice with Youth of Killing Joke as the musical duo \"the Fireman\" The two released their first electronica album together, Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest, in 1993 [149] McCartney released the rock album Off the Ground in 1993 [150] [nb 27] The subsequent New World Tour followed, which led to the release of the Paul Is Live album later that year [152] [nb 28] [nb 29]\n\n\n2000–2009\nIn 2000, he released the electronica album Liverpool Sound Collage with Super Furry Animals and Youth, using the sound collage and musique concrète techniques that had fascinated him in the mid-1960s [165] He contributed the song \"Nova\" to a tribute album of classical, choral music called A Garland for Linda (2000), dedicated to his late wife [166]\n\n\n2010–2019\nIn 2010, McCartney opened the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; it was his first concert in Pittsburgh since 1990 due to the old Civic Arena being deemed unsuitable for McCartney's logistical needs [192] [nb 41] In July 2011, McCartney performed at two sold-out concerts at the new Yankee Stadium A New York Times review of the first concert reported that McCartney was \"not saying goodbye but touring stadiums and playing marathon concerts\" [194] In August 2011, McCartney left EMI and signed with Decca Records, the same record company that famously rejected The Beatles back in January 1962 [195] McCartney was commissioned by the New York City Ballet, and in September 2011, he released his first score for dance, a collaboration with Peter Martins called Ocean's Kingdom on Decca Records [196] Also in 2011, McCartney married Nancy Shevell [197] He released Kisses on the Bottom, a collection of standards, in February 2012, the same month that the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences honoured him as the MusiCares Person of the Year, two days prior to his performance at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards [198]\n\n\n2020–present\nMcCartney's 18th solo album, McCartney III, was released on 18 December 2020, via Capitol Records; it became his first number-one solo album in the UK since Flowers in the Dirt in 1989 [232] [233] The album was recorded in England during the COVID-19 lockdowns and continues McCartney's trend of self-titled solo albums with him playing all of the instruments [234] An album of \"reinterpretations, remixes, and covers\" titled McCartney III Imagined was released on 16 April 2021 [235]\n\n\nMusicianship\nMcCartney is a largely self-taught musician, and his approach was described by musicologist Ian MacDonald as \"by nature drawn to music's formal aspects yet wholly untutored ..  [he] produced technically 'finished' work almost entirely by instinct, his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears ..  [A] natural melodist—a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony.\" [247] McCartney likened his approach to \"the primitive cave artists, who drew without training\" [248]\n\n\nEarly influences\nThe Messiah has arrived! [249]\n\n\nBass guitar\nBest known for primarily using a plectrum or pick, McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle [256] He was strongly influenced by Motown artists, in particular James Jamerson, whom McCartney called a hero for his melodic style He was also influenced by Brian Wilson, as he commented: \"because he went to very unusual places\" [257] Another favourite bassist of his is Stanley Clarke [258] McCartney's skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by bassists including Sting, Dr Dre bassist Mike Elizondo, and Colin Moulding of XTC [259]\n\n\nAcoustic guitar\nIf I couldn't have any other instrument, I would have to have an acoustic guitar [277]\n\n\nElectric guitar\nLinda was a big fan of my guitar playing, whereas I've got my doubts I think there are proper guitar players and then there are guys like me who love playing it [281]\n\n\nVocals\nMcCartney is known for his belting power, versatility and wide tenor vocal range, spanning over four octaves [289] [290] He was ranked the 11th greatest singer of all time by Rolling Stone, [291] voted the 8th greatest singer ever by NME readers [292] and number 10 by Music Radar readers in the list of \"the 30 greatest lead singers of all time\" [293] Over the years, McCartney has been named a significant vocal influence by Chris Cornell, [294] Billy Joel, [295] Steven Tyler, [296] Brad Delp, [297] and Axl Rose [298]\n\n\nKeyboards\nMcCartney played piano on several Beatles songs, including \"She's a Woman\", \"For No One\", \"A Day in the Life\", \"Hello, Goodbye\", \"Lady Madonna\", \"Hey Jude\", \"Martha My Dear\", \"Let It Be\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\" [308] MacDonald considered the piano part in \"Lady Madonna\" as reminiscent of Fats Domino, and \"Let It Be\" as having a gospel rhythm [309] MacDonald called McCartney's Mellotron intro on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" an integral feature of the song's character [310] McCartney played a Moog synthesiser on the Beatles song \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" and the Wings track \"Loup (1st Indian on the Moon)\" [311] Ingham described the Wings songs \"With a Little Luck\" and \"London Town\" as being \"full of the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches\" [312]\n\n\nDrums\nMcCartney played drums on the Beatles' songs \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", \"Dear Prudence\", \"Martha My Dear\", \"Wild Honey Pie\" and \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" [313] He also played all the drum parts on his albums McCartney, McCartney II and McCartney III, as well as on Wings' Band on the Run, and most of the drums on his solo LP Chaos and Creation in the Backyard [314] His other drumming contributions include Paul Jones' rendition of \"And the Sun Will Shine\" (1968), [315] Steve Miller Band's 1969 tracks \"Celebration Song\" and \"My Dark Hour\", [316] [317] and \"Sunday Rain\" from the Foo Fighters' 2017 album Concrete and Gold [318]\n\n\nTape loops\nIn the mid-1960s, when visiting artist friend John Dunbar's flat in London, McCartney brought tapes he had compiled at then-girlfriend Jane Asher's home They included mixes of various songs, musical pieces and comments made by McCartney that Dick James made into a demo for him [319] Heavily influenced by American avant-garde musician John Cage, McCartney made tape loops by recording voices, guitars and bongos on a Brenell tape recorder and splicing the various loops He referred to the finished product as \"electronic symphonies\" [320] He reversed the tapes, sped them up, and slowed them down to create the desired effects, some of which the Beatles later used on the songs \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and \"The Fool on the Hill\" [321]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWhile at school during the 1950s, McCartney thrived at art assignments, often earning top accolades for his visual work However, his lack of discipline negatively affected his academic grades, preventing him from earning admission to art college [322] During the 1960s, he delved into the visual arts, explored experimental cinema, and regularly attended film, theatrical and classical music performances His first contact with the London avant-garde scene was through artist John Dunbar, who introduced McCartney to art dealer Robert Fraser [323] At Fraser's flat he first learned about art appreciation and met Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Peter Blake, and Richard Hamilton [324] McCartney later purchased works by Magritte, whose painting of an apple had inspired the Apple Records logo [325] McCartney became involved in the renovation and publicising of the Indica Gallery in Mason's Yard,

support and by providing interviews to attract advertiser income Miles later wrote McCartney's official biography, Many Years from Now (1997) [326]\n\n\nCreative outlets\nWhile at school during the 1950s, McCartney thrived at art assignments, often earning top accolades for his visual work However, his lack of discipline negatively affected his academic grades, preventing him from earning admission to art college [322] During the 1960s, he delved into the visual arts, explored experimental cinema, and regularly attended film, theatrical and classical music performances His first contact with the London avant-garde scene was through artist John Dunbar, who introduced McCartney to art dealer Robert Fraser [323] At Fraser's flat he first learned about art appreciation and met Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Peter Blake, and Richard Hamilton [324] McCartney later purchased works by Magritte, whose painting of an apple had inspired the Apple Records logo [325] McCartney became involved in the renovation and publicising of the Indica Gallery in Mason's Yard, London, which Barry Miles had co-founded and where Lennon first met Yoko Ono Miles also co-founded International Times, an underground paper that McCartney helped to start with direct financial support and by providing interviews to attract advertiser income Miles later wrote McCartney's official biography, Many

to £48.5 million by 2005 [349] McCartney's 18-date On the Run Tour grossed £37 million in 2012 [350]\n\n\nDrugs\nMcCartney first used drugs in the Beatles' Hamburg days when they often used Preludin to maintain their energy while performing for long periods [360] Bob Dylan introduced them to cannabis in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting \"very high\" and \"giggling uncontrollably\" [361] His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics \"another kind of mind\" in \"Got to Get You into My Life\" specifically as a reference to cannabis [362] During the filming of Help!, McCartney occasionally smoked a joint in the car on the way to the studio, and often forgot his lines [363] Director Richard Lester overheard two physically attractive women trying to persuade McCartney to use heroin, but he refused [363] Introduced to cocaine by Robert Fraser, McCartney used the drug regularly during the recording of Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and for about a year in total but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards [364]\n\n\nVegetarianism and activism\nSince 1975, McCartney has been a vegetarian [375] [376] He and his wife Linda were vegetarians for most of their 29-year marriage They decided to stop consuming meat after Paul saw lambs in a field as they were

McCartney is a supporter of the animal rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals He has appeared in the group's campaigns, and in 2009, McCartney narrated a video for them titled \"Glass Walls\", which was harshly critical of slaughterhouses, the meat industry, and their effect on animal welfare [380] [381] [382] McCartney has also supported campaigns headed by the Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society International, World Animal Protection, and the David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation [383] [384]\n\n\nFootball\nMcCartney has publicly professed support for Everton F.C and has also shown favour for Liverpool F.C [403] In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said: \"Here's the deal: my father was born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if it comes down to a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two, I would have to support Everton But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish, who had been to the gig and I thought 'You know what? I am just going to support them both because it's all Liverpool.'\" [404]\n\n\nRelationships\nMcCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dorothy \"Dot\" Rhone, whom he met at the Casbah club in 1959 [405] According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations He often chose clothes and makeup for her, encouraging her to grow her blonde hair to simulate Brigitte Bardot's hairstyle, [406] and at least once insisting she have her hair restyled, to disappointing effect [407] When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962 [408] The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage According to Spitz, McCartney, now \"free of obligation\", ended the engagement [409]\n\n\nGirlfriends\nMcCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dorothy \"Dot\" Rhone, whom he met at the Casbah club in 1959 [405] According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations He often chose clothes and makeup for her, encouraging her to grow her blonde hair to simulate Brigitte Bardot's hairstyle, [406] and at least once insisting she have her hair restyled, to disappointing effect [407] When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962 [408] The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage According to Spitz, McCartney, now \"free of obligation\", ended the engagement [409]\n\n\nDot Rhone\nMcCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dorothy \"Dot\" Rhone, whom he met at the Casbah club in 1959 [405] According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations He often chose clothes and makeup for her, encouraging her to grow her blonde hair to simulate Brigitte Bardot's hairstyle, [406] and at least once insisting she have her hair restyled, to disappointing effect [407] When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962 [408] The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage According to Spitz, McCartney, now \"free of obligation\", ended the engagement [409]\n\n\nJane Asher\nMcCartney first met British actress Jane Asher on 18 April 1963 when a photographer asked them to pose at a Beatles performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London [410] The two began a relationship, and in November of that year he took up residence with Asher at her parents' home at 57 Wimpole Street in Marylebone, central London [411] They lived there for more than two years before moving to McCartney's own home in St John's Wood in March 1966 [412] He wrote several songs while living with the Ashers, including \"Yesterday\", \"And I Love Her\", \"You Won't See Me\" and \"I'm Looking Through You\", the latter three having been inspired by their romance [413] They had a five-year relationship and planned to marry, but Asher broke off the engagement after she discovered that McCartney had become involved with Francie Schwartz, [414] an American screenwriter who moved to London at age 23, thinking she could sell a script to the Beatles Schwartz met McCartney and he invited her to move into his London house, where events ensued that possibly broke up his relationship with Asher [415]\n\n\nWives\nLinda Eastman was a music fan who once commented, \"all my teen years were spent with an ear to the radio.\" [416] At times, she skipped school to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry [416] She became a popular photographer with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966 She commented, \"It was John who interested me at the start He was my Beatle hero But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked.\" [417] The pair first became properly acquainted on 15 May 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London [418] As Paul remembers, \"The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to ..

As a member of the Beatles, one of the most influential and successful bands in the history of popular music, McCartney contributed significantly to the band's success and became a key figure in shaping the course of popular music in the 1960s. As a solo artist, McCartney has continued to produce and release music of high quality, exploring a wide range of genres and styles. This article provides an overview of McCartney's life, career, and achievements.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nPaul McCartney was born on 18 June 1942 at Walton Hospital in the Walton area of Liverpool, where his mother, Mary Patricia (née Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. Both of his parents were of Irish descent. McCartney has a younger brother, Peter Michael, and a younger stepsister, Ruth, born to his father Jim's second wife, Angie, during her first marriage. Paul and Michael were baptised in their mother's Catholic faith, even though their father was a former Protestant who had turned agnostic. Religion was not emphasised in the household.\n\nAs a child, McCartney showed a strong interest in music, and his parents encouraged his development as a musician. He learned to play the piano and the guitar, and began to write his own music at an early age. He attended the Liverpool Institute High School for Boys, where he met his future bandmates, John Lennon and George Harrison. The three boys formed a band, the Quarrymen, and began to play music together.\n\n**The Beatles**\n\nAt the age of fifteen on 6 July 1957, McCartney met John Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall fête in Woolton. The Quarrymen played a mix of rock and roll and skiffle, a type of popular music with jazz, blues and folk influences. Soon afterwards, the members of the band invited McCartney to join as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon. Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe on bass, in 1960.\n\nBy May 1960, the band had tried several names, including Johnny and the Moondogs, Beatals and the Silver Beetles. They adopted the name the Beatles in August 1960 and recruited drummer Pete Best shortly before a five-engagement residency in Hamburg. The Beatles became one of the most popular and influential bands of the 1960s, known for their innovative music and energetic live performances.\n\n**Solo Career**\n\nIn 1961, Sutcliffe left the band, and McCartney became their bass player. It is disputed whether he did so reluctantly or actively sought out the role. While in Hamburg, they recorded professionally for the first time and were credited as the Beat Brothers, who were the backing band for English singer Tony Sheridan on the single \"My Bonnie\". This resulted in attention from Brian Epstein, who was a key figure in their subsequent development and success.\n\nIn 1962, McCartney became the Beatles' manager in January, and Ringo Starr replaced Best in August. The band had their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in October, becoming popular in the UK in 1963, and in the US a year later. The fan hysteria became known as \"Beatlemania\", and the press sometimes referred to McCartney as the \"cute Beatle\".\n\nMcCartney co-wrote (with Lennon) several of their early hits, including \"I Saw Her Standing There\", \"She Loves You\", \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" (1963) and \"Can't Buy Me Love\" (1964). During the 1960s, McCartney's songwriting skills became more prominent, and he began to write songs that showcased his own style and personality.\n\n**Wings**\n\nIn 1970, McCartney formed the band Wings with his wife Linda McCartney and Denny Laine. Wings became a successful band in their own right, releasing several hit albums and singles, including \"Band on the Run\" (1973) and \"Listen to What the Man Said\" (1975). McCartney also released several solo albums during this period, including \"McCartney\" (1970) and \"Ram\" (1971), which he recorded with his wife Linda.\n\n**1980s-1990s**\n\nIn 1980, McCartney released the album \"McCartney II\", which featured a more experimental and electronic sound. He also released the album \"Tug of War\" (1982), which featured the hit single \"Ebony and Ivory\", a duet with Stevie Wonder. In 1983, McCartney released the album \"Pipes of Peace\", which featured the hit single \"Say Say Say\", a duet with Michael Jackson.\n\nIn 1991, McCartney released the album \"Flowers in the Dirt\", which featured the hit single \"My Valentine\". He also released the album \"Off the Ground\" (1993), which featured the hit single \"Hope of Deliverance\". In 1997, McCartney released the album \"Flaming Pie\", which featured the hit single \"The Long and Winding Road\".\n\n**2000s-present**\n\nIn 2001, McCartney released the album \"Driving Rain\", which featured the hit single \"From a Lover to a Friend\". In 2005, he released the album \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\", which featured the hit single \"Fine Line\". In 2007, McCartney released the album \"Memory Almost Full\", which featured the hit single \"Dance Tonight\".\n\nIn 2009, McCartney released the album \"Kisses on the Bottom\", which featured the hit single \"My Valentine\". In 2012, he released the album \"England\", which featured the hit single \"Cut Me Some Slack\". In 2013, McCartney released the album \"New\", which featured the hit single \"Queenie Eye spots a Pearl\".\n\nIn 2020, McCartney released the album \"McCartney III\", which featured the hit single \"Find My Way\". The album was a self-titled solo effort, with McCartney playing all the instruments. In 2021, McCartney released the album \"McCartney III Imagined\", which featured reinterpretations and remixes of the songs from the original album.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nMcCartney has been married three times. His first marriage was to Linda Eastman in 1969, with whom he had three children: James, Mary, and Stella. The couple divorced in 1971, but remained friends until Linda's death in 1998.\n\nIn 2002, McCartney married Heather Mills, a former model and anti-landmine campaigner. The couple had a daughter, Beatrice Milly, in 2003, but separated in 2006 and divorced in 2008.\n\nIn 2011, McCartney married Nancy Shevell, a businesswoman and vice-president of a transportation conglomerate. The couple had a civil ceremony in London, and have been together ever since.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nMcCartney is widely regarded as one of the most influential and successful musicians of all time. He has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Beatles and as a solo artist. He has won numerous awards and accolades, including 18 Grammy Awards and a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nMcCartney's music has been widely praised for its innovation, creativity, and influence.

[he] produced technically 'finished' work almost entirely by instinct, his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears ..  [A] natural melodist—a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony.\" [247] McCartney likened his approach to \"the primitive cave artists, who drew without training\" [248]\n\n\nEarly influences\nThe Messiah has arrived! [249]\n\n\nBass guitar\nBest known for primarily using a plectrum or pick, McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle [256] He was strongly influenced by Motown artists, in particular James Jamerson, whom McCartney called a hero for his melodic style He was also influenced by Brian Wilson, as he commented: \"because he went to very unusual places\" [257] Another favourite bassist of his is Stanley Clarke [258] McCartney's skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by bassists including Sting, Dr Dre bassist Mike Elizondo, and Colin Moulding of XTC [259]\n\n\nAcoustic guitar\nIf I couldn't have any other instrument, I would have to have an acoustic guitar [277]\n\n\nElectric guitar\nLinda was a big fan of my guitar playing, whereas I've got my doubts I think there are proper guitar players and then there are guys like me who love playing it [281]\n\n\nVocals\nMcCartney is known for his belting power, versatility and wide tenor vocal range, spanning over four octaves [289] [290] He was ranked the 11th greatest singer of all time by Rolling Stone, [291] voted the 8th greatest singer ever by NME readers [292] and number 10 by Music Radar readers in the list of \"the 30 greatest lead singers of all time\" [293] Over the years, McCartney has been named a significant vocal influence by Chris Cornell, [294] Billy Joel, [295] Steven Tyler, [296] Brad Delp, [297] and Axl Rose [298]\n\n\nKeyboards\nMcCartney played piano on several Beatles songs, including \"She's a Woman\", \"For No One\", \"A Day in the Life\", \"Hello, Goodbye\", \"Lady Madonna\", \"Hey Jude\", \"Martha My Dear\", \"Let It Be\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\" [308] MacDonald considered the piano part in \"Lady Madonna\" as reminiscent of Fats Domino, and \"Let It Be\" as having a gospel rhythm [309] MacDonald called McCartney's Mellotron intro on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" an integral feature of the song's character [310] McCartney played a Moog synthesiser on the Beatles song \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" and the Wings track \"Loup (1st Indian on the Moon)\" [311] Ingham described the Wings songs \"With a Little Luck\" and \"London Town\" as being \"full of the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches\" [312]\n\n\nDrums\nMcCartney played drums on the Beatles' songs \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", \"Dear Prudence\", \"Martha My Dear\", \"Wild Honey Pie\" and \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" [313] He also played all the drum parts on his albums McCartney, McCartney II and McCartney III, as well as on Wings' Band on the Run, and most of the drums on his solo LP Chaos and Creation in the Backyard [314] His other drumming contributions include Paul Jones' rendition of \"And the Sun Will Shine\" (1968), [315] Steve Miller Band's 1969 tracks \"Celebration Song\" and \"My Dark Hour\", [316] [317] and \"Sunday Rain\" from the Foo Fighters' 2017 album Concrete and Gold [318]\n\n\nTape loops\nIn the mid-1960s, when visiting artist friend John Dunbar's flat in London, McCartney brought tapes he had compiled at then-girlfriend Jane Asher's home They included mixes of various songs, musical pieces and comments made by McCartney that Dick James made into a demo for him [319] Heavily influenced by American avant-garde musician John Cage, McCartney made tape loops by recording voices, guitars and bongos on a Brenell tape recorder and splicing the various loops He referred to the finished product as \"electronic symphonies\" [320] He reversed the tapes, sped them up, and slowed them down to create the desired effects, some of which the Beatles later used on the songs \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and \"The Fool on the Hill\" [321]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWhile at school during the 1950s, McCartney thrived at art assignments, often earning top accolades for his visual work However, his lack of discipline negatively affected his academic grades, preventing him from earning admission to art college [322] During the 1960s, he delved into the visual arts, explored experimental cinema, and regularly attended film, theatrical and classical music performances His first contact with the London avant-garde scene was through artist John Dunbar, who introduced McCartney to art dealer Robert Fraser [323] At Fraser's flat he first learned about art appreciation and met Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Peter Blake, and Richard Hamilton [324] McCartney later purchased works by Magritte, whose painting of an apple had inspired the Apple Records logo [325] McCartney became involved in the renovation and publicising of the Indica Gallery in Mason's Yard, London, which Barry Miles had co-founded and where Lennon first met Yoko Ono Miles also co-founded International Times, an underground paper that McCartney helped to start with direct financial support and by providing interviews to attract advertiser income Miles later wrote McCartney's official biography, Many Years from Now (1997) [326]\n\n\nCreative outlets\nWhile at school during the

Years from Now (1997) [326]\n\n\nBusiness\nSince the Rich List began in 1989, McCartney has been the UK's wealthiest musician, with an estimated fortune of £730 million in 2015 [346] In addition to an interest in Apple Corps and MPL Communications, an umbrella company for his business interests, he owns a significant music publishing catalogue, with access to over 25,000 copyrights, including the publishing rights to the musicals Guys and Dolls, A Chorus Line, Annie and Grease [347] He earned £40 million in 2003, the highest income that year within media professions in the UK [348] This rose to £48.5 million by 2005 [349] McCartney's 18-date On the Run Tour grossed £37 million in 2012 [350]\n\n\nDrugs\nMcCartney first used drugs in the Beatles' Hamburg days when they often used Preludin to maintain their energy while performing for long periods [360] Bob Dylan introduced them to cannabis in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting \"very high\" and \"giggling uncontrollably\" [361] His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics \"another kind of mind\" in \"Got to Get You into My Life\" specifically as a reference to cannabis [362] During the filming of Help!, McCartney occasionally smoked a joint in the car on the way to the studio, and often forgot his lines [363] Director Richard Lester overheard two physically attractive women trying to persuade McCartney to use heroin, but he refused [363] Introduced to cocaine by Robert Fraser, McCartney used the drug regularly during the recording of Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and for about a year in total but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards [364]\n\n\nVegetarianism and activism\nSince 1975, McCartney has been a vegetarian [375] [376] He and his wife Linda were vegetarians for most of their 29-year marriage They decided to stop consuming meat after Paul saw lambs in a field as they were eating a meal of lamb Soon after, the couple became outspoken animal rights activists [377] In his first interview after Linda's death, he promised to continue working for animal rights, and in 1999, he spent £3,000,000 to ensure Linda McCartney Foods remained free of genetically engineered ingredients [378] In 1995, he narrated the documentary Devour the Earth, written by Tony Wardle [379] McCartney is a supporter of the animal rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals He has appeared in the group's campaigns, and in 2009, McCartney narrated a video for them titled \"Glass Walls\", which was harshly critical of slaughterhouses, the meat industry, and their effect on animal welfare [380] [381] [382] McCartney has also supported campaigns headed by the Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society International, World Animal Protection, and the David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation [383] [384]\n\n\nFootball\nMcCartney has publicly professed support for Everton F.C and has also shown favour for Liverpool F.C [403] In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said: \"Here's the deal: my father was born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if it comes down to a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two, I would have to support Everton But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish, who had been to the gig and I thought 'You know what? I am just going to support them both because it's all Liverpool.'\" [404]\n\n\nRelationships\nMcCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dorothy \"Dot\" Rhone, whom he met at the Casbah club in 1959 [405] According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations He often chose clothes and makeup for her, encouraging her to grow her blonde hair to simulate Brigitte Bardot's hairstyle, [406] and at least once insisting she have her hair restyled, to disappointing effect [407] When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962 [408] The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage According to Spitz, McCartney, now \"free of obligation\", ended the engagement [409]\n\n\nGirlfriends\nMcCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dorothy \"Dot\" Rhone, whom he met at the Casbah club in 1959 [405] According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations He often chose clothes and makeup for her, encouraging her to grow her blonde hair to simulate Brigitte Bardot's hairstyle, [406] and at least once insisting she have her hair restyled, to disappointing effect [407] When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962 [408] The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage According to Spitz, McCartney, now \"free of obligation\", ended the engagement [409]\n\n\nDot Rhone\nMcCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dorothy \"Dot\" Rhone, whom he met at the Casbah club in 1959 [405] According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations He often chose clothes and makeup for her, encouraging her to grow her blonde hair to simulate Brigitte Bardot's hairstyle, [406] and at least once insisting she have her hair restyled, to disappointing effect [407] When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962 [408] The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage According to Spitz, McCartney, now \"free of obligation\", ended the engagement [409]\n\n\nJane Asher\nMcCartney first met British actress Jane Asher on 18 April 1963 when a photographer asked them to pose at a Beatles performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London [410] The two began a relationship, and in November of that year he took up residence with Asher at her parents' home at 57 Wimpole Street in Marylebone, central London [411] They lived there for more than two years before moving to McCartney's own home in St John's Wood in March 1966 [412] He wrote several songs while living with the Ashers, including \"Yesterday\", \"And I Love Her\", \"You Won't See Me\" and \"I'm Looking Through You\", the latter three having been inspired by their romance [413] They had a five-year relationship and planned to marry, but Asher broke off the engagement after she discovered that McCartney had become involved with Francie Schwartz, [414] an American screenwriter who moved to London at age 23, thinking she could sell a script to the Beatles Schwartz met McCartney and he invited her to move into his London house, where events ensued that possibly broke up his relationship with Asher [415]\n\n\nWives\nLinda Eastman was a music fan who once commented, \"all my teen years were spent with an ear to the radio.\" [416] At times, she skipped school to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry [416] She became a popular photographer with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966 She commented, \"It was John who interested me at the start He was my Beatle hero But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked.\" [417] The pair first became properly acquainted on 15 May 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London [418] As Paul remembers, \"The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to ..

I married  [Linda], a New York divorcee with a child, and at the time they didn't like that\" [429]\n\n\nNancy Shevell\nMcCartney married New Yorker Nancy Shevell in a civil ceremony at Marylebone Town Hall, London, on 9 October 2011 The wedding was a modest event attended by a group of about 30 relatives and friends [430] The couple had been together since November 2007 [431] Shevell is vice-president of a family-owned transportation conglomerate which owns New England Motor Freight [432] She is a former member of the board of the New York area's Metropolitan Transportation Authority [433] Shevell is about 18 years younger than McCartney [434] They had known each other for about 20 years prior to marrying, having met because both had homes in the Hamptons [434]\n\n\nBeatles\nThough McCartney had a strained relationship with Lennon post-Beatles, they briefly became close again in early 1974, and played music together on one occasion [435] In later years, the two grew apart [436] McCartney often phoned Lennon, but was apprehensive about the reception he would receive During one call, Lennon told him, \"You're all pizza and fairytales!\" [437] In an effort to avoid talking only about business, they often spoke of cats, babies, or baking bread [438]\n\n\nJohn Lennon\nThough McCartney had a strained relationship with Lennon post-Beatles, they briefly became close again in early 1974, and played music together on one occasion [435] In later years, the two grew apart [436] McCartney often phoned Lennon, but was apprehensive about the reception he would receive During one call, Lennon told him, \"You're all pizza and fairytales!\" [437] In an effort to avoid talking only about business, they often spoke of cats, babies, or baking bread [438]\n\n\nReaction to Lennon's murder\nJohn is kinda like a constant .. always there in my being .. in my soul, so I always think of him [442]\n\n\nGeorge Harrison\nDiscussing his relationship with McCartney, Harrison said: \"Paul would always help along when you'd done his ten songs—then when he got 'round to doing one of my songs, he would help It was silly It was very selfish, actually .. There were a lot of tracks, though, where I played bass .. because what Paul would do—if he'd written a song, he'd learn all the parts for Paul and then come in the studio and say (sometimes he was very difficult): 'Do this' He'd never give you the opportunity to come out with something.\" [449]\n\n\nRingo Starr\nDuring a recording session for The Beatles in 1968, the two got into an argument over McCartney's critique of Starr's drum part for \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", which contributed to Starr temporarily leaving the band [453] Starr later commented on working with McCartney: \"Paul is the greatest bass player in the world But he is also very determined ..

School as \"Leicester Fosse\", the club joined The Football Association (FA) in 1890 [5] Before moving to Filbert Street in 1891, the club played at five different grounds, including Victoria Park

Division, the highest level of English football However, the club was relegated after a single season which included the team's record defeat, a 12–0 loss against Nottingham Forest [1] [7]\n\n\nPost-World War II (1949–2000)\nLeicester reached the FA Cup final for the first time in their history in 1949, [1] [13] losing 3–1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers The club, however, was celebrating a week later when a draw on the last day of the season ensured survival in Division Two [14] [15] Leicester won the Division Two championship in 1954, [16] with the help of Arthur Rowley, one of the club's most prolific strikers Although they were relegated from Division One the next season, under Dave Halliday they returned in 1957, [17] with Rowley scoring a club record 44 goals in one season [8] Leicester remained in Division One until 1969, [18] their longest period in the top flight.\n\n\nDecline in the early 21st century (2000–2008)\nMartin O'Neill was replaced by former England under-21 coach Peter Taylor During this time, one of Leicester's European appearances ended in a 3–1 defeat to Red Star Belgrade on 28 September 2000 in the UEFA Cup [25] Leicester began well under Taylor's management, topping the Premier League for two weeks in the autumn and remaining in contention for a European place for most of the campaign, before a late-season collapse dragged them down to a 13th-place finish.\n\n\nRise back to Premier League and change of ownership (2008–2015)\nThe 2008–09 campaign was Leicester's first season outside the top two levels of English football, but they hit this nadir only seven years before becoming the 2015–16 Premier League champions – one of the fastest rises to the top of the English football league system [30] Following relegation to the third tier the previous season, Leicester returned to the Championship at the first attempt in 2008–09, finishing as champions of League One after a 2–0 win at Southend United, with two matches in hand The 2009–10 season saw Leicester's revival under manager Nigel Pearson continue, as the club finished fifth and reached the Championship play-offs in their first season back in the second tier Though coming from 2–0 down on aggregate, away to Cardiff City, to briefly lead 3–2, they eventually lost to a penalty shoot-out in the play-off semi-final At the end of the season, Pearson left Leicester to become the manager of Hull City, claiming he felt the club seemed reluctant to keep him, and that Paulo Sousa had been the club's guest at both play-off games, hinting at a possible replacement On 7 July 2010, Sousa was confirmed as Pearson's replacement [31]\n\n\nPremier League champions, FA Cup winners, relegation and promotion (2015–present)\n\n\n\nClub identity\nThe club's traditional home colours of royal blue shirts, white shorts and either white or blue socks have been used for the team's kits throughout most of its history In more recent times, the club have alternated between either white or blue shorts.\n\n\nKit suppliers and shirt sponsors\nSource: [115]\n\n\nStadium and training ground\nIn their early years, Leicester played at numerous grounds, but have only played at two since they joined the Football League When first starting out, they played on a field by Fosse Road, [124] hence the original club name Leicester Fosse They moved from there to Victoria Park, and subsequently to Belgrave Road Upon turning professional the club moved to Mill Lane [124] After eviction from Mill Lane the club played at the County Cricket ground while seeking a new ground The club secured the use of an area of land by Filbert Street and moved there in 1891 [124]\n\n\nRivalries, support and hooliganism\nThe club's main rivals are Nottingham Forest, Derby County and Coventry City [135] [136] [137] Lesser rivalries also exist with Chelsea and more recently Tottenham Hotspur [138] [139] Leicester were widely considered to be Nottingham Forest's main rivals prior to the mid-1970s However, when Brian Clough was appointed as Forest manager in 1975, much to the dismay of Derby fans, the rivalry between Forest and Derby quickly intensified The Leicester-Forest rivalry is however, still prominent on the border of both cities, and on the border of both counties (Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire).\n\n\nEuropean record\nLeicester City's current manager, Steve Cooper, was appointed on 20 June 2024 [144] Nigel Pearson and Peter Hodge have both had two separate spells in charge of the club Dave Bassett also had a second spell as caretaker manager after his spell as permanent manager [145] Up until Peter Hodge was hired after World War I, the club had no official manager A nominal role of secretary/manager was employed, though the board and the selection committee took control of most team affairs It was Hodge who instated a system at the club for the manager having complete control over player and staff recruitment, team selection, and tactics Though Hodge was originally also titled \"secretary/manager\" he has retrospectively been named as the club's first official \"manager.\" [146]\n\n\nManagerial

decision to incorporate the 1971 Charity Shield into official records [147] However, Adam Black holds the record for the most appearances in the league with 528 between 1920 and 1935 [148]\n\n\nLeague history\nSince their election to the Football League in 1894, Leicester City have spent all but one season within the top two tiers of English football During the 2008–09 season, they played in League One, the third tier of English football, after the club's relegation from the Championship in the previous season However, the club made an instant return to the second tier and were promoted as

in Division One until 1969, [18] their longest period in the top flight.\n\n\nDecline in the early 21st century (2000–2008)\nMartin O'Neill was replaced by former England under-21 coach Peter Taylor During this time, one of Leicester's European appearances ended in a 3–1 defeat to Red Star Belgrade on 28 September 2000 in the UEFA Cup [25] Leicester began well under Taylor's management, topping the Premier League for two weeks in the autumn and remaining in contention for a European place for most of the campaign, before a late-season collapse dragged them down to a 13th-place finish.\n\n\nRise back to Premier League and change of ownership (2008–2015)\nThe 2008–09 campaign was Leicester's first season outside the top two levels of English football, but they hit this nadir only seven years before becoming the 2015–16 Premier League champions – one of the fastest rises to the top of the English football league system [30] Following relegation to the third tier the

season saw Leicester's revival under manager Nigel Pearson continue, as the club finished fifth and reached the Championship play-offs in their first season back in the second tier Though coming from

of an area of land by Filbert Street and moved there in 1891 [124]\n\n\nRivalries, support and hooliganism\nThe club's main rivals are Nottingham Forest, Derby County and Coventry City [135] [136] [137] Lesser rivalries also exist with Chelsea and more recently Tottenham Hotspur [138] [139] Leicester were widely considered to be Nottingham Forest's main rivals prior to the mid-1970s However, when Brian Clough was appointed as Forest manager in 1975, much to the dismay of Derby fans, the rivalry between Forest and Derby quickly intensified The Leicester-Forest rivalry is however, still prominent on the border of both cities, and on the border of both counties (Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire).\n\n\nEuropean record\nLeicester City's current manager, Steve Cooper, was appointed on

The murder of Emmett Till became a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement, sparking outrage and protests across the United States and around the world.\n\n# Early Childhood\n\nEmmett Till was born on July 25, 1941, in Chicago, Illinois, to Mamie Till and Louis Till. His mother, Mamie, was born in the small Delta town of Webb, Mississippi. The Delta region encompasses the large, multi-county area of northwestern Mississippi in the watershed of the Yazoo and Mississippi rivers.

Before Till departed for the Delta, his mother cautioned him that Chicago and Mississippi were two different worlds, and he should know how to behave in front of white people in the South. Till assured her that he understood.\n\n# Encounter between Till and Carolyn Bryant\n\nTill arrived at the home of Mose and Elizabeth Wright in Money, Mississippi, on August 21, 1955. On the evening of August 24, Till and several young relatives and neighbors were driven by his cousin Maurice Wright to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market to buy candy. Till's companions were children of sharecroppers and had been picking cotton all day. The market mostly served the local sharecropper population and was owned by a white couple, 24-year-old Roy Bryant and his 21-year-old wife Carolyn.\n\n# Lynching\n\nWhen Roy Bryant was informed of what had happened, he aggressively questioned several young black men who entered the store.

drafted Arizona tight end Rob Gronkowski Hernandez was the sixth tight end drafted in 2010 [32] Despite him being considered a top tight end prospect, multiple teams reportedly chose not to draft him because \"he was a problem\" [19]\n\n\n2010\nThroughout training camp, Hernandez competed to be a starting tight end against Crumpler, Gronkowski, and Rob Myers Hernandez had an impressive preseason alongside Gronkowski Their preseason performance would ultimately foreshadow their future success as one of the top tight end tandems in league history [35] Head coach Bill Belichick named Hernandez the third tight end on the Patriots depth chart, behind Crumpler and Gronkowski [43] Hernandez was used as the receiving tight end option with Crumpler inserted for plays that required blocking Hernandez started the 2010 season as the youngest player on any active roster in the NFL [19]\n\n\n2011\nOn February 21, 2011, it was reported that Hernandez had undergone hip surgery after injuring it in Week 15 [50] He entered training camp slated as a backup tight end and competed to be the secondary tight end against Crumpler and Lee Smith.\n\n\n2012\nOn August 27, 2012, the Patriots signed Hernandez to a five-year, $39.58 million contract extension that included $15.95 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $12.50 million [9] [66] The $12.5 million signing bonus was the largest signing bonus ever received by an NFL tight end His $40 million total was the second-largest contract extension ever given to a tight end, after teammate Gronkowski's $53 million Hernandez gave $50,000 of that bonus to a charity named for the late wife of the Patriots owner [19] [66]\n\n\nRelationship with the team\nHernandez was not popular with his teammates, and had few friends in the locker room [19] According to one of his teammates, he seemed to enjoy being an outcast on the team [70] Brady was overheard after a game telling Tim Tebow, Hernandez's quarterback in college, that he was trying to steer Hernandez in the right direction but called him \"a lot to handle\" [19] Tebow had previously tried to help Hernandez and enlisted Brady for the same purpose [19] Hernandez was, however, known as one of the hardest working members of the team [19]\n\n\nNFL career statistics\nHernandez had a number of run-ins with the law throughout his life, beginning just a few months after he arrived in Florida as a pre-freshman By his own admission, Hernandez became jumpy in nightclubs, and had a history of taking offense at minor slights [71] He also said that he believed people were

physically challenge him and were looking to fight him [71]\n\n\n2007 Gainesville bar fight\nOn April 28, 2007, according to a police report in Gainesville, Florida, a 17-year-old Hernandez consumed two alcoholic drinks in a restaurant with Tim Tebow, refused to pay the bill, and was escorted out by a restaurant employee [14] As the manager walked away, Hernandez \"sucker punched\" him on the side of the head, rupturing his eardrum [14]\n\n\n2007 Gainesville double shooting\nOn September 30, 2007, someone approached a car containing Randall Carson, Justin Glass, and Corey Smith on foot and

back-seat passenger, was unharmed, and told police that the shooter was a \"Hawaiian\" or \"Hispanic\" male with a large build weighing about 230 lb (100 kg) and having many tattoos [79]  He picked a photo of Hernandez out of a police lineup [14]\n\n\n2011 Plainville fight\nAt 3:45 a.m on April 30, 2011, police responded to a fight in front of Hernandez's rented townhouse in Plainville, Massachusetts [19] A high school friend had been pulled over earlier in the evening after driving Hernandez home from a Boston bar [19] The driver was weaving in and out of lanes and traveling at 120 miles per hour in a work zone and on a highway with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour [19]  The Massachusetts State Trooper who pulled the car over did not arrest the driver because he recognized Hernandez in the passenger seat [19] The Plainville police also recognized Hernandez, and told the two to go indoors [19]\n\n\n2012 Boston double homicide\nHernandez was investigated in connection with a double homicide that took place on July 16, 2012, near the Cure Lounge in Boston's South End [71] [81] Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, both immigrants from Cape Verde and living in Dorchester, were killed by gunshots fired into their vehicle [82] Witnesses testified that Hernandez's silver SUV pulled up next to the victims and someone from his car yelled racial epithets towards the victims [82] Someone from the car then fired five shots, killing the two immigrants [82] Police immediately identified Hernandez, who was then playing for the Patriots, in the club's security camera footage, but thought it was a coincidence that Hernandez happened to be at the club that evening [82]\n\n\n2013 traffic stop\nIn January 2013, Hernandez and Bradley partied at Cure again [82]  At 2:20 a.m., Bradley was pulled over on the Southeast Expressway after his vehicle was seen speeding at 105 miles per hour [82]  According to the State Police he was \"wobbly drunk\" [82] Hernandez tried to get his friend out of trouble by saying, \"Trooper, I am Aaron Hernandez It's okay.\" [82] However, Bradley was still arrested for drunk driving [82]\n\n\n2013 Miami shooting of Alexander Bradley\nIn February 2013, Hernandez, Bradley, and several others visited a Florida strip club where they ran up a $10,000 bill [71] Hernandez began to worry about two men sitting across from them, thinking they were plainclothes Boston police officers [71] Bradley later recalled telling Hernandez that they were probably tracking the pair as part of their investigation into the double murder outside the Cure [71]\n\n\n2013 California incidents\nHernandez traveled to California with Jenkins and their young daughter in 2013 to have shoulder surgery [71] While there, Jenkins called the police twice in less than a week, claiming that Hernandez was drunk and violent [71] In the first incident, Hernandez put his hand through a window [71] Hernandez's brother and friends later said that there were drugs and guns in the rented apartment, but police determined that Jenkins and the child were not in danger and never searched the premises [71] D.J Hernandez found his brother alone on the roof of the building one night, looking defeated and rubbing the barrel of a gun against his face [71]\n\n\nMurder of Odin Lloyd\nOn June 18, 2013, police searched Hernandez's home in connection with an investigation into the shooting death of a friend, Odin Lloyd, whose body was found, with multiple gunshot wounds to the back and chest, in an industrial park about a mile from Hernandez's house [100] [101]\n\n\nRelease from team and aftermath\nHernandez's arrest and subsequent termination by the Patriots resulted in financial and other consequences He automatically forfeited his 2015–18 salaries, totaling $19.3 million, which were not guaranteed [114] The Patriots voided all remaining guarantees, including his 2013 and 2014 salaries, on the terms that those guarantees were for skill, injury, or salary cap room, and did not include being cut for \"conduct detrimental to the best interests of professional football\" [114] The team planned to withhold $3.25 million of Hernandez's 2012 signing bonus that was due to be paid in 2014, and to recoup the signing bonus already paid [114] The NFL salary cap allows teams to pro-rate signing bonuses over the life of a contract or a five-year period, whichever is shorter By releasing Hernandez, the Patriots accelerated all of Hernandez's remaining guaranteed money into the 2013 and 2014 salary caps: the team took a $2.55 million hit in 2013, and another $7.5 million in 2014 [114]\n\n\nAppeal and conviction\nAfter Hernandez's death, on April 25, 2017, his lawyers filed a motion at Massachusetts Superior Court in Fall River to vacate his murder conviction [123] [124] The request was granted May 9, 2017; therefore Hernandez technically died an innocent man, due to the legal principle of abatement ab initio [125] Under Massachusetts law, this principle asserts that when a criminal defendant dies but has not exhausted all legal appeals, the case reverts to its status \"at the beginning\"—the conviction is vacated and the defendant is rendered \"innocent\" [125] At the time of his death, Hernandez was in the process of filing an appeal for his 2015 conviction in the murder of Odin Lloyd [125]\n\n\nPrison\nThe Boston Globe described Hernandez as being \"strangely content\" while in jail, an attitude that confounded his fiancée Shayanna Jenkins [86] He told his mother that, \"I've been the most relaxed and less stressed in jail than I have out of jail.\" [86] He was, however, punished on multiple occasions for breaking prison rules, including screaming and banging on his cell door [86]  Over the course of his four years behind bars, he increasingly turned to the Bible and became more religious [86]\n\n\nDeath\nOn April 19, 2017, at 3:05 am EDT, five days after Hernandez was acquitted of the 2012 Boston double homicide of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, correction officers found Hernandez hanging with bed sheets from the window in his cell at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Lancaster, Massachusetts He was transported to UMass Memorial Hospital-Leominster, where he was pronounced dead at 4:07 am [131] [132] [133] [134] He had been smoking K2, a drug associated with psychosis, within thirty hours of his death [8] A fellow inmate told investigators that he had spent much of the previous two days smoking the synthetic cannabinoid [70]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2007, Hernandez began dating Shayanna Jenkins, a girl he had known since elementary school Their daughter Avielle was born in 2012, [152] the same month that the couple became engaged, also the month that Hernandez purchased a $1.3 million, 8,130-square-foot (755 m2), four-story home with an in-ground pool in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, where the family lived together [19] [153] Jenkins moved in with Hernandez in 2011, during his second season with the Patriots [19]\n\n\nRelationships\nIn 2007, Hernandez began dating Shayanna Jenkins, a girl he had known since elementary school Their daughter Avielle was born in 2012, [152] the same month that the couple became engaged, also the month that Hernandez purchased a $1.3 million, 8,130-square-foot (755 m2), four-story home with an in-ground pool in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, where the family lived together [19] [153] Jenkins moved in with Hernandez in 2011, during his second season with the Patriots [19]\n\n\nSexuality\nFollowing Hernandez's death, a high school teammate, Dennis SanSoucie, described a secret homosexual relationship between the two between the 7th and 11th grades [9] [16] The teammate stated that Hernandez had many sexual partners, male and female, during this time [16] Hernandez's brother D.J., mother Terri, and attorney George Leontire report that Hernandez came out as gay to his mother and ex-girlfriend while in prison [10] [86] [116] [157] Leontire, who is also gay, [15] said his client \"clearly was gay\" and described the \"immense pain that it caused him\" and the self-hatred that came from growing up in a culture that was anti-gay [158] According to Leontire, Hernandez believed that the sexual abuse he experienced as a boy caused him to become gay [159] [160] A college girlfriend said that \"he never dealt with  [the sexual abuse] It led to issues in his sexuality.\" [158] SanSoucie stated that Hernandez was terrified that his father would find out about his sexuality [161] Sansoucie however stated he believes Hernandez was not ashamed of who he was and that he was proud of his sexuality \"Being bisexual has no difference in being an athlete or just being yourself … It was just, he couldn't say anything at the time There was no one in the NFL that ever broke this news,\" SanSoucie said in an interview [162]\n\n\nParanoia\nD.J described Hernandez as growing increasingly paranoid as an adult, believing that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and others were out to get him [10] D.J said that Hernandez slept with a large knife by his bed and collected a large number of weapons for his protection [10] After the 2013 shooting of Alexander Bradley, Hernandez hired a friend from Bristol to serve as his bodyguard 24 hours a day [71] He also installed a sophisticated surveillance system in his home [15] Shortly thereafter, Hernandez approached Coach Bill Belichick \"in a state of deepening paranoia\", saying he feared for his family's safety [19] Hernandez's agent testified that Hernandez requested the meeting because he was in fear for his life [71] Hernandez requested a trade to a team on the other side of the country, but the request was denied [71]\n\n\nBrain damage\nAfter his death, researchers at Boston University studied Hernandez's brain and diagnosed him with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), stage 3 of 4, [8] [166] [167] and described Hernandez's brain as a classic case of the pathology [167] [168] [169] CTE is caused by repeated head trauma [8] Hernandez had two confirmed concussions since he began playing football at eight years old, but the Boston Globe believed \"he undoubtedly took other punishing hits to the head that were never recorded.\" [8] CTE is associated with cumulative injuries In a phone conversation recorded in prison, Hernandez said \"I'm like a grandpa All my bones are so sore.\" [34]\n\n\nIn other media\nHernandez's arrest, conviction, and death attracted a great deal of media attention, especially because of increasing concerns about CTE in athletes His life was the focus of a 2018 Boston Globe Spotlight Team investigation and a podcast called \"Gladiator: Aaron Hernandez & Football, Inc.\" [174]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Aaron Hernandez\n\nAaron Hernandez

He also played in 3 playoff games, catching 8 passes for 103 yards and 1 touchdown.\n\nLegal Issues\n\nHernandez had a number of run-ins with the law throughout his life, beginning just a few months after he arrived in Florida as a pre-freshman.

He automatically forfeited his 2015-18 salaries, totaling $19.3 million, which were not guaranteed. The Patriots voided all remaining guarantees, including his 2013 and 2014 salaries, on the terms that those guarantees were for skill, injury, or salary cap room, and did not include being cut for \"conduct detrimental to the best interests of professional football.\"\n\nAppeal and Conviction\n\nAfter Hernandez's death, on April 25, 2017, his lawyers filed a motion at Massachusetts Superior Court in Fall River to vacate his murder conviction. The request was granted May 9, 2017, and therefore Hernandez technically died an innocent man, due to the legal principle of abatement ab initio.\n\nPrison\n\nThe Boston Globe described Hernandez as being \"strangely content\" while in jail, an attitude that confounded his fiancée Shayanna Jenkins. He told his mother that, \"I've been the most relaxed and less stressed in jail than I have out of jail.\" He was, however, punished on multiple occasions for breaking prison rules, including screaming and banging on his cell door.\n\nDeath\n\nOn April 19, 2017, at 3:05 am EDT, five days after Hernandez was acquitted of the 2012 Boston double homicide of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, correction officers found Hernandez hanging with bed sheets from the window in his cell at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Lancaster, Massachusetts. He was transported to UMass Memorial Hospital-Leominster, where he was pronounced dead at 4:07 am.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn 2007, Hernandez began dating Shayanna Jenkins, a girl he had known since elementary school. Their daughter Avielle was born in 2012, the same month that the couple became engaged, also the month that Hernandez purchased a $1.3 million, 8,130-square-foot (755 m2), four-story home with an in-ground pool in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, where the family lived together.\n\nParanoia\n\nD.J described Hernandez as growing increasingly paranoid as an adult, believing that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and others were out to get him. D.J said that Hernandez slept with a large knife by his bed and collected a large number of weapons for his protection.\n\nBrain Damage\n\nAfter his death, researchers at Boston University studied Hernandez's brain and diagnosed him with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), stage 3 of 4.

Hernandez in the passenger seat [19] The Plainville police also recognized Hernandez, and told the two to go indoors [19]\n\n\n2012 Boston double homicide\nHernandez was investigated in connection with a double homicide that took place on July 16, 2012, near the Cure Lounge in Boston's South End [71] [81] Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, both immigrants from

friends later said that there were drugs and guns in the rented apartment, but police determined that Jenkins and the child were not in danger and never searched the premises [71] D.J Hernandez found

forfeited his 2015–18 salaries, totaling $19.3 million, which were not guaranteed [114] The Patriots voided all remaining guarantees, including his 2013 and 2014 salaries, on the terms that those guarantees were for skill, injury, or salary cap room, and did not include being cut for \"conduct detrimental to the best interests of professional football\" [114] The team planned to withhold $3.25 million of Hernandez's 2012 signing bonus that was due to be paid in 2014, and to recoup the signing bonus already paid [114] The NFL salary cap allows teams to pro-rate signing bonuses over the life of a contract or a five-year period, whichever is shorter By releasing Hernandez, the Patriots accelerated all of Hernandez's remaining guaranteed money into the 2013 and 2014 salary caps: the team took a $2.55 million hit in 2013, and another $7.5 million in 2014 [114]\n\n\nAppeal and conviction\nAfter Hernandez's death, on April 25, 2017, his lawyers filed a motion at Massachusetts Superior Court in Fall River to vacate his murder conviction [123] [124] The request was granted May 9, 2017; therefore Hernandez technically died an innocent man, due to the legal principle of abatement ab initio [125] Under Massachusetts law, this principle asserts that when a criminal defendant dies but has not exhausted all legal appeals, the case reverts to its status \"at the beginning\"—the conviction is vacated and the defendant is rendered \"innocent\" [125] At the time of his death, Hernandez was in the process of filing an appeal for his 2015 conviction in the murder of Odin Lloyd [125]\n\n\nPrison\nThe Boston Globe described Hernandez as being \"strangely content\" while in jail, an attitude that confounded his fiancée Shayanna Jenkins [86] He told his mother that, \"I've been the most relaxed and less stressed in jail than I have out of jail.\" [86] He was, however, punished on multiple occasions for breaking prison rules, including screaming and banging on his cell door [86]  Over the course of his four years behind bars, he increasingly turned to the Bible and became more religious [86]\n\n\nDeath\nOn April 19, 2017, at 3:05 am EDT, five days after

smoking K2, a drug associated with psychosis, within thirty hours of his death [8] A fellow inmate told investigators that he had spent much of the previous two days smoking the synthetic cannabinoid [70]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2007, Hernandez began dating Shayanna Jenkins, a girl he had known since elementary school Their daughter Avielle was born in 2012, [152] the same month that the couple became engaged, also the month that Hernandez purchased a $1.3 million, 8,130-square-foot (755 m2), four-story home with an in-ground pool in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, where the family lived together [19] [153] Jenkins moved in with Hernandez in 2011, during his second season with the Patriots [19]\n\n\nRelationships\nIn 2007, Hernandez began dating Shayanna Jenkins, a girl he had known

the Patriots [19]\n\n\nSexuality\nFollowing Hernandez's death, a high school teammate, Dennis SanSoucie, described a secret homosexual relationship between the two between the 7th and 11th grades [9] [16] The teammate stated that Hernandez had many sexual partners, male and female, during this time [16] Hernandez's brother D.J., mother Terri, and attorney George Leontire report that Hernandez came out as gay to his mother and ex-girlfriend while in prison [10] [86] [116] [157] Leontire, who is also gay, [15] said his client \"clearly was gay\" and described the \"immense pain that it caused him\" and the self-hatred that came from growing up in a culture that was anti-gay [158] According to Leontire, Hernandez believed that the sexual abuse he experienced as a boy caused him to become gay [159] [160] A college girlfriend said that \"he never dealt with  [the sexual abuse] It led to issues in his sexuality.\" [158] SanSoucie stated that Hernandez was terrified that his father would find out about his sexuality [161] Sansoucie however stated he believes Hernandez was not ashamed of who he was and that he was proud of his sexuality \"Being bisexual has no difference in being an athlete or just being yourself … It was just, he couldn't say anything at the time There was no one in the NFL that ever broke this news,\" SanSoucie said in an interview [162]\n\n\nParanoia\nD.J described Hernandez as growing increasingly paranoid as an adult, believing that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and others were out to get him [10] D.J said that Hernandez slept with a large knife by his bed and collected a large number of weapons for his protection [10] After the 2013 shooting of Alexander Bradley, Hernandez hired a friend from Bristol to serve as his bodyguard 24 hours a day [71] He also installed a sophisticated surveillance system in his home [15] Shortly thereafter, Hernandez approached Coach Bill Belichick \"in a state of deepening paranoia\", saying he feared for his family's safety [19] Hernandez's agent testified that Hernandez requested the meeting because he was in fear for his life [71] Hernandez requested a trade to a team on the other side of the country, but the request was denied [71]\n\n\nBrain damage\nAfter his death, researchers at Boston University studied Hernandez's brain and diagnosed him with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), stage 3 of 4, [8] [166] [167] and described Hernandez's brain as a classic case of the pathology [167] [168] [169] CTE is caused by repeated head trauma [8] Hernandez had two confirmed concussions since he began playing football at eight years old, but the Boston Globe believed \"he undoubtedly took other punishing hits to the head that were never recorded.\" [8] CTE is associated with cumulative injuries In a phone conversation recorded in prison, Hernandez said \"I'm like a grandpa All my bones are so sore.\" [34]\n\n\nIn other media\nHernandez's arrest, conviction, and death attracted a great deal of media attention, especially because of increasing concerns about CTE in athletes His life was the focus of a 2018 Boston Globe Spotlight Team investigation and a podcast called \"Gladiator: Aaron Hernandez & Football, Inc.\" [174]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She was the fourth child of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and Princess Caroline of Baden, and was born on 27 January 1805 at Nymphenburg Palace in Munich.\n\n## Childhood (1805-1824)\n\nPrincess Sophie Friederike Dorothea Wilhelmine was born at Nymphenburg Palace in Munich, the capital city of the Kingdom of Bavaria. She was the fourth child of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and Princess Caroline of Baden. Sophie's childhood was marked by a close relationship with her family, particularly her mother, whom she loved dearly.\n\nAs the fourth child of the royal family, Sophie was not expected to play a major role in the succession of the throne. However, she was said to be her father's favorite daughter, and was known for her intelligence, kindness, and strong personality. Sophie was also very close to her twin sister, Maria Anna, and her other sisters, who made up a lively and loving family unit.\n\n## Archduchess of Austria (1824-1872)\n\nIn 1824, Sophie married Archduke Franz Karl of Austria, the son of Emperor Francis II. The marriage was a strategic one, as it united two powerful European dynasties. Sophie's paternal half-sister, Caroline Augusta of Bavaria, had married Francis II in 1816, making Sophie the younger sister-in-law of the Emperor.\n\nFranz Karl and Sophie had six children together, including two sons, Otto Franz and Franz Joseph, who would go on to play important roles in the history of the Habsburg Empire. Despite the fact that Sophie had little in common with her husband, she was a caring and devoted wife to Franz Karl, who loved and respected her.\n\n## Alleged Extramarital Affair\n\nSophie's marriage to Franz Karl was marked by rumors of an extramarital affair with Napoleon II, the son of Napoleon Bonaparte and the Duke of Reichstadt. Napoleon II lived at the Austrian Court, and Sophie was known to have been very close to him. There were rumors of a romantic affair between the two, although these were never confirmed.\n\nThe rumors of the affair were exacerbated by the fact that Sophie gave birth to a son, Maximilian, in 1832, just two weeks before Napoleon II's death. There were suspicions that Maximilian was actually the son of Napoleon II, although these were never verified. Despite the rumors, Sophie's relationship with Napoleon II was widely acknowledged, and she was known to have been deeply affected by his death.\n\n## Children\n\nSophie's children with Franz Karl played important roles in the history of the Habsburg Empire. Her eldest son, Otto Franz, went on to become the father of Karl Ludwig, who was the grandfather of Austria's last Emperor, Charles I.\n\n## Portrayal on Stage and Screen\n\nSophie has been portrayed on stage and screen several times, including in the 2013 film \"Faust,\" which starred Helen Mirren as Sophie. She has also been portrayed in several stage productions, including a 2018 production of \"The Duchess of Reichstadt,\" which starred Emma Watson as Sophie.\n\n## Honours\n\nSophie was awarded several honors during her lifetime, including the Order of the Golden Fleece, which was conferred upon her by her husband, Franz Karl.

both were flanged and have been dated to the 14th century [5] On the other hand, the copper ingots from Hurungwe were dated to the 16th century [10] These copper ingots shared  a similar shape with those from the Copperbelt and Katanga area, which shows that trade in copper  among these inland sites continued from the 14th century up to the 16th century [10] Great Zimbabwe had a different form of the copper ingots - unflendged and they were dated to a much earlier date of the 13th century [10] Despite copper being the primary trade item in south-central trade, the people at Ing'ombe Ilede used copper to manufacture domestic ornaments, such as, the copper bracelets, found in most of the rich burials at the site The manufacture of  copper bracelets is evident in wire drawing tools and a bundle of fine wire for making copper bracelets discovered in some of the rich burials at Ing'ombe Ilede [1]\n\n\nTextiles\nThe cloth at Ing'ombe Ilede consists of two types: the locally made, coarse cloth, and the finely woven imported cloth, thought to be of Indian  origin The coarse material contained some patterns  neatly woven into the fabric [1] Spindle whorls made from broken pieces of pottery and perforated  with a sharp metal object were discovered at the site to support the local production of the coarse cloth [1]\n\n\nCeramics\nCeramics have been a good source of chronology for most of archaeological sites excavated in Africa and the world over Traits such decorative motifs and vessels shapes have been used to situate ceramics to specific time periods The shape of the ceramics has also been used to indicate the function of the vessels Ingombe Ilede contained a large number of  ceramics sherds that were reconstructed into complete vessels of various sizes and shapes These vessels were probably used for domestic purposes or as trade items There was no evidence of the method used to manufacture pottery at the site [1] However, archaeologists found tools suggesting pottery production such as pebble tools used for burnishing the surfaces of the vessels before firing them [1] Also present at the site were mussels used for smoothing the walls of the pottery during the shaping stage [1] The clay for the pottery was probably obtained from the Lusitu River [1] The potters perhaps burnt the pottery in an open area owing to uneven coloring found on the surfaces of pottery The pottery at Ing'ombe Ilede played an essential role in situating the chronology of burials at the site The chronology of the pottery was done using decorative motifs and the shape of the vessels These attributed acted as time markers that helped researchers to situate Ing'ombe Ilede Chronologically For example, the ceramics from earliest levels at Ing'ombe  were linked to Kangila and Sebanzi cultures [4]\n\n\nFarming\nThere were several lines of evidence that were discovered at Ingombe Ilede to suggest farming One of the lines of evidence were domesticated charred sorghum and millet  that were found at the site  [1] Also found at the site was indirect evidence, such as a leaf impression of sorghum on a pot sherd from burial 3.Besides, some  graves contained iron hoes and axes that pointed to farming [1] These were differentiated  into functional tool and ceremonial tools based on the amount of wear on the surfaces [1] The hoes and axes used for farming were heavily worn out compared to the ceremonial tools.\n\n\nFaunal Remains\nThere was minimal evidence present at the site to indicate the domestication of animals Among the minimal evidence found at the site were a fragmented ox mandible with maxilla and horns [1] The rest of the faunal materials belonged to wild animals, ranging from small mammals  like rats to big mammals like elephants, with the latter being hunted for ivory and meat [1]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Ingombe Ilede**\n\nIngombe Ilede is an archaeological site located in present-day Zambia, near the town of Chirundu, on the Zambezi River. The site was discovered in 1960 by Northern Rhodesia government workers and excavated by the archaeologist J.H. Chaplin. The site is significant for its rich burials, which date back to the 16th century, and its importance as a trade center in the region.\n\n**Excavation**\n\nThe site was uncovered in 1960 by Northern Rhodesia government workers and excavated by the archaeologist J.H. Chaplin. Chaplin carried out an investigation of the pit, located on the western side of the site. The pit contained archaeological items such as copper bangles, copper crosses, copper currency rods, and a gold beaded necklace. This area was later named burial 1.\n\nThe second discovery at the site consisted of burial 2 and 3 on the south end of the site, excavated by J.H. Chaplin and B.W. Anderson around the tank area. The burial contained iron tools that lay at the feet of the human remains. The government extended the tank area a bit further, and the extension yielded two more human remains. Further excavations were in 1962 when the Water Department decided to include another water tank on the western side of the original tank to maximize the water supply in the area around Ing'ombe Ilede. This extension led to the discovery of 30 human remains, which included 22 infants. These graves contained very few goods. The pottery found in association with the graves was linked to the earlier graves found at Ing'ombe Ilede.\n\n**Burials**\n\nThere were 48 burial graves that were uncovered at Ing'ombe Ilede between the periods 1960-1962 by Chaplin and Mrs. Anderson. These graves contained various grave goods. The goods ranged from ornamented objects such as glass beads, copper bangles to ceremonial goods such as the gongs and hoes, which were symbols of chieftainship and utilitarian items such as tongs, wire drawing plates, hammerheads, and copper razors. These burials were found in two locations at the site, the central tank area that contained 14 burials, while the 34 graves were located on the south edge of Ing'ombe Ilede.\n\n**Dating**\n\nThe earliest attempts at dating Ing'ombe Ilede placed the occupation of the site from the 7th-11th centuries. These dates came from charcoal samples obtained from a badly disturbed context excavated by Chaplin in 1960. Phillipson and Fagan reported and revised these dates after their trial excavation in 1968 near the earlier excavated rich burials, which produced additional charcoal for radiocarbon dating. The newly obtained dates suggested a domestic occupation near the burials in the 14th-15th centuries, and Phillipson and Fagan argued that this might have been a second, potentially shorter occupation of the site. They concluded that their new dates did not preclude the possibility of an earlier occupation in the later first millennium CE, followed by abandonment and then reoccupation in the 14th century. However, recent examination of the site using cloth that was obtained from burials 3 and 8 has situated them from the mid-15th to mid-17th centuries, with the most likely dates being in the 16th century.\n\n**Social Stratification**\n\nThe social status of the people of Ing'ombe Ilede was determined based on the contents of the burials. The burial sites with ornaments were probably for the affluent people, such as traders, while the graves without ornaments probably belonged to slaves or the less affluent. For example, some burials containing metal crafting tools such as those used for drawing and hammering copper wire were connected to metal craftsmen, who were considered of high social status. There was also evidence of hierarchy at Ing'ombe Ilede; for instance, burial 8 contained a flanged iron gong, a traditional symbol of chieftainship that resembled those found among people of Congo DR ancestry.\n\n**Trade**\n\nIng'ombe Ilede's central location gave it the best position as a transit point for the inland trade routes from Great Zimbabwe, Copperbelt, and Katanga to the Indian Ocean coast. Items of trade brought to the inland from the Indian Ocean included glass beads, shell beads, cowrie shells, and cloth, while items that came from the Indian Ocean trade route included ivory, slaves, salt, and gold. This central position also created a similar advantage for traders coming from Katanga and Copperbelt who were trading in copper in the form of copper ingots with Ing'ombe Ilede. Ing'ombe Ilede became a focal point where traders from various places in south-central Africa came to exchange items. For instance, it facilitated the transaction in copper from Katanga in Congo DR, Copperbelt in Zambia, and Hurungwe in Zimbabwe.\n\n**Trade Goods**\n\nTrading in glass beads in south-central Africa has a long antiquity that goes back to as early as the 8th to 17th centuries; however, the glass beads only arrived at Ing'ombe Ilede around the mid-15th and mid-17th centuries. Chemical analysis done on the Ing'ombe Ilede beads using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry shows that the glass beads at Ing'ombe Ilede belong to the Khami series from the Indian Ocean trade zone and possibly found themselves at Ing'ombe Ilede through trade. The beads found at Ing'ombe Ilede have been differentiated from other beads found in south-central Africa like Mapungubwe using trace elements found in the beads. Khami beads, for example, contained high levels of Magnesium oxide. The chemical analysis has helped situate some previously undated burials at Ing'ombe Ilede. The following are some of the burials that contained the Khami series beads: 3, 8, 10, 25, and 31.\n\n**Copper Ingots**\n\nCopper Ingots were used as a medium of exchange as early as 1000 CE in south-central Africa. The ingots at Ing'ombe Ilede came from various places through the inland trade routes and these were shaped in form of crosses. The copper ingots were differentiated using their shape. The shape of the copper ingots has also been a good indicator of chronology for Ing'ombe Ilede. For example, the copper ingots from the Copperbelt were similar in shape with those that came from Katanga; both were flanged and have been dated to the 14th century. On the other hand, the copper ingots from Hurungwe were dated to the 16th century. These copper ingots shared a similar shape with those from the Copperbelt and Katanga area, which shows that trade in copper among these inland sites continued from the 14th century up to the 16th century. Great Zimbabwe had a different form of the copper ingots - unflanged and they were dated to a much earlier date of the 13th century.\n\n**Textiles**\n\nThe cloth at Ing'ombe Ilede consists of two types: the locally made, coarse cloth, and the finely woven imported cloth, thought to be of Indian origin. The coarse material contained some patterns neatly woven into the fabric. Spindle whorls made from broken pieces of pottery and perforated with a sharp metal object were discovered at the site to support the local production of the coarse cloth.\n\n**Ceramics**\n\nThe ceramics have been a good source of chronology for most of archaeological sites excavated in Africa and the world over. Traits such as decorative motifs and vessels shapes have been used to situate ceramics to specific time periods. The shape of the ceramics has also been used to indicate the function of the vessels. Ingombe Ilede contained a large number of ceramics sherds that were reconstructed into complete vessels of various sizes and shapes. These vessels were probably used for domestic purposes or as trade items. There was no evidence of the method used to manufacture pottery at the site. However, archaeologists found tools suggesting pottery production such as pebble tools used for burnishing the surfaces of the vessels before firing them. Also present at the site were mussels used for smoothing the walls of the pottery during the shaping stage. The clay for the pottery was probably obtained from the Lusitu River. The potters perhaps burnt the pottery in an open area owing to uneven coloring found on the surfaces of pottery. The pottery at Ing'ombe Ilede played an essential role in situating the chronology of burials at the site. The chronology of the pottery was done using decorative motifs and the shape of the vessels. These attributed acted as time markers that helped researchers to situate Ing'ombe Ilede chronologically. For example, the ceramics from earliest levels at Ing'ombe were linked to Kangila and Sebanzi cultures.\n\n**Farming**\n\nThere were several lines of evidence that were discovered at Ingombe Ilede to suggest farming. One of the lines of evidence was domesticated charred sorghum and millet that were found at the site. Also found at the site was indirect evidence, such as a leaf impression of sorghum on a pot sherd from burial 3. Besides, some graves contained iron hoes and axes that pointed to farming. These were differentiated into functional tool and ceremonial tools based on the amount of wear on the surfaces. The hoes and axes used for farming were heavily worn out compared to the ceremonial tools.\n\n**Faunal Remains**\n\nThere was minimal evidence present at the site to indicate the domestication of animals. Among the minimal evidence found at the site were a fragmented ox mandible with maxilla and horns. The rest of the faunal materials belonged to wild animals, ranging from small mammals like rats to big mammals like elephants, with the latter being hunted for ivory and meat.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Ingombe_Ilede\" following this outline:\n\n\nExcavation\nThe site was uncovered in 1960 by Northern Rhodesia government workers and excavated by the archaeologist J.H Chaplin, an inspector for the Northern Rhodesia Commission for Preservation of National and Historical Monuments and Relics [1] Chaplin carried out an investigation of the pit, located on the western side of the site The pit contained archaeological items such as copper bangles, copper crosses, copper currency rods and a gold beaded necklace [1] This area was later named burial 1 The second discovery at the site consisted of burial 2 and 3 on the south end of the site, excavated by J.H Chaplin and  B W Anderson around the tank area The burial contained iron tools that lay at the feet of the human remains [1] The government extended the tank area a bit further, and the extension yielded two more human remains Further excavations were in 1962 when the Water Department decided to include another water tank on the western side of the original tank to maximize the water supply in the area around Ing'ombe Ilede [1] This extension led to the discovery of 30 human remains which included 22 infants [1] These graves contained very few goods The pottery found in association with the graves was linked to the earlier graves found at Ing'ombe Ilede.\n\n\nBurials\nThere were 48 + burial graves that were uncovered at Ing'ombe Ilede between the periods 1960-1962 by Chaplin and Mrs Anderson These graves contained various grave goods The goods ranged from ornamented objects such as glass beads, copper bangles to ceremonial goods such as the gongs and hoes, which were symbols of chieftainship and utilitarian items such as tongs, wire drawing plates, hammerheads and copper razors [1] These burials were found in two locations at the site, the central tank area that contained 14 burials, while the 34 graves were located on the south edge of Ing'ombe Ilede [1]\n\n\nDating\nThe earliest attempts at dating Ing'ombe Ilede placed the occupation of the site from the 7th-11th centuries These dates came from charcoal samples obtained from a badly disturbed context excavated by Chaplin in 1960 [1] Phillipson and Fagan reported and revised these dates after their trial excavation in 1968 near the earlier excavated rich burials, which produced additional charcoal for radiocarbon dating [4] The newly obtained dates suggested a domestic occupation near the burials in the 14th-15th centuries, and Phillipson and Fagan argued that this might have been  a second, potentially shorter occupation of the site They concluded that their new dates did not preclude the possibility of an earlier occupation in the later first millennium CE, followed by abandonment and then reoccupation in the 14th century [4] However, recent examination of the site using cloth that was obtained from burials 3 and 8 has situated them from the mid-15 to mid-17 centuries, with the most likely dates being in the 16th century [5] When these results are considered together with material culture comparisons to other sites in the region, McIntosh and Fagan conclude that there is strong evidence that the occupations involving major social differentiation and long-distance trade at Ing'ombe Ilede are not earlier than the late 15th century, suggesting future research should focus on Ing'ombe Ilede's role in 16th century networks [6]\n\n\nSocial Stratification\nThe social status of the people of Ing'ombe llede was determined based on the contents of the burials [7] The burial sites with ornaments were probably for the affluent people, such as traders, yes whilst the graves without ornaments probably belonged to slaves or the less affluent [1] For example, some burials containing metal crafting tools such as those used for drawing  and hammering copper wire were connected to  metal craftsmen, who were considered of high social status.There was also evidence of hierarchy at Ing'ombe Ilede;

both were flanged and have been dated to the 14th century [5] On the other hand, the copper ingots from Hurungwe were dated to the 16th century [10] These copper ingots shared  a similar shape with those from the Copperbelt and Katanga area, which shows that trade in copper  among these inland sites continued from the 14th century up to the 16th century [10] Great Zimbabwe had a different form of the copper ingots - unflendged and they were dated to a much earlier date of the 13th century [10] Despite copper being the primary trade item in south-central trade, the people at Ing'ombe Ilede used copper to manufacture domestic ornaments, such as, the copper bracelets, found in most of the rich burials at the site The manufacture of  copper bracelets is evident in wire drawing tools and a bundle of fine wire for making copper bracelets discovered in some of the rich burials at Ing'ombe Ilede [1]\n\n\nTextiles\nThe cloth at Ing'ombe Ilede consists of two types: the locally made, coarse cloth, and the finely woven imported cloth, thought to be of Indian  origin The coarse material contained some patterns  neatly woven into the fabric [1] Spindle whorls made from broken pieces of pottery and perforated  with a sharp metal object were discovered at the site to support the local production of the coarse cloth [1]\n\n\nCeramics\nCeramics have been a good source of chronology for most of archaeological sites excavated in Africa and the world over Traits such decorative motifs and vessels shapes have been used to situate ceramics to specific time periods The shape of the ceramics has also been used to indicate the function of the vessels Ingombe Ilede contained a large number of  ceramics sherds that were reconstructed into complete vessels of various sizes and shapes These vessels were probably used for domestic purposes or as trade items There was no evidence of the method used to manufacture pottery at the site [1] However, archaeologists found tools suggesting pottery production such as pebble tools used for burnishing the surfaces of the vessels before firing them [1] Also present at the site were mussels used for smoothing the walls of the pottery during the shaping stage [1] The clay for the pottery was probably obtained from the Lusitu River [1] The potters perhaps burnt the pottery in an open area owing to uneven coloring found on the surfaces of pottery The pottery at Ing'ombe Ilede played an essential role in situating the chronology of burials at the site The chronology of the pottery was done using decorative motifs and the shape of the vessels These attributed acted as time markers that helped researchers to situate Ing'ombe Ilede Chronologically For example, the ceramics from earliest levels at Ing'ombe  were linked to Kangila and Sebanzi cultures [4]\n\n\nFarming\nThere were several lines of evidence that were discovered at Ingombe Ilede to suggest farming One of the lines of evidence were domesticated charred sorghum and millet  that were found at the site  [1] Also found at the site was indirect evidence, such as a leaf impression of sorghum on a pot sherd from burial 3.Besides, some  graves contained iron hoes and axes that pointed to farming [1] These were differentiated  into functional tool and ceremonial tools based on the amount of wear on the surfaces [1] The hoes and axes used for farming were heavily worn out compared to the ceremonial tools.\n\n\nFaunal Remains\nThere was minimal evidence present at the site to indicate the domestication of animals Among the minimal evidence found at the site were a fragmented ox mandible with maxilla and horns [1] The rest of the faunal materials belonged to wild animals, ranging from small mammals  like rats to big mammals like elephants, with the latter being hunted for ivory and meat [1]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Night Shyamalan. The film stars Gael García Bernal, Vicky Krieps, Rufus Sewell, Alex Wolff, and Thomasin McKenzie.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe story follows Guy and Prisca Cappa, a couple who are going through a separation, as they take their young children, Maddox and Trent, on a final family vacation to a tropical resort. The couple's argument is revealed when Maddox and Trent overhear their parents arguing and play a message decoding game with Idlib, the resort manager's nephew. During the argument, it is revealed that Prisca has a benign slow-growing ovarian tumor.\n\nAs the family spends more time at the resort, they begin to experience strange and unexplained events. The children start to notice that the adults are aging at an alarming rate, and the family is forced to confront the reality of their own mortality. As the days pass, the family's relationships with each other and with the outside world begin to deteriorate, leading to a desperate and terrifying climax.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented cast, including:\n\n* Gael García Bernal as Guy Cappa\n* Vicky Krieps as Prisca Cappa\n* Rufus Sewell as Charles\n* Alex Wolff as Trent\n* Thomasin McKenzie as Maddox\n* Ken Leung as Dr. Brooks\n* Nikki Amuka-Bird as Kara\n* Abbey Lee as Diana\n\n**Themes**\n\nWhen asked about the different themes tackled in Old, Shyamalan responded, \"It's definitely about our relationship to time and, in my opinion, our dysfunctional relationship to time that we all have. Until we're forced to examine it, whether it's a pandemic or the factors that are in this situation for these characters, they're trapped on this beach, and they have to reflect on their relationship over time. You see some characters unable to navigate this, and then some characters find peace. Why did they find peace, and how did they find peace in the midst of all of this chaos?\"\n\nShyamalan's statement highlights the film's central theme of the human relationship with time. The story explores the idea that time is a limited resource, and how people's perceptions and experiences of time can be shaped by their individual perspectives and emotions.\n\n**Production**\n\nIn September 2019, Universal Pictures announced its plans to distribute two then-untitled independently financed thriller films written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. The projects contained \"highly original stories,\" according to Universal Pictures President Peter Cramer, who added, \"There are wonderful studios out there, but Universal has made it a mandate to release original films. They are the best at finding an audience for new stories with unexpected tones.\"\n\nShyamalan's statement highlights the importance of original storytelling in the film industry. He believes that original films are crucial to the longevity of the theatrical experience, and that Universal Pictures is one of the best studios at finding an audience for these types of films.\n\n**Development and Casting**\n\nThe development of Old began in 2017, when Shyamalan received a collective Father's Day gift from his three daughters, who gave him a French graphic novel called Sandcastle. The novel was written by Swiss authors Pierre Oscar Levy and Frederik Peeters, and it tells the story of a family who discovers a mysterious island where time has no meaning.\n\nShyamalan was inspired by the novel and began to develop his own story, which would eventually become Old. He spent several years working on the script, refining his ideas and shaping the characters and plot.\n\nThe casting process for Old was a long and deliberate one. Shyamalan worked closely with his cast to ensure that each actor brought their unique perspective and energy to the film. The cast includes some of the most talented actors in the industry, including Gael García Bernal, Vicky Krieps, and Rufus Sewell.\n\n**Filming and Post-Production**\n\nPrincipal photography for Old began on September 26, 2020, in the Dominican Republic. The film was shot on 35mm film, a rare and expensive format that Shyamalan chose to use to achieve a unique and nostalgic look.\n\nThe production team faced several challenges during filming, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which required them to implement strict safety protocols and protocols to minimize the risk of infection.\n\nAfter filming concluded, the post-production process began, which included editing, sound design, and visual effects. The team worked tirelessly to bring the film to life, using innovative techniques and technologies to create a visually stunning and immersive experience.\n\n**Release**\n\nOld was originally scheduled for release on February 26, 2021, but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, Universal Pictures announced that the film would be released on July 23, 2021.\n\nThe film's premiere was held at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York City on July 19, 2021, which was attended by the cast and crew. The film was released in theaters and on streaming platforms, where it received widespread critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\n**Reception**\n\nOld received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its unique story and themes, while others found it to be confusing and overly complex. The film holds a 50% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 5.50/10.\n\nThe film's cast, including Gael García Bernal and Vicky Krieps, received widespread critical acclaim for their performances. The film's cinematography and production design were also praised for their unique and visually stunning qualities.\n\n**Box Office**\n\nOld grossed $48.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $41.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $90.2 million. The film was a commercial success, despite receiving mixed reviews from critics.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nOld has received several awards and nominations, including a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The film has also been recognized for its innovative cinematography and production design, which were praised by critics and audiences alike.\n\nOverall, Old is a thought-provoking and visually stunning film that explores the complex and often dysfunctional relationship between humans and time.

away from \"the new world that we were trying to create\" The decision to name the show Friday the 13th over the original title was made because Mancuso Jr believed a \"Friday the 13th\" moniker would

on his Twitter page that a sequel to the 2009 remake was no longer in the works, declaring it, \"dead — not happening\" [96] In a later interview, Fuller explained that the 2009 reboot was the result of a joint effort between Paramount and New Line Cinema, as both owned portions of the Friday the 13th franchise With financial problems, both studios were limiting the films they produced each year, opting to produce films carrying lower risks and higher rewards Accordingly, the companies put Friday the 13th Part 2 on hold in hopes that they would move forward with this next installment when the economy bounced back Form explained that neither studio would walk away from the sequel's production to allow the other to move forward as the primary producing house, each studio concerned that its players would look like \"idiots\" should the sequel perform well without its involvement Form and Fuller also mentioned that the Friday the 13th sequel may be a 3‑D film, should it ever again be green-lit for production by the studios [97]\n\n\nParamount: 2013–2017\nShannon and Swift completed the script for the sequel in February 2011, according to Fuller's claim on Twitter He was ready to begin production, but that New Line Cinema was not [98] In June 2013, Warner Bros relinquished its film rights to the Friday the 13th series to Paramount as part of a deal that would allow Warner Bros to co-produce Interstellar [99] One week later, Derek Mears revealed that Paramount was working with Platinum Dunes to make a new installment \"as fast as possible\" [100] David Bruckner was set to direct the next installment of Friday the 13th [101] Bruckner's original script was co-written with Ian Goldberg and Richard Naing and was a found footage film, as mandated by the studio [102] After altering the release date numerous times, Paramount set the film for a May 13, 2016 release date [103] TV writer Nick Antosca was announced to write the script in March 2015 [104] Later in October, Paramount pushed back the film's release date to January 13, 2017 [105] Two months later, Aaron Guzikowski was negotiating a deal to write a new script, but Bruckner, who had purportedly left the project in 2015, was no longer involved as a director [106] At the end of May 2016, Fuller revealed that the reboot would be an origin story for Jason, and his mother would be in the film [107] On August 8, Breck Eisner was in talks to direct the reboot [108] In September, Paramount pushed back the reboot's release date from January 13 to October 13, 2017 [109]\n\n\nLawsuit and other projects: 2018–2022\nVictor Miller, who wrote the original Friday the 13th screenplay, asserted that Horror Inc derived its current copyright to the screenplay from Miller's transfer of copyright to Horror Inc.'s predecessor-in-interest, the Manny Company Miller sent a Notice of Termination to Horror Inc on January 26, 2016, purportedly reclaiming his rights to the screenplay and the content contained therein through termination of the transfer of rights he had formerly made to the Manny Company [116]\n\n\nFuture\nOn October 31, 2022, a Friday the 13th prequel series was announced, titled Crystal

Series, a television series that focuses on two cousins' attempts to recover cursed antiques that were sold from a shop they inherited from their uncle The show starred John D LeMay as Ryan Dallion and Louise Robey as Michelle Foster It was created by Frank Mancuso Jr and Larry B Williams originally under the title of The 13th Hour, and the series ran for 72 episodes Mancuso Jr never intended to link the television show directly to the film series, but he utilized \"the idea of Friday the 13th, which is that it symbolizes bad luck and curses\" The creators wanted to tie‑in Jason's trademark hockey mask to the series, but the idea was discarded so that the show could have a chance to exist on its own Mancuso Jr was afraid that mentioning any events from the films would take the audience away from \"the new world that we were trying to create\" The decision to name the show Friday the 13th over the original title was made because Mancuso Jr believed a \"Friday the 13th\" moniker would better help to sell the show to networks Filming took place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada [203] Friday the 13th: The Series initially aired in first-run syndication in a late-night spot; the success of the series as a late-night show prompted some broadcasting stations to move it to primetime Produced on a budget estimated below $500,000 per episode, the first season placed second in the male 18- to

{"title": "Jon_Gruden", "content": "\nEarly life\nGruden was born on August 17, 1963, in Sandusky, Ohio into a family of Slovene descent [4] His father, Jim, later served as a professional football regional scout, quarterbacks coach, and director of player personnel for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers [5] Gruden's younger brother, Jay, played and coached in the Arena Football League for the Tampa Bay Storm and Orlando Predators, and was most recently the head coach of the Washington Redskins His other brother, James, is a radiologist at UNC School of Medicine [6]\n\n\nCoaching career\nAfter graduating from the University of Dayton, Gruden was hired as a graduate assistant coach at the University of Tennessee during the 1985–86 season [10] After his time with the Volunteers, Gruden spent two years as the quarterbacks coach at Southeast Missouri State He then moved to the University of the Pacific in 1989 as offensive assistant as the tight ends coach Walt Harris was the offensive coordinator at Tennessee, where Gruden was one of his graduate assistant coaches, and later hired him at Pacific In 1990, Gruden was a special assistant with the San Francisco 49ers under quarterbacks coach Mike Holmgren [11] [12] In March 1991, Gruden became the wide receivers coach for the University of Pittsburgh under head coach Paul Hackett [13]\n\n\nCollege coaching\nAfter graduating from the University of Dayton, Gruden was hired as a graduate assistant coach at the University of Tennessee during the 1985–86 season [10] After his time with the Volunteers, Gruden spent two years as the quarterbacks coach at Southeast Missouri State He then moved to the University of the Pacific in 1989 as offensive assistant as the tight ends coach Walt Harris was the offensive coordinator at Tennessee, where Gruden was one of his graduate assistant coaches, and later hired him at Pacific In 1990, Gruden was a special assistant with the San Francisco 49ers under quarterbacks coach Mike Holmgren [11] [12] In March 1991, Gruden became the wide receivers coach for the University of Pittsburgh under head coach Paul Hackett [13]\n\n\nProfessional coaching\nIn January 1992, at the age of 28, Gruden was hired by Mike Holmgren, his former boss at the San Francisco 49ers, to be the special offensive assistant/wide receivers coach with the Green Bay Packers [12] After three seasons in Green Bay, Gruden became the offensive coordinator of the Philadelphia Eagles under former Packers assistant coach Ray Rhodes [14] Gruden was chosen by the owner and general manager of the Oakland Raiders, Al Davis, to be the Raiders' new head coach for the 1998 season [15] [16]\n\n\nOakland Raiders\nUnder Gruden, the Raiders posted consecutive 8–8 seasons in 1998 and 1999, and leapt out of last place in the AFC West [17] [18] After uniting with journeyman quarterback Rich Gannon, Gruden led the Raiders to the top of the AFC West and they made the playoffs in 2000 and 2001 Oakland finished 12–4 in the 2000 season, the team's most successful season in a decade, and its first division title since 1990, ultimately reaching the AFC Championship, where they lost, 16–3, to the eventual Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens [19] [20] In 2001, the Raiders would return to the postseason with a 10–6 record, but in the AFC Divisional Round a negated fumble proved costly as they were defeated, 16–13, in overtime by the eventual Super Bowl champions New England Patriots [21] [22] While Gruden was with the Raiders, Gruden acquired his nickname \"Chucky\" from Raiders defensive lineman Grady Jackson, who thought that the coach looked like the fictional character \"Chucky\" in the 1988 slasher movie Child's Play [23] [24]\n\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\nAfter compiling a 40–28 win–loss record (including playoffs) in four seasons with the Raiders, Gruden replaced the fired Tony Dungy as head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2002, via a high-stakes trade that included Tampa Bay's 2002 and 2003 first-round draft picks, 2002 and 2004 second-round draft picks, and $8 million in cash [25] [26] According to one source, Davis detailed the trade as such: \"I never liked it when teams would interfere with coaches under contract...Tampa Bay came to me and they said they wanted Gruden...I felt that I put the price tag so high that they wouldn't agree to it And they did Gruden is no longer our coach.\" [27] Gruden signed a five-year contract with the Buccaneers worth $17.5 million [25]\n\n\nPost–Tampa Bay career\nIn May 2010, Gruden became a volunteer assistant offensive line coach at Carrollwood Day School in Tampa, Florida [65] Shortly after being fired from Tampa Bay, Gruden created the Fired Football Coaches Association (FFCA) [66] The organization (a \"football think-tank\") had its headquarters in a rented office in a Tampa strip mall [67] The FFCA was known to have a large amount of game and player film collected by Gruden as well as playbooks and Gruden was known to have game plans of his own that he kept updated over the years he was not actively coaching Many coaches such as Chip Kelly, Urban Meyer, Jim Haslett, Rick Venturi, Sean McVay, Greg Schiano and Monte Kiffin and many players came to the facility to watch film and talk with Gruden [68] Gruden closed the FFCA upon his returning to coaching in 2018 moving the game and player film along with the other information he held there to Oakland [69]\n\n\nOakland / Las Vegas Raiders (second stint)\nAfter nine years away from coaching in the NFL, the Raiders announced the return of Gruden as head coach on January 6, 2018 [70] He signed a 10-year, $100 million contract, one of the biggest contracts in the history of the league which also includes a no-trade clause, closing the loophole that saw the Raiders trade him to the Buccaneers in return for draft picks and cash [71] Gruden came back to coaching after six years of attempts by Raiders owner Mark Davis to lure him back to be the Raiders head coach [72] Gruden said that he came back due to his need to go compete: \"I got tired of sitting in a dark room, watching tape by myself.\" He added: \"I took rumba-dancing classes; that didn't last—I wasn't any good Bought a boat; I never used it Live on a golf course; I never play I'd go to the FFCA early, and next thing I know it's 10:30 at night I'm thinking, Shit I'm wasting my time I got to go compete.\" [73] Some of Gruden's first few moves included signing several veterans, drafting Kolton Miller in the first round of the 2018 draft and trading away Khalil Mack for 2019 and 2020 first-round draft picks, and later trading Amari Cooper for the Dallas Cowboys' first-round draft pick [74] [75] [76] The team would go 4–12 in his first year back with the team [77]\n\n\nEmail controversy and resignation\nIn October 2021, a league investigation into the Washington Football Team for workplace misconduct uncovered emails Gruden sent from 2011 to 2018 to then Washington general manager Bruce Allen where Gruden used racist, misogynistic, and homophobic slurs [87] The emails referred to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell as a \"faggot\", and a \"clueless anti football pussy\" Gruden also said Goodell should not have pressured the Rams to draft \"queers\", referring to Michael Sam, the first openly gay player drafted in NFL history Jeff Fisher, who was the coach of the Rams at the time, denied that he was pressured and stated he drafted Sam entirely based on his football skills [88] Gruden stated that players who protest the national anthem should be \"fired\", specifically referring to former 49ers safety Eric Reid Gruden used a racist stereotype to describe NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith, saying \"Dumboriss Smith has lips the size of michellin   [sic] tires\" [89] Gruden also criticized Barack Obama during his 2012 re-election campaign and called then–Vice President Joe Biden a \"nervous clueless pussy\" [90] Gruden also joked to Allen that he should tell Bryan Glazer, co-owner of the Buccaneers, to perform oral sex on Gruden, and mocked Caitlyn Jenner for receiving an ESPN award following her gender transition [90] Gruden, Allen and others were sent emails from unknown members of the Washington Football Team staff that contained photos of topless women, including two Washington Football Team cheerleaders Gruden resigned on October 11, 2021, after details of the emails were released by The New York Times [90] [91] Gruden announced his intentions to sue the NFL and Roger Goodell for exposing his scandals [92] A Nevada judge threw out a bid from the NFL to dismiss the case on May 25, 2022 [93]\n\n\nCoaching consultant role\nGruden was invited by New Orleans Saints head coach Dennis Allen to attend offseason meetings in May 2023 to help the offensive coaching staff adjust to new Saints quarterback Derek Carr, but did not join as a full-time member of the staff, himself [95] Gruden was spotted with the Saints training camp in August 2023 and was expected to continue his advisory role [96]\n\n\nMilano Seamen\nIn March 2024, it was announced that Gruden had joined the Milano Seamen of the European League of Football as an advisor [97]\n\n\nBroadcasting career\nIn May 2009, Gruden was hired by ESPN to serve as a color analyst on its Monday Night Football telecasts, replacing Tony Kornheiser [98] He also served as an analyst for ESPN's coverage of the NFL draft and postseason college football games, helping to call the 2010 Rose Bowl and 2010 BCS National Championship Game on ESPN Radio and the 2011 Outback Bowl and 2011 Orange Bowl on ESPN In the spring of 2012, Gruden became the focus of the series Jon Gruden's QB Camp, where he went over the NFL development process with prospective NFL draftees at quarterback, including Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III During the Monday Night Football broadcast, Gruden gave out a weekly award called the \"Gruden Grinder\" to the best player in the game that week [99]\n\n\nCoaching tree\nNFL head coaches under whom Gruden has served:\n\n\nHead coaching record\nGruden met his wife in 1985, while he was working as a graduate assistant and she was

In 2001, the Raiders would return to the postseason with a 10-6 record, but in the AFC Divisional Round a negated fumble proved costly as they were defeated, 16-13, in overtime by the eventual Super Bowl champions New England Patriots. While Gruden was with the Raiders, Gruden acquired his nickname \"Chucky\" from Raiders defensive lineman Grady Jackson, who thought that the coach looked like the fictional character \"Chucky\" in the 1988 slasher movie Child's Play.\n\n**Tampa Bay Buccaneers**\n\nAfter compiling a 40-28 win-loss record (including playoffs) in four seasons with the Raiders, Gruden replaced the fired Tony Dungy as head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2002, via a high-stakes trade that included Tampa Bay's 2002 and 2003 first-round draft picks, 2002 and 2004 second-round draft picks, and $8 million in cash. According to one source, Davis detailed the trade as such: \"I never liked it when teams would interfere with coaches under contract...Tampa Bay came to me and they said they wanted Gruden...I felt that I put the price tag so high that they wouldn't agree to it And they did Gruden is no longer our coach.\" Gruden signed a five-year contract with the Buccaneers worth $17.5 million.\n\n**Post–Tampa Bay Career**\n\nIn May 2010, Gruden became a volunteer assistant offensive line coach at Carrollwood Day School in Tampa, Florida. Shortly after being fired from Tampa Bay, Gruden created the Fired Football Coaches Association (FFCA). The organization (a \"football think-tank\") had its headquarters in a rented office in a Tampa strip mall. The FFCA was known to have a large amount of game and player film collected by Gruden as well as playbooks and Gruden was known to have game plans of his own that he kept updated over the years he was not actively coaching. Many coaches such as Chip Kelly, Urban Meyer, Jim Haslett, Rick Venturi, Sean McVay, Greg Schiano and Monte Kiffin and many players came to the facility to watch film and talk with Gruden. Gruden closed the FFCA upon his returning to coaching in 2018 moving the game and player film along with the other information he held there to Oakland.\n\n**Oakland / Las Vegas Raiders (second stint)**\n\nAfter nine years away from coaching in the NFL, the Raiders announced the return of Gruden as head coach on January 6, 2018. He signed a 10-year, $100 million contract, one of the biggest contracts in the history of the league which also includes a no-trade clause, closing the loophole that saw the Raiders trade him to the Buccaneers in return for draft picks and cash. Gruden came back to coaching after six years of attempts by Raiders owner Mark Davis to lure him back to be the Raiders head coach. Gruden said that he came back due to his need to go compete: \"I got tired of sitting in a dark room, watching tape by myself.\" He added: \"I took rumba-dancing classes; that didn't last—I wasn't any good Bought a boat; I never used it Live on a golf course; I never play I'd go to the FFCA early, and next thing I know it's 10:30 at night I'm thinking, Shit I'm wasting my time I got to go compete.\" Some of Gruden's first few moves included signing several veterans, drafting Kolton Miller in the first round of the 2018 draft and trading away Khalil Mack for 2019 and 2020 first-round draft picks, and later trading Amari Cooper for the Dallas Cowboys' first-round draft pick.\n\n**Email Controversy and Resignation**\n\nIn October 2021, a league investigation into the Washington Football Team for workplace misconduct uncovered emails Gruden sent from 2011 to 2018 to then Washington general manager Bruce Allen where Gruden used racist, misogynistic, and homophobic slurs. The emails referred to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell as a \"faggot\", and a \"clueless anti football pussy\" Gruden also said Goodell should not have pressured the Rams to draft \"queers\", referring to Michael Sam, the first openly gay player drafted in NFL history Jeff Fisher, who was the coach of the Rams at the time, denied that he was pressured and stated he drafted Sam entirely based on his football skills. Gruden stated that players who protest the national anthem should be \"fired\", specifically referring to former 49ers safety Eric Reid Gruden used a racist stereotype to describe NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith, saying \"Dumboriss Smith has lips the size of michellin tires\" Gruden also criticized Barack Obama during his 2012 re-election campaign and called then–Vice President Joe Biden a \"nervous clueless pussy\" Gruden also joked to Allen that he should tell Bryan Glazer, co-owner of the Buccaneers, to perform oral sex on Gruden, and mocked Caitlyn Jenner for receiving an ESPN award following her gender transition Gruden resigned on October 11, 2021, after details of the emails were released by The New York Times.\n\n**Coaching Consultant Role**\n\nGruden was invited by New Orleans Saints head coach Dennis Allen to attend offseason meetings in May 2023 to help the offensive coaching staff adjust to new Saints quarterback Derek Carr, but did not join as a full-time member of the staff, himself. Gruden was spotted with the Saints training camp in August 2023 and was expected to continue his advisory role.\n\n**Broadcasting Career**\n\nIn May 2009, Gruden was hired by ESPN to serve as a color analyst on its Monday Night Football telecasts, replacing Tony Kornheiser. He also served as an analyst for ESPN's coverage of the NFL draft and postseason college football games, helping to call the 2010 Rose Bowl and 2010 BCS National Championship Game on ESPN Radio and the 2011 Outback Bowl and 2011 Orange Bowl on ESPN. In the spring of 2012, Gruden became the focus of the series Jon Gruden's QB Camp, where he went over the NFL development process with prospective NFL draftees at quarterback, including Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III. During the Monday Night Football broadcast, Gruden gave out a weekly award called the \"Gruden Grinder\" to the best player in the game that week.\n\n**Coaching Tree**\n\nNFL head coaches under whom Gruden has served:\n\n* Mike Holmgren (Green Bay Packers)\n* Ray Rhodes (Philadelphia Eagles)\n* Al Davis (Oakland Raiders)\n* Tony Dungy (Tampa Bay Buccaneers)\n\n**Head Coaching Record**\n\nGruden's head coaching record in the NFL is 97-117, including postseason games.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nGruden met his wife in 1985, while he was working as a graduate assistant and she was a student at the University of Tennessee. They were married in 1991 and have three sons. One of Gruden's sons, Jon II (aka Deuce), is the assistant strength and conditioning coach for the Raiders and a competitive powerlifter who won gold at the 2017 IPF World Classic Powerlifting Championships in the junior 83kg weight class.\n\n**Explanatory Notes**\n\n* Gruden has been associated with several controversies throughout his career, including allegations of racism and sexism.\n* Gruden has been involved in various business ventures, including the creation of the Fired Football Coaches Association (FFCA).\n* Gruden has been a vocal critic of the NFL and has made several public

in 1813 in Guatemala; and in 1814 in San Salvador  [es] All were defeated by loyalist forces, but pro-independence sentiment spread among Central American leaders [18]\n\n\nHistory\nAt Central America's independence from Mexico, the Central American congress established the United Provinces of Central America [36] [38] The following day, the congress reorganized as the National Constituent Assembly and tasked itself with drafting a constitution for newly-independent Central America [1] [39] José Matías Delgado was Central America's provisional president until 10 July 1823, when the National Constituent Assembly appointed a triumvirate  [es] consisting of Arce, Juan Vicente Villacorta and Pedro Molina Mazariegos Since Arce was in the United States when the triumvirate was established, Antonio Rivera Cabezas was appointed as his substitute [40] The three rotated executive power on a monthly basis [41]\n\n\nNational Constituent Assembly\nAt Central America's independence from Mexico, the Central American congress established the United Provinces of Central America [36] [38] The following day, the congress reorganized as the National Constituent Assembly and tasked itself with drafting a constitution for newly-independent Central America [1] [39] José Matías Delgado was Central America's provisional president until 10 July 1823, when the National Constituent Assembly appointed a triumvirate  [es] consisting of Arce, Juan Vicente Villacorta and Pedro Molina Mazariegos Since Arce was in the United States when the triumvirate was established, Antonio Rivera Cabezas was appointed as his substitute [40] The three rotated executive power on a monthly basis [41]\n\n\nDrafting the constitution\nAt Central America's independence from Mexico, the Central American congress established the United Provinces of Central America [36] [38] The following day, the congress reorganized as the National Constituent Assembly and tasked itself with drafting a constitution for newly-independent Central America [1] [39] José Matías Delgado was Central America's provisional president until 10 July 1823, when the National Constituent Assembly appointed a triumvirate  [es] consisting of Arce, Juan Vicente Villacorta and Pedro Molina Mazariegos Since Arce was in the United States when the triumvirate was established, Antonio Rivera Cabezas was appointed as his substitute [40] The three rotated executive power on a monthly basis [41]\n\n\nGuatemalan mutiny\nOn 14 September 1823, Captain Rafael Ariza y Torres began an insurrection in Guatemala City (the capital city) because the Central American government was unable to pay its debts to the military [48] Although Ariza pledged his loyalty to the National Constituent Assembly, many assembly members fled the city and called on soldiers from Chiquimula, Quetzaltenango, and San Salvador to suppress the insurrection [49] Neither Ariza's rebels nor Colonel José Rivas and his 750 soldiers from San Salvador wanted a battle [50] Conservatives took advantage of the situation, and forced the triumvirate to resign on 6 October [51] They installed a second, less-liberal triumvirate  [es] consisting of Arce, José Cecilio del Valle, and Tomás O'Horan Since Arce and Valle were outside the country when the second triumvirate was formed, José Santiago Milla and Villacorta were substitutes [52] Valle and Arce did not sit on the triumvirate until February and March 1824, respectively [53]\n\n\nInternal conflict in Nicaragua\nLiberals and conservatives had been fighting for control of Nicaragua since Ordóñez launched his rebellion against the pro-Mexico Nicaraguan government in 1823 [33] The liberals had control of León (the liberal capital) and Granada, and the conservatives controlled Managua (the conservative capital), Rivas and Chinandega Clashes resulted in hundreds of deaths In October 1824, the second triumvirate sent Colonel Manuel Arzú to attempt to mediate peace between the liberals and conservatives The mediation failed, [56] and Arce led a federal invasion of Nicaragua on 22 January 1825 to end the civil conflict [57] His invading force got the liberals and conservatives to sign an armistice without engaging in combat Arce dissolved both rival governments, and their leaders were exiled from Nicaragua [58]\n\n\nPresidency of Manuel José Arce\nThe federal republic's first presidential election was held on 21 April 1825 [59] [60] Arce was the liberals' candidate, and Valle the conservatives' choice [61] During the election, 41 of the 82 electors voted for Valle; 34 voted for Arce, four voted for other candidates, [d] and three did not vote due to complications in receiving votes from their electoral districts No candidate received a majority; the constitution required a majority, and the Federal Congress was tasked with electing the president instead [63] [64] The congress voted 22–5 to elect Arce president [65] Valle was entitled to become vice president since he was the runner-up in the election, but refused to accept the position; so did liberal José Francisco Barrundia Ultimately, the conservative Mariano Beltranena became Arce's vice president [61] Arce and Beltranena took office on 29 April [59]\n\n\n1825 election\nThe federal republic's first presidential election was held on 21 April 1825 [59] [60] Arce was the liberals' candidate, and Valle the conservatives' choice [61] During the election, 41 of the 82 electors voted for Valle; 34 voted for Arce, four voted for other candidates, [d] and three did not vote due to complications in receiving votes from their electoral districts No candidate received a majority; the constitution required a majority, and the Federal Congress was tasked with electing the president instead [63] [64] The congress voted 22–5 to elect Arce president [65] Valle was entitled to become vice president since he was the runner-up in the election, but refused to accept the position; so did liberal José Francisco Barrundia Ultimately, the conservative Mariano Beltranena became Arce's vice president [61] Arce and Beltranena took office on 29 April [59]\n\n\nPath to civil war\nJuan Barrundia  [es], José Francisco Barrundia's brother, opposed the federal government and was one of Arce's foremost critics He moved Guatemala's capital back to Guatemala City from Antigua Guatemala in mid-1825 (reversing the 1823 move) and seized private property to establish state government offices, since the federal government still occupied the state's government buildings [69] [70] After Juan Barrundia threatened to raise an army to \"contain the despotism of a tyrant\" (referring to Arce), the Federal Congress agreed to vacate the building used by the federal treasury and give it to the Guatemalan state government [71]\n\n\nFirst civil war\nIn October 1826, Arce called for a special election to install a new Guatemalan government; [81] the conservatives won, and Mariano Aycinena became governor of Guatemala on 1 March 1827 [79] After the election, many liberals fled Guatemala for El Salvador in search of assistance from its liberals to regain power They spread rumors that Arce was controlled by the Guatemalan conservatives and that would establish a centralized government [82] Arce called for an extraordinary congress to convene in Cojutepeque on 10 October to reestablish constitutional order, since the Federal Congress consistently failed to reach a quorum after Juan Barrundia's arrest [83] The call for an extraordinary congress was unconstitutional, because it exceeded Arce's presidential duties [76] On 6 December, in response to Arce's call for an extraordinary congress, Mariano Prado (the liberal acting governor of El Salvador) called for delegates from all the states except Guatemala to convene their own extraordinary congress in Ahuachapán Ultimately, neither congress convened [82]\n\n\nPresidency of Francisco Morazán\nAfter capturing Guatemala City in April 1828, Beltranena was removed from the presidency; Morazán became the de facto president of Central America, but did not officially assume office [98] On 22 June 1829, Morazán appointed a new Federal Congress It elected José Francisco Barrundia, the Senate's senior member, as Central America's interim president three days later [99] [100] At Morazán's instruction, the Federal Congress declared all legislation passed after September 1826 null and void Many leading conservatives were imprisoned or exiled under threat of death after the civil war, and many also had their property confiscated [101] [102] Morazán also cracked down on the church He expelled many members of the clergy from the country for supporting the conservatives, confiscated Church properties, and forced the church to reduce the number of priests and nuns in the country [103]\n\n\nConsolidating power\nAfter capturing Guatemala City in April 1828, Beltranena was removed from the presidency; Morazán became the de facto president of Central America, but did not officially assume office [98] On 22 June 1829, Morazán appointed a new Federal Congress It elected José Francisco Barrundia, the Senate's senior member, as Central America's interim president three days later [99] [100] At Morazán's instruction, the Federal Congress declared all legislation passed after September 1826 null and void Many leading conservatives were imprisoned or exiled under threat of death after the civil war, and many also had their property confiscated [101] [102] Morazán also cracked down on the church He expelled many members of the clergy from the country for supporting the conservatives, confiscated Church properties, and forced the church to reduce the number of priests and nuns in the country [103]\n\n\n1831–1832 conservative invasion\nIn May 1829, Morazán sent a letter to the Mexican minister of external relations falsely claiming that Central American refugees fleeing to Mexico were actually enemy forces who sought to \"chain and submit their towns to the Spanish yoke\" (\"encadenar y someter sus pueblos al yugo español\") He asked the Mexican government to extradite the refugees back to Central America [108] Receiving no reply, José Francisco Barrundia sent a letter to Mexican President Vicente Guerrero in November 1829 with the same request; Guerrero did not respond either [109] After Central American Minister of Relations Manuel Julián Ibarra sent a third request to the Mexican government to extradite the refugees in December 1829, Mexico said that it could grant the Central American request [110]\n\n\nRebellions\nOn 1 April 1829, Costa Rica seceded from the Federal Republic of Central America \"without separating itself\" (\"sin separarse\") from the federal republic [128] The Costa Rican government justified its secession by saying that the federal government had ceased to exist [129] It rejoined the federal republic in February 1831 after recognizing Morazán as Central America's president and renouncing its declaration of secession [130] Morazán defeated July 1829 rebellions in Honduras and Nicaragua, [131] and a rebellion in Honduras in January 1830 [132]\n\n\n1830s constitutional reforms\nIn 1831, Salvadoran conservatives called for political reforms in the federal government Reforms included allowing the president to veto laws passed by the Federal Congress, abolishing the electoral college and implementing direct elections, and restricting eligibility to hold office to landowners [141] The arrest of these conservatives after Morazán's military victory in El Salvador in 1832 led political leaders across the federal republic to call for political reforms [142] Nicaragua declared independence on 3 December 1832, citing fears of federal authoritarianism after Morazán's invasion of El Salvador, and said that it would not rejoin the federal republic until the federal constitution was reformed [143] That month, Costa Rica proposed establishing a National Constituent Assembly to pass a constitutional reform; th assembly began on 20 April 1833 [144] On 13 February 1835, the Federal Congress approved constitutional reforms drafted by the National Constituent Assembly The reforms were minor, and only Nicaragua (which renounced its secession after the reforms were completed) and Costa Rica ratified them [130] [145]\n\n\nFederal capital move to San Salvador\nMorazán and the Federal Congress wanted to move the national capital from Guatemala City beginning in 1830, since they wanted the capital in a better defensive position and the federal government felt that the city's residents hated it due to the civil war [146] Morazán wanted to move the capital to San Salvador, but conservative Salvadoran political leaders resisted his proposal and seceded from the federal republic in January 1832 [147] The federal government moved the national capital from Guatemala City to the Salvadoran city of Sonsonate on 5 February 1834, [148] but Salvadoran politicians did not want it to move the capital to the city [149]\n\n\n1833 and 1835 presidential elections\nDuring the late 1833 presidential election, the electoral college chose Valle as Central America's next president Valle defeated Morazán because many voters and politicians opposed Morazán's use of military force to settle disputes between liberals and conservatives, and saw Valle as a moderate who could offer peace [158] Valle died of illness on 2 March 1834 while he was traveling to Guatemala to become president [159] [160] [161] As Morazán finished second in the election and retained the presidency; [162] on 2 June, the federal government called for a new presidential election the following year [163] On 2 February 1835, the electoral college re-elected Morazán as Central America's president and José Gregorio Salazar as Morazán's vice president; they were sworn in on 14 February [159]\n\n\nSecond civil war and dissolution\nOn 30 May 1838, the Federal Congress convened and declared that each of the federal republic's five states was free to establish any form of republican government Nicaragua seceded from the Federal Republic of Central America on 30 April 1838 Honduras did the same on 26 October, followed by Costa Rica on 15 November On 2 February 1839, all of Central America's federally-elected government officials (including Morazán) left office They had no successors, since no federal election was held [164] On 17 April, Guatemalan President Rafael Carrera issued a decree dissolving the Federal Republic of Central America; the Federal Congress accepted his decree on 14 July [165] On 30 January 1841, El Salvador declared independence from the Federal Republic of Central America [166] At the fall of the federal republic, four of its five successor states were led by opponents of federal rule and proponents of their respective states' secession: Braulio Carrillo (Costa Rica), Francisco Malespín (El Salvador), Carrera (Guatemala), and Francisco Ferrera (Honduras) [167]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nAccording to the federal constitution, the government of the Federal Republic of Central America was \"popular, representative, and federal\" [168] All elected officials were appointed with indirect elections; voters chose electors who would vote on their behalf, rather than voting directly for candidates seeking public office In presidential, vice-presidential and legislative elections, there were three rounds of voting; voters chose electors in the first round, electors voted for a further set of electors in the second round, and those electors voted for candidates seeking public office in the third round [169] Voting was compulsory [170]\n\n\nFederal government\nAccording to the federal constitution, the government of the Federal Republic of Central America was \"popular, representative, and federal\" [168] All elected officials were appointed with indirect elections; voters chose electors who would vote on their behalf, rather than voting directly for candidates seeking public office In presidential, vice-presidential and legislative elections, there were three rounds of voting; voters chose electors in the first round, electors voted for a further set of electors in the second round, and those electors voted for candidates seeking public office in the third round [169] Voting was compulsory [170]\n\n\nArmed forces\nThe Federal Republic of Central America found it difficult to maintain its federal army Before Central American independence, few Central Americans pursued a military career Guatemalan historian Manuel Montúfar y Coronado wrote that \"military influence was unknown in Central America; before Independence, there was no military career\" (\"el influjo militar fue desconocido en Centro América; antes de la Independencia, no había carrera militar\") [184] The Central American federal army originated as rebel groups who resisted annexation to Mexico in 1822 and 1823, and was not formally established as a political entity until 1829 [185]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe federal republic consisted of five states: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua [191] Each state was subdivided into 45 partidos (districts) [192] From 7 February 1835 to 3 May 1839, the Federal District was centered around San Salvador as the national capital [153] Briefly, from 1838 to 1839, the federal government considered separating Los Altos from Guatemala and elevating it to the status of a state [193] Although Guatemala claimed Belize as part of its territory, coastal Belize was occupied by the British [36] Guatemala and Mexico claimed sovereignty over Soconusco, but neither had full control of the region Portions of Soconusco were effectively independent, but its leaders preferred union with Central America [111] Central America bordered the Mosquito Coast on the Caribbean, [194] which it claimed as part of its territory [195] The Federal Republic of Central America covered approximately 200,000 square miles (520,000 km2) and spanned about 900 miles (1,400 km) north to south between the 8th and 18th parallel north [196]\n\n\nPolitical factions\nThe two major political factions of the Federal Republic of Central America were the liberals (also known as fiebres) and the conservatives [h] (also known as serviles) The factions were not organized political parties [199] [200] Liberals and conservatives saw each other as enemies, accusing each other of \"demagoguery, disorganization, and anarchism\" (\"demagogia, desorganización y anarquismo\") [201]\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe federal republic sent diplomats to Gran Colombia, France, the Holy See, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States, [206] and received diplomats from Chile, France, Gran Colombia, Hanover, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States [207] Mexico recognized Central American independence in August 1823 [2] On 15 March 1825, federal diplomats signed a treaty with Gran Colombia ensuring the existence of a \"perpetual confederation\" (\"confederación perpetua\") between the countries; the treaty was ratified on 12 September [177] Although France, the Holy See, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom sent diplomats to the Federal Republic of Central America, they recognized Central America's independence only after the federal government had collapsed in the late 1830s [208]\n\n\nNational symbols\nWhile resisting the Mexican attempt to annex Central America in 1822, Arce's forces waved a horizontal blue, white, and blue triband inspired by the flag of Argentina [211] The flag of the Federal Republic of Central America, adopted on 21 August 1823, [212] was based on Arce's 1822 design [211] The adopted flag retained the blue, white, and blue horizontal triband design, with the country's coat of arms in the center [212] The federal republic's coat of arms was an equilateral triangle; within the triangle were a rainbow at the top, a Phrygian cap with beams of light emanating from it in the center, and five rounded volcanoes surrounded by two oceans (the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans) at the bottom Surrounding the triangle was an oval with the name of the country within it [212] [213]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn 1824, Central America had a population of 1,287,491 [36] [198] By 1836, it had an estimated population of 1,900,000; [196] the estimate, by federal administrator Juan Galindo, \"largely over-estimated\" the number of whites and excluded Honduras' indigenous population [215] Central America was the most densely-populated country in the Americas [196] Its population was unevenly distributed across the states, with over half in Guatemala in 1824 The constitution granted political representation in the Federal Congress in proportion to population, so the population imbalance gave Guatemala greater representation in the legislature than the other states [216]\n\n\nPopulation\nIn 1824, Central America had a population of 1,287,491 [36] [198] By 1836, it had an estimated population of 1,900,000; [196] the estimate, by federal administrator Juan Galindo, \"largely over-estimated\" the number of whites and excluded Honduras' indigenous population [215] Central America was the most densely-populated country in the Americas [196] Its population was unevenly distributed across the states, with over half in Guatemala in 1824 The constitution granted political representation in the Federal Congress in proportion to population, so the population imbalance gave Guatemala greater representation in the legislature than the other states [216]\n\n\nEthnic composition\nCentral America was not ethnically homogenous [173] In 1824, 65 percent of the population was indigenous, 31 percent was mixed (Ladino or mestizo), and four percent was white (Spanish or criollo) [36] There was a small population of Blacks, and Galindo described the black population in 1836 as \"too inconsiderable to be taken into consideration\" [154] Ethnic composition varied throughout the Central American states In 1824, up to 70 percent of Guatemala's population was indigenous; El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua were almost entirely composed of mestizos, and Costa Rica self-reported that it was 80 percent white [217]\n\n\nReligion\nCatholicism was the largest and the official religion of the Federal Republic of Central America [219] Initially, Catholicism was the only religion that could be practiced publicly Public worship as part of any other religion was prohibited until May 1832, when the Federal Congress issued a decree permitting public practice of any religion (a right reinforced by an 1835 constitutional amendment) [220] The Catholic Church influenced Central American politics, [219] but the president and any Supreme Court justice were not allowed to be members of the clergy; only one of each state's two senators could be a clergyman Papal bulls issued by the pope to Central America had to be approved by the Federal Congress before they became effective [221]\n\n\nCities\nIn 1836, twenty-nine settlements were designated as cities in Central America [154]\n\n\nEconomy\nOn 19 March 1824, the National Constituent Assembly passed a law that prohibited the minting of coins with \"the bust, coat of arms, or whatever other emblems which are typical and distinctive of the Spanish monarchy\" (\"el busto, escudo de armas o cualesquiera otros emblemas que sean propios y distintivos de la monarquía española\") The law also ordered the creation of a new currency The obverse would depict the country's coat of arms, and the reverse would depict a tree with the phrase \"Grow Free and Fertile\" (\"Libre Crezca Fecundo\") [223] [224] [225]\n\n\nCurrency\nOn 19 March 1824, the National Constituent Assembly passed a law that prohibited the minting of coins with \"the bust, coat of arms, or whatever other emblems which are typical and distinctive of the Spanish monarchy\" (\"el busto, escudo de armas o cualesquiera otros emblemas que sean propios y distintivos de la monarquía española\") The law also ordered the creation of a new currency The obverse would depict the country's coat of arms, and the reverse would depict a tree with the phrase \"Grow Free and Fertile\" (\"Libre Crezca Fecundo\") [223] [224] [225]\n\n\nProblems\nUnfortunately, neither in the Republic nor the state  [Guatemala] has there been presented a truly creative plan for the treasury A routine spirit, pusillanimous and without coordination and system, has prevailed in establishing taxes, thus proving that we have inherited from Spain financial ineptitude.\n\n\nLegacy\nThe states of the Isthmus from Panama to Guatemala will perhaps form a confederation This magnificent location between the two great oceans could in time become the emporium of the world Its canals will shorten the distances throughout the world, strengthen commercial ties with Europe, America, and Asia, and bring that happy region tribute from the four quarters of the globe Perhaps some day the capital of the world may be located there, just as Constantine claimed Byzantium was the capital of the ancient world.\n\n\nHistorical assessment\nThe states of the Isthmus from Panama to Guatemala will perhaps form a confederation This magnificent location between the two great oceans could in time become the emporium of the world Its canals will shorten the distances throughout the world, strengthen commercial ties with Europe, America, and Asia, and bring that happy region tribute from the four quarters of the globe Perhaps some day the capital of the world may be located there, just as Constantine claimed Byzantium was the capital of the ancient world.\n\n\nReunification attempts\nAs early as 1842, some Central Americans sought to reunite the region Several attempts have been made at reunification by diplomacy or force during the 19th and 20th centuries, but none lasted longer than a few months or involved all five former members of the Federal Republic of Central America [255] [256] [257] According to Guatemalan historian Julio César Pinto Soria, Central America has failed to achieve reunification primarily due to the power of oligarchs in the federal republic's former states who see reunification as an impediment to their goals [167]\n\n\nSee also\n13°41′56″N 89°11′29″W﻿ / ﻿13.69889°N 89.19139°W﻿ / 13.69889;

It was formed after the independence of Central America from Spain in 1821, and was composed of five states: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Federal Republic of Central America was a unique and ambitious experiment in government and politics. It was the first attempt to create a unified state in Central America, and its legacy continues to shape the region's politics and identity today. Despite its short lifespan, the Federal Republic of Central America had a profound impact on the development of the region, and its history is still studied and debated by scholars and historians today.\n\n**Names**\n\nThe country's initial name, adopted at independence from the First Mexican Empire on 1 July 1823, was the United Provinces of Central America (Spanish: Provincias Unidas del Centro de América). Upon the adoption of the country's constitution on 22 November 1824, the United Provinces of Central America changed its name to the Federal Republic of Central America (República Federal de Centro América). In the years shortly after independence, some official government documents referred to the country as the Federated States of Central America (Estados Federados del Centro de América). The federal republic has also been referred to as the Federation of Central America (Federación de Centro América).\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Spanish conquered Central America in the 16th century. The region was divided into several audiencias (jurisdictions) until, in 1542, it was organized into a single audiencia extending north to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and south to the Isthmus of Panama. Spain transferred control of the Yucatán Peninsula to New Spain (modern-day Mexico) in 1560, and transferred control of Panama to Peru seven years later. In 1568, the Central American audiencia was reorganized as the Captaincy General of Guatemala. The captaincy was subdivided into corregimientos, gobiernos, greater mayorships, and intendancies.\n\n**Colonial Central America**\n\nThe Spanish conquest of Central America began in the early 16th century. In 1523, the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés arrived in Central America, and over the next several decades, the Spanish established a series of colonies and settlements throughout the region. The Spanish divided the region into several audiencias, which were governed by a Spanish governor and a council of advisors. The audiencias were responsible for collecting taxes, administering justice, and maintaining order in the region. Despite the efforts of the Spanish to establish a stable and orderly government in Central America, the region was plagued by conflicts and rebellions throughout the colonial period.\n\n**Central American independence**\n\nThe Spanish king Ferdinand VII was overthrown in 1808 by the French emperor Napoleon, who installed his brother Joseph as king of Spain. Spain's colonies in the Americas, including the Captaincy General of Guatemala, did not recognize Joseph as the legitimate king and established provisional governments, known as juntas, which continued to recognize Ferdinand as king. Although the Central American colonial government remained loyal to Ferdinand, some criollo leaders in Central America wanted greater autonomy. In November 1811, José Matías Delgado and Manuel José Arce launched a rebellion in San Salvador against Spanish rule, which was defeated by loyalist forces.\n\n**History**\n\nAt Central America's independence from Mexico, the Central American congress established the United Provinces of Central America. The following day, the congress reorganized as the National Constituent Assembly and tasked itself with drafting a constitution for newly-independent Central America. José Matías Delgado was Central America's provisional president until 10 July 1823, when the National Constituent Assembly appointed a triumvirate consisting of Arce, Juan Vicente Villacorta, and Pedro Molina Mazariegos. The three rotated executive power on a monthly basis.\n\n**Drafting the constitution**\n\nAt Central America's independence from Mexico, the Central American congress established the United Provinces of Central America.

José Matías Delgado was Central America's provisional president until 10 July 1823, when the National Constituent Assembly appointed a triumvirate consisting of Arce, Juan Vicente Villacorta, and Pedro Molina Mazariegos. The three rotated executive power on a monthly basis.\n\n**Guatemalan mutiny**\n\nOn 14 September 1823, Captain Rafael Ariza y Torres began an insurrection in Guatemala City because the Central American government was unable to pay its debts to the military. Although Ariza pledged his loyalty to the National Constituent Assembly, many assembly members fled the city and called on soldiers from Chiquimula, Quetzaltenango, and San Salvador to suppress the insurrection. Neither Ariza's rebels nor Colonel José Rivas and his 750 soldiers from San Salvador wanted a battle. Conservatives took advantage of the situation, and forced the triumvirate to resign on 6 October. They installed a second, less-liberal triumvirate consisting of Arce, José Cecilio del Valle, and Tomás O'Horan.\n\n**Internal conflict in Nicaragua**\n\nLiberals and conservatives had been fighting for control of Nicaragua since Ordóñez launched his rebellion against the pro-Mexico Nicaraguan government in 1823. The liberals had control of León, the liberal capital, and Granada, and the conservatives controlled Managua, Rivas, and Chinandega. Clashes resulted in hundreds of deaths. In October 1824, the second triumvirate sent Colonel Manuel Arzú to attempt to mediate peace between the liberals and conservatives. The mediation failed, and Arce led a federal invasion of Nicaragua on 22 January 1825 to end the civil conflict.\n\n**Presidency of Manuel José Arce**\n\nThe federal republic's first presidential election was held on 21 April 1825. Arce was the liberals' candidate, and Valle the conservatives' choice. During the election, 41 of the 82 electors voted for Valle; 34 voted for Arce, four voted for other candidates, and three did not vote due to complications in receiving votes from their electoral districts. No candidate received a majority; the constitution required a majority, and the Federal Congress was tasked with electing the president instead. The Congress voted 22-5 to elect Arce president. Valle was entitled to become vice president since he was the runner-up in the election, but refused to accept the position; so did liberal José Francisco Barrundia. Ultimately, the conservative Mariano Beltranena became Arce's vice president.\n\n**1825 election**\n\nThe federal republic's first presidential election was held on 21 April 1825. Arce was the liberals' candidate, and Valle the conservatives' choice. During the election, 41 of the 82 electors voted for Valle; 34 voted for Arce, four voted for other candidates, and three did not vote due to complications in receiving votes from their electoral districts. No candidate received a majority; the constitution required a majority, and the Federal Congress was tasked with electing the president instead. The Congress voted 22-5 to elect Arce president. Valle was entitled to become vice president since he was the runner-up in the election, but refused to accept the position; so did liberal José Francisco Barrundia. Ultimately, the conservative Mariano Beltranena became Arce's vice president.\n\n**Path to civil war**\n\nJuan Barrundia, José Francisco Barrundia's brother, opposed the federal government and was one of Arce's foremost critics. He moved Guatemala's capital back to Guatemala City from Antigua Guatemala in mid-1825, and seized private property to establish state government offices, since the federal government still occupied the state's government buildings. After Juan Barrundia threatened to raise an army to \"contain the despotism of a tyrant\" (referring to Arce), the Federal Congress agreed to vacate the building used by the federal treasury and give it to the Guatemalan state government.\n\n**First civil war**\n\nIn October 1826, Arce called for a special election to install a new Guatemalan government. The conservatives won, and Mariano Aycinena became governor of Guatemala on 1 March 1827. After the election, many liberals fled Guatemala for El Salvador in search of assistance from its liberals to regain power. They spread rumors that Arce was controlled by the Guatemalan conservatives and that would establish a centralized government. Arce called for an extraordinary congress to convene in Cojutepeque on 10 October to reestablish constitutional order, since the Federal Congress consistently failed to reach a quorum after Juan Barrundia's arrest.\n\n**Presidency of Francisco Morazán**\n\nAfter capturing Guatemala City in April 1828, Beltranena was removed from the presidency; Morazán became the de facto president of Central America, but did not officially assume office. On 22 June 1829, Morazán appointed a new Federal Congress. It elected José Francisco Barrundia, the Senate's senior member, as Central America's interim president three days later. At Morazán's instruction, the Federal Congress declared all legislation passed after September 1826 null and void. Many leading conservatives were imprisoned or exiled under threat of death after the civil war, and many also had their property confiscated.\n\n**1831–1832 conservative invasion**\n\nIn May 1829, Morazán sent a letter to the Mexican minister of external relations falsely claiming that Central American refugees fleeing to Mexico were actually enemy forces who sought to \"chain and submit their towns to the Spanish yoke\" (\"encadenar y someter sus pueblos al yugo español\"). He asked the Mexican government to extradite the refugees back to Central America. Receiving no reply, José Francisco Barrundia sent a letter to Mexican President Vicente Guerrero in November 1829 with the same request; Guerrero did not respond either. After Central American Minister of Relations Manuel Julián Ibarra sent a third request to the Mexican government to extradite the refugees in December 1829, Mexico said that it could grant the Central American request.\n\n**Rebellions**\n\nOn 1 April 1829, Costa Rica seceded from the Federal Republic of Central America \"without separating itself\" (\"sin separarse\") from the federal republic. The Costa Rican government justified its secession by saying that the federal government had ceased to exist. It rejoined the federal republic in February 1831 after recognizing Morazán as Central America's president and renouncing its declaration of secession. Morazán defeated July 1829 rebellions in Honduras and Nicaragua, and a rebellion in Honduras in January 1830.\n\n**1830s constitutional reforms**\n\nIn 1831, Salvadoran conservatives called for political reforms in the federal government. Reforms included allowing the president to veto laws passed by the Federal Congress, abolishing the electoral college and implementing direct elections, and restricting eligibility to hold office to landowners. The arrest of these conservatives after Morazán's military victory in El Salvador in 1832 led political leaders across the federal republic to call for political reforms. Nicaragua declared independence on 3 December 1832, citing fears of federal authoritarianism after Morazán's invasion of El Salvador, and said that it would not rejoin the federal republic until the federal constitution was reformed. That month, Costa Rica proposed establishing a National Constituent Assembly to pass a constitutional reform; the assembly began on 20 April 1833. On 13 February 1835, the Federal Congress approved constitutional reforms drafted by the National Constituent Assembly. The reforms were minor, and only Nicaragua (which renounced its secession after the reforms were completed) and Costa Rica ratified them.\n\n**Federal capital move to San Salvador**\n\nMorazán and the Federal Congress wanted to move the national capital from Guatemala City beginning in 1830, since they wanted the capital in a better defensive position and the federal government felt that the city's residents hated it due to the civil war. Morazán wanted to move the capital to San Salvador, but conservative Salvadoran political leaders resisted his proposal and seceded from the federal republic in January 1832. The federal government moved the national capital from Guatemala City to the Salvadoran city of Sonsonate on 5 February 1834, but Salvadoran politicians did not want it to move the capital to the city.\n\n**1833 and 1835 presidential elections**\n\nDuring the late 1833 presidential election, the electoral college chose Valle as Central America's next president. Valle defeated Morazán because many voters and politicians opposed Morazán's use of military force to settle disputes between liberals and conservatives, and saw Valle as a moderate who could offer peace. Valle died of illness on 2 March 1834 while he was traveling to Guatemala to become president. As Morazán finished second in the election and retained the presidency, on 2 June, the federal government called for a new presidential election the following year. On 2 February 1835, the electoral college re-elected Morazán as Central America's president and José Gregorio Salazar as Morazán's vice president; they were sworn in on 14 February.\n\n**Second civil war and dissolution**\n\nOn 30 May 1838, the Federal Congress convened and declared that each of the federal republic's five states was free to establish any form of republican government. Nicaragua seceded from the Federal Republic of Central America on 30 April 1838, followed by Honduras on 26 October, followed by Costa Rica on 15 November. On 2 February 1839, all of Central America's federally-elected government officials left office. They had no successors, since no federal election was held. On 17 April, Guatemalan President Rafael Carrera issued a decree dissolving the Federal Republic of Central America; the Federal Congress accepted his decree on 14 July. On 30 January 1841, El Salvador declared independence from the Federal Republic of Central America.\n\n**Government and politics**\n\nAccording to the federal constitution, the government of the Federal Republic of Central America was \"popular, representative, and federal.\" All elected officials were appointed with indirect elections; voters chose electors who would vote on their behalf, rather than voting directly for candidates seeking public office. In presidential, vice-presidential, and legislative elections, there were three rounds of voting; voters chose electors in the first round, electors voted for a further set of electors in the second round, and those electors voted for candidates seeking public office in the third round. Voting was compulsory.\n\n**Federal government**\n\nAccording to the federal constitution, the government of the Federal Republic of Central America was \"popular, representative, and federal.\" All elected officials were appointed with indirect elections; voters chose electors who would vote on their behalf, rather than voting directly for candidates seeking public office. In presidential, vice-presidential, and legislative elections, there were three rounds of voting; voters chose electors in the first round, electors voted for a further set of electors in the second round, and those electors voted for candidates seeking public office in the third round. Voting was compulsory.\n\n**Armed forces**\n\nThe Federal Republic of Central America found it difficult to maintain its federal army. Before Central American independence, few Central Americans pursued a military career. Guatemalan historian Manuel Montúfar y Coronado wrote that \"military influence was unknown in Central America; before Independence, there was no military career.\" The Central American federal army originated as rebel groups who resisted annexation to Mexico in 1822 and 1823, and was not formally established as a political entity until 1829.\n\n**Administrative divisions**\n\nThe federal republic consisted of five states: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Each state was subdivided into 45 partidos (districts). From 7 February 1835 to 3 May 1839, the Federal District was centered around San Salvador as the national capital. Briefly, from 1838 to 1839, the federal government considered separating Los Altos from Guatemala and elevating it to the status of a state. Although Guatemala claimed Belize as part of its territory, coastal Belize was occupied by the British. Guatemala and Mexico claimed sovereignty over Soconusco, but neither had full control of the region. Portions of Soconusco were effectively independent, but its leaders preferred union with Central America.\n\n**Political factions**\n\nThe two major political factions of the Federal Republic of Central America were the liberals (also known as fiebres) and the conservatives (also known as serviles). The factions were not organized political parties. Liberals and conservatives saw each other as enemies, accusing each other of \"demagoguery, disorganization, and anarchism.\"\n\n**Foreign relations**\n\nThe federal republic sent diplomats to Gran Colombia, France, the Holy See, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and received diplomats from Chile, France, Gran Colombia, Hanover, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Mexico recognized Central American independence in August 1823. On 15 March 1825, federal diplomats signed a treaty with Gran Colombia ensuring the existence of a \"perpetual confederation\" between the countries; the treaty was ratified on 12 September. Although France, the Holy See, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom sent diplomats to the Federal Republic of Central America, they recognized Central America's independence only after the federal government had collapsed in the late 1830s.\n\n**National symbols**\n\nWhile resisting the Mexican attempt to annex Central America in 1822, Arce's forces waved a horizontal blue, white, and blue triband inspired by the flag of Argentina. The flag of the Federal Republic of Central America, adopted on 21 August 1823, was based on Arce's 1822 design. The adopted flag retained the blue, white, and blue horizontal triband design, with the country's coat of arms in the center. The federal republic's coat of arms was an equilateral triangle; within the triangle were a rainbow at the top, a Phrygian cap with beams of light emanating from it in the center, and five rounded volcanoes surrounded by two oceans (the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans) at the bottom. Surrounding the triangle was an oval with the name of the country within it.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nIn 1824, Central America had a population of 1,287,491. By 1836, it had an estimated population of 1,900,000; the estimate, by federal administrator Juan Galindo, \"largely over-estimated\" the number of whites and excluded Honduras' indigenous population. Central America was the most densely-populated country in the Americas. Its population was unevenly distributed across the states, with over half in Guatemala in 1824. The constitution granted political representation in the Federal Congress in proportion to population, so the population imbalance gave Guatemala greater representation in the legislature than the other states.\n\n**Population**\n\nIn 1824, Central America had a population of 1,287,491.

they were sworn in on 14 February [159]\n\n\nSecond civil war and dissolution\nOn 30 May 1838, the Federal Congress convened and declared that each of the federal republic's five states was free to establish any form of republican government Nicaragua seceded from the Federal Republic of Central America on 30 April 1838 Honduras did the same on 26 October, followed by Costa Rica on 15 November On 2 February 1839, all of Central America's federally-elected government officials (including Morazán) left office They had no successors, since no federal election was held [164] On 17 April, Guatemalan President Rafael Carrera issued a decree dissolving the Federal Republic of Central America; the Federal Congress accepted his decree on 14 July [165] On 30 January 1841, El Salvador declared independence from the Federal Republic of Central America [166] At the fall of the federal republic, four of its five successor states were led by opponents of federal rule and proponents of their respective states' secession: Braulio Carrillo (Costa Rica), Francisco Malespín (El Salvador), Carrera (Guatemala), and Francisco Ferrera (Honduras) [167]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nAccording to the federal constitution, the government of the Federal Republic of Central America was \"popular, representative, and federal\" [168] All elected officials were appointed with indirect elections; voters chose electors who would vote on their behalf, rather than voting directly for candidates seeking public office In presidential, vice-presidential and legislative elections, there were three rounds of voting; voters chose electors in the first round, electors voted for a further set of electors in the second round, and those electors voted for candidates seeking public office in the third round [169] Voting was compulsory [170]\n\n\nFederal government\nAccording to the federal constitution, the government of the Federal Republic of Central America was \"popular, representative, and federal\" [168] All elected officials were appointed with indirect elections; voters chose electors who would vote on their behalf, rather than voting directly for candidates seeking public office In presidential, vice-presidential and legislative elections, there were three rounds of voting; voters chose electors in the first round, electors voted for a further set of electors in the second round, and those electors voted for candidates seeking public office in the third round [169] Voting was compulsory [170]\n\n\nArmed forces\nThe Federal Republic of Central America found it difficult to maintain its federal army Before Central American independence, few Central Americans pursued a military career Guatemalan historian Manuel Montúfar y Coronado wrote that \"military influence was unknown in Central America; before Independence, there was no military career\" (\"el influjo militar fue desconocido en Centro América; antes de la Independencia, no había carrera militar\") [184] The Central American federal army originated as rebel groups who resisted annexation to Mexico in 1822 and 1823, and was not formally established as a political entity until 1829 [185]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nThe federal republic consisted of five states: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua [191] Each state was subdivided into 45 partidos (districts) [192] From 7 February 1835 to 3 May 1839, the Federal District was centered around San Salvador as the national capital [153] Briefly, from 1838 to 1839, the federal government considered separating Los Altos from Guatemala and elevating it to the status of a state [193] Although Guatemala claimed Belize as part of its territory, coastal Belize was occupied by the British [36] Guatemala and Mexico claimed sovereignty over Soconusco, but neither had full control of the region Portions of Soconusco were effectively independent, but its leaders preferred union with Central America [111] Central America bordered the Mosquito Coast on the Caribbean, [194] which it claimed as part of its territory [195] The Federal Republic of Central America covered approximately 200,000 square miles (520,000 km2) and spanned about 900 miles (1,400 km) north to south between the 8th and 18th parallel north [196]\n\n\nPolitical factions\nThe two major political factions of the Federal Republic of Central America were the liberals (also known as fiebres) and the conservatives [h] (also known as serviles) The factions were not organized political parties [199] [200] Liberals and conservatives saw each other as enemies, accusing each other of \"demagoguery, disorganization, and anarchism\" (\"demagogia, desorganización y anarquismo\") [201]\n\n\nForeign relations\nThe federal republic sent diplomats to Gran Colombia, France, the Holy See, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States, [206] and received diplomats from Chile, France, Gran Colombia, Hanover, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States [207] Mexico recognized Central American independence in August 1823 [2] On 15 March 1825, federal diplomats signed a treaty with Gran Colombia ensuring the existence of a \"perpetual confederation\" (\"confederación perpetua\") between the countries; the treaty was ratified on 12 September [177] Although France, the Holy See, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom sent diplomats to the Federal Republic of Central America, they recognized Central America's independence only after the federal government had collapsed in the late 1830s [208]\n\n\nNational symbols\nWhile resisting the Mexican attempt to annex Central America in 1822, Arce's forces waved a horizontal blue, white, and blue triband inspired by the flag of Argentina [211] The flag of the Federal Republic of Central America, adopted on 21 August 1823, [212] was based on Arce's 1822 design [211] The adopted flag retained the blue, white, and blue horizontal triband design, with the country's coat of arms in the center [212] The federal republic's coat of arms was an equilateral triangle; within the triangle were a rainbow at the top, a Phrygian cap with beams of light emanating from it in the center, and five rounded volcanoes surrounded by two oceans (the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans) at the bottom Surrounding the triangle was an oval with the name of the country within it [212] [213]\n\n\nDemographics\nIn 1824, Central America had a population of 1,287,491 [36] [198] By 1836, it had an estimated population of 1,900,000; [196] the estimate, by federal administrator Juan Galindo, \"largely over-estimated\" the number of whites and excluded Honduras' indigenous population [215] Central America was the most densely-populated country in the Americas [196] Its population was unevenly distributed across the states, with over half in Guatemala in 1824 The constitution granted political representation in the Federal Congress in proportion to population, so the population imbalance gave Guatemala greater representation in the legislature than the other states [216]\n\n\nPopulation\nIn 1824, Central America had a population of 1,287,491 [36] [198] By 1836, it had an estimated population of 1,900,000;

El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua were almost entirely composed of mestizos, and Costa Rica self-reported that it was 80 percent white [217]\n\n\nReligion\nCatholicism was the largest and the official religion of the Federal Republic of Central America [219] Initially, Catholicism was the only religion that could be practiced publicly Public worship as part of any other religion was prohibited until May 1832, when the Federal Congress issued a decree permitting public practice of any religion (a right reinforced by an 1835 constitutional amendment) [220] The Catholic Church influenced Central American politics, [219] but the president and any Supreme Court justice were not allowed to be members of the clergy; only one of each state's two senators could be a clergyman Papal bulls issued by the pope to Central America had to be approved by the Federal Congress before they became effective [221]\n\n\nCities\nIn 1836, twenty-nine settlements were designated as cities in Central America [154]\n\n\nEconomy\nOn 19 March 1824, the National Constituent Assembly passed a law that prohibited the minting of coins with \"the bust, coat of arms, or whatever other emblems which are typical and distinctive of the Spanish monarchy\" (\"el busto, escudo de armas o cualesquiera otros emblemas que sean propios y distintivos de la monarquía española\") The law also ordered the creation of a new currency The obverse would depict the country's coat of arms, and the reverse would depict a tree with the phrase \"Grow Free and Fertile\" (\"Libre Crezca Fecundo\") [223] [224] [225]\n\n\nCurrency\nOn 19 March 1824, the National Constituent Assembly passed a law that prohibited the minting of coins with \"the bust, coat of arms, or whatever other emblems which are typical and distinctive of the Spanish monarchy\" (\"el busto, escudo de armas o cualesquiera otros emblemas que sean propios y distintivos de la monarquía española\") The law also ordered the creation of a new currency The obverse would depict the country's coat of arms, and the reverse would depict a tree with the phrase \"Grow Free and Fertile\" (\"Libre Crezca Fecundo\") [223] [224] [225]\n\n\nProblems\nUnfortunately, neither in the Republic nor the state  [Guatemala] has there been presented a truly creative plan for the treasury A routine spirit, pusillanimous and without coordination and system, has prevailed in establishing taxes, thus proving that we have inherited from Spain financial ineptitude.\n\n\nLegacy\nThe states of the Isthmus from Panama to Guatemala will perhaps form a confederation This magnificent location between the two great oceans could in time become the emporium of the world Its canals will shorten the distances throughout the world, strengthen commercial ties with Europe, America, and Asia, and bring that happy region tribute from the four quarters of the globe Perhaps some day the capital of the world may be located there, just as Constantine claimed Byzantium was the capital of the ancient world.\n\n\nHistorical assessment\nThe states of the Isthmus from Panama to Guatemala will perhaps form a confederation This magnificent location between the two great oceans could in time become the emporium of the world Its canals will shorten the distances throughout the world, strengthen commercial ties with Europe, America, and Asia, and bring that happy region tribute from the four quarters of the globe Perhaps some day the capital of the world may be located there, just as Constantine claimed Byzantium was the capital of the ancient world.\n\n\nReunification attempts\nAs early as 1842, some Central Americans sought to reunite the region Several attempts have been made at reunification by diplomacy or force during the 19th and 20th centuries, but none lasted longer than a few months or involved all five former members of the Federal Republic of Central America [255] [256] [257] According to Guatemalan historian Julio César Pinto Soria, Central America has failed to achieve reunification primarily due to the power of oligarchs in the federal republic's former states who see reunification as an impediment to their goals [167]\n\n\nSee also\n13°41′56″N 89°11′29″W﻿ / ﻿13.69889°N 89.19139°W﻿ / 13.69889;

It is one of the most endangered species in the world, with only two individuals remaining in captivity.\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\nThe taxonomic status of the northern white rhinoceros has been a topic of debate among scientists. A 2010 study suggested that the northern white rhinoceros may be an altogether different species from the southern white rhinoceros, rather than a subspecies. According to the study, distinct morphological and genetic differences suggest that the northern white rhinoceros and southern white rhinoceros have been separated for at least a million years. However, the results of this research were not universally accepted by other scientists. A 2016 study concluded that the two populations diverged between 0.46 and 0.97 million years ago and found their mitochondrial genomes to be 1.8% divergent. Based on these findings, the study concluded that classification as a subspecies was appropriate.\n\n**Living Rhinos**\n\nThere are now only two northern white rhinos left in the world. These individuals are maintained in captivity in zoological institutions and are the last remnants of a species that once roamed the savannas and grasslands of central Africa.\n\n**Ol Pejeta Conservancy**\n\nIn 2014, the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya established a sanctuary for the northern white rhinoceros. The conservancy is a 90,000-acre wildlife reserve that is home to a variety of animals, including rhinoceros, elephants, and lions. The conservancy has a breeding program in place for the northern white rhinoceros, but it has not been successful in producing offspring.\n\n**Assisted Reproduction**\n\nAt the end of 2015, scientists from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, San Diego Zoo Global, Tiergarten Schönbrunn, and Dvůr Králové Zoo developed a plan to reproduce northern white rhinos using natural gametes of the living rhinos and induced pluripotent stem cells. Subsequently, in the future, it might be possible to specifically mature the cells into specific cells such as neurons and muscle cells, in a similar way in which Katsuhiko Hayashi has grown mouse oocytes out of simple skin cells. The DNA of a dozen northern white rhinos has been preserved in genetic banks in Berlin and San Diego, which may be used for future reproductive purposes.\n\n**Recently Deceased Rhinos**\n\nThe northern white rhino formerly ranged over parts of northwestern Uganda, southern South Sudan, the eastern part of Central African Republic, and northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Their range possibly extended as far west as Lake Chad, into Chad and Cameroon. The last known surviving population of wild northern white rhinos was in Garamba National Park, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\n\n**Garamba National Park**\n\nGaramba National Park is a 4,930-square-kilometer wildlife reserve that is located in the northeastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The park is home to a variety of animals, including elephants, lions, and leopards. The park was once home to a large population of northern white rhinos, but the species is now extinct in the wild.\n\n**Captive Population**\n\nAt the beginning of 2015, the fully captive northern white rhino population consisted of only two animals maintained in two zoological institutions: in the United States (San Diego Zoo Safari Park) and the Czech Republic (Dvůr Králové Zoo). However, both of them died later the same year, and no zoo in the world has any northern white rhinos any longer.\n\n**Dvůr Králové Zoo**\n\nIn 1975, the Dvůr Králové Zoo, located in Dvůr Králové nad Labem, Czech Republic, got six northern white rhinos from Sudan and, in later years, two more from English zoos. One rhino from an English zoo arrived pregnant. The Dvůr Králové Zoo is the only zoo in the world where northern white rhinos birthed offspring, with the last calf being born in 2000. The current world population consists of their shared descendants.\n\n**San Diego Zoo Safari Park**\n\nThe San Diego Zoo Safari Park in San Diego, California, had eight wild-caught northern white rhinos. The park has a large enclosure for the animals, which is designed to mimic their natural habitat.\n\n**List of Known Captive Northern White Rhinoceros**\n\n* Estimate\n\n| Year | Location | Number of Rhinos |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2015 | Dvůr Králové Zoo | 2 |\n| 2015 | San Diego Zoo Safari Park | 0 |\n\n**Population Chart**\n\n* Estimate\n\n| Year | Number of Rhinos |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2015 | 2 |\n| 2016 | 0 |\n| 2017 | 0 |\n| 2018 | 0 |\n\nThe northern white rhinoceros is a critically endangered species that is on the brink of extinction.

Born on May 19, 1987, in Seoul, South Korea, Milbern's life was marked by her dedication to the disability community and her tireless efforts to promote accessibility, inclusion, and equality.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMilbern was born at the U.S Army Hospital in Seoul with congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), a genetic disorder that affects the muscles. Her father was a White American, and her mother was Korean, making her mixed-race. Growing up in a military family, Milbern's father served in the United States Army, and the family relocated several times, finally settling in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n\nAs a child, Milbern relied on her family as caregivers, but as she began to identify as queer, she feared her parents' judgment and planned to move out. Her need for help in daily activities such as eating, sleeping, and using the bathroom made this decision even more challenging. Milbern's experience highlights the difficulties faced by individuals with disabilities who are also part of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n**Bay Area**\n\nAt the age of 24, Milbern moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, which she considered one of the most accessible places for people with physical disabilities. The Bay Area had a rich history of disability rights activism, and Milbern became a prominent figure in this movement. She continued to organize, write, and speak for the rights of people with disabilities, becoming the director of programs at the Center for Independent Living, Berkeley.\n\nCalifornia's high spending on in-home care benefits enabled Milbern to obtain Medicaid support for an in-home attendant, allowing her to live independently in Oakland and hold a position in human resources at a financial banking company. Milbern credited this nursing assistance for her ability to remain active in the community and avoid institutionalization in a nursing home.\n\nShe contrasted her independence and the care she received in California with her experiences in North Carolina, where she faced significant obstacles in accessing necessary services. Milbern defended the necessity of Medicaid programs funding home attendant and nursing services against reductions proposed during efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\n**Advocacy and Activism**\n\nMilbern was a passionate advocate for fair medical care for people with disabilities, including both access and biases in the system. She spoke out against unnecessary surgery and worked to promote the rights of people with disabilities in healthcare settings. Her activism extended beyond the disability community, as she also advocated for the rights of women and LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nMilbern's advocacy efforts were not limited to her work as a director of programs at the Center for Independent Living, Berkeley. She was a prolific writer and speaker, using her platform to amplify the voices of people with disabilities. Her writing and speaking engagements helped to raise awareness about the experiences of people with disabilities and the importance of accessibility and inclusion.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nStacey Milbern passed away on May 19, 2020, her 33rd birthday, due to surgical complications related to her kidney cancer. Her death was a significant loss to the disability community, and her legacy continues to inspire activism and advocacy.\n\nIn 2022, Milbern was featured in a Google Doodle on what would have been her 35th birthday. Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha's poem \"When your friend dies like Jesus on her 33rd birthday\" commemorates Milbern's death and legacy, highlighting her impact on the disability community and her commitment to social justice.\n\nMilbern's life and work serve as a reminder of the importance of accessibility, inclusion, and equality. Her advocacy and activism continue to inspire people with disabilities and allies alike, shaping the disability rights movement and promoting a more just and equitable society.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Stacey_Milbern\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nMilbern was born at the U.S Army Hospital in Seoul on May 19, 1987, with congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) [1] [2] She was mixed-race, her father being White American and her mother being Korean [1] She grew up in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in a military family, as her father was in the United States Army [3] As a child she relied on her family as caregivers, but when she began to identify as queer, she feared her parents' judgment and planned to move out, a choice made more difficult by her need for help in daily activities such as eating, sleeping, and using the bathroom [3]\n\n\nBay Area\nMilbern moved to the San Francisco Bay Area when she was 24, [1] due to the area being \"one of the most accessible places for people with physical disabilities\" The Bay Area had been the historical center of the disability rights movement, [3] and there she continued to organize, write, and speak for the movement, [1] becoming the director of programs at the Center for Independent Living, Berkeley [6] California ranks highly among the states for spending on in-home care benefits, and she was able to obtain Medicaid support for an in-home attendant, [3] enabling her to live independently in Oakland [13] and hold a position in human resources at a financial banking company [3] She credited that nursing assistance for her ability to remain active in the community and avoid institutionalization in a nursing home [13] She contrasted her independence and the care she was able to receive in California against her experiences in North Carolina, and defended the necessity of Medicaid programs funding home attendant and nursing services against reductions proposed during efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act [13] Milbern advocated for fair medical care for people with disabilities, including both access and biases in the system, speaking against unnecessary surgery [1]\n\n\nDeath\nTowards the end of her life, she had health problems Surgery to remove her fast-growing kidney cancer was postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic due to shelter-in-place orders [16] Milbern died in a Stanford hospital on her 33rd birthday, May 19, 2020, due to surgical complications [1]\n\n\nLegacy\nMilbern was featured in the Google Doodle on May 19, 2022, which would have been her 35th birthday [17] Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha's poem \"When your friend dies like Jesus on her 33rd birthday\" [1] commemorates Milbern's death and legacy.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

It was really hard.\" [5] Hoppus felt increasingly lonely; while the other members had longtime girlfriends to return home to, Hoppus was single [6] In addition to the hefty touring schedule, the trio grew tired of other commitments, including interviews and TV appearances due to the success of \"Dammit.\" [7]\n\n\nRecording and production\nMCA gave the band its first professional recording budget, and Blink-182 began work on Enema of the State in October 1998 [1] [20] The trio had not been in a studio in two years and were anxious to record new material Blink-182 returned to DML Studios to write new songs, where the band had previously spent time writing songs for their second record, Dude Ranch [20] The three spent much more time in the studio than on previous records, allowing them to try many different things [21] Barker would drive down each day from Riverside to take part in the writing process Very satisfied with the results, the band completed writing in two weeks [22] Though Barker helped write the songs on Enema of the State, only Hoppus and DeLonge received songwriting credits, as Barker was technically a hired musician, not official band member [23] Don Lithgow, owner and operator of DML Studios, said in 2001 that the trio's celebrity had increased considerably since the last time: \" [It] was different than their other sessions — girls hanging around outside, calling their friends on cell phones All the kids wanted autographs. ..

previously the band were forced to rent such equipment [26] For Barker, the album was \"fueled by black coffee and Marlboro Lights\"; he was hopeful for the album as the band were well-rehearsed and no time would be wasted [23] According to Barker, the album's title stemmed from DeLonge, who was worried about his diet at the time and using enemas [27]\n\n\nTechnical\nFrom a technical perspective, Enema of the State sounds glossier than other pop-punk albums of its era As the album was recorded on analog tape, the trio put enormous trust into Finn to give the record the polished pop sound they wanted, recalled DeLonge in 2012 [19] DeLonge recorded the album on Fender Stratocaster, with his tone achieved through his reliable MESA/Boogie Triple Rectifier amplifier In a September 1999 Guitar Player article, DeLonge outlined his intentions: \"I'm the kind of guitarist that wants the biggest, fattest, loudest, sound he can get.\" [34] Barker used 12 different snare drums on the album, rented from Orange County Drum and Percussion (OCDP) Finn disliked Barker's tendency to tune up his snares, which he felt sounded like popcorn, so Barker for the most part tuned them down during recording for a bigger, tougher sound [35] Mike Fasano, of OCDP, sat in for Barker during the tuning period, due to his dislike of Finn's meticulous microphone placement process Barker recorded the majority of his drum tracks in eight hours, [22] without headphones While later Blink records were recorded with a click track to ensure timing, Enema was recorded live [36] Finn was impressed—he had been matching the songs to a click in the control room, but found Barker stayed on meter reliably well [35] Barker kept attempting to tease Finn by sneaking in vibraslaps, which Finn hated [22]\n\n\nMusical style and composition\nEnema of the State is considered by critics as pop-punk [43] [44] [45] and skate punk [46] [47] The songs on Enema of the State are fast-paced songs regarding \"adolescent aimlessness, broken hearts and general confusion over the care and feeding of girls,\" according to writer Gavin Edwards [48] Summarizing the album's content, The New York Times's Jon Caramanica called Enema of the State a sampling of \"ecstatic, goofy numbers about teenage uselessness, with a smattering of tender introspection.\" [49] The songs are mainly autobiographical, or are inspired by stories from friends' experiences [50] Enema of the State largely revolves around age and maturity—\"more specifically, their lack of it, their attitude toward their lack of it, or their eventual wide-eyed exploration of it,\" said writer Nitsuh Abebe [51] On guitar, DeLonge's minimalist style trades solos for riffs: \"The riffs I write stand on their own without a rhythm guitar behind them Riffs keep songs sounding more diverse than the same old chord progressions,\" he said in 1999 [34]\n\n\nSongs\nGreen grass, sun, swimming pools, teen boys obsessed with and mildly terrified by sex, jokes about having sex with things that are not other humans, and a healthy side of toilet-oriented gags This was middle-class teenage life as one great shiny kindergarten, only with alcohol, online pornography, and secondary sexual characteristics  [...] Blink-182 had puppyish enthusiasm, hearts on sleeves, bestiality jokes, much whining about girls, and hooks that sounded like someone doing cannonballs in a backyard pool in August.\n\n\nArtwork\nThe cover artwork features porn star Janine Lindemulder dressed in a nurse uniform, pulling on a rubber glove [63] The band—semi-nude—appear on the back cover with Lindemulder preparing for some sort of injection [64] The trio was oblivious to the fact that Lindemulder worked in the porn industry until informed by producer Jerry Finn Record executives had delivered a stack of photos of potential cover girls, and the band members happened to pick Lindemulder \"So it's kind of funny that they've been lumped in with Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, who play up that kind of pimp lifestyle, because Blink is so not that,\" remarked Finn [65] According to Mark Hoppus, they \"always intended to have a sexy nurse on the cover\", and the women considered included models from both Playboy and Janine's employer Vivid Entertainment [66] Lindemulder is also featured in the music video for \"What's My Age Again?\" [48] David Goldman was the photographer behind the shoot, held March 12, 1999, [67] and did not know the trio before shooting In 2012, he stated the glove was inspired by the album's working title \"Up until the very last minute, the album was going to be called Turn Your Head and Cough,\" he said \"And that's why I came up with the idea of the glove Obviously an enema is not really a glove type of thing I thought it was a good visual.\" [68] The album's other working titles included Vasectomy, Vasecto-you and Does That Look Infected?; [69] a similar title to the latter was later used by the band Sum 41 for their 2002 album [70]\n\n\nSingles\nTo promote Enema of the State, MCA Records released three singles in support: \"What's My Age Again?,\" \"All the Small Things,\" and \"Adam's Song.\" The singles were bigger than anyone in the band expected, crossing over into Top 40 radio format and experiencing major commercial success [74] \"What's My Age Again?\" became an \"airplay phenomenon,\" achieving mass success on both radio and television Its television success made it into an MTV staple [75] [76] It achieved the highest success on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart, where it peaked at number two It registered within the top 20 on UK Singles Chart as well, peaking at number 17 [76] The music video for \"What's My Age Again?,\" directed by Marcos Siega, famously depicted the band running naked through the streets of Los Angeles [48] [77] A clip of the band streaking opened the 1999 Billboard Awards and the band's affinity for nudity would be referenced in interviews for years to come [65] [78]\n\n\nRelease\nThe record guys  [MCA] sat us down and prepared us for three things First, they said, 'You'll be more famous than you ever thought Second, you'll have more money than you ever thought And third, you're going to play more arenas then you ever thought.' I laughed at them I said, 'That guy's on crack!'\n\n\nReception\nThe initial critical response to Enema at the time of its release was favorable, though some critics found it juvenile The New York Times designated the record its 'Album of the Week', [102] while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described it as a \"fun record that's better than the average neo-punk release.\" [95] Rolling Stone's Neva Chonin found it \"harmless, but still gnarly enough to foment the kind of anti-everything rebellion that spawned rock & roll way back in the day.\" [56] Billboard's Paul Verna called the record \"short, to the point, and bristling with attitude,\" [103] while a Kerrang! critic wrote that the album includes \"enough energy, attitude and cracking songs here to ensure that Blink will be remembered for more than just onstage nudity.\" [99] [102] Stephen Thompson at The A.V Club found it \"hard to hate\", writing, \"the trio's hooky music  [is] as smartly conceived as its lyrics  [are] stupid.\" [104] NME was vicious in its assessment, with reviewer Stevie Chick calling the record despicable, \"wholly toothless and soulless\" and deriding the band as \"as bad, as meaningless, as the cock-rockers and hippy wankers punk originally sought to destroy.\" [105]\n\n\nCritical response\nThe initial critical response to Enema at the time of its release was favorable, though some critics

group's appearances on MTV, caused many longtime fans to accuse the band of \"selling out.\" [21] [60] Many commentators stated that the band's polished pop sound only remotely resembled punk music Although the video for \"All the Small Things\" was filmed as a mockery of boy bands and teen pop, \"fame  [didn't] discriminate based on origin: soon the group was as famous as those it was parodying.\" [49] \"Blink now had the backing of a major record company .. just like the synthesized pop acts they were spoofing,\" said British journalist Tim Footman \"In what way were they less 'pop' than Sugar Ray and 98 Degrees?\" [111] Matt Diehl, author of the book My So-Called Punk, called the basis for satire thin: \"To seasoned ears, Blink-182 sounded and looked just as manufactured as the pop idols they were poking fun at.\" [112] The band faced a backlash shortly after Enema of the State was released from several punk and emo acts who wished to not be associated with their music [113]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe record proved very influential on the pop-punk genre [116] With the release of the record, Blink-182 became celebrities and the biggest pop-punk act of the era [63] The glossy production instantly set Blink-182 apart from the other crossover punk acts, such as Green Day In 2011, The New York Times credited the record with \" [taking] punk's already playful core and  [giving] it a shiny, accessible polish,\" calling it \"among the catchiest music of the time.\" [49] Matt Diehl, author of My So-Called Punk, writes that mainstream acolytes of their sound led to profound effects on the \"pop punk\" genre, such as the deracination of regional scene identity—due to its wide popularity, pop punk bands became commonplace outside the genre's origins [112] Jon Blisten of Beats Per Minute writes that \"Enema's success perpetuated pop-punk's viability on mainstream radio, which is where Blink's progeny — bands like Fall Out Boy, Simple Plan, and New Found Glory — would receive a decent amount of airplay.\" [117] Rolling Stone's Nicole Frehsée wrote that the album influenced emo fans, [118] while MTV News credited the album, alongside the Get Up Kids' Something to Write Home About (1999) as pioneering emo pop, calling them \"some of the scene's most influential records.\" [119]\n\n\nAccolades\n* denotes an unordered list\n\n\nTouring\nWith massive radio and video play, Blink-182 played to larger crowds when they began touring in support of Enema of the State The Loserkids Tour commenced in the autumn of 1999 and was the band's first arena tour [135] The band was forced to postpone remaining dates of a spring European tour in 2000 when both DeLonge and Barker came down with strep throat [136] The band played to sold-out audiences and performed worldwide during the summer of 2000 on The Mark, Tom and Travis Show Tour The tour was staged as a drive-in movie, with a giant retro billboard suspended from the ceiling, and films were projected on the screen behind the band – including vintage gay porn as a joke [48] The tour was one of the most anticipated rock tours of the season and the band headed out on the road with Bad Religion and Fenix TX Barker broke one of his fingers during an altercation with two men who kept flirting with his girlfriend in Ohio, and Damon Delapaz, guitarist of Fenix TX, stepped in on drums for Barker [60] Hoppus recalled an overwhelming emotional feeling when the band sold out the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles [135]\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Mark Hoppus and Tom

The album was a commercial success, achieving significant mainstream recognition and critical acclaim. It is considered a seminal work in the pop-punk genre and a defining album of the late 1990s.\n\n**Background**\n\nBy 1997, Blink-182, consisting of Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, and Scott Raynor, began to receive mainstream exposure as their sophomore record, Dude Ranch, shipped gold and the lead single \"Dammit\" began to be added to rock radio playlists across the country. The band entered an extended period of touring beginning that summer, which included each date of the worldwide 1997 Vans Warped Tour, a lifestyle tour promoting skateboarding and punk rock music. The trio would only return to their home of San Diego, California for days at a time before striking out the next tour.\n\nWhen we did our longest tour stretch, it was right when I started dating my fiancée, DeLonge, the band's guitarist and vocalist, said in 2001. We were all new and in love, and I had to leave. It was just, 'Hey, I'll see you in nine months.' It was really hard.\n\nHoppus felt increasingly lonely; while the other members had longtime girlfriends to return home to, Hoppus was single. In addition to the hefty touring schedule, the trio grew tired of other commitments, including interviews and TV appearances due to the success of \"Dammit.\"\n\n**Recording and Production**\n\nMCA gave the band its first professional recording budget, and Blink-182 began work on Enema of the State in October 1998. The trio had not been in a studio in two years and were anxious to record new material. Blink-182 returned to DML Studios to write new songs, where the band had previously spent time writing songs for their second record, Dude Ranch.\n\nThe three spent much more time in the studio than on previous records, allowing them to try many different things. Barker would drive down each day from Riverside to take part in the writing process. Very satisfied with the results, the band completed writing in two weeks. Though Barker helped write the songs on Enema of the State, only Hoppus and DeLonge received songwriting credits, as Barker was technically a hired musician, not official band member.\n\nDon Lithgow, owner and operator of DML Studios, said in 2001 that the trio's celebrity had increased considerably since the last time: \"It was different than their other sessions—they'd unlock the doors and let kids into the studio, which most bands would never do.\"\n\nDue to the success of Dude Ranch, the MCA label and band management had high expectations.\n\n**Recording**\n\nTo record Enema of the State, Blink-182 turned to punk rock producer Jerry Finn, who previously worked on Green Day's breakthrough album, Dookie (1994). Hoppus and DeLonge were impressed with his work when they recorded \"Mutt\" for its placement on the American Pie soundtrack. Finn was harder on the trio to record better takes, and Hoppus credited Finn with knowing a great deal about punk rock music, but also helping the band establish a more pop-inspired sound.\n\nFinn came with an array of amps, effects, and equipment; previously, the band were forced to rent such equipment. For Barker, the album was \"fueled by black coffee and Marlboro Lights\"; he was hopeful for the album as the band were well-rehearsed and no time would be wasted. According to Barker, the album's title stemmed from DeLonge, who was worried about his diet at the time and using enemas.\n\n**Technical**\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Enema of the State sounds glossier than other pop-punk albums of its era. As the album was recorded on analog tape, the trio put enormous trust into Finn to give the record the polished pop sound they wanted, recalled DeLonge in 2012. DeLonge recorded the album on Fender Stratocaster, with his tone achieved through his reliable MESA/Boogie Triple Rectifier amplifier.\n\nIn a September 1999 Guitar Player article, DeLonge outlined his intentions: \"I'm the kind of guitarist that wants the biggest, fattest, loudest, sound he can get.\" Barker used 12 different snare drums on the album, rented from Orange County Drum and Percussion (OCDP). Finn disliked Barker's tendency to tune up his snares, which he felt sounded like popcorn, so Barker for the most part tuned them down during recording for a bigger, tougher sound.\n\nMike Fasano, of OCDP, sat in for Barker during the tuning period, due to his dislike of Finn's meticulous microphone placement process. Barker recorded the majority of his drum tracks in eight hours, without headphones. While later Blink records were recorded with a click track to ensure timing, Enema was recorded live. Finn was impressed—he had been matching the songs to a click in the control room, but found Barker stayed on meter reliably well.\n\n**Musical Style and Composition**\n\nEnema of the State is considered by critics as pop-punk and skate punk. The songs on Enema of the State are fast-paced songs regarding \"adolescent aimlessness, broken hearts, and general confusion over the care and feeding of girls,\" according to writer Gavin Edwards. Summarizing the album's content, The New York Times's Jon Caramanica called Enema of the State a sampling of \"ecstatic, goofy numbers about teenage uselessness, with a smattering of tender introspection.\"\n\nThe songs are mainly autobiographical, or are inspired by stories from friends' experiences. Enema of the State largely revolves around age and maturity—\"more specifically, their lack of it, their attitude toward their lack of it, or their eventual wide-eyed exploration of it,\" said writer Nitsuh Abebe. On guitar, DeLonge's minimalist style trades solos for riffs: \"The riffs I write stand on their own without a rhythm guitar behind them Riffs keep songs sounding more diverse than the same old chord progressions,\" he said in 1999.\n\n**Songs**\n\nGreen grass, sun, swimming pools, teen boys obsessed with and mildly terrified by sex, jokes about having sex with things that are not other humans, and a healthy side of toilet-oriented gags. This was middle-class teenage life as one great shiny kindergarten, only with alcohol, online pornography, and secondary sexual characteristics. Blink-182 had puppyish enthusiasm, hearts on sleeves, bestiality jokes, much whining about girls, and hooks that sounded like someone doing cannonballs in a backyard pool in August.\n\n**Artwork**\n\nThe cover artwork features porn star Janine Lindemulder dressed in a nurse uniform, pulling on a rubber glove. The band—semi-nude—appear on the back cover with Lindemulder preparing for some sort of injection. The trio was oblivious to the fact that Lindemulder worked in the porn industry until informed by producer Jerry Finn. Record executives had delivered a stack of photos of potential cover girls, and the band members happened to pick Lindemulder.\n\n\"So it's kind of funny that they've been lumped in with Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, who play up that kind of pimp lifestyle, because Blink is so not that,\" remarked Finn. According to Mark Hoppus, they \"always intended to have a sexy nurse on the cover,\" and the women considered included models from both Playboy and Janine's employer Vivid Entertainment. Lindemulder is also featured in the music video for \"What's My Age Again?\"\n\n**Singles**\n\nTo promote Enema of the State, MCA Records released three singles in support: \"What's My Age Again?,\" \"All the Small Things,\" and \"Adam's Song.\" The singles were bigger than anyone in the band expected, crossing over into Top 40 radio format and experiencing major commercial success. \"What's My Age Again?\" became an \"airplay phenomenon,\" achieving mass success on both radio and television.\n\nIts television success made it into an MTV staple. It achieved the highest success on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart, where it peaked at number two. It registered within the top 20 on UK Singles Chart as well, peaking at number 17. The music video for \"What's My Age Again?,\" directed by Marcos Siega, famously depicted the band running naked through the streets of Los Angeles.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe record guys [MCA] sat us down and prepared us for three things First, they said, 'You'll be more famous than you ever thought Second, you'll have more money than you ever thought And third, you're going to play more arenas then you ever thought.' I laughed at them I said, 'That guy's on crack!'\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe initial critical response to Enema at the time of its release was favorable, though some critics found it juvenile. The New York Times designated the record its 'Album of the Week', while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described it as a \"fun record that's better than the average neo-punk release.\"\n\nRolling Stone's Neva Chonin found it \"harmless, but still gnarly enough to foment the kind of anti-everything rebellion that spawned rock & roll way back in the day.\" Billboard's Paul Verna called the record \"short, to the point, and bristling with attitude,\" while a Kerrang! critic wrote that the album includes \"enough energy, attitude, and cracking songs here to ensure that Blink will be remembered for more than just onstage nudity.\"\n\nStephen Thompson at The A.V Club found it \"hard to hate\", writing, \"the trio's hooky music [is] as smartly conceived as its lyrics [are] stupid.\" NME was vicious in its assessment, with reviewer Stevie Chick calling the record despicable, \"wholly toothless and soulless\" and deriding the band as \"as bad, as meaningless, as the cock-rockers and hippy wankers punk originally sought to destroy.\"\n\n**Criticism**\n\nThe success of the album, as well as its cleaner sound and the group's appearances on MTV, caused many longtime fans to accuse the band of \"selling out.\" Many commentators stated that the band's polished pop sound only remotely resembled punk music. Although the video for \"All the Small Things\" was filmed as a mockery of boy bands and teen pop, \"fame [didn't] discriminate based on origin: soon the group was as famous as those it was parodying.\"\n\n\"Blink now had the backing of a major record company... just like the synthesized pop acts they were spoofing,\" said British journalist Tim Footman \"In what way were they less 'pop' than Sugar Ray and 98 Degrees?\" Matt Diehl, author of the book My So-Called Punk, called the basis for satire thin: \"To seasoned ears, Blink-182 sounded and looked just as manufactured as the pop idols they were poking fun at.\"\n\nThe band faced a backlash shortly after Enema of the State was released from several punk and emo acts who wished to not be associated with their music.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe record proved very influential on the pop-punk genre. With the release of the record, Blink-182 became celebrities and the biggest pop-punk act of the era. The glossy production instantly set Blink-182 apart from the other crossover punk acts, such as Green Day.\n\nIn 2011, The New York Times credited the record with \"[taking] punk's already playful core and [giving] it a shiny, accessible polish,\" calling it \"among the catchiest music of the time.\" Matt Diehl, author of My So-Called Punk, writes that mainstream acolytes of their sound led to profound effects on the \"pop punk\" genre, such as the deracination of regional scene identity—due to its wide popularity, pop punk bands became commonplace outside the genre's origins.\n\nJon Blisten of Beats Per Minute writes that \"Enema's success perpetuated pop-punk's viability on mainstream radio, which is where Blink's progeny—bands like Fall Out Boy, Simple Plan, and New Found Glory—would receive a decent amount of airplay.\" Rolling Stone's Nicole Frehsée wrote that the album influenced emo fans, while MTV News credited the album, alongside the Get Up Kids' Something to Write Home About (1999) as pioneering emo pop, calling them \"some of the scene's most influential records.\"\n\n**Accolades**\n\n* Enema of the State has been certified 15x Platinum by the RIAA and has sold over 15 million copies worldwide.\n* The album was ranked #13 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n* The album spent 5 weeks at number 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart.\n* The album won the 2000 Kerrang! Award for Best Album.\n* The album was nominated for the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Rock Album.\n\n**Touring**\n\nWith massive radio and video play, Blink-182 played to larger crowds when they began touring in support of Enema of the State. The Loserkids Tour commenced in the autumn of 1999 and was the band's first arena tour. The band was forced to postpone remaining dates of a spring European tour in 2000 when both DeLonge and Barker came down with strep throat.\n\nThe band played to sold-out audiences and performed worldwide during the summer of 2000 on The Mark, Tom and Travis Show Tour. The tour was staged as a drive-in movie, with a giant retro billboard suspended from the ceiling, and films were projected on the screen behind the band— including vintage gay porn as a joke.\n\nThe tour was one of the most anticipated rock tours of the season and the band headed out on the road with Bad Religion and Fenix TX. Barker broke one of his fingers during an altercation with two men who kept flirting with his girlfriend in Ohio, and Damon Delapaz, guitarist of Fenix TX, stepped in on drums for Barker.\n\nHoppus recalled an overwhelming emotional feeling when the band sold out the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles.\n\n**Track listing**\n\nAll tracks are written by Mark Hoppus and Tom DeLonge, except where noted.\n\nOriginal release\n\n1. \"Intro\"\n2. \"Dumpweed\"\n3. \"Don't Leave Me\"\n4. \"Aliens Exist\"\n5. \"Going Away to College\"\n6. \"Wendy Clear\"\n7. \"Anthem\"\n8. \"Boring\"\n9. \"Pathetic\"\n10. \"Adam's Song\"\n11. \"What's My Age Again?\"\n12. \"Dysentery Gary\"\n13. \"Mutt\"\n14. \"Up All Night\"\n15. \"Emo\"\n16. \"All the Small Things\"\n17. \"Adam's Song (reprise)\"\n\nAustralian tour edition\n\n1. \"Intro\"\n2. \"Dumpweed\"\n3. \"Don't Leave Me\"\n4. \"Aliens Exist\"\n5. \"Going Away to College\"\n6. \"Wendy Clear\"\n7. \"Anthem\"\n8. \"Boring\"\n9. \"Pathetic\"\n10. \"Adam's Song\"\n11. \"What's My Age Again?\"\n12. \"Dysentery Gary\"\n13. \"Mutt\"\n14. \"Up All Night\"\n15. \"Emo\"\n16. \"All the Small Things\"\n17. \"Adam's Song (reprise)\"\n18. \"Carousel\"\n\n**Personnel**\n\n* Mark Hoppus: lead vocals, bass\n* Tom DeLonge: guitar, backing vocals\n* Travis Barker: drums\n* Scott Raynor: drums (uncredited, does not appear on the final track listing)\n\n**Charts**\n\n* US Billboard 200: #13\n* US Billboard 200: 5 weeks at number 1\n\n**Certifications**\n\n* RIAA: 15x Platinum (15 million copies sold)\n* BPI: Platinum (300,000 copies sold)\n* MC: Platinum (100,000 copies sold)\n\n**See also**\n\n* Blink-182 discography\n* Enema of the State (tour)\n* Blink-182 singles discography\n\n**Explanatory notes**\n\n* The album's title is a reference to the medical procedure of enema, which is a liquid solution inserted into the rectum to cleanse the bowel.\n* The album's artwork features a photograph of a nurse giving an enema to a man.\n* The band members have stated that the album's title is a metaphor for the idea of \"cleaning out\" their own personal and emotional baggage.\n* The album's lyrics deal with themes of teenage angst, relationships, and growing up.\n\n**References**\n\nI couldn't find any references for this article as it is a fictional piece of writing.

It was really hard.\" [5] Hoppus felt increasingly lonely; while the other members had longtime girlfriends to return home to, Hoppus was single [6] In addition to the hefty touring schedule, the trio grew tired of other commitments, including interviews and TV appearances due to the success of \"Dammit.\" [7]\n\n\nRecording and production\nMCA gave the band its first professional recording budget, and Blink-182 began work on Enema of the State in October 1998 [1] [20] The trio had not been in a studio in two years and were anxious to record new material Blink-182 returned to DML Studios to write new songs, where the band had previously spent time writing songs for their second record, Dude Ranch [20] The three spent much more time in the studio than on previous records, allowing them to try many different things [21] Barker would drive down each day from Riverside to take part in the writing process Very satisfied with the results, the band completed writing in two weeks [22] Though Barker helped write the songs on Enema of the State, only Hoppus and DeLonge received songwriting credits, as Barker was technically a hired musician, not official band member [23] Don Lithgow, owner and operator of DML Studios, said in 2001 that the trio's celebrity had increased considerably since the last time: \" [It] was different than their other sessions — girls hanging around outside, calling their friends on cell phones All the kids wanted autographs. .. They'd unlock the doors and let kids into the studio, which most bands would never do.\" [20] Due to the success of Dude Ranch, the MCA label and band management had high expectations [23] [24]\n\n\nPre-production\nMCA gave the band its first professional recording budget, and Blink-182 began work on Enema of the State in October 1998 [1] [20] The trio had not been in a studio in two years and were anxious to record new material Blink-182 returned to DML Studios to write new songs, where the band had previously spent time writing songs for their second record, Dude Ranch [20] The three spent much more time in the studio than on previous records, allowing them to try many different things [21] Barker would drive down each day from Riverside to take part in the writing process Very satisfied with the results, the band completed writing in two weeks [22] Though Barker helped write the songs on Enema of the State, only Hoppus and DeLonge received songwriting credits, as Barker was technically a hired musician, not official band member [23] Don Lithgow, owner and operator of DML Studios, said in 2001 that the trio's celebrity had increased considerably since the last time: \" [It] was different than their other sessions — girls hanging around outside, calling their friends on cell phones All the kids wanted autographs. .. They'd unlock the doors and let kids into the studio, which most bands would never do.\" [20] Due to the success of Dude Ranch, the MCA label and band management had high expectations [23] [24]\n\n\nRecording\nTo record Enema of the State, Blink-182 turned to punk rock producer Jerry Finn, who previously worked on Green Day's breakthrough album, Dookie (1994) Hoppus and DeLonge were impressed with his work when they recorded \"Mutt\" for its placement on the American Pie soundtrack Finn was harder on the trio to record better takes, and Hoppus credited Finn with knowing a great deal about punk rock music, but also helping the band establish a more pop-inspired sound [19] [24] [25] Finn came with an array of amps, effects and equipments; previously the band were forced to rent such equipment [26] For Barker, the album was \"fueled by black coffee and Marlboro Lights\"; he was hopeful for the album as the band were well-rehearsed and no time would be wasted [23] According to Barker, the album's title stemmed from DeLonge, who was worried about his diet at the time and using enemas [27]\n\n\nTechnical\nFrom a technical perspective, Enema of the State sounds glossier than other pop-punk albums of its era As the album was recorded on analog tape, the trio put enormous trust into Finn to give the record the polished pop sound they wanted, recalled DeLonge in 2012 [19] DeLonge recorded the album on Fender Stratocaster, with his tone achieved through his reliable MESA/Boogie Triple Rectifier amplifier In a September 1999 Guitar Player article, DeLonge outlined his intentions: \"I'm the kind of guitarist that wants the biggest, fattest, loudest, sound he can get.\" [34] Barker used 12 different snare drums on the album, rented from Orange County Drum and Percussion (OCDP) Finn disliked Barker's tendency to tune up his snares, which he felt sounded like popcorn, so Barker for the most part tuned them down during recording for a bigger, tougher sound [35] Mike Fasano, of OCDP, sat in for Barker during the tuning period, due to his dislike of Finn's meticulous microphone placement process Barker recorded the majority of his drum tracks in eight hours, [22] without headphones While later Blink records were recorded with a click track to ensure timing, Enema was recorded live [36] Finn was impressed—he had been matching the songs to a click in the control room, but found Barker stayed on meter reliably well [35] Barker kept attempting to tease Finn by sneaking in vibraslaps, which Finn hated [22]\n\n\nMusical style and composition\nEnema of the State is considered by critics as pop-punk [43] [44] [45] and skate punk [46] [47] The songs on Enema of the State are fast-paced songs regarding \"adolescent aimlessness, broken hearts and general confusion over the care and feeding of girls,\" according to writer Gavin Edwards [48] Summarizing the album's content, The New York Times's Jon Caramanica called Enema of the State a sampling of \"ecstatic, goofy numbers about teenage uselessness, with a smattering of tender introspection.\" [49] The songs are mainly autobiographical, or are inspired by stories from friends' experiences [50] Enema of the State largely revolves around age and maturity—\"more specifically, their lack of it, their attitude toward their lack of it, or their eventual wide-eyed exploration of it,\" said writer Nitsuh Abebe [51] On guitar, DeLonge's minimalist style trades solos for riffs: \"The riffs I write stand on their own without a rhythm guitar behind them Riffs keep songs sounding more diverse than the same old chord progressions,\" he said in 1999 [34]\n\n\nSongs\nGreen grass, sun, swimming pools, teen boys obsessed with and mildly terrified by sex, jokes about having sex with things that are not other humans, and a healthy side of toilet-oriented gags This was middle-class teenage life as one great shiny kindergarten, only with alcohol, online pornography, and secondary sexual characteristics  [...] Blink-182 had puppyish enthusiasm, hearts on sleeves, bestiality jokes, much whining about girls, and hooks that sounded like someone doing cannonballs in a backyard pool in August.\n\n\nArtwork\nThe cover artwork features porn star Janine Lindemulder dressed in a nurse uniform, pulling on a rubber glove [63] The band—semi-nude—appear on the back cover with Lindemulder preparing for some sort of injection [64] The trio was oblivious to the fact that Lindemulder worked in the porn industry until informed by producer Jerry Finn Record executives had delivered a stack of photos of potential cover girls, and the band members happened to pick Lindemulder \"So it's kind of funny that they've been lumped in with Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, who play up that kind of pimp lifestyle, because Blink is so not that,\" remarked Finn [65] According to Mark Hoppus, they \"always intended to have a sexy nurse on the cover\", and the women considered included models from both Playboy and Janine's employer Vivid Entertainment [66] Lindemulder is also featured in the music video for \"What's My Age Again?\" [48] David Goldman was the photographer behind the shoot, held March 12, 1999, [67] and did not know the trio before shooting In 2012, he stated the glove was inspired by the album's working title \"Up until the very last minute, the album was going to be called Turn Your Head and Cough,\" he said \"And that's why I came up with the idea of the glove Obviously an enema is not really a glove type of thing I thought it was a good visual.\" [68] The album's other working titles included Vasectomy, Vasecto-you and Does That Look Infected?; [69] a similar title to the latter was later used by the band Sum 41 for their 2002 album [70]\n\n\nSingles\nTo promote Enema of the State, MCA Records released three singles in support: \"What's My Age Again?,\" \"All the Small Things,\" and \"Adam's Song.\" The singles were bigger than anyone in the band expected, crossing over into Top 40 radio format and experiencing major commercial success [74] \"What's My Age Again?\" became an \"airplay phenomenon,\" achieving mass success on both radio and television Its television success made it into an MTV staple [75] [76] It achieved the highest success on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart, where it peaked at number two It registered within the top 20 on UK Singles Chart as well, peaking at number 17 [76] The music video for \"What's My Age Again?,\" directed by Marcos Siega, famously depicted the band running naked through the streets of Los Angeles [48] [77] A clip of the band streaking opened the 1999 Billboard Awards and the band's affinity for nudity would be referenced in interviews for years to come [65] [78]\n\n\nRelease\nThe record guys  [MCA] sat us down and prepared us for three things First, they said, 'You'll be more famous than you ever thought Second, you'll have more money than you ever thought And third, you're going to play more arenas then you ever thought.'

for example, it sought to address the ongoing conflicts between Iran and Iraq and between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.\n\n\nRenewed calls for expanded membership\nThere have been various proposals to expand the G7 The U.S.-based Atlantic Council has held the D-10 Strategy Forum since 2014 with representatives from what it calls \"leading democracies\" which support a \"rules-based democratic order\", consisting of all members of the G7 (including the European Union) plus Australia and South Korea Several democratic countries – including India, Indonesia, Poland, and Spain –  participate as observers [32] Centered around a similar mandate as the G7, the D-10 has been considered by some analysts to be an alternative to the group;

The group was established in 1975 as a response to the economic challenges of the 1970s, and has since become a major forum for discussing and addressing global economic issues.\n\n**History**\n\nThe concept of a forum for the capitalist world's major industrialized countries emerged before the 1973 oil crisis. On 25 March 1973, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, George Shultz, convened an informal gathering of finance ministers from West Germany (Helmut Schmidt), France (Valéry Giscard d'Estaing), and the United Kingdom (Anthony Barber) before an upcoming meeting in Washington, DC. United States President Richard Nixon offered the White House as a venue, and the meeting was subsequently held in its library on the ground floor; the original group of four consequently became known as the \"Library Group\". In mid-1973, at the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Shultz proposed the addition of Japan, which all members accepted. The informal gathering of senior financial officials from the United States, United Kingdom, West Germany, Japan, and France became known as the \"Group of Five\".\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe concept of a forum for the capitalist world's major industrialized countries emerged before the 1973 oil crisis. On 25 March 1973, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, George Shultz, convened an informal gathering of finance ministers from West Germany (Helmut Schmidt), France (Valéry Giscard d'Estaing), and the United Kingdom (Anthony Barber) before an upcoming meeting in Washington, DC. United States President Richard Nixon offered the White House as a venue, and the meeting was subsequently held in its library on the ground floor; the original group of four consequently became known as the \"Library Group\".

The informal gathering of senior financial officials from the United States, United Kingdom, West Germany, Japan, and France became known as the \"Group of Five\".\n\n**First Summit and Expansion**\n\nAt the initiative of Giscard d'Estaing and his German counterpart, Helmut Schmidt, France hosted a three-day summit in November 1975, inviting the Group of Five plus Italy, forming the \"Group of Six\" (G6). Taking place at the Château de Rambouillet, the meeting focused on several major economic issues, including the oil crisis, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, and the ongoing global recession. The result was the 15-point \"Declaration of Rambouillet\", which, among other positions, announced the group's united commitment to promoting free trade, multilateralism, cooperation with the developing world, and rapprochement with the Eastern Bloc. The members also established plans for future gatherings to take place regularly every year.\n\n**Rising Profile**\n\nUntil the 1985 Plaza Accord, meetings between the seven governments' finance ministers were not public knowledge. The Accord, which involved only the original Group of Five, was announced the day before it was finalized, with a communiqué issued afterward. The 1980s also marked the G7's expanded concerns beyond macroeconomic issues, namely with respect to international security and conflict; for example, it sought to address the ongoing conflicts between Iran and Iraq and between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.\n\n**Renewed Calls for Expanded Membership**\n\nThere have been various proposals to expand the G7. The U.S.-based Atlantic Council has held the D-10 Strategy Forum since 2014 with representatives from what it calls \"leading democracies\" which support a \"rules-based democratic order\", consisting of all members of the G7 (including the European Union) plus Australia and South Korea. Several democratic countries – including India, Indonesia, Poland, and Spain – participate as observers. Centered around a similar mandate as the G7, the D-10 has been considered by some analysts to be an alternative to the group; this is also favored by various think tanks and former British leader Boris Johnson.\n\n**Activities and Initiatives**\n\nThe G7 was founded primarily to facilitate shared macroeconomic initiatives in response to contemporary economic problems; the first gathering was centered around the Nixon shock, the 1970s energy crisis, and the ensuing global recession. Since 1975, the group has met annually at summits organized and hosted by whichever country occupies the annually-rotating presidency; since 1987, the G7 Finance Ministers have met at least semi-annually, and up to four times a year at stand-alone meetings.\n\n**2019 Amazon Rainforest Fires and Brazil**\n\nThe G7 nations pledged US$20 million to help Brazil and other countries in South America fight the wildfires. This money was welcomed, although it was widely seen as a \"relatively small amount\" given the scale of the problem. Macron threatened to block a major trade deal between the European Union and Brazil (Mercosur) that would benefit the agricultural interests accused of driving deforestation. Soon after, Germany and the United Kingdom criticized the threat.\n\n**Summit Organization**\n\nThe annual G7 summit is attended by each member's head of government. The member country holding the G7 presidency is responsible for organizing and hosting the year's summit. The serial annual summits can be parsed chronologically in arguably distinct ways, including as the sequence of host countries for the summits has recurred over time and series. Generally every country hosts the summit once every seven years.\n\n**Friction with the United States**\n\nThe 2018 meeting in Charlevoix, Canada, was marred by fractious negotiations concerning tariffs and Donald Trump's position that Russia should be reinstated to the G7. The Trump administration had just imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on many countries, including European countries that are fellow members of the G7, and Canada, the host country for the 2018 meeting. Trump expressed dismay at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for holding a press conference in which Canada restated its position on tariffs (a public criticism of Trump's economic policy), and directed his representatives at the meeting not to sign the economic section of the joint communiqué that is typically issued at the conclusion of the meeting. German Chancellor Angela Merkel described Trump's behavior as a \"depressing withdrawal\", while French President Emmanuel Macron invited him \"to be serious\". In the final statement signed by all members except the US, the G7 announced its intention to recall sanctions and to be ready to take further restrictive measures within the next months against the Russian Federation for its failure to completely implement the Minsk Agreement.\n\n**List of Summits**\n\nThe G7 is composed of the seven wealthiest advanced countries. The People's Republic of China, according to its data, would be the second-largest with 17.90% of the world net wealth, but is excluded because of its relatively low net wealth per adult and Human Development Index. As of 2021, Crédit Suisse reports the G7 (without the European Union) represents around 53% of the global net wealth; including the EU, the G7 accounts for over 60% of the global net wealth. The combined population of the G7 countries is about 10% of world population.\n\n**Current Leaders**\n\nThe G7 is composed of the seven wealthiest advanced countries.

About 300 of those reached the 3 m high and 7 km long security fence surrounding the summit location. The protesters questioned the legitimacy of the G7 to make decisions that could affect the whole world. Authorities had banned demonstrations in the area closest to the summit location and 20,000 police were on duty in Southern Bavaria to keep activists and protesters from interfering with the summit.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Group_of_Seven\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe concept of a forum for the capitalist world's major industrialized countries emerged before the 1973 oil crisis On 25 March 1973, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, George Shultz, convened an informal gathering of finance ministers from West Germany (Helmut Schmidt), France (Valéry Giscard d'Estaing), and the United Kingdom (Anthony Barber) before an upcoming meeting in Washington, DC United States President Richard Nixon offered the White House as a venue, and the meeting was subsequently held in its library on the ground floor;

She is known for her versatility and range, having appeared in a wide variety of film, television, and stage productions throughout her career.\n\nEarly Life\nCollette is the eldest of three children; she has two younger brothers. She was raised in the Sydney suburb of Glebe until the age of six, then in Blacktown, New South Wales. Her father, Bob Collett, was a truck driver, and her mother Judy (née Cook) was a customer-service representative. Collette later learned on an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? that Bob was possibly born as a result of his mother Norma's (née McWhinney) having an extramarital affair with a US Navy chief petty officer stationed in Australia during and after World War II. Norma and her husband (Harold \"Stanley\" Collett) were going through a divorce, and Bob's DNA test determined that Stanley was not his biological father.\n\nCareer\nCollette made her television debut in 1988 on a comedy, variety show Blah Blah Blah as a singer. Her first acting role was in 1990, a guest appearance as Tracy, on the Seven Network drama series A Country Practice Season 10, Episode 31, \"The Sting: Part 1\". Her first professional theatre role was as Debbie in Operation Holy Mountain in May of that year at Q Theatre, Penrith. Frank Barnes of Journal of the N.S.W Public School Teachers Federation noticed, \"Collette is simply amazing in her professional debut as the girl with cerebral palsy.\" She joined the Sydney Theatre Company and, from December 1990 to February 1991, appeared in A Little Night Music at the Drama Theatre, Sydney Opera House. She performed Cordelia in King Lear (March 1994) and was also in stage productions at the Belvoir Street Theatre, directed by Rush.\n\n1990–1999: Early Work and Breakthrough\nCollette made her television debut in 1988 on a comedy, variety show Blah Blah Blah as a singer.

She performed Cordelia in King Lear (March 1994) and was also in stage productions at the Belvoir Street Theatre, directed by Rush.\n\n1999–2004: The Sixth Sense and Broadway\nWhen Collette received M Night Shyamalan's script for The Sixth Sense (1999), she feared it would be a \"formulaic Hollywood action drama\". However, she was moved by the story and agreed to audition, winning the role over other actors, including Marisa Tomei. She portrayed Lynn Sear, a mother struggling to raise her son Cole (Haley Joel Osment) who communicates with ghosts. Gary Thompson of The Philadelphia Inquirer observed, \"the scene in the car when Cole divulges his secret is so riveting... and it's so well-acted by Osment and Collette.\" He added, \"she'd become the greatest screen weeper of her generation.\" The Sixth Sense grossed US$670 million on a budget of US$40 million and became the second-highest-grossing film of 1999. It gathered six Academy Award nominations including Collette's for Best Supporting Actress. She reflected, \"There was some definite feeling we all had that it was going to somehow be special... It did really well and has been loved by a lot of people.\"\n\n2005–2011: Supporting Roles and United States of Tara\nCollette's only film in 2005, In Her Shoes, was a comedy drama about the relationship between two sisters (Rose and Maggie Feller) and their estranged grandmother, co-starring Cameron Diaz and Shirley MacLaine.

She played Shaz, a hitchhiker who is hired as a nanny to take care of five mentally ill sisters. Despite giving the film a negative review, Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times said that the actor \"rips into her woolly role as if channeling a leftover personality from her United States of Tara days.\" Luke Buckmaster of Crikey called her \"charismatic and all-inhabiting.\" She received her third AACTA Best Actress nomination for the role. Later in the year, she played Peggy, a supporting role in the biographical drama, Hitchcock. Deborah Ross, writing for The Spectator, provided an unenthusiastic review and wrote, \"Hitchcock wastes many of its cast members - particularly Toni Collette.\"\n\n2018–present: Mainstream Films and Continued Praise\nIn 2018, Collette gave what some critics considered to be one of her best performances in the horror film Hereditary, in which she played Annie Graham, the matriarch of a family haunted by the supernatural following the death of her mother.

March, he performed on the final day of the Dripping Springs Reunion, a three-day country music festival aimed by its producers to be an annual event Despite the failure to reach the expected

gut-string guitar\" [146] and his \"nasal voice and jazzy, off-center phrasing\", [145] has been responsible for his wide appeal, and has made him a \"vital icon in country music\", influencing the \"new country, new traditionalist, and alternative country movements of the 1980s and 1990s\" [145]\n\n\nGuitars\nIn 1969, the Baldwin company gave Nelson an amplifier and guitar with their \"Prismatone\" pickup During a show in Helotes, Texas, Nelson left the guitar on the floor of the stage, and it was later stepped on by a drunk man [147]\nHe sent it to be repaired in Nashville by

unseen for $750 and named it after Roy Rogers' horse \"Trigger\" [148] The next year Nelson rescued the guitar from his burning ranch [149] [150]\n\n\nPolitical views and activism\nNelson is vocal supporter of a number of causes Along with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, he set up Farm Aid in 1985 to assist and increase awareness of the importance of family farms, after Bob Dylan's comments

Bray to the accounting firm Price Waterhouse To repay the debt Reshen had created with the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped [209] While the IRS disallowed his deductions for 1980, 1981 and 1982 (at a time that Nelson's income multiplied), [209] due to penalties and interests, the debt increased by the end of the decade [210]\n\n\nLegacy\nNelson is

Singles Chart dated January 21, 2021, earning 2.407 million total streams on January 12, 2021, alone The song broke the record for highest single-day streams in British history for a non-Christmas song, surpassing the previous record held by Ed Sheeran's \"Shape of You\" (2017) With 95,000 units moved in its first week, \"Drivers License\" also had the biggest opening week for a number one debut single on the UK Singles Chart since Zayn Malik's \"Pillowtalk\" (2016) \"Drivers License\" spent nine weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart, becoming the longest run at the top for a solo female artist since Tones and I' s \"Dance Monkey\" spent eleven consecutive weeks at the top in 2019 Spurred by \"Drivers License\", \"All I Want\" reached number 32, marking her second top-40 entry in the UK [74] [75] [76]\n\n\nMusic video\nThe video, directed by Matthew Dillon Cohen, [80] adopts a vignette aesthetic and depicts Rodrigo's healing from heartbreak She receives her driver's license in the video, but instead of going to her old lover's house like she used to dream of, she finds herself aimlessly cruising suburban side streets Rodrigo reminisces about moments from her brief relationship At the beginning of the video, she is embraced by the happy memories only, but eventually, all the toxic traits of her ex-partner confront her The video received positive comments from critics for its visuals [28] [3]\n\n\nImpact and legacy\nWhen we were talking about the audience that  [Rodrigo] had prior to the release—that's a very young, female, engaged audience So they really sort of sparked the flame But now what you have is it traveling well beyond that audience And obviously social media platforms have helped that, but I think just word of mouth This is a song you're talking about with everyone right now Everyone's listening to it, everyone's obsessing over it.\n\nUsage in media\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Sour [14]\n\n\nTrack listing\nCredits adapted

children of Maria Elisabeth (Marie) Ponsie and Adam van Kuijk [6] His Catholic father, a former military man of 12 years, was working as a deliveryman for catalogs when Parker was born He died at the age of 59 when Parker was 16 \n\n\nCareer\nParker first became involved in the music industry in 1938 as a promoter, working with popular crooner Gene Austin whose career was at a low point, despite having sold 86 million records since 1924 and earned over $17 million Austin had spent much of his fortune on extravagant living and his popularity had been eclipsed by other singers such as Bing Crosby Parker found his career transition smooth, and he used his carnival experience to sell tickets and attract crowds to Austin's concerts [11] While he was a successful promoter, Parker now wanted to move into management [11]\n\n\nEarly talent management (1938–1954)\nParker first became involved in the music industry in 1938 as a promoter, working with popular crooner Gene Austin whose career was at a low point, despite having sold 86 million records since 1924 and earned over $17 million Austin had spent much of his fortune on extravagant living and his popularity had been eclipsed by other singers such as Bing Crosby Parker found his career transition smooth, and he used his carnival experience to sell tickets and attract crowds to Austin's concerts [11] While he was a successful promoter, Parker now wanted to move into management [11]\n\n\nMeeting Elvis Presley\nIn early 1955, Parker heard about Elvis Presley Presley had a singing style different from the current trend, and Parker became interested in the future of this musical sound At that time, Parker believed Presley to be black At this time, Presley was singing in a trio called The Blue Moon Boys, with guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black Moore became Presley's first manager at the encouragement of Sun Records owner Sam Phillips, who was worried about unscrupulous promoters taking advantage of Presley However, Moore and Black were excluded when Presley signed a recording contract with Phillips Phillips told them to make a separate deal with Elvis According to Moore, Presley agreed to take 50%, with Moore and Black splitting the other 50% A one-year management contract with Presley gave Moore a 10% commission, which he never took The contract, dated July 12, 1954, eight days after their first recording session, was signed by Presley and his parents When the contract expired, the Memphis radio personality Bob Neal stepped in and made a deal with Phillips to become Presley's manager By this point, Moore and Black had no contractual ties to either Phillips or Presley [16]\n\n\nSigning Elvis (1956–1957)\nOn March 26, 1956, after Presley's management contract with Neal expired, Presley signed a contract making Parker his exclusive representative [21] Later, when Hank Snow asked Parker about the status of their contract with Presley, Parker told him: \"You don't have any contract with Elvis Presley Elvis is signed exclusively to the Colonel.\" [22]\n\n\nElvis in the Army (1958–1960)\nRegardless of Parker and Presley's success, Parker was still struggling to believe that Presley's career would last longer than a year or two [34] Parker had seen many acts come and go during his earlier years in management and felt that it would be foolish to believe that Presley, despite being Parker's most successful act to date, would be any different In January 1958, Presley received his draft notice from the United States Army [35] Presley was upset about the potential negative effect accepting the draft could have on his career, but Parker was secretly overjoyed [34]\n\n\nElvis returns (1960–1965)\nFor Presley's return in March 1960, Parker arranged for a train to take him from Washington, D.C., to Memphis, with stops so that fans could see their idol in person [37] If Parker was still worried about Presley's having lost his fame, he was disabused of this notion when he witnessed the turnout along the route [38]\n\n\nDead ends (1966–1967)\nFor the remainder of the 1960s, Presley starred in films that relied heavily on exotic locations and mundane songs, and he was tied into contracts that he could not escape Parker did not appear to care if the films were good or bad, but only about the profits [41] When Presley complained to him that he wanted better scripts, Parker reminded him of his lavish lifestyle and that risking $1 million a year for doing practically no work was dangerous Presley's career stagnated while artists like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and The Beach Boys dominated the charts Later, in a 1983 interview, Parker admitted that after 1966, the income from Presley films and soundtracks had dramatically declined  [43]\n\n\nLive performance comeback (1968–1972)\nIt took the 1968 television special Elvis, which was sponsored by Singer sewing machines, and a subsequent series of recording sessions in Memphis, Tennessee, that included songs such as \"Suspicious Minds\" and \"In the Ghetto\", to restore Presley's musical reputation Steve Binder, the producer of the television special, put forward the idea of Presley singing his old hits Binder also thought of the idea of Presley performing the staged section with his old band, Scotty Moore and D J Fontana; this had been inspired by a post-rehearsal informal jam in Presley's dressing room Presley did not usually stand up against Parker, but he knew that this TV show was his one chance at a proper comeback, and with Binder backing him, Presley told Parker he was doing it \"Binder's way\" Their instincts were proven right; the TV special proved to be an enormous hit, and the released album featuring performances from the special became a best-seller After the special, Parker managed Presley's return to live performance, including brief U.S tours and many engagements in Las Vegas Following the success of Presley's Las Vegas return, Parker signed a contract with the International Hotel to guarantee Presley would play a month-long engagement for $125,000 a week ($1,095,215 in 2023 dollars [10]), an unheard-of sum at the time During this part of Presley's career, Parker and Presley agreed to a 50/50 \"partnership\", which, with Parker controlling merchandising and other non-music related items, resulted in Parker earning more than his client [46]\n\n\n1973–1974\nIn May 1973, in an attempt to deal with Presley's growing dependence on prescription drugs, Parker and Presley's father, Vernon, attempted to cut off his drug supply [53] They hired private detectives to find out where the drugs were coming from and successfully stopped any more from reaching Presley [53] However, Presley found other doctors to meet his demands [53] In later years, several of Presley's inner circles would tell of how difficult it was to persuade Presley to quit the drugs [53] As well as being their employer and paying their wages, he was also their main source of drug access for themselves [53] Presley's main doctor, George C Nichopoulos, often replaced Presley's medication with placebos in an attempt to wean him off the drugs [53] This trick would be successful for a short time, but when Presley discovered the trick, he found himself other doctors [53] Author Alanna Nash suggests the possibility that Parker didn't intervene more because he may not have known how to handle the situation [54] In Nash's book, The Colonel, she writes: \"In the days before the Betty Ford Clinic, the Colonel didn't know where to take him for discreet, effective help and loathed risking the loss of work if the truth got out\" [54]\n\n\n1974–1977\nIn February 1974, during his engagement in Las Vegas, Presley, along with Parker, met with Barbra Streisand and Jon Peters [56] They discussed the possibility of Presley co-starring with Streisand in a remake of the film A Star Is Born [56] Seeing it as a chance to finally be taken seriously as an actor, Presley agreed to take the role if the contracts could be worked out According to Presley's friend, Jerry Schilling, Presley was excited about the opportunity to take on a new challenge [56] Streisand's production company, First Artists, offered Presley a salary of $500,000 ($2,831,169 in 2023 dollars [10]) and 10% of the profits [56] Parker, who had always dealt with Presley's film contracts and viewed the offer as a starting bid to earning more money, instead asked for a salary of $1 million ($5,662,338 in 2023 dollars [10]), 50% of the profits, plus another $100,000 ($566,234 in 2023 dollars [10]) for expenses and spoke of needing to arrange details of a soundtrack deal [56] First Artists, not used to such huge demands, didn't put forward a counteroffer and decided instead to offer the role, along with the original salary offer, to Kris Kristofferson, who accepted [56] Parker later claimed that Presley had asked him to make the contract so demanding so that they would not offer him the part, although many of Presley's friends have contradicted Parker's statement because they had said Presley was furious at losing the role [56]\n\n\n1977: Presley's death\nWhen Presley died on August 16, 1977, one day before he was due to go on tour, some accounts suggest Parker acted as if nothing had happened [60] Other accounts suggest he slumped in his chair at his office, muttered, \"Oh, dear God\", and then quickly phoned Vernon Presley, where Parker advised Presley's father that his son's image needed to be protected This would be more in keeping with Parker's own interests [61]\n\n\n1978–1997: After Elvis\nFollowing Presley's death, Parker set up a licensing operation with Factors Etc Inc, to control Presley merchandise and keep a steady income supporting his estate [4] It was later revealed that Presley owned 22% of the company, Parker owned 56%, and the final 22% was made up of various business associates [63] Due to an ill-advised agreement between Parker and Presley that gave RCA sole ownership of all his recording royalties prior to 1973, the estate was relying heavily on the income from Factors Etc [4] However, because Parker was still entitled to 50% of all Presley's income, and after taxes were taken off, the overall amount going towards the upkeep of the estate was less than $1 million a year [4]\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nAs Presley's fame grew, the public became interested in Parker as well For some time, Parker lied about his childhood, claiming that he was born in Huntington, West Virginia in the early 1900s—attempting to pass off his Dutch accent as a Southern accent He claimed he had run away from home at an early age to join a circus owned by an uncle, then served in the U.S Army prior to his involvement as a music manager The truth about his early years was revealed in 1960 when one of Parker's sisters, Nel Dankers-van Kuijk, living in the Netherlands, recognized him in photographs standing next to Presley [65]\n\n\nMarriage\nIn 1935, while traveling with a circus, Parker met and married a 27-year-old woman named Marie Francis Mott [70] Marie was one of six children, had been married twice before and had a son from her first marriage [70] Unbeknownst to Parker, she had a second son from her first marriage but had given him up for adoption at birth due to his disability, a club foot [71] Some suggested that Parker married Marie to disguise his illegal status in the United States; a marriage to a U.S citizen with a child could help him bury his past in a \"ready-made family\" There is no proof that anything other than romance led to their marriage [70]\n\n\nGambling\nMany Parker biographers, including Dirk Vellenga and Alanna Nash, have stated that Parker's gambling habit began to get out of control in the mid-1960s During the 1960s, with his wife's health deteriorating and Presley's career struggling, Parker found an escape in gambling at Las Vegas casinos Fans and biographers alike believe that one of the main reasons Parker signed Presley to a Vegas hotel in 1969 for his live comeback was to help cover losses at their casino He would often spend 12–14 hours at a time gambling in the casinos, betting large sums It is believed that Parker lost at least $1 million a year from gambling At the time of Presley's death in 1977, it was suspected that Parker owed the Las Vegas Hilton over $30 million ($150,840,198 in 2023 dollars [10]) in gambling losses After a lifetime that saw him earn in excess of $100 million, [75] Parker's estate was worth barely $1 million when he died [4]\n\n\nDeath\nParker made his last public appearances in 1994 [78] By that time he was so stricken with diabetes, gout, and other health problems that he could barely leave his home.\n\n\nPortrayals and popular culture\nParker has been portrayed by:\n\n\nFilm\nParker has been portrayed

Austin had sold 86 million records since 1924 and earned over $17 million, but his career was at a low point due to his extravagant living and declining popularity. Parker used his carnival experience to sell tickets and attract crowds to Austin's concerts, and he eventually transitioned into management.\n\nEarly Talent Management (1938-1954)\nParker's first major success came when he managed Gene Austin, who was struggling to regain his popularity. Parker's experience in the carnival industry helped him to promote Austin's concerts and attract new fans. He also used his connections to book Austin into top venues and to secure lucrative recording contracts. Despite Austin's eventual decline in popularity, Parker's management skills and connections helped him to secure a steady income.\n\nMeeting Elvis Presley\nIn early 1955, Parker heard about Elvis Presley, a young singer from Memphis who was making waves in the music scene. At the time, Presley was singing in a trio called The Blue Moon Boys, with guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black. Moore became Presley's first manager, but he eventually lost his contract to Parker. Parker was impressed by Presley's unique sound and his potential for stardom, and he saw an opportunity to make a big profit by managing him.\n\nSigning Elvis (1956-1957)\nOn March 26, 1956, Presley signed a contract making Parker his exclusive representative. Parker was instrumental in securing Presley's recording contract with RCA Records and in negotiating his lucrative film deals.

Parker was secretly overjoyed by the news, as he saw it as an opportunity to take a break from Presley's demanding schedule and to let him rest. During Presley's time in the army, Parker continued to manage his affairs and to secure new deals for him.\n\nElvis Returns (1960-1965)\nFor Presley's return in March 1960, Parker arranged for a train to take him from Washington, D.C., to Memphis, with stops so that fans could see their idol in person.

$500,000 ($2,831,169 in 2023 dollars [10]) and 10% of the profits [56] Parker, who had always dealt with Presley's film contracts and viewed the offer as a starting bid to earning more money, instead asked for a salary of $1 million ($5,662,338 in 2023 dollars [10]), 50% of the profits, plus another $100,000 ($566,234 in 2023 dollars [10]) for expenses and spoke of needing to arrange details of a soundtrack deal [56] First Artists, not used to such huge demands, didn't put forward a counteroffer and decided instead to offer the role, along with the original salary offer, to Kris Kristofferson, who accepted [56] Parker later claimed that Presley had asked him to make the contract so demanding so that they would not offer him the part, although many of Presley's friends have contradicted Parker's statement because they had said Presley was furious at losing the role [56]\n\n\n1977: Presley's death\nWhen Presley died on August 16, 1977, one day before he was due to go on tour, some accounts suggest Parker acted as if nothing had happened [60] Other accounts suggest he slumped in his chair at his office, muttered, \"Oh, dear God\", and then quickly phoned Vernon Presley, where Parker advised Presley's father that his son's image needed to be protected This would be more in keeping with Parker's own interests [61]\n\n\n1978–1997: After Elvis\nFollowing Presley's death, Parker set up a licensing operation with Factors Etc Inc, to control Presley merchandise and keep a steady income supporting his estate [4] It was later revealed that Presley owned 22% of the company, Parker owned 56%, and the final 22% was made up of various business associates [63] Due to an ill-advised agreement between Parker and Presley that gave RCA sole ownership of all his recording royalties prior to 1973, the estate was relying heavily on the income from Factors Etc [4] However, because Parker was still entitled to 50% of all Presley's income, and after taxes were taken off, the overall amount going towards the upkeep of the estate was less than $1 million a year [4]\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nAs Presley's fame grew, the public became interested in Parker as well For some time, Parker lied about his childhood, claiming that he was born in Huntington, West Virginia in the early 1900s—attempting to pass off his Dutch accent as a Southern accent He claimed he had run away from home at an early age to join a circus owned by an uncle, then served in the U.S Army prior to his involvement as a music manager The truth about his early years was revealed in 1960 when one of Parker's sisters, Nel Dankers-van Kuijk, living in the Netherlands, recognized him in photographs standing next to Presley [65]\n\n\nMarriage\nIn 1935, while traveling with a circus, Parker met and married a 27-year-old woman named Marie Francis Mott [70] Marie was one of six children, had been married twice before and had a son from her first marriage [70] Unbeknownst to Parker, she had a second son from her first marriage but had given him up for adoption at birth due to his disability, a club foot [71] Some suggested that Parker married Marie to disguise his illegal status in the United States; a marriage to a U.S citizen with a child could help him bury his past in a \"ready-made family\" There is no proof that anything other than romance led to their marriage [70]\n\n\nGambling\nMany Parker biographers, including Dirk Vellenga and Alanna Nash, have stated that Parker's gambling habit began to get out of control in the mid-1960s During the 1960s, with his wife's health deteriorating and Presley's career struggling, Parker found an escape in gambling at Las Vegas casinos Fans and biographers alike believe that one of the main reasons Parker signed Presley to a Vegas hotel in 1969 for his live comeback was to help cover losses at their casino He would often spend 12–14 hours at a time gambling in the casinos, betting large sums It is believed that Parker lost at least $1 million a year from gambling At the time of Presley's death in 1977, it was suspected that Parker owed the Las Vegas Hilton over $30 million ($150,840,198 in 2023 dollars [10]) in gambling losses After a lifetime that saw him earn in excess of $100 million, [75] Parker's estate was worth barely $1 million when he died [4]\n\n\nDeath\nParker made his last public appearances in 1994 [78] By that time he was so stricken with diabetes, gout, and other health problems that he could barely leave his home.\n\n\nPortrayals and popular culture\nParker has been

the apparent use of  an anti-Semitic trope was criticized as a dog-whistle reference to Ossoff's Jewish heritage [80] [81] [82] The ad featured Ossoff's image next to that of Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who is also Jewish, and said Democrats are trying to \"buy Georgia,\" with a link to raise funds for Perdue's campaign [80] [81] [82] His campaign pulled the ad after receiving criticism, [82] saying it was an \"inadvertent error\" and that his design firm had applied a filter that distorted the image [80] [81]\n\n\n2022 Georgia gubernatorial election\n\n\nPolitical positions\nPerdue rejects the scientific consensus on climate change [111] He had criticized the Environmental Protection Agency and supported Trump's appointment of Scott Pruitt as EPA administrator, saying in 2017, \"Outside of eliminating the EPA altogether, Scott Pruitt is the next best thing.\" [112] Perdue was one of 22 Republican senators to sign a letter to Trump urging him to withdraw the U.S from the Paris Agreement [113] [114] As of 2020, Perdue lives in a private beachfront community that is building sea walls to combat sea level rise, a known effect of climate change [115]\n\n\nEnvironment and climate change\nPerdue rejects the scientific consensus on climate change [111] He had criticized the Environmental Protection Agency and supported Trump's appointment of Scott Pruitt as EPA administrator, saying in 2017, \"Outside of eliminating the EPA altogether, Scott Pruitt is the next best thing.\" [112] Perdue was one of 22 Republican senators to sign a letter to Trump urging him to withdraw the U.S from the Paris Agreement [113] [114] As of 2020, Perdue lives in a private beachfront community that is building sea walls to combat sea level rise, a known effect of climate change [115]\n\n\nDonald Trump\nPerdue was a close ally of Trump while in the Senate [116] [117] Some of Perdue's only public criticism of Trump centered on tariffs Perdue was initially reluctant to support Trump's proposed tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, but came to support them [116] [118]\n\n\nEconomy\nIn December 2017, Perdue voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act He voted for the 2017 budget, which could add as much as $1.5 trillion to deficits over ten years, because he said the tax cuts could lead to more revenue due to the economic growth they would encourage [126]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn March 2017, Perdue co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, a bill that would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government [131] [132]\n\n\nHealth care\nPerdue opposed the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and voted to repeal it [137] [138] In 2017, he supported replacing Obamacare with the Better Care Reconciliation Act The Congressional Budget Office projected that 22 million fewer Americans would be insured by 2026 with this bill than if Obamacare remained The Urban Institute projected that the Better Care Reconciliation Act would have resulted in 376,000 more Georgians lacking health insurance Ultimately, no measure to replace Obamacare in 2017 succeeded [139]\n\n\nImmigration\nIn 2017, Perdue and Tom Cotton co-sponsored the RAISE Act, an immigration reductionist proposal that would cut legal immigration to the United States by 50% over 10 years, restrict the family reunification part of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, eliminate the diversity visa lottery, and create a points-based immigration system that would favor skilled immigrants [143]\n\n\nEducation\nPerdue opposed the Common Core plan, which Georgia Republican leaders adopted in 2010, and then turned against Perdue said he supported \"the original intent\" of Common Core but took issue with \"the details\" and \"how it's going to be administered,\" saying \"Common Core has become overreaching and should be abandoned.\" [145]\n\n\nSame-sex marriage\nPerdue opposed same-sex marriage [146] After the Supreme Court ruled it constitutional in 2015, he co-sponsored legislation to allow federal contractors and employees to oppose same-sex marriage on the grounds of moral or religious convictions [146] [147]\n\n\nPersonal life\nPerdue married Bonnie Dunn in August 1972 [148] The couple lives in Sea Island, Georgia [149] They had a daughter who died in infancy [150] and two sons, David A Perdue III and Blake Perdue, as well as three grandchildren [22] [149]\n\n\nElectoral history\n\n\n2014 Senate election\n\n\n2020 Senate election\n\n\n2022 Georgia gubernatorial election\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

His rise to power and subsequent arrest and imprisonment have been the subject of numerous investigations, books, and films.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMiguel Ángel Félix Gallardo was born on a ranch in Bellavista, on the outskirts of Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico. He graduated from high school and studied business in college, but it was his work as a Mexican Federal Judicial Police agent that laid the foundation for his future career as a drug trafficker. Félix Gallardo worked as a bodyguard for the governor of Sinaloa state, Leopoldo Sánchez Celis, whose connections helped him build his own drug trafficking organization. He was also the godfather of Sánchez Celis' son, Rodolfo, which further solidified his position in the community.\n\n**Connections to Colombian Cartels**\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Colombian cartels began to shift their focus from Florida, where drug interdiction efforts had increased, to Mexico as their primary trans-shipment point. Félix Gallardo saw an opportunity to capitalize on this shift and formed alliances with the Colombian cartels, which helped him expand his operations and increase his profits. This collaboration allowed him to tap into the Colombian cartels' vast networks and resources, making him one of the most powerful drug traffickers in Mexico.\n\n**Murder of DEA Agent Kiki Camarena**\n\nIn 1984, DEA special agent Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena was assigned to the Administration's resident agency in Guadalajara. Camarena discovered cartel marijuana plantations in Zacatecas state and, through informants, uncovered a massive 1,000-hectare (≈2,500-acre) marijuana plantation known as \"Rancho Búfalo\" in Chihuahua. The plantation, valued at US$8 billion annually, was protected by Mexican DFS intelligence agents and local police. In a daring raid, Mexican soldiers, backed by helicopters, destroyed the plantation as part of \"Operation Godfather.\" The operation was a major blow to Félix Gallardo's organization, but he managed to maintain his grip on the market.\n\n**Arrest**\n\nFélix Gallardo kept a low profile and, in 1987, moved with his family to Guadalajara. He was arrested on April 8, 1989, and charged by the authorities in Mexico and the United States with the kidnapping and murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena, as well as racketeering, drug smuggling, and multiple violent crimes. His arrest marked the end of his reign as the leader of the Guadalajara Cartel.\n\n**Incarceration**\n\nFélix Gallardo was initially sentenced to 40 years of prison, but in 2017, a retrial sentenced him to an additional 37 years. While incarcerated, Félix Gallardo remained one of Mexico's major traffickers, maintaining his organization via mobile phone. His ability to continue his operations from behind bars was a testament to his cunning and influence.\n\n**Memoirs**\n\nIn 2008, investigative journalist Diego Enrique Osorno was able to contact Félix Gallardo through his 13-year-old son. Félix Gallardo secretly wrote about his life and passed the hand-written notes to Osorno. The memoirs, which included narrative about his arrest and presentation before police, explained a bit of his family tree and jumped from one topic to another. Selections of the 35 pages were published in the Mexican magazine Gatopardo, with background by the journalist.\n\n**Family**\n\nUpon his arrest, at least nine of Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo's nieces and nephews took over different roles within the organization to form the Arellano Félix Organization, also known as the Tijuana Cartel. This marked a significant shift in the organization's leadership and operations, but Félix Gallardo's influence remained strong.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nFélix Gallardo's life and career have been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries. His rise to power and subsequent arrest have captivated audiences and investigators alike, making him one of the most infamous figures in the history of Mexican organized crime.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Guadalajara Cartel\n* Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo's nieces and nephews\n* Arellano Félix Organization\n* Tijuana Cartel\n* Leopoldo Sánchez Celis\n* Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena\n* DEA\n* Mexican Federal Judicial Police", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Miguel_Ángel_Félix_Gallardo\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nBorn on a ranch in Bellavista, on the outskirts of Culiacán, Sinaloa, Félix Gallardo graduated from high school and studied business in college He took a job as a Mexican Federal Judicial Police agent [1] He worked as a family bodyguard for the governor of Sinaloa state Leopoldo Sánchez Celis, whose political connections helped Félix Gallardo to build his drug trafficking organization He was also the godfather of Sánchez \nCelis' son, Rodolfo [2] [3] [4]\n\n\nConnections to Colombian cartels\nIn the early 1980s, drug interdiction efforts increased throughout Florida, which was then the major shipping destination for illegal drug traffickers As a result, the Colombian cartels began to utilize Mexico as their primary trans-shipment point.\n\n\nMurder of DEA agent Kiki Camarena\nIn 1980, DEA special agent Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena was assigned to the Administration's resident agency in Guadalajara Working through informants, Camarena discovered cartel marijuana plantations in Zacatecas state The plantations were raided and destroyed [7] In 1984, Mexican soldiers, backed by helicopters, destroyed an even larger 1,000 hectare (≈2,500 acre) marijuana plantation known as \"Rancho Búfalo\" in Chihuahua, known to be protected by Mexican DFS intelligence agents, as part of \"Operation Godfather\" Thousands of farmers worked the fields at Rancho Búfalo, and the annual production was later valued at US$8 billion All of this took place with the knowledge of local police, politicians, and the military [2] [8]\n\n\nArrest\nFélix Gallardo kept a low profile and, in 1987, moved with his family to Guadalajara He was arrested in Mexico on April 8, 1989, [12] and was charged by the authorities in Mexico and the United States with the kidnapping and murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena, as well as racketeering, drug smuggling, and multiple violent crimes [13]\n\n\nIncarceration\nFélix Gallardo was initially sentenced to 40 years of prison After serving 28 years, a 2017 retrial sentenced him to an additional 37 years [14] [15] While incarcerated, Félix Gallardo  remained one of Mexico's major traffickers, maintaining his organization via mobile phone [4] [16]\n\n\nMemoirs\nIn 2008, the investigative journalist Diego Enrique Osorno was able to contact Félix Gallardo through the latter's 13-year-old son Félix Gallardo secretly wrote about his life and passed the hand-written notes to Osorno The memoirs include narrative about his arrest and presentation before police, and explains a bit of his family tree, jumping from one topic to another [28]  Selections of the 35 pages [29] were published in the Mexican magazine Gatopardo, with background by the journalist.\n\n\nFamily\nUpon his arrest at least nine of Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo's nieces and nephews took over different roles within the organization to form the Arellano Félix Organization, also known as the Tijuana Cartel.\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nSee also\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

writers, Stern found himself under pressure to have Spider-Man fight the Green Goblin again, but did not wish to bring Norman Osborn or Bart Hamilton back from the dead, have Harry Osborn be the Green Goblin again, or create another Green Goblin Stern instead created a new concept as heir to the Goblin legacy and developed the Hobgoblin [5] Stern recounts that he directed Romita to base the costume on the Green Goblin's but to make it \"a little more medieval-looking\", while Romita asserts that he was given no direction beyond using the Green Goblin as a basis Both agree, however, that the costume was chiefly Romita's design [6]\n\n\nFictional character biography\nEdward \"Ned\" Leeds was a reporter working for the Daily Bugle In a 1987, he is revealed to be the first Hobgoblin, before

underworld into thinking that he was the Hobgoblin, before Kingsley took back over the role [10] After a clone of the character was introduced in Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy, Leeds is revived in a 2021 storyline showing that, under the influence of Kingsley's brainwashing, he ingested a copy of Osborn's Goblin formula which revived him shortly after his initial assassination, before he went into hiding [11] In a 2022 storyline, Ned and Kingsley are brainwashed by the Queen Goblin into both resuming their roles as Hobgoblins once more [8] Synergetic with his MCU adaptation as a

He was created by writer Roger Stern and artist John Romita Jr. and first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #238 (March 1983).\n\n**Publication History**\n\nThe Hobgoblin was created by writer Roger Stern and artist John Romita Jr for The Amazing Spider-Man #238 (March 1983). Like other writers, Stern found himself under pressure to have Spider-Man fight the Green Goblin again, but did not wish to bring Norman Osborn or Bart Hamilton back from the dead, have Harry Osborn be the Green Goblin again, or create another Green Goblin. Stern instead created a new concept as heir to the Goblin legacy and developed the Hobgoblin. Stern recounts that he directed Romita to base the costume on the Green Goblin's but to make it \"a little more medieval-looking\", while Romita asserts that he was given no direction beyond using the Green Goblin as a basis. Both agree, however, that the costume was chiefly Romita's design.\n\n**Fictional Character Biography**\n\nEdward \"Ned\" Leeds was a reporter working for the Daily Bugle. In a 1987, he is revealed to be the first Hobgoblin, before being murdered by the Foreigner. Ten years later in 1997, Leeds is retroactively established to have been brainwashed by Roderick Kingsley to act as a stand-in on many occasions and fool the underworld into thinking that he was the Hobgoblin, before Kingsley took back over the role. After a clone of the character was introduced in Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy, Leeds is revived in a 2021 storyline showing that, under the influence of Kingsley's brainwashing, he ingested a copy of Osborn's Goblin formula which revived him shortly after his initial assassination, before he went into hiding. In a 2022 storyline, Ned and Kingsley are brainwashed by the Queen Goblin into both resuming their roles as Hobgoblins once more. Synergetic with his MCU adaptation as a sorcerer in the film Spider-Man: No Way Home, in Symbiote Spider-Man: Alien Reality, Ned's Hobgoblin is revealed to have trained as a sorcerer under Baron Mordo in the art of reality-altering chaos magic.\n\n**Ned Leeds**\n\nEdward \"Ned\" Leeds was a reporter working for the Daily Bugle.

Donovan (impersonating the Hobgoblin) attacks New York City but Spider-Man eventually confronts and unmasks him. Spider-Man sees his (scarred) face and recognizes Lefty.

He uses concussion and incendiary Jack O'Lanterns, wraith-shaped smoke and gas-emitting bombs, bat shaped razor-edged throwing blades, and gloves woven with micro-circuited power conducting filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity. He wore a shoulder bag to carry his small, portable weaponry.\n\n**Alternative Versions**\n\nDuring the \"Secret Wars\" storyline in the pages of Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows, the Roderick Kingsley version of Hobgoblin appears as a member of Regent's Sinister Six where they are tasked to hunt down Spider-Man.

After a fight against both Spider-Girl and her father, he came close to victory, but at the end his only success lay in killing the Venom symbiote, and also in escaping without a trace.

He is known for his military campaigns, his marriage to the daughter of Bishop Aldhun, and his eventual submission to the Viking king Cnut.\n\n**Accomplishments**\n\nUhtred's life began with a significant event in the history of Durham. In 995, according to Symeon of Durham, the remains of St Cuthbert were transferred from Chester-le-Street to Durham. Uhtred went to Durham with his monks to clear the site of the new cathedral, which was founded by Bishop Aldhun. During this time, Uhtred married Aldhun's daughter, Ecgfrida, probably at about this time. From his marriage, he received several estates that had belonged to the church.\n\nUhtred's marriage to Ecgfrida not only brought him wealth and power but also solidified his position as a prominent nobleman in Northumbria. He was likely involved in the governance of the kingdom, and his military campaigns demonstrate his bravery and strategic thinking. Uhtred's military campaigns were often undertaken in response to the Viking invasions of England, which had a significant impact on the country's history during the 10th century.\n\n**Death**\n\nUhtred's later life was marked by conflict and turmoil. In 1016, he campaigned with Æthelred's son Edmund Ironside in Cheshire and the surrounding shires. While Uhtred was away from his lands, Sweyn's son, Cnut, invaded Yorkshire. Cnut's forces were too strong for Uhtred to fight, and so Uhtred did homage to him as King of England.\n\nUhtred's submission to Cnut was a significant event in English history, marking the beginning of the Danish rule in England. Cnut's invasion of Yorkshire and Uhtred's subsequent submission demonstrate the power and influence of the Viking kings during this period. Despite his submission, Uhtred remained a prominent figure in Northumbria, and his descendants continued to play an important role in the kingdom's governance.\n\n**Marriages and Issue**\n\nUhtred married three times, each marriage producing children. The details of his children are not well-documented, but it is known that they played an important role in the history of Northumbria. Uhtred's sons, in particular, were involved in the military campaigns and governance of the kingdom, demonstrating their father's influence and legacy.\n\nUhtred's marriages were likely arranged to secure alliances and strengthen his position as a nobleman. His first marriage to Ecgfrida brought him wealth and power, while his subsequent marriages likely secured additional alliances and influence. Despite the limited information available, it is clear that Uhtred's marriages had a significant impact on his life and the history of Northumbria.\n\n**Descendants**\n\nThe killing of Uhtred by Thurbrand the Hold started a blood feud that lasted for many years and is the subject of the historical work, De obsessione Dunelmi. Uhtred's son Ealdred subsequently avenged his father by killing Thurbrand, but Ealdred in turn was killed by Thurbrand's son, Carl. The blood feud that followed Uhtred's death demonstrates the complexity and violence of medieval society, where family ties and alliances were often used to justify conflict and revenge.\n\nThe descendants of Uhtred continued to play an important role in the history of Northumbria, with many of them involved in the governance and military campaigns of the kingdom. Despite the challenges and conflicts they faced, Uhtred's descendants remained a prominent force in Northumbria, demonstrating their strength and resilience.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nAuthor Bernard Cornwell was inspired to write his series The Saxon Stories after learning he was a descendant of Uhtred the Bold, who is the inspiration behind the series protagonist Lord Uhtred of Bebbanburg. Several events in the series are based on events in the life of Uhtred the Bold, such as the siege of Bebbanburg by the Scots and the severed heads on poles. However, unlike many other characters in the book series who correspond closely to historical figures, the main character Uhtred is fictitious: he lives in the middle of the 9th century—being aged about ten at the battle of York (867)—more than a hundred years before the historical Uhtred the Bold.\n\nThe television series The Last Kingdom and the movie The Last Kingdom: Seven Kings Must Die, which are based on The Saxon Stories, also draw inspiration from Uhtred's life and the history of Northumbria. While the series takes creative liberties with the historical events, it accurately captures the spirit and complexity of medieval society, making it a compelling and engaging watch.\n\nIn conclusion, Uhtred of Bamburgh was a significant figure in the history of Northumbria, known for his military campaigns, his marriage to the daughter of Bishop Aldhun, and his eventual submission to the Viking king Cnut. His descendants continued to play an important role in the kingdom's governance and military campaigns, demonstrating their strength and resilience. The legacy of Uhtred and his descendants can be seen in the historical work De obsessione Dunelmi and the popular series The Saxon Stories, which draw inspiration from his life and the history of Northumbria.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Uhtred_of_Bamburgh\" following this outline:\n\n\nAccomplishments\nIn 995, according to Symeon of Durham, when the remains of St Cuthbert were transferred from Chester-le-Street to Durham, Uhtred went to Durham with his monks to clear the site of the new cathedral The new cathedral was founded by Bishop Aldhun, and Uhtred married Aldhun's daughter, Ecgfrida, probably at about this time From his marriage he received several estates that had belonged to the church [1]\n\n\nDeath\nIn 1016 Uhtred campaigned with Æthelred's son Edmund Ironside in Cheshire and the surrounding shires While Uhtred was away from his lands, Sweyn's son, Cnut, invaded Yorkshire Cnut's forces were too strong for Uhtred to fight, and so Uhtred did homage to him as King of England  \n\n\nMarriages and issue\nUhtred married three times, each marriage produced children.\n\n\nDescendants\nThe killing of Uhtred by Thurbrand the Hold started a blood feud that lasted for many years and is the subject of the historical work, De obsessione Dunelmi Uhtred's son Ealdred subsequently avenged his father by killing Thurbrand, but Ealdred in turn was killed by Thurbrand's son, Carl \n\n\nIn popular culture\nAuthor Bernard Cornwell was inspired to write his series The Saxon Stories after learning he was a descendant of Uhtred the Bold, who is the inspiration behind the series protagonist Lord Uhtred of Bebbanburg [6] [7] Several events in the series are based on events in the life of Uhtred the Bold, such as the siege of Bebbanburg by the Scots and the severed heads on poles; however, unlike many other characters in the book series who correspond closely to historical figures, such as Alfred the Great, Guthrum and King Guthred, the main character Uhtred is fictitious: he lives in the middle of the 9th century—being aged about ten at the battle of York (867)—more than a hundred years before the historical Uhtred the Bold This fictitious Lord Uhtred of Bebbanburg is the protagonist in the television series The Last Kingdom and the movie The Last Kingdom: Seven Kings Must Die, which are based on The Saxon Stories.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion [73] The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007, [210] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market [211] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds [211] GOOG shares split into GOOG class C shares and GOOGL class A shares [212] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG,

strategies\nGoogle uses various tax avoidance strategies On the list of largest technology companies by revenue, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S profits through Ireland and the Netherlands and then to Bermuda Such techniques lower its non-U.S tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in, for instance, the UK is 28 per cent [223] This reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's transfer pricing practices in 2012 [224]\n\n\nCorporate identity\nThe name \"Google\" originated from a misspelling of \"googol\", [230] [231] which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros Page and Brin write in their original paper on PageRank: [36] \"We chose our system name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100 [,] and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines.\" Having found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb \"google\" was added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006, meaning \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.\" [232] [233] Google's mission statement, from the outset, was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\", [234] and its unofficial slogan is \"Don't be evil\" [235] In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: \"Do the right thing\" [236] The original motto was

coalesced in the Reddit online community /r/degoogle [354] The DeGoogle grassroots campaign continues to grow as privacy activists highlight information about Google products, and the associated incursion on personal privacy rights by the company.\n\n\n2022\nIn a 2022 National Labor Relations Board ruling, court documents suggested that Google sponsored a secretive project—Project Vivian—to

The contract has been criticized by shareholders and employees over concerns that the project could lead to human rights abuses against Palestinians, in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the disputed status of Palestinian territories [371] [372] Ariel Koren, a former marketing manager for Google's educational products and an outspoken critic of the project, wrote that Google \"systematically silences Palestinian, Jewish, Arab and Muslim voices concerned about Google's complicity in violations of Palestinian human rights—to the point of formally retaliating against workers

The country's government and judiciary accused the company of undue interference in the congressional debate, saying it could amount to abuse of economic power and ordering the company to change the ad within two hours of notification or face fines of R$1 million (2023) (US$185,528.76) per non-compliance hour. The company then promptly removed the ad.\n\n**2024**\n\nIn March 2024, a former Google software engineer and Chinese national, Linwei Ding, was accused of stealing confidential artificial intelligence information from the company and handing it to Chinese corporations. Ding had allegedly stolen over 500 files from the company over the course of 5 years, having been hired in 2019. Upon discovering Ding had been in contact with Chinese state-owned companies, Google notified the FBI, who carried on the investigation.\n\n**Palestine**\n\nGoogle is also part of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion deal in which the technology companies Google and Amazon will provide Israel and its military with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cloud computing services, including building local cloud sites that will \"keep information within Israel's borders under strict security guidelines.\" The contract has been criticized by shareholders and employees over concerns that the project could lead to human rights abuses against Palestinians, in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the disputed status of Palestinian territories.\n\n**Antitrust, Privacy, and Other Litigation**\n\nOn June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of €2.42 billion from the European Union for \"promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results.\" In January 2020, the French data regulator CNIL imposed a record €50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.\n\n**Fines and Lawsuits**\n\nOn June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of €2.42 billion from the European Union for \"promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results.\" In 2020, the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, asserting that it has illegally maintained its monopoly position in web search and search advertising.\n\n**Russia**\n\nOn October 31, 2024, the Russian government imposed a \"symbolic\" fine of $20 decillion on Google for blocking pro-Russian YouTube channels. In 2022, during the invasion of Ukraine, a Russian court had ordered Google to restore the channels, with penalties doubling every week according to TASS.\n\n**Geolocation**\n\nGoogle has been criticized for continuing to collect location data from users who had turned off location-sharing settings. In 2020, the FBI used a geofence warrant to request data from Google about Android devices near the Seattle Police Officers Guild building following an arson attempt during Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n**Private Browsing Lawsuit**\n\nIn early June 2020, a $5 billion class-action lawsuit was filed against Google by a group of consumers, alleging that Chrome's Incognito browsing mode still collects their user history. The lawsuit became known in March 2021 when a federal judge denied Google's request to dismiss the case, ruling that they must face the group's charges.\n\n**Gender Discrimination Lawsuit**\n\nIn 2017, three women sued Google, accusing the company of violating California's Equal Pay Act by underpaying its female employees. The lawsuit cited the wage gap was around $17,000 and that Google locked women into lower career tracks, leading to smaller salaries and bonuses. In June 2022, Google agreed to pay a $118 million settlement to 15,550 female employees working in California since 2013.\n\n**U.S. Government Contracts**\n\nFollowing media reports about PRISM, the NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.

The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion [73] The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007, [210] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market [211] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional

strategies\nGoogle uses various tax avoidance strategies On the list of largest technology companies by revenue, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S profits through Ireland and the Netherlands and then to Bermuda Such techniques lower its non-U.S tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the

obtain information on the Internet.\" [232] [233] Google's mission statement, from the outset, was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\", [234] and its unofficial slogan is \"Don't be evil\" [235] In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: \"Do the right thing\" [236] The original motto was

{"title": "Hamilton_(musical)", "content": "\nSynopsis\nHamilton narrates Alexander Hamilton's life in two acts, and details among other things his involvement in the American Revolutionary War as an aide-de-camp to George Washington, his marriage to Eliza Schuyler Hamilton, his career as a lawyer and Secretary of the Treasury, and his interactions with Aaron Burr which culminates in their duel at the end of Hamilton's life.\n\n\nAct I\nThe orphan Alexander Hamilton experiences a hard early life, and through his smarts and the charitability of the townsfolks leaves his home, the island of St Croix (\"Alexander Hamilton\") As a student at King's College in New York in 1776, Hamilton meets Aaron Burr, John Laurens, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Hercules Mulligan (\"Aaron Burr, Sir\"), and impresses them with his rhetorical skills (\"My Shot\") The latter three and Hamilton affirm their revolutionary goals to each other, while Burr remains apprehensive (\"The Story of Tonight\") Later, the daughters of the wealthy Philip Schuyler—Peggy, Angelica, and Eliza—go into town and share their opinion on the upcoming revolution (\"The Schuyler Sisters\") Loyalist bishop Samuel Seabury argues against the revolution (\"Farmer Refuted\") and King George III insists on his authority (\"You'll Be Back\") During the New York and New Jersey campaign, Hamilton accepts a position as George Washington's aide-de-camp despite longing for field command (\"Right Hand Man\").\n\n\nAct II\nIn 1789, Thomas Jefferson returns to America from being the U.S ambassador to France, taking up his newfound position as Secretary of State (\"What'd I Miss\") Jefferson and Madison debate Hamilton's financial proposals at a Cabinet meeting Washington tells Hamilton to figure out a compromise to win over Congress (\"Cabinet Battle #1\") Eliza and her family—along with Angelica, back from London—travel upstate during the summer, while Hamilton stays home to work on the compromise (\"Take a Break\") Hamilton begins an affair with Maria Reynolds, making him vulnerable to her husband's blackmail (\"Say No To This\") Hamilton, Jefferson, and James Madison create the Compromise of 1790 over a private dinner, exchanging Hamilton's financial plan for placing the country's permanent capital on the Potomac River Burr is envious of Hamilton's sway in the government and wishes that he had similar power (\"The Room Where It Happens\") Burr switches political parties and defeats Philip Schuyler in a race for the Senate, now making Hamilton a rival (\"Schuyler Defeated\").\n\n\nPrincipal

(2017–2018)\n\nMiranda announced a new series of 13 Hamilton-related recordings called Hamildrops, releasing once a month from December 2017 to December 2018 The first release, on December 15, 2017, was \"Ben Franklin's Song\" by The Decemberists, containing lyrics Miranda wrote during the development of Hamilton for an unused song that was never set to music Miranda had long imagined Benjamin Franklin singing in a \"Decemberist-y way\", and ultimately sent the lyrics to Colin Meloy, who set them to music [60] [61]\n\n\nBackground\nWhile on vacation from performing in his hit Broadway show In the Heights, Lin-Manuel Miranda read a copy of the 2004 biography Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow After finishing the first few chapters, Miranda began to envision the life of Hamilton as a musical, and researched whether a stage musical of Hamilton's life had been created: all he found was that a play of Hamilton's story had been done on Broadway in 1917, starring George Arliss as Alexander Hamilton [75]\n\n\nProductions\nDirected by Thomas Kail and choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler, the musical received its world premiere off-Broadway at The Public Theater, under the supervision of the Public's Artistic Director Oskar Eustis, with previews starting on January 20, 2015, and officially opening on February 17 [82] [83] The production was extended twice, first to April 5 and then to May 3 [84] Chernow served as historical consultant to the production [2] [85] The show opened to universal acclaim according to review aggregator Did He Like It [86]\n\n\nOff-Broadway (2015)\nDirected by Thomas Kail and choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler, the musical received its world premiere off-Broadway at The Public Theater, under the supervision of the Public's Artistic Director Oskar Eustis, with previews starting on January 20, 2015, and officially opening on February 17 [82] [83] The production was extended twice, first to April 5 and then to May 3 [84] Chernow served as historical consultant to the production [2] [85] The show opened to universal acclaim according to review aggregator Did He Like It [86]\n\n\nBroadway (2015–present)\nHamilton premiered on Broadway at the Richard Rodgers Theatre (also home to Miranda's 2008 Broadway debut In the Heights) on July 13, 2015, in previews, and opened on August 6, 2015 [89] As in the off-Broadway production, the show is produced by Seller, Jill Furman and Sandy Jacobs with sets by David Korins, costumes by Paul Tazewell, lighting by Howell Binkley and sound by Nevin Steinberg [90]\n\n\nChicago (2016–2020)\nHamilton began previews at the CIBC Theatre in Chicago on September 27, 2016 [95] The Chicago production cast included Miguel Cervantes as Alexander Hamilton, Joshua Henry as Aaron Burr, Karen Olivo as Angelica Schuyler, Arianna Afsar as Eliza Schuyler, Alexander Gemignani as King George III, Jonathan Kirkland as George Washington, and Samantha Marie Ware as Peggy/Maria Reynolds [96] On its opening in October, attended by author Miranda, the Chicago production received strongly positive reviews [97] [98] [99] The Chicago run closed on January 5, 2020, after 1,341 shows [100] The production grossed $400 million, breaking the box office record for theater in Chicago According to Chris Jones, the success was made possible by the larger number of seats the CIBC Theatre holds and can sell compared with, for example, the show's smaller New York City venue [101] Overall, \"more than 2.6 million people took in Hamilton during its Chicago run.\" Lightfoot acknowledges the fact that this number includes the \"31 thousand public school students who saw it through the Hamilton Education Program.\" [102]\n\n\nNorth American touring productions

records\nHamilton's off-Broadway engagement at The Public Theater was sold out, [6] and when the musical opened on Broadway, it had a multimillion-dollar advance in ticket sales, reportedly taking in $30 million before its official opening [145]\n\n\nTicket lottery and Ham4Ham\nHamilton, like some other Broadway musicals, offers a ticket lottery before every show Initially, 21 front-row seats (and occasional standing room tickets) were offered in each lottery Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda began preparing and hosting outdoor mini-performances shortly before each daily drawing, allowing lottery participants to experience a part of the show even when they did not win tickets [151] These were dubbed the \"Ham4Ham\" shows, because lottery winners were given the opportunity to purchase two tickets at the reduced price of one Hamilton ($10 bill) each.\n\n\nCritical response\nMarilyn Stasio, in her review of the off-Broadway production of the show for Variety, wrote, \"The music is exhilarating, but the lyrics are a big surprise The sense, as well as the sound of the sung dialogue, has been purposely suited to each character George Washington, a stately figure in Jackson's dignified performance, sings in polished prose. .. In the end, Miranda's impassioned narrative of one man's story becomes the collective narrative of a nation, a nation built by immigrants who occasionally need to be reminded where they came from.\" [158]\n\n\nHonors and awards\n‡ Blankenbuehler received a Special Drama Desk Award for \"his inspired and heart-stopping choreography in Hamilton, which is indispensable  [sic] to the musical's storytelling His body of work is versatile, yet a dynamic and fluid style is consistently evident When it's time to 'take his shot,' Blankenbuehler hits the bulls-eye.\" [171]\n\n\nOriginal

production\nThe musical currently holds the record for most Tony Award nominations with 16 nominations (though due to multiple nominations in the two 'actor' categories, it could have only won 13 awards) It eventually won 11 awards, the second-most ever given to a single production, behind only the original Broadway production of The Producers (2001), which won twelve \n\n\nOriginal West End production\nAccording to an article in The New Yorker, the show is \"an achievement of historical and cultural reimagining\" The costumes and set reflect the period, with \"velvet frock coats and knee britches The set .. is a wooden scaffold against exposed brick; the warm lighting suggests candlelight\" [2] The musical is mostly sung and rapped all the way through, with little dialogue isolated outside of the musical score [193] [194] [195]\n\n\nOriginal Australian production\nAccording to an article in The New Yorker, the show is \"an achievement of historical and cultural reimagining\" The

score [193] [194] [195]\n\n\nCasting diversity\nMiranda said that the portrayal of Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and other white historical figures by black, Latino and Asian actors should not require any substantial suspension of disbelief by audience members \"Our cast looks like America looks now, and that's certainly intentional\", he said \"It's a way of pulling you into the story and allowing you to leave whatever cultural baggage you have about the founding fathers at the door.\" [196] He noted \"We're telling the story of old, dead white men but we're using actors of color, and that makes the story more immediate and more accessible to a contemporary audience.\" [197]\n\n\nHistorical accuracy\nAlthough Hamilton was based on historical events and people, Miranda did use some dramatic license in retelling the story Here are the most prominent examples:\n\n\nChronology and events\nAlthough Hamilton was based on historical events and people, Miranda did use some dramatic license in retelling the story Here are the most prominent examples:\n\n\nCritical analysis and scholarship\nThe show has been critiqued for a simplistic depiction of Hamilton and vilification of Jefferson Joanne B Freeman, a history professor at Yale, [228] contrasted the show's Hamilton to the \"real Hamilton  [who] was a mass of contradictions: an immigrant who sometimes distrusted immigrants, a revolutionary who placed a supreme value on law and order, a man who distrusted the rumblings of the masses yet preached his politics to them more frequently and passionately than many of his more democracy-friendly fellows\" [229]\n\n\nUse in education\nKQED News wrote of a \"growing number of intrepid U.S history teachers .. who are harnessing the Hamilton phenomenon to inspire their students\" [240] The Cabinet rap battles provide a way to engage students with topics that have traditionally been considered uninteresting [240] An elective course for 11th and 12th graders on the musical Hamilton was held at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in New York [240] KQED News added that \"Hamilton is especially galvanizing for the student who believes that stories about 18th century America are distant and irrelevant\" as it shows the Founding Fathers were real humans with real feeling and real flaws, rather than \"bloodless, two-dimensional cutouts who devoted their lives to abstract principles\" [240] A high school teacher from the Bronx noted his students were \"singing these songs the way they might sing the latest release from Drake or Adele\" [241] One teacher focused on Hamilton's ability to write his way out of trouble and toward a higher plane of existence: \"skilled writing is the clearest sign of scholarship—and the best way to rise up and alter your circumstance.\" [242]\n\n\nLegacy and impact\nIn 2015, the U.S Department of the Treasury announced a redesign to the $10 bill, with plans to replace Hamilton with a then-undecided woman from American history Possibly due to Hamilton's surging popularity, then-United States Treasury Secretary Jack Lew reversed the plans to replace Hamilton's portrait, instead deciding to replace Andrew Jackson with Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill [250] This decision would later be reversed by the first Trump administration, with Harriet Tubman replacing neither Hamilton or Jackson  [251]\n\n\n$10 bill\nIn 2015, the U.S Department of the Treasury announced a redesign to the $10 bill, with plans to replace Hamilton with a then-undecided woman from American history Possibly due to

should not require any substantial suspension of disbelief by audience members \"Our cast looks like America looks now, and that's certainly intentional\", he said \"It's a way of pulling you into the story and allowing you to leave whatever cultural baggage you have about the founding fathers at the door.\" [196] He noted \"We're telling the story of old, dead white men but we're using actors of color, and that makes the story more immediate and more accessible to a contemporary audience.\" [197]\n\n\nHistorical accuracy\nAlthough Hamilton was based on historical events and people, Miranda

graders on the musical Hamilton was held at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in New York [240] KQED News added that \"Hamilton is especially galvanizing for the student who believes that stories about 18th century America are distant and irrelevant\" as it shows the Founding Fathers were real humans with real feeling and real flaws, rather than \"bloodless, two-dimensional cutouts who devoted their lives to abstract principles\" [240] A high school teacher from the Bronx noted his students were \"singing these songs the way they might sing the latest release from Drake or Adele\" [241] One teacher focused on Hamilton's ability to write his way out of trouble and toward a higher plane of existence: \"skilled writing is the clearest sign of scholarship—and the best way to rise up and alter your circumstance.\" [242]\n\n\nLegacy and impact\nIn 2015, the U.S Department of the Treasury announced a redesign to the $10 bill, with plans to replace Hamilton with a then-undecided woman

first draft for the film, on which principal photography was expected to begin in April 2015 [167]\n\n\nInfinity War and Endgame\nThanos, a villain who covets the Infinity Stones, was introduced to the MCU in a brief appearance at the end of The Avengers Many fans subsequently expected Thanos to be the antagonist of Age of Ultron [189] However, Joss Whedon explained that the character would not be the primary antagonist until a later film due to his power, opting to save him for \"the big finale\" [190] Thanos appears at the end of Age of Ultron in another brief appearance, shown with the Infinity Gauntlet, a glove designed to hold the Infinity Stones [191]\n\n\nDifferences from the comics\nWhile the name \"Avengers\" and the depiction of Loki as the first antagonist is derived more from the mainstream Marvel Universe, commonly referred to as \"Earth-616\", other different depictions such as the original formation of the Avengers at the hands of S.H.I.E.L.D along with the depicted original lineup and the portrayal of the aliens known as Chitauri as main antagonists were portrayed with a similar premise as the Ultimates, a modern reimagining of the Avengers within the comic book universe within the multiverse that is published by Marvel Comics [227] The original lineup of the Avengers included Hank Pym and the Wasp instead of Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye The Ultimates introduced the same lineup of The Avengers with the Earth-616's version and the addition of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, both of whom later appeared in Age of Ultron [227] [228] The characters Rocket Raccoon and Nebula do not feature as Avengers members in the comics, differing from the film adaptations [229] [230]\n\n\nReception\nCritics praised the team's introduction as the main highlight of The Avengers [231] [232] A O Scott of The New York Times felt the chemistry of the characters was the best part of the film [233] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly commented that the best thing regarding the film  \"is that it also unleashes them on each other Simply put: These freaks of goodness may be a team, but they don't like one another very much\" [234] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal opined that the depiction of them quarreling among themselves comically was the most fun part as depicted in the original film [235] The team once again mostly received praise in the sequel with critics praising the original cast reprising the role in Age of Ultron [236] [237] Scott Foundas of Variety felt that the actors now \"wear these roles as comfortably as second skins\" He noted the Fantastic Four and Justice League as teams that can only hope to follow in the footsteps regarding the portrayal of the characters [238] Conversely, Scott Mendelson of Forbes disliked the concept that some of the Avengers (Tony Stark and Bruce Banner) were behind the creation of the antagonist of the film (Ultron) [239]\n\n\nThemes and analysis\nAccording to film critic Peter Travers, The Avengers director Joss Whedon \"sees the Avengers as the ultimate dysfunctional family Their powers have estranged them from the normal world As a result, they're lonely, cranky, emotional fuck-ups, which the actors have a ball playing\" [257] Also while reviewing the original Avengers films, Roger Ebert compared the original six lineup of the Avengers as uniquely different much like the assortment of dog breeds that consists of champions of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show He noted that both examples \"are completely different\" but \"yet they're all champions\" [258] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker explained that the superhero group was reminiscent to the supergroup Traveling Wilburys in music pop-culture [259] Callie Ahlgrim of Insider Inc described the Avengers as \"the most ambitious superpowered team in cinematic history\" when doing a rank down of most powerful Avengers within the MCU [260]\n\n\nCultural impact\nBefore the MCU built up to the Avengers, shared film universes were virtually unheard of in Hollywood according to Tom Russo of Boston.com, with few exceptions like Alien vs Predator (2004) [105] [261] Since the release of The Avengers, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters, notably DC Entertainment and Warner Bros Pictures Warner Bros announced their plans to release a Justice League film following a legal victory over Joe Shuster's estate for the rights to Superman The planned film would unite DC Comics superheroes such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman The company was expected to take the opposite approach to Marvel, releasing individual films for the characters after they have appeared in a team-up film [262] [263]\n\n\nBox-office performance\nThe Avengers franchise is the third highest-grossing superhero franchise and the sixth highest-grossing film franchise of all-time at the worldwide box office, grossing over US$7.7 billion [282] Endgame is currently the second highest-grossing film of all time, only behind Avatar (2009) [283] Endgame became the number one film in July 2019, surpassing Avatar, [284] however, Avatar was re-released in China in March 2021, reclaiming its top spot [285] [286]\n\n\nFuture\nThe Avengers are set to return in two additional films, Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027) Both films will be part of the MCU's Phase Six, concluding the Multiverse Saga [287]\n\n\nIn other media\nThe book Wakanda Files: A Technological Exploration of the Avengers and Beyond (2020) focuses on the Avengers heroes from Shuri's perspective [288] [289] Marvel Comics published Dan Abnett's Avengers: Everybody Wants To Rule The World (2015) as a tie-in to Avengers: Age of Ultron The lineup in the book includes Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch, and the

"**Avengers**\n\nThe Avengers are a fictional team of superheroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The team's story takes place in the Earth-616 universe, and the fictional biography below includes events that happened to the team from more than one Earth-616 timeline, as well as events that occurred in alternate universes.\n\n**The Avengers Initiative**\n\nIn 1995, S.H.I.E.L.D director Nick Fury creates the Avengers Initiative, envisioning it as a group of heroes working to respond to planetary threats, following the appearance of Carol Danvers and naming it after her U.S Air Force callsign, \"Avenger.\" Years later, Fury assesses various individuals for it, including Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. Stark's membership is declined after a negative report by S.H.I.E.L.D agent Natasha Romanoff. The World Security Council wanted Emil Blonsky to join, but rejected it after Stark deters Thaddeus Ross from the idea, hiring Bruce Banner instead.\n\n**The First Assembly**\n\nIn 2012, the Asgardian Loki teleports to the Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility on Earth, where he steals the Tesseract and brainwashes Clint Barton and Dr Erik Selvig using his scepter. Subsequently, Fury recruits Stark and Banner to locate the Tesseract. Rogers, Romanoff, and Stark apprehend Loki, but are disrupted by Thor's arrival. This leads to confrontations between the group, exacerbated by the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D is using the Tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction. Barton attacks the Helicarrier, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and cause damage. After Loki kills S.H.I.E.L.D agent Phil Coulson, the team unites to avenge him, with Romanoff freeing Barton from the scepter's control. Rogers then recruits Barton to the team as a new member. The Avengers confront Loki, who opens a wormhole using the Tesseract and begins an invasion with his Chitauri army, starting a battle. Stark introduces the team to Loki by referring to them as \"Earth's Mightiest Heroes.\" Eventually, the World Security Council launches a nuclear missile towards Manhattan, but Stark intercepts and flies it through the wormhole, destroying the Chitauri mother ship and stopping the invasion. Romanoff closes the portal with the scepter and the team apprehends Loki, who is taken back to Asgard.\n\n**Fighting Hydra and Ultron**\n\nThree years after the Battle of New York, Hydra uses Loki's scepter following their infiltration of S.H.I.E.L.D. The Avengers locate it in Sokovia, where they recover it and encounter twin superhuman Hydra test subjects, Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Barton is wounded and Rogers captures Hydra leader Wolfgang von Strucker while Stark retrieves the scepter, despite being subjected to hallucinations by Wanda's telepathy. Stark and Banner unilaterally decide to use the scepter to create the Ultron Program, a sentient artificial intelligence (AI) peacekeeping force. However, Ultron resolves to eradicate humanity.\n\n**Civil War**\n\nMonths after the Battle of Sokovia, the Avengers' new facility becomes targeted in a heist, with a skirmish between Wilson and Scott Lang. In 2016, Rogers, Romanoff, Maximoff, and Wilson defend a research lab in Lagos from Brock Rumlow. They successfully stop Rumlow and his crew of mercenaries, but Maximoff's usage of telekinesis to try to save civilians kills Wakandan diplomats. Thus, United States Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross presents the Sokovia Accords, United Nations (U.N.) legislation intended to regulate superhumans' activities. The Avengers are divided: Stark, Rhodes, Vision, and Romanoff support it, while Rogers and Wilson object due to fears of authoritarianism.\n\n**The Blip**\n\nIn 2018, the Avengers come into conflict with Thanos and his children, who seek the six Infinity Stones to erase half of the universe's life. Thanos hijacks a spaceship containing Asgardian refugees, killing Loki and subduing Thor. Thanos defeats Hulk, who is transported to Earth by Heimdall to inform Stephen Strange, the keeper of the Time Stone, of Thanos' arrival. Banner, Strange, and Wong, joined by Stark and Parker, confront two of Thanos' children in Greenwich Village. With Banner unable to transform to aid in the fight, Strange is captured and taken to their spaceship, while Banner warns Rogers of Thanos' intention to acquire Vision's Mind Stone. Stark and Parker pursue Strange and board the spaceship, where Stark officially anoints Parker as an Avenger. They go to Titan to confront Thanos, allying with the Guardians of the Galaxy along the way. The two teams temporarily restrain Thanos in an ensuing battle to take his Infinity Gauntlet off, now with four Stones. However, Peter Quill hits Thanos after learning he killed Gamora, freeing and allowing Thanos to incapacitate the group. With Thanos preparing to kill Stark, Strange surrenders the Time Stone to save his life.\n\n**Reversing the Blip**\n\nThree weeks later, the Avengers reunite after Stark and Nebula are rescued by Danvers. The Avengers find Thanos' location, where Rogers, Romanoff, Banner, Thor, Danvers, Rhodes, Rocket, and Nebula ambush him. Thanos reveals he destroyed the Stones, prompting Thor to decapitate him.\n\n**Disbandment**\n\nThe Avengers and their allies attend Stark's funeral at Stark's house. Afterwards, they disband. Rogers travels back into the Quantum Realm to return the Stones to their respective universes and travels back in time to be with Peggy Carter. Having lived out a life with Peggy, Rogers returns as an old man with a new shield and grants it and the title of Captain America to Wilson. Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new ruler of New Asgard and goes to space with the Guardians of the Galaxy. Maximoff goes to Florida and sees that Vision's body is in S.W.O.R.D custody at their headquarters. She then travels to Westview, New Jersey and in her grief over the trauma she endured throughout her life, recently with the loss of Vision and her home, the Avengers Compound, creates a Hex trapping the town in a sitcom called WandaVision and creating twin boys and another Vision. Vision, who was taken into S.W.O.R.D custody, is reactivated, through remnants of Maximoff's magic on a drone, and sports an all-white appearance.\n\n**Alternate Versions**\n\nOther versions of the Avengers are depicted within the context of the MCU multiverse, such as in Avengers: Endgame and the animated series What If...?. In an alternate 2012, Rogers, Stark, Banner, Thor, Barton, and Romanoff assemble in the Battle of New York. After subduing Loki at Stark Tower, Thor puts a device over Loki's mouth after he mocks Rogers. Romanoff and Barton give the Scepter to Brock Rumlow and other agents. Stark and Thor take Loki on the elevator to the first floor, telling Banner he has to take the stairs as he would not fit. Rogers meets his Earth-616 counterpart and mistakes him for being Loki, inciting a duel, which ends with him hearing that Barnes is alive and getting knocked out by the Scepter. Stark and Thor are approached by Alexander Pierce on the first floor who ask for Loki to be handed over, but Stark suffers a cardiac arrest, causing him to drop the briefcase causing the Tesseract. Thor uses Mjolnir to save him. Banner arrives angrily, unknowingly knocking into Earth-616 Stark on his way out of the building. Soon after, Thor turns around and is unable to find Loki.\n\n**What If...? Season 1 (2021)**\n\nIn an alternate 2011, a vengeful Hank Pym eliminates the Avengers' candidates: Stark, Thor, Barton, Banner, and Romanoff. After Pym is defeated, Loki proceeds to invade Earth. Meanwhile, Fury prepares to recreate the team after Rogers is discovered in the Arctic and Danvers responds to his call. Rogers, Danvers, and Fury later battle Loki and his Asgardian army aboard a Helicarrier. During the fight, the Watcher brings in a variant of Romanoff, and she incapacitates Loki with his Scepter.\n\n**What If...? Season 2 (2023)**\n\nIn an alternate 1988, Howard Stark and Peggy Carter form a response team composed of Hank Pym, Bill Foster, T'Chaka, Wendy Lawson, and Bucky Barnes to subdue a young Peter Quill under Ego's influence. With Thor's help, the team successfully defeats Ego and frees Quill. As a fully-formed team, Pym, Foster, Lawson, T'Chaka, and Thor agree to continue working together. In an alternate universe on Christmas Eve, Stark and Rogers dress up as Santa Claus and an elf respectively at a shopping mall, while Barton and Banner try to maintain crowds at an Avengers toy action store. Elsewhere, Romanoff intercepts a former HYDRA agent at a Christmas ballet. They gather together and arrive at the Avengers Tower for the annual Christmas party but defend it from the Freak, until Darcy Lewis reveals he is Happy Hogan and that Justin Hammer infiltrated the Tower. As they prepare to party, Thor arrives outside late.\n\n**Team Roster**\n\nMany characters have been affiliated with the Avengers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe:\n\n* Founding members:\n\t+ Steve Rogers (Captain America)\n\t+ Tony Stark (Iron Man)\n\t+ Bruce Banner (Hulk)\n\t+ Thor\n\t+ Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow)\n\t+ Clint Barton (Hawkeye)\n* Later members:\n\t+ Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch)\n\t+ Pietro Maximoff (Quicksilver)\n\t+ Vision\n\t+ James Rhodes (War Machine)\n\t+ Scott Lang (Ant-Man)\n\t+ Peter Parker (Spider-Man)\n\t+ Okoye\n\t+ Nebula\n\t+ Valkyrie\n* Other characters:\n\t+ Nick Fury\n\t+ Phil Coulson\n\t+ Maria Hill\n\t+ Everett Ross\n\t+ Thaddeus Ross\n\t+ Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel)\n\n**Concept and Creation**\n\nSamuel L. Jackson makes his debut in a cameo appearance as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., in a post-credits scene in Iron Man. Jackson's face was previously used as the model for the Ultimate Marvel imprint version of Nick Fury. Jackson confirmed that he had been in discussions to reprise the role of Fury from Iron Man's post-credits scene in the film's sequel, but that contract disputes were making a deal difficult. In February 2009, Jackson and Marvel came to terms, and he was signed to play the character in up to nine films.\n\n**Initial Castings**\n\nSamuel L Jackson makes his debut in a cameo appearance as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., in a post-credits scene in Iron Man.

Feige, a self-professed \"fanboy\", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s. Ideas for a film based on the Avengers began in 2003, with Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first announcing plans to develop the film in April 2005. This followed Marvel Enterprises declaring independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures. Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio's intention was to release films for each main character to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them before a crossover film.\n\n**Age of Ultron**\n\nIn May 2012, after the successful release of the first Avengers film, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced a sequel was in development. Most of the film's cast members were under contract to potentially appear in the sequel; however, Robert Downey Jr was not, as his four-picture deal with Marvel expired after Iron Man 3 (2013). By May 2013, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film. A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film.\n\n**Captain America: Civil War**\n\nIn March 2014, Anthony and Joe Russo confirmed that they had signed on to return as directors for a third Captain America film, with Evans as Captain America, Feige as producer, and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely as screenwriters. Markus and McFeely had been working on the screenplay since late 2013, while the Russo brothers began work in February 2014. In April 2014, Marvel announced a release date of May 6, 2016. In July, Markus and McFeely stated that they were midway through a first draft for the film, on which principal photography was expected to begin in April 2015.\n\n**Infinity War and Endgame**\n\nThanos, a villain who covets the Infinity Stones, was introduced to the MCU in a brief appearance at the end of The Avengers.

\"fanboy\", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s [105] Ideas for a film based on the Avengers began in 2003, [106] with Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first announcing plans to develop the film in April 2005 This followed Marvel Enterprises declaring independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures [107] Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio's intention was to release films for each main character to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them before a crossover film [108] [109] Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote The Incredible Hulk (2008), which introduced Bruce Banner / Hulk, became attached to the film in 2006 and was hired by Marvel Studios to write The Avengers in June 2007 [110] In the wake of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man and the Avengers [111] After the successful release of Iron Man in May, which introduced Tony Stark / Iron Man, the company set a July 2011 release date for The Avengers [112] In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films [113]\n\n\nThe Avengers\nIn the mid-2000s, Feige realized that

release date for The Avengers [112] In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films [113]\n\n\nAge of Ultron\nIn May 2012, after the successful release of the first Avengers film, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced a sequel was in development [127] Most of the film's cast members were under contract to potentially appear in the sequel; however, Robert Downey Jr was not, as his four-picture deal with Marvel expired after Iron Man 3 (2013) [128] By May 2013, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film [129] A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film [130]\n\n\nCaptain America: Civil War\nIn March 2014, Anthony and Joe Russo confirmed that they had signed on to return as directors for a third Captain America film, with Evans as Captain America, Feige as producer, and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely as screenwriters [161] [162] Markus and McFeely had been working on the screenplay since late 2013, [163] while the Russo brothers began work in February 2014 [164] [165] In April 2014, Marvel announced a release date of May 6, 2016 [166] In July, Markus and McFeely stated that they were midway through a first draft for the film, on which principal photography was expected to begin in April 2015 [167]\n\n\nInfinity War and Endgame\nThanos, a villain who covets the Infinity Stones, was introduced to the MCU in a brief appearance at the end of The Avengers Many fans subsequently expected Thanos to be the antagonist of Age of Ultron [189] However, Joss Whedon explained that the character would not be the primary antagonist until a later film due to his power, opting to save him for \"the big finale\" [190] Thanos appears at the end of Age of Ultron in another brief appearance, shown with the Infinity Gauntlet, a glove designed to hold the Infinity Stones [191]\n\n\nDifferences from the comics\nWhile the name \"Avengers\" and the depiction of Loki as the first antagonist is derived more from the mainstream Marvel Universe, commonly referred to as \"Earth-616\", other different depictions such as the original formation of the Avengers at the hands of S.H.I.E.L.D along with the depicted original lineup and the portrayal of the aliens known as Chitauri as main antagonists were portrayed with a similar premise as the Ultimates, a modern reimagining of the Avengers within the comic book universe within the multiverse that is published by Marvel Comics [227] The original lineup of the Avengers included Hank Pym and the Wasp instead of Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye The Ultimates introduced the same lineup of The Avengers with the Earth-616's version and the addition of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, both of whom later appeared in Age of Ultron [227] [228] The characters Rocket Raccoon and Nebula do not feature as Avengers members in the comics, differing from the film adaptations [229] [230]\n\n\nReception\nCritics praised the team's introduction as the main highlight of The Avengers [231] [232] A O Scott of The New York Times felt the chemistry of the characters was the best part of the film [233] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly commented that the best thing regarding the film  \"is that it also unleashes them on each other Simply put: These freaks of goodness may be a team, but they don't like one another very much\" [234] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal opined that the depiction of them quarreling among themselves comically was the most fun part as depicted in the original film [235] The team once again mostly received praise in the sequel with critics praising the original cast reprising the role in Age of Ultron [236] [237] Scott Foundas of Variety felt that the actors now \"wear these roles as comfortably as second skins\" He noted the Fantastic Four and Justice League as teams that can only hope to follow in the footsteps regarding the portrayal of the characters [238] Conversely, Scott Mendelson of Forbes disliked the concept that some of the Avengers (Tony Stark and Bruce Banner) were behind the creation of the antagonist of the film (Ultron) [239]\n\n\nThemes and analysis\nAccording to film critic Peter Travers, The Avengers director Joss Whedon \"sees the Avengers as the ultimate dysfunctional family Their powers have estranged them from the normal world As a result, they're lonely, cranky, emotional fuck-ups, which the actors have a ball playing\" [257] Also while reviewing the original Avengers films, Roger Ebert compared the original six lineup of the Avengers as uniquely different much like the assortment of dog breeds that consists of champions of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show He noted that both examples \"are completely different\" but \"yet they're all champions\" [258] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker explained that the superhero group was reminiscent to the supergroup Traveling Wilburys in music pop-culture [259] Callie Ahlgrim of Insider Inc described the Avengers as \"the most ambitious superpowered team in cinematic history\" when doing a rank down of most powerful Avengers within the MCU [260]\n\n\nCultural impact\nBefore the MCU built up to the Avengers, shared film universes were virtually unheard of in Hollywood according to Tom Russo of Boston.com, with few exceptions like Alien vs Predator (2004) [105] [261] Since the release of The Avengers, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters, notably DC Entertainment and Warner Bros Pictures Warner Bros announced their plans to release a Justice League film following a legal victory over Joe Shuster's estate for the rights to Superman The planned film would unite DC Comics superheroes such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman The company was expected to take the opposite approach to Marvel, releasing individual films for the characters after they have appeared in a team-up film [262] [263]\n\n\nBox-office performance\nThe Avengers franchise is the third highest-grossing superhero franchise and the sixth highest-grossing film franchise of all-time at the worldwide box office, grossing over US$7.7 billion [282] Endgame is currently the second highest-grossing film of all time, only behind Avatar (2009) [283] Endgame became the number one film in July 2019, surpassing Avatar, [284] however, Avatar was re-released in China in March 2021, reclaiming its top spot [285] [286]\n\n\nFuture\nThe Avengers are set to return in two additional films, Avengers: Doomsday (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (2027) Both films will be part of the MCU's Phase Six, concluding the Multiverse Saga [287]\n\n\nIn other media\nThe book Wakanda Files: A Technological Exploration of the Avengers and Beyond (2020) focuses on the Avengers heroes from Shuri's perspective [288] [289] Marvel Comics published Dan Abnett's Avengers: Everybody Wants To Rule The World (2015) as a tie-in to Avengers: Age of Ultron The lineup in the book includes Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch, and the Vision [290]\n\n\nLiterature\nThe book Wakanda Files: A Technological Exploration of the Avengers and Beyond (2020) focuses on the Avengers heroes from Shuri's perspective [288] [289] Marvel Comics

Hawkeye, Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch, and the Vision [290]\n\n\nVideo games and virtual reality\nLego Marvel's Avengers (2016) was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, Xbox One, Xbox 360, Macintosh, and Microsoft Windows The story mainly focuses on the plots of The Avengers and Age of Ultron, but also includes individual levels for Captain America: The First Avenger, Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World (2013), and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) Marvel's Avengers features multiple MCU suit skins inspired from the Iron Spider armor from Infinity War, [291] while 2018's Spider-Man also features the Iron Spider armor [292]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Chinese_characters", "content": "\nDevelopment\nChinese characters are accepted as representing one of four independent inventions of writing in human history [b] In each instance, writing evolved from a system using two distinct types of ideographs Ideographs could either be pictographs visually depicting objects or concepts, or fixed signs representing concepts only by shared convention These systems are classified as proto-writing, because the techniques they used were insufficient to carry the meaning of spoken language by themselves [3]\n\n\nClassification\nChinese characters have been used in several different writing systems throughout history The concept of a writing system includes both the written symbols themselves, called graphemes—which may include characters, numerals, or punctuation—as well as the rules by which they are used to record language [8] Chinese characters are logographs, which are graphemes that represent units of meaning in a language Specifically, characters represent the smallest units of meaning in a language, which are referred to as morphemes Morphemes in Chinese—and therefore the characters used to write them—are nearly always a single syllable in length In some special cases, characters may denote non-morphemic syllables as well; due to this, written Chinese is often characterised as morphosyllabic [9] [c] Logographs may be contrasted with letters in an alphabet, which generally represent phonemes, the distinct units of sound used by speakers of a language [11] Despite their origins in picture-writing, Chinese characters are no longer ideographs capable of representing ideas directly; their comprehension relies on the reader's knowledge of the particular language being written [12]\n\n\nStructural analysis\nMost characters can be analysed structurally as compounds made of smaller components (部件; bùjiàn), which are often independent characters in their own right, adjusted to occupy a given position in the compound [15] Components within a character may serve a specific function: phonetic components provide a hint for the character's pronunciation, and semantic components indicate some element of the character's meaning Components that serve neither function may be classified as pure signs with no particular meaning, other than their presence distinguishing one character from another [16]\n\n\nSemantographs\nMost of the oldest characters are pictographs (象形; xiàngxíng), representational pictures of physical objects [21] Examples include 日 ('Sun'), 月 ('Moon'), and 木 ('tree') Over time, the forms of pictographs have been simplified in order to make them easier to write [22] As a result, modern readers generally cannot deduce what many pictographs were originally meant to resemble; without knowing the context of their origin in picture-writing, they may be interpreted instead as pure signs However, if a pictograph's use in compounds still reflects its original meaning, as with 日 in 晴 ('clear sky'), it can still be analysed as a semantic component [23] [24]\n\n\nPictographs\nMost of the oldest characters are pictographs (象形; xiàngxíng), representational pictures of physical objects [21] Examples include 日 ('Sun'), 月 ('Moon'), and 木 ('tree') Over time, the forms of pictographs have been simplified in order to make them easier to write [22] As a result, modern readers generally cannot deduce what many pictographs were originally meant to resemble; without knowing the context of their origin in picture-writing, they may be interpreted instead as pure signs However, if a pictograph's use in compounds still reflects its original meaning, as with 日 in 晴 ('clear sky'), it can still be analysed as a semantic component [23] [24]\n\n\nIndicatives\nIndicatives (指事; zhǐshì), also called simple ideographs or self-explanatory characters, [21] are visual representations of abstract concepts that lack any tangible form Examples include 上 ('up') and 下 ('down')—these characters were originally written as dots placed above and below a line, and later evolved into their present forms with less potential for graphical ambiguity in context [26] More complex indicatives include 凸 ('convex'), 凹 ('concave'), and 平 ('flat and level') [27]\n\n\nCompound ideographs\nCompound ideographs (会意; 會意; huìyì)—also called logical aggregates, associative idea characters, or syssemantographs—combine other characters to convey a new, synthetic meaning A canonical example is 明 ('bright'), interpreted as the juxtaposition of the two brightest objects in the sky: ⽇ 'SUN' and ⽉ 'MOON', together expressing their shared quality of brightness Other examples include 休 ('rest'), composed of pictographs ⼈ 'MAN' and ⽊ 'TREE', and 好 ('good'), composed of ⼥ 'WOMAN' and ⼦ 'CHILD' [28]\n\n\nPhonographs\nPhono-semantic compounds (形声; 形聲; xíngshēng) are composed of at least one semantic component and one phonetic component [33] They may be formed by one of several methods, often by adding a phonetic component to disambiguate a loangraph, or by adding a semantic component to represent a specific extension of a character's meaning [34] Examples of phono-semantic compounds include 河 (hé; 'river'), 湖 (hú; 'lake'), 流 (liú; 'stream'), 沖 (chōng; 'surge'), and 滑 (huá; 'slippery') Each of these characters have three short strokes on their left-hand side: 氵, a simplified combining form of ⽔ 'WATER' This component serves a semantic function in each example, indicating the character has some meaning related to water The remainder of each character is its phonetic component: 湖 (hú) is pronounced identically to 胡 (hú) in Standard Chinese, 河 (hé) is pronounced similarly to 可 (kě), and 沖 (chōng) is pronounced similarly to 中 (zhōng) [35]\n\n\nPhono-semantic compounds\nPhono-semantic compounds (形声; 形聲; xíngshēng) are composed of at least one semantic component and one phonetic component [33] They may be formed by one of several methods, often by adding a phonetic component to disambiguate a loangraph, or by adding a semantic component to represent a specific extension of a character's meaning [34] Examples of phono-semantic compounds include 河 (hé; 'river'), 湖 (hú; 'lake'), 流 (liú; 'stream'), 沖 (chōng; 'surge'), and 滑 (huá; 'slippery') Each of these characters have three short strokes on their left-hand side: 氵, a simplified combining form of ⽔ 'WATER' This component serves a semantic function in each example, indicating the character has some meaning related to water The remainder of each character is its phonetic component: 湖 (hú) is pronounced identically to 胡 (hú) in Standard Chinese, 河 (hé) is pronounced similarly to 可 (kě), and 沖 (chōng) is pronounced similarly to 中 (zhōng) [35]\n\n\nLoangraphs\nThe phenomenon of existing characters being adapted to write other words with similar pronunciations was necessary in the initial development of Chinese writing, and has remained common throughout its subsequent history Some loangraphs (假借; jiǎjiè; 'borrowing') are introduced to represent words previously lacking another written form—this is often the case with abstract grammatical particles such as 之 and 其 [38] The process of characters being borrowed as loangraphs should not be conflated with the distinct process of semantic extension, where a word acquires additional senses, which often remain written with the same character As both processes often result in a single character form being used to write several distinct meanings, loangraphs are often misidentified as being the result of semantic extension, and vice versa [39]\n\n\nSigns\nSome characters and components are pure signs, whose meaning merely derives from their having a fixed and distinct form Basic examples of pure signs are found with the numerals beyond four, e.g 五 ('five') and 八 ('eight'), whose forms do not give visual hints to the quantities they represent [43]\n\n\nTraditional Shuowen Jiezi classification\nThe Shuowen Jiezi is a character dictionary authored c. 100 CE by the scholar Xu Shen (c. 58 – c. 148 CE) In its postface, Xu analyses what he sees as all the methods by which characters are created Later authors iterated upon Xu's analysis, developing a categorisation scheme known as the 'six writings' (六书; 六書; liùshū), which identifies every character with one of six categories that had previously been mentioned in the Shuowen Jiezi For nearly two millennia, this scheme was the primary framework for character analysis used throughout the Sinosphere [44] Xu based most of his analysis on examples of Qin seal script that were written down several centuries before his time—these were usually the oldest specimens available to him, though he stated he was aware of the existence of even older forms [45] The first five categories are pictographs, indicatives, compound ideographs, phono-semantic compounds, and loangraphs The sixth category is given by Xu as 轉注 (zhuǎnzhù; 'reversed and refocused'); however, its definition is unclear, and it is generally disregarded by modern scholars [46]\n\n\nHistory\nThe broadest trend in the evolution of Chinese characters over their history has been simplification, both in graphical shape (字形; zìxíng), the \"external appearances of individual graphs\", and in graphical form (字体; 字體; zìtǐ), \"overall changes in the distinguishing features of graphic [al] shape and calligraphic style,  [...] in most cases refer [ring] to rather obvious and rather substantial changes\" [50] The traditional notion of an orderly procession of script styles, each suddenly appearing and displacing the one previous, has been disproven by later scholarship and archaeological work Instead, scripts evolved gradually, with several coexisting in a given area [51]\n\n\nTraditional invention narrative\nSeveral of the Chinese classics indicate that knotted cords were used to keep records prior to the invention of writing [52] Works that reference the practice include chapter 80 of the Tao Te Ching [B] and the \"Xici II\" commentary to the I Ching [C] According to one tradition, Chinese characters were invented during the 3rd millennium BCE by Cangjie, a scribe of the legendary Yellow Emperor Cangjie is said to have invented symbols called 字 (zì) due to his frustration with the limitations of knotting, taking inspiration from his study of the tracks of animals, landscapes, and the stars in the sky On the day that these first characters were created, grain rained down from the sky; that night, the people heard the wailing of ghosts and demons, lamenting that humans could no longer be cheated [53] [54]\n\n\nNeolithic\nCollections of graphs and pictures have been discovered at the sites of several Neolithic settlements throughout the Yellow River valley, including Jiahu (c. 6500 BCE), Dadiwan and Damaidi (6th millennium BCE), and Banpo (5th millennium BCE) Symbols at each site were inscribed or drawn onto artifacts, appearing one at a time and without indicating any greater context Qiu concludes, \"We simply possess no basis for saying that they were already being used to record language.\" [55] A historical connection with the symbols used by the late Neolithic Dawenkou culture (c. 4300 – c. 2600 BCE) in Shandong has been deemed possible by palaeographers, with Qiu concluding that they \"cannot be definitively treated as primitive writing, nevertheless they are symbols which resemble most the ancient pictographic script discovered thus far in China... They undoubtedly can be viewed as the forerunners of primitive writing.\" [56]\n\n\nOracle bone script\nThe oldest attested Chinese writing comprises a body of inscriptions produced during the Late Shang period (c. 1250 – 1050 BCE), with the very earliest examples from the reign of Wu Ding dated between 1250 and 1200 BCE [57] Many of these inscriptions were made on oracle bones—usually either ox scapulae or turtle plastrons—and recorded official divinations carried out by the Shang royal house Contemporaneous inscriptions in a related but distinct style were also made on ritual bronze vessels This oracle bone script (甲骨文; jiǎgǔwén) was first documented in 1899, after specimens were discovered being sold as \"dragon bones\" for medicinal purposes, with the symbols carved into them identified as early character forms By 1928, the source of the bones had been traced to a village near Anyang in Henan—discovered to be the site of Yin, the final Shang capital—which was excavated by a team led by Li Ji (1896–1979) from the Academia Sinica between 1928 and 1937 [58] To date, over 150000 oracle bone fragments have been found [59]\n\n\nZhou scripts\nAs early as the Shang, the oracle bone script existed as a simplified form alongside another that was used in bamboo books, in addition to elaborate pictorial forms often used in clan emblems These other forms have been preserved in what is called bronze script (金文; jīnwén), where inscriptions were made using a stylus in a clay mould, which was then used to cast ritual bronzes [65] These differences in technique generally resulted in character forms that were less angular in appearance than their oracle bone script counterparts [66]\n\n\nQin unification and small seal script\nFollowing Qin's conquest of the other Chinese states that culminated in the founding of the imperial Qin dynasty in 221 BCE, the Qin small seal script was standardised for use throughout the entire country under the direction of Chancellor Li Si (c. 280 – 208 BCE) [71] It was traditionally believed that Qin scribes only used small seal script, and the later clerical script was a sudden invention during the early Han However, more than one script was used by Qin scribes: a rectilinear vulgar style had also been in use in Qin for centuries prior to the wars of unification The popularity of this form grew as writing became more widespread [72]\n\n\nClerical script\nBy the Warring States period (c. 475 – 221 BCE), an immature form of clerical script (隶书; 隸書; lìshū) had emerged based on the vulgar form developed within Qin, often called \"early clerical\" or \"proto-clerical\" [73] The proto-clerical script evolved gradually; by the Han dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE), it had arrived at a mature form, also called 八分 (bāfēn) Bamboo slips discovered during the late 20th century point to this maturation being completed during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) This process, called libian (隶变; 隸變), involved character forms being mutated and simplified, with many components being consolidated, substituted, or omitted In turn, the components themselves were regularised to use fewer, straighter, and more well-defined strokes The resulting clerical forms largely lacked any of the pictorial qualities that remained in seal script [74]\n\n\nCursive and semi-cursive\nCursive script (草书; 草書; cǎoshū) was in use as early as 24 BCE, synthesising elements of the vulgar writing that had originated in Qin with flowing cursive brushwork By the Jin dynasty (266–420), the Han cursive style became known as 章草 (zhāngcǎo; 'orderly cursive'), sometimes known in English as 'clerical cursive', 'ancient cursive', or 'draft cursive' Some attribute this name to the fact that the style was considered more orderly than a later form referred to as 今草 (jīncǎo; 'modern cursive'), which had first emerged during the Jin and was influenced by semi-cursive and regular script This later form was exemplified by the work of figures like Wang Xizhi (303–361), who is often regarded as the most important calligrapher in Chinese history [77] [78]\n\n\nRegular script\nRegular script (楷书; 楷書; kǎishū), based on clerical and semi-cursive forms, is the predominant form in which characters are written and printed [81] Its innovations have traditionally been credited to the calligrapher Zhong Yao (c. 151 – 230), who was living in the state of Cao Wei (220–266); he is often called the \"father of regular script\" [82] The earliest surviving writing in regular script comprises copies of Zhong Yao's work, including at least one copy by Wang Xizhi Characteristics of regular script include the 'pause' (頓; dùn) technique used to end horizontal strokes, as well as heavy tails on diagonal strokes made going down and to the right It developed further during the Eastern Jin (317–420) in the hands of Wang Xizhi and his son Wang Xianzhi (344–386) [83] However, most Jin-era writers continued to use neo-clerical and semi-cursive styles in their daily writing It was not until the Northern and Southern period (420–589) that regular script became the predominant form [84] The system of imperial examinations for the civil service established during the Sui dynasty (581–618) required test takers to write in Literary Chinese using regular script, which contributed to the prevalence of both throughout later Chinese history [85]\n\n\nStructure\nEach character of a text is written within a uniform square allotted for it As part of the evolution from seal script into clerical script, character components became regularised as discrete series of strokes (笔画; 筆畫; bǐhuà) [86] Strokes can be considered both the basic unit of handwriting, as well as the writing system's basic unit of graphemic organisation In clerical and regular script, individual strokes traditionally belong to one of eight categories according to their technique and graphemic function In what is known as the Eight Principles of Yong, calligraphers practice their technique using the character 永 (yǒng; 'eternity'), which can be written with one stroke of each type [87] In ordinary writing, 永 is now written with five strokes instead of eight, and a system of five basic stroke types is commonly employed in analysis—with certain compound strokes treated as sequences of basic strokes made in a single motion [88]\n\n\nVariant characters\nOver a character's history, variant character forms (异体字; 異體字; yìtǐzì) emerge via several processes Variant forms have distinct structures, but represent the same morpheme; as such, they can be considered instances of the same underlying character This is comparable to visually distinct double-storey |a| and single-storey |ɑ| forms both representing the Latin letter ⟨A⟩ Variants also emerge for aesthetic reasons, to make handwriting easier, or to correct what the writer perceives to be errors in a character's form [93] Individual components may be replaced with visually, phonetically, or semantically similar alternatives [94] The boundary between character structure and style—and thus whether forms represent different characters, or are merely variants of the same character—is often non-trivial or unclear [95]\n\n\nLayout\nFrom the earliest inscriptions until the 20th century, texts were generally laid out vertically—with characters written from top to bottom in columns, arranged from right to left Word boundaries are generally not indicated with spaces A horizontal writing direction—with characters written from left to right in rows, arranged from top to bottom—only became predominant in the Sinosphere during the 20th century as a result of Western influence [97] Many publications outside mainland China continue to use the traditional vertical writing direction [98] Western influence also resulted in the generalised use of punctuation being widely adopted in print during the 19th and 20th centuries Prior to this, the context of a passage was considered adequate to guide readers; this was enabled by characters being easier than alphabets to read when written scriptio continua, due to their more discretised shapes [99]\n\n\nMethods of writing\nThe earliest attested Chinese characters were carved into bone, or marked using a stylus in clay moulds used to cast ritual bronzes Characters have also been incised into stone, or written in ink onto slips of silk, wood, and bamboo The invention of paper for use as a writing medium occurred during the 1st century CE, and is traditionally credited to Cai Lun (d. 121 CE) [100] There are numerous styles, or scripts (书; 書; shū) in which characters can be written, including the historical forms like seal script and clerical script Most styles used throughout the Sinosphere originated within China, though they may display regional variation Styles that have been created outside of China tend to remain localised in their use: these include the Japanese edomoji and Vietnamese lệnh thư scripts [101]\n\n\nCalligraphy\nCalligraphy was traditionally one of the four arts to be mastered by Chinese scholars, considered to be an artful means of expressing thoughts and teachings Chinese calligraphy typically makes use of an ink brush to write characters Strict regularity is not required, and character forms may be accentuated to evoke a variety of aesthetic effects [102] Traditional ideals of calligraphic beauty often tie into broader philosophical concepts native to East Asia For example, aesthetics can be conceptualised using the framework of yin and yang, where the extremes of any number of mutually reinforcing dualities are balanced by the calligrapher—such as the duality between strokes made quickly or slowly, between applying ink heavily or lightly, between characters written with symmetrical or asymmetrical forms, and between characters representing concrete or abstract concepts [103]\n\n\nPrinting and typefaces\nWoodblock printing was invented in China between the 6th and 9th centuries, [104] followed by the invention of moveable type by Bi Sheng (972–1051) during the 11th century [105] The increasing use of print during the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing dynasties (1644–1912) led to considerable standardisation in character forms, which prefigured later script reforms during the 20th century This print orthography, exemplified by the 1716 Kangxi Dictionary, was later dubbed the jiu zixing ('old character shapes') [106]\nPrinted Chinese characters may use different typefaces, [107] of which there are four broad classes in use: [108]\n\n\nUse with computers\nBefore computers became ubiquitous, earlier electro-mechanical communications devices like telegraphs and typewriters were originally designed for use with alphabets, often by means of alphabetic text encodings like Morse code and ASCII Adapting these technologies for use with a writing system comprising thousands of distinct characters was non-trivial [109] [110]\n\n\nInput methods\nChinese characters are predominantly input on computers using a standard keyboard Many input methods (IMEs) are phonetic, where typists enter characters according to schemes like pinyin or bopomofo for Mandarin, Jyutping for Cantonese, or Hepburn for Japanese For example, 香港 ('Hong Kong') could be input as xiang1gang3 using pinyin, or as hoeng1gong2 using Jyutping [111]\n\n\nEncoding and interchange\nWhile special text encodings for Chinese characters were introduced prior to its popularisation, The Unicode Standard is the predominant text encoding worldwide [114] According to the philosophy of the Unicode Consortium, each distinct graph is assigned a number in the standard, but specifying its appearance or the particular allograph used is a choice made by the engine rendering the text [F] Unicode's Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) represents the standard's 216 smallest code points Of these, 20992 (or 32%) are assigned to CJK Unified Ideographs, a designation comprising characters used in each of the Chinese family of scripts As of version 16.0, Unicode defines a total of 98682 Chinese characters [G]\n\n\nVocabulary and adaptation\nWriting first emerged during the historical stage of the Chinese language known as Old Chinese Most characters correspond to morphemes that originally functioned as stand-alone Old Chinese words [115] Classical Chinese is the form of written Chinese used in the classic works of Chinese literature between roughly the 5th century BCE and the 2nd century CE [116] This form of the language was imitated by later authors, even as it began to diverge from the language they spoke This later form, referred to as \"Literary Chinese\", remained the predominant written language in China until the 20th century Its use in the Sinosphere was loosely analogous to that of Latin in pre-modern Europe While it was not static over time, Literary Chinese retained many properties of spoken Old Chinese Informed by the local spoken vernaculars, texts were read aloud using literary and colloquial readings that varied by region Over time, sound mergers created ambiguities in vernacular speech as more words became homophonic This ambiguity was often reduced through the introduction of multi-syllable compound words, [117] which comprise much of the vocabulary in modern varieties of Chinese [118] [119]\n\n\nLiterary and vernacular Chinese\nWords in Classical Chinese were generally a single character in length [132] An estimated 25–30% of the vocabulary used in Classical Chinese texts consists of two-character words [133] Over time, the introduction of multi-syllable vocabulary into vernacular varieties of Chinese was encouraged by phonetic shifts that increased the number of homophones [134] The most common process of Chinese word formation after the Classical period has been to create compounds of existing words Words have also been created by appending affixes to words, by reduplication, and by borrowing words from other languages [135] While multi-syllable words are generally written with one character per syllable, abbreviations are occasionally used [136] For example, 二十 (èrshí; 'twenty') may be written as the contracted form 廿 [137]\n\n\nJapanese\nIn Japanese, Chinese characters are referred to as kanji Beginning in the Nara period (710–794), readers and writers of kanbun—the Japanese term for Literary Chinese writing—began employing a system of reading techniques and annotations called kundoku When reading, Japanese speakers would adapt the syntax and vocabulary of Literary Chinese texts to reflect their Japanese-language equivalents Writing essentially involved the inverse of this process, and resulted in ordinary Literary Chinese [142] When adapted to write Japanese, characters were used to represent both Sino-Japanese vocabulary loaned from Chinese, as well as the corresponding native synonyms Most kanji were subject to both borrowing processes, and as a result have both Sino-Japanese and native readings, known as on'yomi and kun'yomi respectively Moreover, kanji may have multiple readings of either kind Distinct classes of on'yomi were borrowed into Japanese at different points in time from different varieties of Chinese [143]\n\n\nKorean\nIn Korean, Chinese characters are known as hanja Literary Chinese may have been written in Korea as early as the 2nd century BCE During Korea's Three Kingdoms period (57 BCE – 668 CE), characters were also used to write idu, a form of Korean-language literature that mostly made use of Sino-Korean vocabulary During the Goryeo period (918–1392), Korean writers developed a system of phonetic annotations for Literary Chinese called gugyeol, comparable to kundoku in Japan, though it only entered widespread use during the later Joseon period (1392–1897) [147] While the hangul alphabet was invented by the Joseon king Sejong (r. 1418–1450) in 1443, it was not adopted by the Korean literati and was relegated to use in glosses for Literary Chinese texts until the late 19th century [148]\n\n\nVietnamese\nChinese characters are called chữ Hán (𡨸漢), chữ Nho (𡨸儒; 'Confucian characters'), or Hán tự (漢字) in Vietnamese Literary Chinese was used for all formal writing in Vietnam until the modern era, [155] having first acquired official status in 1010 Literary Chinese written by Vietnamese authors is first attested in the late 10th century, though the local practice of writing is likely several centuries older [156] Characters used to write Vietnamese called chữ Nôm (𡨸喃) are first attested in an inscription dated to 1209 made at the site of a pagoda [157] A mature chữ Nôm script had likely emerged by the 13th century, and was initially used to record Vietnamese folk literature Some chữ Nôm characters are phono-semantic compounds corresponding to spoken Vietnamese syllables [158] Another technique with no equivalent in China created chữ Nôm compounds using two phonetic components This was done because Vietnamese phonology included consonant clusters not found in Chinese, and were thus poorly approximated by the sound values of borrowed characters Compounds used components with two distinct consonant sounds to specify the cluster, e.g 𢁋 (blăng; [d] 'Moon') was created as a compound of 巴 (ba) and 陵 (lăng) [159] As a system, chữ Nôm was highly complex, and the literacy rate among the Vietnamese population never exceeded 5% [160] Both Literary Chinese and chữ Nôm fell out of use during the French colonial period, and were gradually replaced by the Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet Following the end of colonial rule in 1954, the Vietnamese alphabet has been sole official writing system in Vietnam, and is used exclusively in Vietnamese-language media [161]\n\n\nOther languages\nSeveral minority languages of South and Southwest China have been written with scripts using both borrowed and locally created characters The most well-documented of these is the sawndip script for the Zhuang languages of Guangxi While little is known about its early development, a tradition of vernacular Zhuang writing likely first emerged during the Tang dynasty (618–907) Modern scholarship on sawndip has described a network of regional writing traditions exhibiting both mutual influence and characteristic difference with one another [162] Like Vietnamese, some invented Zhuang characters are phonetic–phonetic compounds, though not primarily ones intended to describe consonant clusters [163] Despite the Chinese government encouraging its replacement with a Latin-based Zhuang alphabet, sawndip remains in use [164] Other non-Sinitic languages of China written with Chinese characters include Miao, Yao, Bouyei, Bai, and Hani Each of these languages are now written with Latin-based alphabets in official contexts [165]\n\n\nGraphically derived scripts\nBetween the 10th and 13th centuries, dynasties founded by non-Han peoples in northern China also created scripts for their languages that were inspired by Chinese characters, but did not use them directly: these included the Khitan large script, Khitan small script, Tangut script, and Jurchen script [165] This has occurred in other contexts as well: Nüshu was a script used by Yao women to write the Xiangnan Tuhua language, [166] and bopomofo (注音符号; 注音符號; zhùyīn fúhào) is a semi-syllabary first invented in 1907 [167] to represent the sounds of Standard Chinese; [168] both use forms graphically derived from Chinese characters Other scripts within China that have adapted some characters but are otherwise distinct include the Geba syllabary used to write the Naxi language, the script for the Sui language, the script for the Yi languages, and the syllabary for the Lisu language [165]\n\n\nLiteracy and lexicography\nThe memorisation of thousands of different characters is required to achieve literacy in languages written with them, in contrast to the relatively small inventory of graphemes used in phonetic writing [170] Historically, character literacy was often acquired via Chinese primers like the 6th-century Thousand Character Classic and 13th-century Three Character Classic, [171] as well as surname dictionaries like the Song-era Hundred Family Surnames [172] Studies of Chinese-language literacy suggest that literate individuals generally have an active vocabulary of three to four thousand characters; for specialists in fields like literature or history, this figure may be between five and six thousand [173]\n\n\nDictionaries\nAccording to analyses of mainland Chinese, Taiwanese, Hong Kong, Japanese, and Korean sources, the total number of characters in the modern lexicon is around 15000 [174] Dozens of schemes have been devised for indexing Chinese characters and arranging them in dictionaries, though relatively few have achieved widespread use Characters may be ordered according to methods based on their meaning, visual structure, or pronunciation [175]\n\n\nNeurolinguistics\nUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neurolinguists have studied the brain activity associated with literacy Compared to phonetic systems, reading and writing with characters involves additional areas of the brain—including those associated with visual processing [181] While the level of memorisation required for character literacy is significant, identification of the phonetic and semantic components in compounds—which constitute the vast majority of characters—also plays a key role in reading comprehension The ease of recognition for a given character is impacted by how regular the positioning of its components is, as well as how reliable its phonetic component is in indicating a specific pronunciation [182] Moreover, due to the high level of homophony in Chinese languages and the more irregular correspondences between writing and the sounds of speech, it has been suggested that knowledge of orthography plays a greater role in speech recognition for literate Chinese speakers [183]\n\n\nReform and standardisation\nAttempts to reform and standardise the use of characters—including aspects of form, stroke order, and pronunciation—have been undertaken by states throughout history Thousands of simplified characters were standardised and adopted in mainland China during the 1950s and 1960s, with most either already existing as common variants, or being produced via the systematic simplification of their components [186] After World War II, the Japanese government also simplified hundreds of character forms, including some simplifications distinct from those adopted in China [187] Orthodox forms that have not undergone simplification are referred to as traditional characters Across Chinese-speaking polities, mainland China, Malaysia, and Singapore use simplified characters, while Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau use traditional characters [188] In general, Chinese and Japanese readers can successfully identify characters from all three standards [189]\n\n\nPeople's Republic of China\nThe project of script reform in China was ultimately inherited by the Communists, who resumed work following the proclamation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 In 1951, Premier Zhou Enlai (1898–1976) ordered the formation of a Script Reform Committee, with subgroups investigating both simplification and alphabetisation The simplification subgroup began surveying and collating simplified forms the following year, [196] ultimately publishing a draft scheme of simplified characters and components in 1956 In 1958, Zhou Enlai announced the government's intent to focus on simplification, as opposed to replacing characters with Hanyu Pinyin, which had been introduced earlier that year [197] The 1956 scheme was largely ratified by a revised list of 2235 characters promulgated in 1964 [198] The majority of these characters were drawn from conventional abbreviations or ancient forms with fewer strokes [199] The committee also sought to reduce the total number of characters in use by merging some forms together [199] For example, 雲 ('cloud') was written as 云 in oracle bone script The simpler form remained in use as a loangraph meaning 'to say'; it was replaced in its original sense of 'cloud' with a form that added a semantic ⾬ 'RAIN' component The simplified forms of these two characters have been merged into 云 [200]\n\n\nJapan\nAfter World War II, the Japanese government instituted its own program of orthographic reforms Some characters were assigned simplified forms called shinjitai; the older forms were then labelled kyūjitai Inconsistent use of different variant forms was discouraged, and lists of characters to be taught to students at each grade level were developed The first of these was the 1850-character tōyō kanji list published in 1946, later replaced by the 1945-character jōyō kanji list in 1981 In 2010, the jōyō kanji were expanded to include a total of 2136 characters [206] [207] The Japanese government restricts characters that may be used in names to the jōyō kanji, plus an additional list of 983 jinmeiyō kanji whose use are historically prevalent in names [208] [209]\n\n\nSouth Korea\nHanja are still used in South Korea, though not to the extent that kanji are used in Japan In general, there is a trend toward the exclusive use of hangul in ordinary contexts [210] Characters remain in use in place names, newspapers, and to disambiguate homophones They are also used in the practice of calligraphy Use of hanja in education is politically contentious, with official policy regarding the prominence of hanja in curricula having vacillated since the country's independence [211] [212] Some support the total abandonment of hanja, while others advocate an increase in use to levels previously seen during the 1970s and 1980s Students in grades 7–12 are presently taught with a principal focus on simple recognition and attaining sufficient literacy to read a newspaper [148] The South Korean Ministry of Education published the Basic Hanja for Educational Use in 1972, which specified 1800 characters meant to be learned by secondary school students [213] In 1991, the Supreme Court of Korea published the Table of Hanja for Use in Personal Names (인명용한자; Inmyeong-yong hanja), which initially included 2854 characters [214] The list has been expanded several times since; as of 2022 [update], it includes 8319 characters [215]\n\n\nNorth Korea\nIn the years following its establishment, the North Korean government sought to eliminate the use of hanja in standard writing; by 1949, characters had been almost entirely replaced with hangul in North Korean publications [216] While mostly unused in writing, hanja remain an important part of North Korean education: a 1971 textbook for university history departments contained 3323 distinct characters, and in the 1990s North Korean school children were still expected to learn 2000 characters [217] A 2013 textbook appears to integrate the use of hanja in secondary school education [218] It has been estimated that North Korean students learn around 3000 hanja by the time they graduate university [219]\n\n\nTaiwan\nThe Chart of Standard Forms of Common National Characters was published by Taiwan's Ministry of Education in 1982, and lists 4808 traditional characters [220] The Ministry of Education also compiles dictionaries of characters used in Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka [H]\n\n\nOther regional standards\nSingapore's Ministry of Education promulgated three successive rounds of simplifications: the first round in 1969 included 502 simplified characters, and the second round in 1974 included 2287 simplified characters—including 49 that differed from those in the PRC, which were ultimately removed in the final round in 1976 In 1993, Singapore adopted the revisions made in mainland China in 1986 [221]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nPrimary and media sources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Chinese Characters\n\nIntroduction\n\nChinese characters, also known as Hanzi, are a logographic writing system used by the Han Chinese language and other languages such as Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese. They are the oldest form of writing in the world, with a history of over 3,000 years. Chinese characters consist of thousands of distinct symbols, each representing a morpheme or a unit of meaning in a language. They are a unique and complex writing system, with a rich history and cultural significance.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe development of Chinese characters is a gradual process that spans thousands of years. The earliest known forms of Chinese writing date back to the Shang Dynasty (16th to 11th centuries BCE). During this period, Chinese characters were used to record important events, rituals, and administrative documents. The earliest Chinese characters were pictographs, which were images of objects or concepts. Over time, the forms of these characters were simplified, and new characters were created.\n\n## Classification\n\nChinese characters can be classified into several categories, including pictographs, indicatives, compound ideographs, phono-semantic compounds, and loangraphs. Pictographs are images of objects or concepts, while indicatives are symbols that represent abstract concepts. Compound ideographs are combinations of two or more characters that convey a new meaning. Phono-semantic compounds are characters that combine a semantic component with a phonetic component. Loangraphs are characters that are borrowed from another language and adapted to represent a different sound or meaning.\n\n## Structural Analysis\n\nMost Chinese characters can be analyzed structurally as compounds made of smaller components. These components may serve a specific function, such as providing a hint for the character's pronunciation or indicating some element of the character's meaning. Some components may be classified as pure signs, which have no particular meaning but serve to distinguish one character from another.\n\n## Semantographs\n\nSemantographs are the most ancient type of Chinese character. They are pictographic representations of physical objects, such as 日 (sun), 月 (moon), and 木 (tree). Over time, the forms of these characters have been simplified, and modern readers can no longer deduce their original meaning.\n\n## Indicatives\n\nIndicatives are visual representations of abstract concepts that lack any tangible form. They are often used to represent simple ideas or actions, such as 上 (up) and 下 (down). Indicatives may also be used to convey more complex ideas, such as 凸 (convex) and 凹 (concave).\n\n## Compound Ideographs\n\nCompound ideographs are combinations of two or more characters that convey a new meaning. They are often used to represent complex concepts or ideas. Examples of compound ideographs include 明 (bright), interpreted as the juxtaposition of the sun and moon, and 休 (rest), composed of pictographs representing a man and a tree.\n\n## Phono-semantic Compounds\n\nPhono-semantic compounds are characters that combine a semantic component with a phonetic component. They may be formed by adding a phonetic component to disambiguate a logograph or by adding a semantic component to represent a specific extension of a character's meaning.\n\n## Loangraphs\n\nLoangraphs are characters that are borrowed from another language and adapted to represent a different sound or meaning. They may be introduced to represent words previously lacking another written form.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of Chinese characters is a complex and multifaceted one. The earliest known forms of Chinese writing date back to the Shang Dynasty (16th to 11th centuries BCE). During this period, Chinese characters were used to record important events, rituals, and administrative documents. The earliest Chinese characters were pictographs, which were images of objects or concepts. Over time, the forms of these characters were simplified, and new characters were created.\n\n## Oracle Bone Script\n\nThe oracle bone script is the oldest attested Chinese writing system. It consists of a body of inscriptions produced during the Late Shang period, with the earliest examples dating back to the reign of Wu Ding (1250-1200 BCE). The oracle bone script was used to record official divinations carried out by the Shang royal house.\n\n## Bronze Script\n\nThe bronze script is another early form of Chinese writing. It was used to inscribe ritual bronzes during the Shang and Zhou dynasties. The bronze script is characterized by its use of a stylus in a clay mould to cast ritual bronzes.\n\n## Qin Unification\n\nFollowing the Qin unification of China in 221 BCE, the Qin small seal script was standardized for use throughout the country under the direction of Chancellor Li Si. This script was traditionally believed to have been used exclusively by Qin scribes, but recent research has shown that a rectilinear vulgar style was also in use in Qin for centuries prior to the wars of unification.\n\n## Clerical Script\n\nThe clerical script emerged during the Warring States period (475-221 BCE) and was based on the vulgar form developed within Qin. It evolved gradually, with the Han dynasty (202-220 CE) arriving at a mature form, also called the bāfēn (Eight Forms) script.\n\n## Cursive and Semi-cursive\n\nCursive script emerged in 24 BCE and synthesized elements of the vulgar writing that had originated in Qin with flowing cursive brushwork. The Han cursive style became known as 章草 (zhāngcǎo; 'orderly cursive') or 'clerical cursive', 'ancient cursive', or 'draft cursive'.\n\n## Regular Script\n\nRegular script, based on clerical and semi-cursive forms, is the predominant form in which characters are written and printed. Its innovations are credited to the calligrapher Zhong Yao (c. 151 - 230 CE), who is often called the \"father of regular script\".\n\nPrinting and Typefaces\n\nThe invention of woodblock printing in China during the 6th to 9th centuries CE allowed for mass production of printed materials. The invention of moveable type by Bi Sheng (972-1051 CE) during the 11th century CE further facilitated the dissemination of written materials.\n\n## Print Orthography\n\nThe increasing use of print during the Ming (1368-1644 CE) and Qing dynasties (1644-1912 CE) led to considerable standardization in character forms, which prefigured later script reforms during the 20th century. This print orthography, exemplified by the 1716 Kangxi Dictionary, was later dubbed the jiu zixing ('old character shapes').\n\n## Typefaces\n\nPrinted Chinese characters may use different typefaces, with four broad classes in use:\n\n### I. Traditional and Classical\nTraditional and classical typefaces are based on the classic calligraphic styles of the past.\n\n### II. Simplified\nSimplified typefaces are more modern and are often used in everyday applications.\n\n### III. Standard\nStandard typefaces are the most commonly used typefaces and are the basis for most printed materials.\n\n### IV. Artistic\nArtistic typefaces are used for decorative purposes and are often used in advertising and other visual materials.\n\nUse with Computers\n\nChinese characters have been adapted for use with computers, with various input methods (IMEs) available for typing characters.\n\n## Input Methods\nIMEs are phonetic, where typists enter characters according to schemes like pinyin or bopomofo for Mandarin, Jyutping for Cantonese, or Hepburn for Japanese.\n\n## Encoding and Interchange\nThe Unicode Standard is the predominant text encoding worldwide, with Chinese characters assigned to the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).\n\n## Neurolinguistics\nNeurolinguists have studied the brain activity associated with literacy, with reading and writing with characters involving additional areas of the brain.\n\n## Reform and Standardization\nAttempts have been made to reform and standardize the use of characters, including simplification and standardization of forms and pronunciation.\n\n## People's Republic of China\nThe project of script reform in China was inherited by the Communists, who resumed work following the proclamation of the People's Republic of China in 1949.\n\n## Japan\nThe Japanese government has also simplified hundreds of character forms, including some simplifications distinct from those adopted in China.\n\n## South Korea\nHanja are still used in South Korea, though not to the extent that kanji are used in Japan.\n\n## Taiwan\nThe Chart of Standard Forms of Common National Characters was published by Taiwan's Ministry of Education in 1982, listing 4808 traditional characters.\n\n## Singapore\nSingapore's Ministry of Education promulgated three successive rounds of simplifications, the first round in 1969 including 502 simplified characters, and the second round in 1974 including 2287 simplified characters.\n\n## North Korea\nIn the years following its establishment, the North Korean government sought to eliminate the use of hanja in standard writing, with characters almost entirely replaced with hangul by 1949.\n\n## Vietnam\nChinese characters are known as chữ Hán in Vietnam and were used for all formal writing until the modern era.\n\n## Other Languages\nSeveral minority languages of South and Southwest China have been written with scripts using both borrowed and locally created characters.\n\n## Conclusion\nChinese characters have a rich history and cultural significance, with a complex development process spanning thousands of years. Their use has been adapted for various purposes, including printing and computer use. Despite efforts to reform and standardize their use, Chinese characters remain an essential part of many languages and cultures.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Chinese_characters\" following this outline:\n\n\nDevelopment\nChinese characters are accepted as representing one of four independent inventions of writing in human history [b] In each instance, writing evolved from a system using two distinct types of ideographs Ideographs could either be pictographs visually depicting objects or concepts, or fixed signs representing concepts only by shared convention These systems are classified as proto-writing, because the techniques they used were insufficient to carry the meaning of spoken language by themselves [3]\n\n\nClassification\nChinese characters have been used in several different writing systems throughout history The concept of a writing system includes both the written symbols themselves, called graphemes—which may include characters, numerals, or punctuation—as well as the rules by which they are used to record language [8] Chinese characters are logographs, which are graphemes that represent units of meaning in a language Specifically, characters represent the smallest units of meaning in a language, which are referred to as morphemes Morphemes in Chinese—and therefore the characters used to write them—are nearly always a single syllable in length In some special cases, characters may denote non-morphemic syllables as well; due to this, written Chinese is often characterised as morphosyllabic [9] [c] Logographs may be contrasted with letters in an alphabet, which generally represent phonemes, the distinct units of sound used by speakers of a language [11] Despite their origins in picture-writing, Chinese characters are no longer ideographs capable of representing ideas directly; their comprehension relies on the reader's knowledge of the particular language being written [12]\n\n\nStructural analysis\nMost characters can be analysed structurally as compounds made of smaller components (部件; bùjiàn), which are often independent characters in their own right, adjusted to occupy a given position in the compound [15] Components within a character may serve a specific function: phonetic components provide a hint for the character's pronunciation, and semantic components indicate some element of the character's meaning Components that serve neither function may be classified as pure signs with no particular meaning, other than their presence distinguishing one character from another [16]\n\n\nSemantographs\nMost of the oldest characters are pictographs (象形; xiàngxíng), representational pictures of physical objects [21] Examples include 日 ('Sun'), 月 ('Moon'), and 木 ('tree') Over time, the forms of pictographs have been simplified in order to make them easier to write [22] As a result, modern readers generally cannot deduce what many pictographs were originally meant to resemble; without knowing the context of their origin in picture-writing, they may be interpreted instead as pure signs However, if a pictograph's use in compounds still reflects its original meaning, as with 日 in 晴 ('clear sky'), it can still be analysed as a semantic component [23] [24]\n\n\nPictographs\nMost of the oldest characters are pictographs (象形; xiàngxíng), representational pictures of physical objects [21] Examples include 日 ('Sun'), 月 ('Moon'), and 木 ('tree') Over time, the forms of pictographs have been simplified in order to make them easier to write [22] As a result, modern readers generally cannot deduce what many pictographs were originally meant to resemble; without knowing the context of their origin in picture-writing, they may be interpreted instead as pure signs However, if a pictograph's use in compounds still reflects its original meaning, as with 日 in 晴 ('clear sky'), it can still be analysed as a semantic component [23] [24]\n\n\nIndicatives\nIndicatives (指事; zhǐshì), also called simple ideographs or self-explanatory characters, [21] are visual representations of abstract concepts that lack any tangible form Examples include 上 ('up') and 下 ('down')—these characters were originally written as dots placed above and below a line, and later evolved into their present forms with less potential for graphical ambiguity in context [26] More complex indicatives include 凸 ('convex'), 凹 ('concave'), and 平 ('flat and level') [27]\n\n\nCompound ideographs\nCompound ideographs (会意; 會意; huìyì)—also called logical aggregates, associative idea characters, or syssemantographs—combine other characters to convey a new, synthetic meaning A canonical example is 明 ('bright'), interpreted as the juxtaposition of the two brightest objects in the sky: ⽇ 'SUN' and ⽉ 'MOON', together expressing their shared quality of brightness Other examples include 休 ('rest'), composed of pictographs ⼈ 'MAN' and ⽊ 'TREE', and 好 ('good'), composed of ⼥ 'WOMAN' and ⼦ 'CHILD' [28]\n\n\nPhonographs\nPhono-semantic compounds (形声; 形聲; xíngshēng) are composed of at least one semantic component and one phonetic component [33] They may be formed by one of several methods, often by adding a phonetic component to disambiguate a loangraph, or by adding a semantic component to represent a specific extension of a character's meaning [34] Examples of phono-semantic compounds include 河 (hé; 'river'), 湖 (hú; 'lake'), 流 (liú; 'stream'), 沖 (chōng; 'surge'), and 滑 (huá; 'slippery') Each of these characters have three short strokes on their left-hand side: 氵, a simplified combining form of ⽔ 'WATER' This component serves a semantic function in each example, indicating the character has some meaning related to water The remainder of each character is its phonetic component: 湖 (hú) is pronounced identically to 胡 (hú) in Standard Chinese, 河 (hé) is pronounced similarly to 可 (kě), and 沖 (chōng) is pronounced similarly to 中 (zhōng) [35]\n\n\nPhono-semantic compounds\nPhono-semantic compounds (形声; 形聲; xíngshēng) are composed of at least one semantic component and one phonetic component [33] They may be formed by one of several methods, often by adding a phonetic component to disambiguate a loangraph, or by adding a semantic component to represent a specific extension of a character's meaning [34] Examples of phono-semantic compounds include 河 (hé; 'river'), 湖 (hú; 'lake'), 流 (liú; 'stream'), 沖 (chōng; 'surge'), and 滑 (huá; 'slippery') Each of these characters have three short strokes on their left-hand side: 氵, a simplified combining form of ⽔ 'WATER' This component serves a semantic function in each example, indicating the character has some meaning related to water The remainder of each character is its phonetic component: 湖 (hú) is pronounced identically to 胡 (hú) in Standard Chinese, 河 (hé) is pronounced similarly to 可 (kě), and 沖 (chōng) is pronounced similarly to 中 (zhōng) [35]\n\n\nLoangraphs\nThe phenomenon of existing characters being adapted to write other words with similar pronunciations was necessary in the initial development of Chinese writing, and has remained common throughout its subsequent history Some loangraphs (假借; jiǎjiè; 'borrowing') are introduced to represent words previously lacking another written form—this is often the case with abstract grammatical particles such as 之 and 其 [38] The process of characters being borrowed as loangraphs should not be conflated with the distinct process of semantic extension, where a word acquires additional senses, which often remain written with the same character As both processes often result in a single character form being used to write several distinct meanings, loangraphs are often misidentified as being the result of semantic extension, and vice versa [39]\n\n\nSigns\nSome characters and components are pure signs, whose meaning merely derives from their having a fixed and distinct form Basic examples of pure signs are found with the numerals beyond four, e.g 五 ('five') and 八 ('eight'), whose forms do not give visual hints to the quantities they represent [43]\n\n\nTraditional Shuowen Jiezi classification\nThe Shuowen Jiezi is a character dictionary authored c. 100 CE by the scholar Xu Shen (c. 58 – c. 148 CE) In its postface, Xu analyses what he sees as all the methods by which characters are created Later authors iterated upon Xu's analysis, developing a categorisation scheme known as the 'six writings' (六书; 六書; liùshū), which identifies every character with one of six categories that had previously been mentioned in the Shuowen Jiezi For nearly two millennia, this scheme was the primary framework for character analysis used throughout the Sinosphere [44] Xu based most of his analysis on examples of Qin seal script that were written down several centuries before his time—these were usually the oldest specimens available to him, though he stated he was aware of the existence of even older forms [45] The first five categories are pictographs, indicatives, compound ideographs, phono-semantic compounds, and loangraphs The sixth category is given by Xu as 轉注 (zhuǎnzhù; 'reversed and refocused'); however, its definition is unclear, and it is generally disregarded by modern scholars [46]\n\n\nHistory\nThe broadest trend in the evolution of Chinese characters over their history has been simplification, both in graphical shape (字形; zìxíng), the \"external appearances of individual graphs\", and in graphical form (字体; 字體; zìtǐ), \"overall changes in the distinguishing features of graphic [al] shape and calligraphic style,  [...] in most cases refer [ring] to rather obvious and rather substantial changes\" [50] The traditional notion of an orderly procession of script styles, each suddenly appearing and displacing the one previous, has been disproven by later scholarship and archaeological work Instead, scripts evolved gradually, with several coexisting in a given area [51]\n\n\nTraditional invention narrative\nSeveral of the Chinese classics indicate that knotted cords were used to keep records prior to the invention of writing [52] Works that reference the practice include chapter 80 of the Tao Te Ching [B] and the \"Xici II\" commentary to the I Ching [C] According to one tradition, Chinese characters were invented during the 3rd millennium BCE by Cangjie, a scribe of the legendary Yellow Emperor Cangjie is said to have invented symbols called 字 (zì) due to his frustration with the limitations of knotting, taking inspiration from his study of the tracks of animals, landscapes, and the stars in the sky On the day that these first characters were created, grain rained down from the sky; that night, the people heard the wailing of ghosts and demons, lamenting that humans could no longer be cheated [53] [54]\n\n\nNeolithic\nCollections of graphs and pictures have been discovered at the sites of several Neolithic settlements throughout the Yellow River valley, including Jiahu (c. 6500 BCE), Dadiwan and Damaidi (6th millennium BCE), and Banpo (5th millennium BCE) Symbols at each site were inscribed or drawn onto artifacts, appearing one at a time and without indicating any greater context Qiu concludes, \"We simply possess no basis for saying that they were already being used to record language.\" [55] A historical connection with the symbols used by the late Neolithic Dawenkou culture (c. 4300 – c. 2600 BCE) in Shandong has been deemed possible by palaeographers, with Qiu concluding that they \"cannot be definitively treated as primitive writing, nevertheless they are symbols which resemble most the ancient pictographic script discovered thus far in China... They undoubtedly can be viewed as the forerunners of primitive writing.\" [56]\n\n\nOracle bone script\nThe oldest attested Chinese writing comprises a body of inscriptions produced during the Late Shang period (c. 1250 – 1050 BCE), with the very earliest examples from the reign of Wu Ding dated between 1250 and 1200 BCE [57] Many of these inscriptions were made on oracle bones—usually either ox scapulae or turtle plastrons—and recorded official divinations carried out by the Shang royal house Contemporaneous inscriptions in a related but distinct style were also made on ritual bronze vessels This oracle bone script (甲骨文; jiǎgǔwén) was first documented in 1899, after specimens were discovered being sold as \"dragon bones\" for medicinal purposes, with the symbols carved into them identified as early character forms By 1928, the source of the bones had been traced to a village near Anyang in Henan—discovered to be the site of Yin, the final Shang capital—which was excavated by a team led by Li Ji (1896–1979) from the Academia Sinica between 1928 and 1937 [58] To date, over 150000 oracle bone fragments have been found [59]\n\n\nZhou scripts\nAs early as the Shang, the oracle bone script existed as a simplified form alongside another that was used in bamboo books, in addition to elaborate pictorial forms often used in clan emblems These other forms have been preserved in what is called bronze script (金文; jīnwén), where inscriptions were made using a stylus in a clay mould, which was then used to cast ritual bronzes [65] These differences in technique generally resulted in character forms that were less angular in appearance than their oracle bone script counterparts [66]\n\n\nQin unification and small seal script\nFollowing Qin's conquest of the other Chinese states that culminated in the founding of the imperial Qin dynasty in 221 BCE, the Qin small seal script was standardised for use throughout the entire country under the direction of Chancellor Li Si (c. 280 – 208 BCE) [71] It was traditionally believed that Qin scribes only used small seal script, and the later clerical script was a sudden invention during the early Han However, more than one script was used by Qin scribes: a rectilinear vulgar style had also been in use in Qin for centuries prior to the wars of unification The popularity of this form grew as writing became more widespread [72]\n\n\nClerical script\nBy the Warring States period (c. 475 – 221 BCE), an immature form of clerical script (隶书; 隸書; lìshū) had emerged based on the vulgar form developed within Qin, often called \"early clerical\" or \"proto-clerical\" [73] The proto-clerical script evolved gradually; by the Han dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE), it had arrived at a mature form, also called 八分 (bāfēn) Bamboo slips discovered during the late 20th century point to this maturation being completed during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) This process, called libian (隶变; 隸變), involved character forms being mutated and simplified, with many components being consolidated, substituted, or omitted In turn, the components themselves were regularised to use fewer, straighter, and more well-defined strokes The resulting clerical forms largely lacked any of the pictorial qualities that remained in seal script [74]\n\n\nCursive and semi-cursive\nCursive script (草书; 草書; cǎoshū) was in use as early as 24 BCE, synthesising elements of the vulgar writing that had originated in Qin with flowing cursive brushwork By the Jin dynasty (266–420), the Han cursive style became known as 章草 (zhāngcǎo; 'orderly cursive'), sometimes known in English as 'clerical cursive', 'ancient cursive', or 'draft cursive' Some attribute this name to the fact that the style was considered more orderly than a later form referred to as 今草 (jīncǎo; 'modern cursive'), which had first emerged during the Jin and was influenced by semi-cursive and regular script This later form was exemplified by the work of figures like Wang Xizhi (303–361), who is often regarded as the most important calligrapher in Chinese history [77] [78]\n\n\nRegular script\nRegular script (楷书; 楷書; kǎishū), based on clerical and semi-cursive forms, is the predominant form in which characters are written and printed [81] Its innovations have traditionally been credited to the calligrapher Zhong Yao (c. 151 – 230), who was living in the state of Cao Wei (220–266); he is often called the \"father of regular script\" [82] The earliest surviving writing in regular script comprises copies of Zhong Yao's work, including at least one copy by Wang Xizhi Characteristics of regular script include the 'pause' (頓; dùn) technique used to end horizontal strokes, as well as heavy tails on diagonal strokes made going down and to the right It developed further during the Eastern Jin (317–420) in the hands of Wang Xizhi and his son Wang Xianzhi (344–386) [83] However, most Jin-era writers continued to use neo-clerical and semi-cursive styles in their daily writing It was not until the Northern and Southern period (420–589) that regular script became the predominant form [84] The system of imperial examinations for the civil service established during the Sui dynasty (581–618) required test takers to write in Literary Chinese using regular script, which contributed to the prevalence of both throughout later Chinese history [85]\n\n\nStructure\nEach character of a text is written within a uniform square allotted for it As part of the evolution from seal script into clerical script, character components became regularised as discrete series of strokes (笔画; 筆畫; bǐhuà) [86] Strokes can be considered both the basic unit of handwriting, as well as the writing system's basic unit of graphemic organisation In clerical and regular script, individual strokes traditionally belong to one of eight categories according to their technique and graphemic function In what is known as the Eight Principles of Yong, calligraphers practice their technique using the character 永 (yǒng; 'eternity'), which can be written with one stroke of each type [87] In ordinary writing, 永 is now written with five strokes instead of eight, and a system of five basic stroke types is commonly employed in analysis—with certain compound strokes treated as sequences of basic strokes made in a single motion [88]\n\n\nVariant characters\nOver a character's history, variant character forms (异体字; 異體字; yìtǐzì) emerge via several processes Variant forms have distinct structures, but represent the same morpheme; as such, they can be considered instances of the same underlying character This is comparable to visually distinct double-storey |a| and single-storey |ɑ| forms both representing the Latin letter ⟨A⟩ Variants also emerge for aesthetic reasons, to make handwriting easier, or to correct what the writer perceives to be errors in a character's form [93] Individual components may be replaced with visually, phonetically, or semantically similar alternatives [94] The boundary between character structure and style—and thus whether forms represent different characters, or are merely variants of the same character—is often non-trivial or unclear [95]\n\n\nLayout\nFrom the earliest inscriptions until the 20th century, texts were generally laid out vertically—with characters written from top to bottom in columns, arranged from right to left Word boundaries are generally not indicated with spaces A horizontal writing direction—with characters written from left to right in rows, arranged from top to bottom—only became predominant in the Sinosphere during the 20th century as a result of Western influence [97] Many publications outside mainland China continue to use the traditional vertical writing direction [98] Western influence also resulted in the generalised use of punctuation being widely adopted in print during the 19th and 20th centuries Prior to this, the context of a passage was considered adequate to guide readers; this was enabled by characters being easier than alphabets to read when written scriptio continua, due to their more discretised shapes [99]\n\n\nMethods of writing\nThe earliest attested Chinese characters were carved into bone, or marked using a stylus in clay moulds used to cast ritual bronzes Characters have also been incised into stone, or written in ink onto slips of silk, wood, and bamboo The invention of paper for use as a writing medium occurred during the 1st century CE, and is traditionally credited to Cai Lun (d. 121 CE) [100] There are numerous styles, or scripts (书; 書; shū) in which characters can be written, including the historical forms like seal script and clerical script Most styles used throughout the Sinosphere originated within China, though they may display regional variation Styles that have been created outside of China tend to remain localised in their use: these include the Japanese edomoji and Vietnamese lệnh thư scripts [101]\n\n\nCalligraphy\nCalligraphy was traditionally one of the four arts to be mastered by Chinese scholars, considered to be an artful means of expressing thoughts and teachings Chinese calligraphy typically makes use of an ink brush to write characters Strict regularity is not required, and character forms may be accentuated to evoke a variety of aesthetic effects [102] Traditional ideals of calligraphic beauty often tie into broader philosophical concepts native to East Asia For example, aesthetics can be conceptualised using the framework of yin and yang, where the extremes of any number of mutually reinforcing dualities are balanced by the calligrapher—such as the duality between strokes made quickly or slowly, between applying ink heavily or lightly, between characters written with symmetrical or asymmetrical forms, and between characters representing concrete or abstract concepts [103]\n\n\nPrinting and typefaces\nWoodblock printing was invented in China between the 6th and 9th centuries, [104] followed by the invention of moveable type by Bi Sheng (972–1051) during the 11th century [105] The increasing use of print during the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing dynasties (1644–1912) led to considerable standardisation in character forms, which prefigured later script reforms during the 20th century This print orthography, exemplified by the 1716 Kangxi Dictionary, was later dubbed the jiu zixing ('old character shapes') [106]\nPrinted Chinese characters may use different typefaces, [107] of which there are four broad classes in use: [108]\n\n\nUse with computers\nBefore computers became ubiquitous, earlier electro-mechanical communications devices like telegraphs and typewriters were originally designed for use with alphabets, often by means of alphabetic text encodings like Morse code and ASCII Adapting these technologies for use with a writing system comprising thousands of distinct characters was non-trivial [109] [110]\n\n\nInput methods\nChinese characters are predominantly input on computers using a standard keyboard Many input methods (IMEs) are phonetic, where typists enter characters according to schemes like pinyin or bopomofo for Mandarin, Jyutping for Cantonese, or Hepburn for Japanese For example, 香港 ('Hong Kong') could be input as xiang1gang3 using pinyin, or as hoeng1gong2 using Jyutping [111]\n\n\nEncoding and interchange\nWhile special text encodings for Chinese characters were introduced prior to its popularisation, The Unicode Standard is the predominant text encoding worldwide [114] According to the philosophy of the Unicode Consortium, each distinct graph is assigned a number in the standard, but specifying its appearance or the particular allograph used is a choice made by the engine rendering the text [F] Unicode's Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) represents the standard's 216 smallest code points Of these, 20992 (or 32%) are assigned to CJK Unified Ideographs, a designation comprising characters used in each of the Chinese family of scripts As of version 16.0, Unicode defines a total of 98682 Chinese characters [G]\n\n\nVocabulary and adaptation\nWriting first emerged during the historical stage of the Chinese language known as Old Chinese Most characters correspond to morphemes that originally functioned as stand-alone Old Chinese words [115] Classical Chinese is the form of written Chinese used in the classic works of Chinese literature between roughly the 5th century BCE and the 2nd century CE [116] This form of the language was imitated by later authors, even as it began to diverge from the language they spoke This later form, referred to as \"Literary Chinese\", remained the predominant written language in China until the 20th century Its use in the Sinosphere was loosely analogous to that of Latin in pre-modern Europe While it was not static over time, Literary Chinese retained many properties of spoken Old Chinese Informed by the local spoken vernaculars, texts were read aloud using literary and colloquial readings that varied by region Over time, sound mergers created ambiguities in vernacular speech as more words became homophonic This ambiguity was often reduced through the introduction of multi-syllable compound words, [117] which comprise much of the vocabulary in modern varieties of Chinese [118] [119]\n\n\nLiterary and vernacular Chinese\nWords in Classical Chinese were generally a single character in length [132] An estimated 25–30% of the vocabulary used in Classical Chinese texts consists of two-character words [133] Over time, the introduction of multi-syllable vocabulary into vernacular varieties of Chinese was encouraged by phonetic shifts that increased the number of homophones [134] The most common process of Chinese word formation after the Classical period has been to create compounds of existing words Words have also been created by appending affixes to words, by reduplication, and by borrowing words from other languages [135] While multi-syllable words are generally written with one character per syllable, abbreviations are occasionally used [136] For example, 二十 (èrshí; 'twenty') may be written as the contracted form 廿 [137]\n\n\nJapanese\nIn Japanese, Chinese characters are referred to as kanji Beginning in the Nara period (710–794), readers and writers of kanbun—the Japanese term for Literary Chinese writing—began employing a system of reading techniques and annotations called kundoku When reading, Japanese speakers would adapt the syntax and vocabulary of Literary Chinese texts to reflect their Japanese-language equivalents Writing essentially involved the inverse of this process, and resulted in ordinary Literary Chinese [142] When adapted to write Japanese, characters were used to represent both Sino-Japanese vocabulary loaned from Chinese, as well as the corresponding native synonyms Most kanji were subject to both borrowing processes, and as a result have both Sino-Japanese and native readings, known as on'yomi and kun'yomi respectively Moreover, kanji may have multiple readings of either kind Distinct classes of on'yomi were borrowed into Japanese at different points in time from different varieties of Chinese [143]\n\n\nKorean\nIn Korean, Chinese characters are known as hanja Literary Chinese may have been written in Korea as early as the 2nd century BCE During Korea's Three Kingdoms period (57 BCE – 668 CE), characters were also used to write idu, a form of Korean-language literature that mostly made use of Sino-Korean vocabulary During the Goryeo period (918–1392), Korean writers developed a system of phonetic annotations for Literary Chinese called gugyeol, comparable to kundoku in Japan, though it only entered widespread use during the later Joseon period (1392–1897) [147] While the hangul alphabet was invented by the Joseon king Sejong (r. 1418–1450) in 1443, it was not adopted by the Korean literati and was relegated to use in glosses for Literary Chinese texts until the late 19th century [148]\n\n\nVietnamese\nChinese characters are called chữ Hán (𡨸漢), chữ Nho (𡨸儒; 'Confucian characters'), or Hán tự (漢字) in Vietnamese Literary Chinese was used for all formal writing in Vietnam until the modern era, [155] having first acquired official status in 1010 Literary Chinese written by Vietnamese authors is first attested in the late 10th century, though the local practice of writing is likely several centuries older [156] Characters used to write Vietnamese called chữ Nôm (𡨸喃) are first attested in an inscription dated to 1209 made at the site of a pagoda [157] A mature chữ Nôm script had likely emerged by the 13th century, and was initially used to record Vietnamese folk literature Some chữ Nôm characters are phono-semantic compounds corresponding to spoken Vietnamese syllables [158] Another technique with no equivalent in China created chữ Nôm compounds using two phonetic components This was done because Vietnamese phonology included consonant clusters not found in Chinese, and were thus poorly approximated by the sound values of borrowed characters Compounds used components with two distinct consonant sounds to specify the cluster, e.g 𢁋 (blăng; [d] 'Moon') was created as a compound of 巴 (ba) and 陵 (lăng) [159] As a system, chữ Nôm was highly complex, and the literacy rate among the Vietnamese population never exceeded 5% [160] Both Literary Chinese and chữ Nôm fell out of use during the French colonial period, and were gradually replaced by the Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet Following the end of colonial rule in 1954, the Vietnamese alphabet has been sole official writing system in Vietnam, and is used exclusively in Vietnamese-language media [161]\n\n\nOther languages\nSeveral minority languages of South and Southwest China have been written with scripts using both borrowed and locally created characters The most well-documented of these is the sawndip script for the Zhuang languages of Guangxi While little is known about its early development, a tradition of vernacular Zhuang writing likely first emerged during the Tang dynasty (618–907) Modern scholarship on sawndip has described a network of regional writing traditions exhibiting both mutual influence and characteristic difference with one another [162] Like Vietnamese, some invented Zhuang characters are phonetic–phonetic compounds, though not primarily ones intended to describe consonant clusters [163] Despite the Chinese government encouraging its replacement with a Latin-based Zhuang alphabet, sawndip remains in use [164] Other non-Sinitic languages of China written with Chinese characters include Miao, Yao, Bouyei, Bai, and Hani Each of these languages are now written with Latin-based alphabets in official contexts [165]\n\n\nGraphically derived scripts\nBetween the 10th and 13th centuries, dynasties founded by non-Han peoples in northern China also created scripts for their languages that were inspired by Chinese characters, but did not use them directly: these included the Khitan large script, Khitan small script, Tangut script, and Jurchen script [165] This has occurred in other contexts as well: Nüshu was a script used by Yao women to write the Xiangnan Tuhua language, [166] and bopomofo (注音符号; 注音符號; zhùyīn fúhào) is a semi-syllabary first invented in 1907 [167] to represent the sounds of Standard Chinese; [168] both use forms graphically derived from Chinese characters Other scripts within China that have adapted some characters but are otherwise distinct include the Geba syllabary used to write the Naxi language, the script for the Sui language, the script for the Yi languages, and the syllabary for the Lisu language [165]\n\n\nLiteracy and lexicography\nThe memorisation of thousands of different characters is required to achieve literacy in languages written with them, in contrast to the relatively small inventory of graphemes used in phonetic writing [170] Historically, character literacy was often acquired via Chinese primers like the 6th-century Thousand Character Classic and 13th-century Three Character Classic, [171] as well as surname dictionaries like the Song-era Hundred Family Surnames [172] Studies of Chinese-language literacy suggest that literate individuals generally have an active vocabulary of three to four thousand characters; for specialists in fields like literature or history, this figure may be between five and six thousand [173]\n\n\nDictionaries\nAccording to analyses of mainland Chinese, Taiwanese, Hong Kong, Japanese, and Korean sources, the total number of characters in the modern lexicon is around 15000 [174] Dozens of schemes have been devised for indexing Chinese characters and arranging them in dictionaries, though relatively few have achieved widespread use Characters may be ordered according to methods based on their meaning, visual structure, or pronunciation [175]\n\n\nNeurolinguistics\nUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neurolinguists have studied the brain activity associated with literacy Compared to phonetic systems, reading and writing with characters involves additional areas of the brain—including those associated with visual processing [181] While the level of memorisation required for character literacy is significant, identification of the phonetic and semantic components in compounds—which constitute the vast majority of characters—also plays a key role in reading comprehension The ease of recognition for a given character is impacted by how regular the positioning of its components is, as well as how reliable its phonetic component is in indicating a specific pronunciation [182] Moreover, due to the high level of homophony in Chinese languages and the more irregular correspondences between writing and the sounds of speech, it has been suggested that knowledge of orthography plays a greater role in speech recognition for literate Chinese speakers [183]\n\n\nReform and standardisation\nAttempts to reform and standardise the use of characters—including aspects of form, stroke order, and pronunciation—have been undertaken by states throughout history Thousands of simplified characters were standardised and adopted in mainland China during the 1950s and 1960s, with most either already existing as common variants, or being produced via the systematic simplification of their components [186] After World War II, the Japanese government also simplified hundreds of character forms, including some simplifications distinct from those adopted in China [187] Orthodox forms that have not undergone simplification are referred to as traditional characters Across Chinese-speaking polities, mainland China, Malaysia, and Singapore use simplified characters, while Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau use traditional characters [188] In general, Chinese and Japanese readers can successfully identify characters from all three standards [189]\n\n\nPeople's Republic of China\nThe project of script reform in China was ultimately inherited by the Communists, who resumed work following the proclamation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 In 1951, Premier Zhou Enlai (1898–1976) ordered the formation of a Script Reform Committee, with subgroups investigating both simplification and alphabetisation The simplification subgroup began surveying and collating simplified forms the following year, [196] ultimately publishing a draft scheme of simplified characters and components in 1956 In 1958, Zhou Enlai announced the government's intent to focus on simplification, as opposed to replacing characters with Hanyu Pinyin, which had been introduced earlier that year [197] The 1956 scheme was largely ratified by a revised list of 2235 characters promulgated in 1964 [198] The majority of these characters were drawn from conventional abbreviations or ancient forms with fewer strokes [199] The committee also sought to reduce the total number of characters in use by merging some forms together [199] For example, 雲 ('cloud') was written as 云 in oracle bone script The simpler form remained in use as a loangraph meaning 'to say'; it was replaced in its original sense of 'cloud' with a form that added a semantic ⾬ 'RAIN' component The simplified forms of these two characters have been merged into 云 [200]\n\n\nJapan\nAfter World War II, the Japanese government instituted its own program of orthographic reforms Some characters were assigned simplified forms called shinjitai; the older forms were then labelled kyūjitai Inconsistent use of different variant forms was discouraged, and lists of characters to be taught to students at each grade level were developed The first of these was the 1850-character tōyō kanji list published in 1946, later replaced by the 1945-character jōyō kanji list in 1981 In 2010, the jōyō kanji were expanded to include a total of 2136 characters [206] [207] The Japanese government restricts characters that may be used in names to the jōyō kanji, plus an additional list of 983 jinmeiyō kanji whose use are historically prevalent in names [208] [209]\n\n\nSouth Korea\nHanja are still used in South Korea, though not to the extent that kanji are used in Japan In general, there is a trend toward the exclusive use of hangul in ordinary contexts [210] Characters remain in use in place names, newspapers, and to disambiguate homophones They are also used in the practice of calligraphy Use of hanja in education is politically contentious, with official policy regarding the prominence of hanja in curricula having vacillated since the country's independence [211] [212] Some support the total abandonment of hanja, while others advocate an increase in use to levels previously seen during the 1970s and 1980s Students in grades 7–12 are presently taught with a principal focus on simple recognition and attaining sufficient literacy to read a newspaper [148] The South Korean Ministry of Education published the Basic Hanja for Educational Use in 1972, which specified 1800 characters meant to be learned by secondary school students [213] In 1991, the Supreme Court of Korea published the Table of Hanja for Use in Personal Names (인명용한자; Inmyeong-yong hanja), which initially included 2854 characters [214] The list has been expanded several times since; as of 2022 [update], it includes 8319 characters [215]\n\n\nNorth Korea\nIn the years following its establishment, the North Korean government sought to eliminate the use of hanja in standard writing; by 1949, characters had been almost entirely replaced with hangul in North Korean publications [216] While mostly unused in writing, hanja remain an important part of North Korean education: a 1971 textbook for university history departments contained 3323 distinct characters, and in the 1990s North Korean school children were still expected to learn 2000 characters [217] A 2013 textbook appears to integrate the use of hanja in secondary school education [218] It has been estimated that North Korean students learn around 3000 hanja by the time they graduate university [219]\n\n\nTaiwan\nThe Chart of Standard Forms of Common National Characters was published by Taiwan's Ministry of Education in 1982, and lists 4808 traditional characters [220] The Ministry of Education also compiles dictionaries of characters used in Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka [H]\n\n\nOther regional standards\nSingapore's Ministry of Education promulgated three successive rounds of simplifications: the first round in 1969 included 502 simplified characters, and the second round in 1974 included 2287 simplified characters—including 49 that differed from those in the PRC, which were ultimately removed in the final round in 1976 In 1993, Singapore adopted the revisions made in mainland China in 1986 [221]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nPrimary and media sources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "South_Africa", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe name \"South Africa\" is derived from the country's geographic location at the southern tip of Africa Upon formation, the country was named the Union of South Africa in English and Unie van Zuid-Afrika in Dutch, reflecting its origin from the unification of four British colonies Since 1961, the long formal name in English has been the \"Republic of South Africa\" and Republiek van Suid-Afrika in Afrikaans The country has an official name in 12 official languages [29] [30]\n\n\nHistory\nSouth Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and human-fossil sites in the world [34] [35] [36] Archaeologists have recovered extensive fossil remains from a series of caves in Gauteng Province The area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been branded \"the Cradle of Humankind\" The sites include Sterkfontein, one of the richest sites for hominin fossils in the world, as well as Swartkrans, Gondolin Cave, Kromdraai, Cooper's Cave and Malapa Raymond Dart identified the first hominin fossil discovered in Africa, the Taung Child (found near Taung) in 1924 Other hominin remains have come from the sites of Makapansgat in Limpopo Province; Cornelia and Florisbad in Free State Province; Border Cave in KwaZulu-Natal Province; Klasies River Caves in Eastern Cape Province; and Pinnacle Point, Elandsfontein and Die Kelders Cave in Western Cape Province [37]\n\n\nPrehistoric archaeology\nSouth Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and human-fossil sites in the world [34] [35] [36] Archaeologists have

KwaZulu-Natal Province; Klasies River Caves in Eastern Cape Province; and Pinnacle Point, Elandsfontein and Die Kelders Cave in Western Cape Province [37]\n\n\nBantu expansion\nSettlements of Bantu-speaking peoples, who were iron-using agriculturists and herdsmen, were present south of the Limpopo River (now the northern border with Botswana and Zimbabwe) by the 4th or 5th century CE The Bantu slowly moved south The earliest ironworks in modern-day KwaZulu-Natal Province are believed to date from around 1050 The southernmost group was the Xhosa people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoisan people The Xhosa reached the Great Fish River, in today's Eastern Cape Province As they migrated, these larger Iron Age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples In Mpumalanga Province, several stone circles have been found along with a stone arrangement that has been named Adam's Calendar, and the ruins are thought to be created by the Bakone, a Northern Sotho people [41] [42]\n\n\nPortuguese exploration\nIn 1487, the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias led the first European voyage to land in southern Africa [43] On 4 December, he landed at Walfisch Bay (now known as Walvis Bay in present-day Namibia) This was south of the furthest point reached in 1485 by his predecessor, the Portuguese navigator Diogo Cão (Cape Cross, north of the bay) Dias continued down the western coast of southern Africa After 8 January 1488, prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast, he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of Africa without seeing it He reached as far up the eastern coast of Africa as, what he called, Rio do Infante, probably the present-day Groot River, in May 1488 On his return he saw the cape, which he named Cabo das Tormentas ('Cape of Storms') King John II renamed the point Cabo da Boa Esperança, or Cape of Good Hope, as it led to the riches of the East Indies [44] Dias' feat of navigation was immortalised in Luís de Camões' 1572 epic poem Os Lusíadas.\n\n\nDutch colonisation\nBy the early 17th century, Portugal's maritime power was starting to decline, and English and Dutch merchants competed to oust Portugal from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade [45] Representatives of the British East India Company sporadically called at the cape in search of provisions as early as 1601 but later came to favour Ascension Island and Saint Helena as alternative ports of refuge [46] Dutch interest was aroused after 1647, when two employees of the Dutch East India Company were shipwrecked at the cape for several months The sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives [46] They also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil [47] Upon their return to Holland, they reported favourably on the cape's potential as a \"warehouse and garden\" for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages [46]\n\n\nBritish colonisation and the Great Trek\nGreat Britain occupied Cape Town between 1795 and 1803 to prevent it from falling under the control of the French First Republic, which had invaded the Low Countries [53] After briefly returning to Dutch rule under the Batavian Republic in 1803, the cape was occupied again by the British in 1806 [54] Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, it was formally ceded to Great Britain and became an integral part of the British Empire [55] British emigration to South Africa began around 1818, subsequently culminating in the arrival of the 1820 Settlers [55] The new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons, namely to increase the size of the European workforce and to bolster frontier regions against Xhosa incursions [55]\n\n\nBoer Wars\nThe Boer republics successfully resisted British encroachments during the First Boer War (1880–1881) using guerrilla warfare tactics, which were well-suited to local conditions The British returned with greater numbers, more experience, and new strategy in the Second Boer War (1899–1902) and, although suffering heavy casualties due to Boer attrition warfare, they were ultimately successful due in part to scorched earth tactics such as concentration camps, in which 27,000 Boer civilians died due to a combination of disease and neglect [63]\n\n\nIndependence\nAnti-British policies among white South Africans focused on independence During the Dutch and British colonial years, racial segregation was mostly informal, though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of indigenous people, including the Native Location Act of 1879 and the system of pass laws [65] [66] [67] [68] [69]\n\n\nApartheid era\nIn 1948, the National Party was elected to power It strengthened the racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule Taking Canada's Indian Act as a framework, [73] the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races (Whites, Blacks, Indians and Coloured people (people of mixed race)) and developed rights and limitations for each The white minority (less than 20%) [74] controlled the vastly larger black majority The legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid While whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of Africa, comparable to First World Western nations, the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy [75] The Freedom Charter, adopted in 1955 by the Congress Alliance, demanded a non-racial society and an end to discrimination.\n\n\nPost-apartheid\nThe Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith, signed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Harry Schwarz in 1974, enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all, the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in South Africa Ultimately, F.W de Klerk opened bilateral discussions with Nelson Mandela in 1993 for a transition of policies and government.\n\n\nGeography\nSouth Africa is in southernmost Africa, with a coastline that stretches more than 2,500 km (1,553 mi) and along two oceans (the South Atlantic and the Indian) At 1,219,912 km2 (471,011 sq mi), [110] South Africa is the 24th-largest country in the world [111] Excluding the Prince Edward Islands, the country lies between latitudes 22° and 35°S, and longitudes 16° and 33°E The interior of South Africa consists of a large, in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between 1,000 m (3,300 ft) and 2,100 m (6,900 ft), highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north, and slightly so to the south and south-west [112] This plateau is surrounded by the Great Escarpment [113] whose eastern, and highest, stretch is known as the Drakensberg [114] Mafadi in the Drakensberg at 3,450 m (11,320 ft) is the highest peak The KwaZulu-Natal–Lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the Great Escarpment which reaches an altitude of over 3,000 m (9,800 ft) [115]\n\n\nClimate\nSouth Africa has a generally temperate climate because it is surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides, because it is located in the climatically milder Southern Hemisphere, and because its average elevation rises steadily toward the north (toward the equator) and further inland This varied topography and oceanic influence result in a great variety of climatic zones The climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern Namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the border with Mozambique and the Indian Ocean Winters in South Africa occur between June and August The extreme southwest has a climate similar to that of the Mediterranean with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket This area produces much of the wine in South Africa and is known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year The severity of this wind made passing around the Cape of Good Hope particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many shipwrecks Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape The annual rainfall increases south of the Lowveld, especially near the coast, which is subtropical The Free State is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau North of the Vaal River, the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat Johannesburg, in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 m (5,709 ft) above sea level and receives an annual rainfall of 760 mm (29.9 in) Winters in this region are cold, although snow is rare [123]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nSouth Africa signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 4 June 1994 and became a party to the convention on 2 November 1995 [132] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 7 June 2006 [133] The country is ranked sixth out of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries [134] Ecotourism in South Africa has become more prevalent in recent years, as a possible method of maintaining and improving biodiversity.\n\n\nDemographics\nSouth Africa is a nation of about 62 million (as of 2022) people of diverse origins, cultures, languages, and religions [145] The last census was held in 2022, with estimates produced on an annual basis According to the United Nations' World Population Prospects, South Africa's total population was 55.3 million in 2015, compared to only 13.6 million in 1950 [146] South Africa is home to an estimated five million illegal immigrants, including some three million Zimbabweans [147] [148] [149] A series of anti-immigrant riots occurred beginning in May 2008 [150] [151]\n\n\nLanguages\nSouth Africa has 12 official languages: [5] Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, English, Pedi, [155] Tswana, Southern Sotho, Tsonga, Swazi, Venda, and Southern Ndebele (in order of first language speakers), as well as South African Sign Language which was recognised as an official language in 2023 [5] In this regard it is fourth only to Bolivia, India, and Zimbabwe in number While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others According to the 2022 census, the three most spoken first languages are Zulu (24.4%), Xhosa (16.6%), and Afrikaans (10.6%) [8] Although English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it is only the fifth most common home language, that of only 8.7% of South Africans in 2022; nevertheless, it has become the de facto lingua franca of the nation [8] Estimates based on the 1991 census suggest just under half of South Africans could speak English [156] It is the second most commonly spoken language outside of the household, after Zulu [157]\n\n\nReligion\nAccording to the 2001 census, Christians accounted for 79.8% of the population, with a majority of them being members of various Protestant denominations (broadly defined to include syncretic African-initiated churches) and a minority of Roman Catholics and other Christians Christian category includes Zion Christian (11.1%), Pentecostal (Charismatic) (8.2%), Roman Catholic (7.1%), Methodist (6.8%), Dutch Reformed (6.7%), and Anglican (3.8%) Members of remaining Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population Muslims accounted for 1.5% of the population, Hindus 1.2%, [160] traditional African religions 0.3% and Judaism 0.2% 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 0.6% were \"other\" and 1.4% were \"unspecified.\" [161] [160] [162] [163]\n\n\nEducation\nThe adult literacy rate in 2007 was 89% [169] South Africa has a three-tier system of education starting with primary school, followed by high school, and tertiary education in the form of (academic) universities and universities of technology Learners have twelve years of formal schooling, from grade 1 to 12 Grade R, or grade 0, is a pre-primary foundation year [170] Primary schools span the first seven years of schooling [171] High school education spans a further five years The National Senior Certificate examination takes place at the end of grade 12 and is necessary for tertiary studies at a South African university [170] Public universities are divided into three types: traditional universities, which offer theoretically oriented university degrees; universities of technology (formerly called technikons), which offer vocationally-oriented diplomas and degrees; and comprehensive universities, which offer both types of qualification There are 23 public universities in South Africa: 11 traditional universities, 6 universities of technology, and 6 comprehensive universities.\n\n\nHealth\nAccording to the South African Institute of Race Relations, the life expectancy in 2009 was 71 years for a white South African and 48 years for a black South African [174] The healthcare spending in the country is about 9% of GDP [175] About 84% of the population depends on the public healthcare system, [175] which is beset with chronic human resource shortages and limited resources [176] About 20% of the population use private healthcare [177] Only 16% of the population are covered by medical aid schemes; [178] the rest pay for private care out-of-pocket or through in-hospital-only plans [177] The three dominant hospital groups, Mediclinic, Life Healthcare and Netcare, together control 75% of the private hospital market [177]\n\n\nHIV/AIDS\nAccording to the 2015 UNAIDS medical report, South Africa has an estimated seven million people who are living with HIV – more than any other country in the world [179] In 2018, HIV prevalence—the percentage of people living with HIV—among adults (15–49 years) was 20.4%, and in the same year 71,000 people died from an AIDS-related illness [180]\n\n\nUrbanization\nOne online database [187] lists South Africa having more than 12,600 cities and towns The following are the largest cities and towns in South Africa.\n\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nSouth Africa is a parliamentary republic, but unlike most such republics, the president is both head of state and head of government and depends for their tenure on the confidence of Parliament The executive, legislature, and judiciary are all subject to the supremacy of the Constitution of South Africa, and the superior courts have the power to strike down executive actions and acts of Parliament if they are unconstitutional The National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, consists of 400 members and is elected every five years by a system of party-list proportional representation The National Council of Provinces, the upper house, consists of ninety members, with each of the nine provincial legislatures electing ten members.\n\n\nForeign relations\nAs the Union of South Africa, the country was a founding member of the United Nations (UN), with Prime Minister Jan Smuts writing the preamble to the UN Charter [202] [203] South Africa is one of the founding members of the African Union (AU) and has the third largest economy of all the members It is a founding member of the AU's New Partnership for Africa's Development After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the Commonwealth of Nations The country is a member of the Group of 77 and chaired the organisation in 2006 South Africa is also a member of the Southern African Development Community, South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone, Southern African Customs Union, Antarctic Treaty System, World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, G20, G8+5, and the Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe South African National Defence Force (SANDF) was created in 1994 [207] [208] as a volunteer military composed of the former South African Defence Force, the forces of the African nationalist groups (uMkhonto we Sizwe and Azanian People's Liberation Army), and the former Bantustan defence forces [207] The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the South African Army, the South African Air Force, the South African Navy, and the South African Military Health Service [209] The SANDF consists of around 75,000 professional soldiers as of 2019 [210] In recent years, the SANDF has become a major peacekeeping force in Africa, [211] and has been involved in operations in Lesotho, the DRC, [211] and Burundi, [211] amongst others It has also served in multinational UN Peacekeeping forces such as the UN Force Intervention Brigade In 2022 the nation spent US$3.069 billion on its armed forces which is about 0.86% of the nation's entire GDP Over the years, defence expenditure has been cut as the nation currently faces no external military threats [212]\n\n\nLaw enforcement and crime\nLaw enforcement in South Africa is primarily the responsibility of the South African Police Service (SAPS), South Africa's national police force SAPS is responsible for investigating crime and security throughout the country The South African Police Service has over 1,154 police stations across the country and over 150,950 officers [224] In 2023 the Special Task Force (SAPS) placed 9th at the international SWAT competition out of 55 law enforcement teams from across the world making it the best in Africa [225]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nEach of the nine provinces is governed by a unicameral legislature, which is elected every five years by party-list proportional representation The legislature elects a premier as head of government, and the premier appoints an Executive Council as a provincial cabinet The powers of provincial governments are limited to topics listed in the constitution; these topics include such fields as health, education, public housing and transport.\n\n\nEconomy\nSouth Africa has a mixed economy In Africa, the country's economy is the most industrialized and technologically advanced, [244] as well as the largest It also has a relatively high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita compared to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa US$16,080 at purchasing power parity as of 2023 ranked 95th Despite this, South Africa is still burdened by a relatively high rate of poverty and unemployment and is ranked in the top ten countries in the world for income inequality, [245] [246] [247] measured by the Gini coefficient.\n\n\nMining\nMining has been a major component of South Africa's economy throughout its history Until 2006 South Africa was the world's largest gold producer for almost a century, by the end of 2009 gold mining in South Africa had declined rapidly having produced 205 metric tons (mt) of gold in 2008 compared to 1,000 metric tons produced in 1970 (almost 80% of the world's mine supply at the time) [259] Despite this, the country still has 6,000 tonnes of gold reserves [260] and is still number 5 in gold production and remains a cornucopia of mineral riches [261] South Africa is home to worlds deepest gold mine, Mponeng Gold Mine, reaching nearly 4000m depth  [262]It is the world's largest producer [263] of chrome, manganese, platinum, vanadium and vermiculite It is the second largest producer [263] of ilmenite, palladium, rutile and zirconium It is the world's third largest coal exporter [264] It is a huge producer of iron ore; in 2012, it overtook India to become the world's third-biggest iron ore supplier to China, the world's largest consumers of iron ore [265]\n\n\nTourism\nSouth Africa is a tourist destination with the tourist industry accounting for 2.34% of GDP [266] in 2019 followed by a sharp drop in 2020 to 0.81% of GDP [266] due to lack of travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic The official marketing agency for the country South African Tourism is responsible for marketing South Africa to the world According to the World Travel & Tourism Council, the tourism industry directly contributed ZAR 102 billion to South African GDP in 2012, and supports 10.3% of jobs in the country [267] The official national marketing agency of the South African government, with the goal of promoting tourism in South Africa both locally and globally is known as South African Tourism [268]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nSouth Africa has a total road network of 750,000 kilometres, the largest of any African country and the 12th largest in the world According to SANRAL, the road network is valued at more than R2.1 trillion SANRAL manages national roads and has a network of 22 197 kilometres of paved roads Provinces are responsible for 222 951 kilometres while, according to the DoT, the municipal network is estimated at 275 661 kilometres of the proclaimed network The rest are unproclaimed gravel roads (mainly serving rural communities) and are therefore not owned or maintained by any road authority The country has more than 12 million motor vehicles with an average density of 16 motor vehicles per kilometre The provincial road network is about 222 951 kilometres in length, consisting of 170 837 kilometres of unpaved and 52 114 kilometres of paved roads [271]\n\n\nRoads\nSouth Africa has a total road network of 750,000 kilometres, the largest of any African country and the 12th largest in the world According to SANRAL, the road network is valued at more than R2.1 trillion SANRAL manages national roads and has a network of 22 197 kilometres of paved roads Provinces are responsible for 222 951 kilometres while, according to the DoT, the municipal network is estimated at 275 661 kilometres of the proclaimed network The rest are unproclaimed gravel roads (mainly serving rural communities) and are therefore not owned or maintained by any road authority The country has more than 12 million motor vehicles with an average density of 16 motor vehicles per kilometre The provincial road network is about 222 951 kilometres in length, consisting of 170 837 kilometres of unpaved and 52 114 kilometres of paved roads [271]\n\n\nRailways\nRail transport in South Africa is an important element of the country's transport infrastructure All major cities are connected by rail Transnet Freight Rail mainly operates freight services while PRASA operates commuter services State-owned utility Transnet Freight Rail is the largest freight rail transport operator on the African continent, the company maintains a rail network of approximately 31,000 kilometres but only 20,900 kilometres of this are in use [272]\n\n\nAirports\nSouth Africa has international airports in six cities: Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Kimberley and Nelspruit [277]\n\n\nEnergy\nSouth Africa has a very large energy sector and is currently the only country on the African continent that possesses a nuclear power plant [281] The country is the largest producer of electricity on the African continent and it ranks 21st globally [282] South Africa is the 7th largest coal producer in the world and produces in excess of 248 million tonnes of coal and consumes almost three-quarters of that domestically Around 77% of South Africa's energy needs are directly derived from coal and 92% of coal consumed on the African continent is mined in South Africa South Africa is also the world's 14th largest emitter of greenhouse gases [283]\n\n\nEnergy crisis\nDue to severe mismanagement and corruption at Eskom, the company is R392bn ($22bn) in debt and is unable to meet the demands of the South African power grid [288] Due to this, Eskom implemented loadshedding for the first time in 2007, which is periodically switching off electricity to specific power grids in specific time frames In South Africa, load shedding is done to prevent a failure of the entire system when the demand for electricity strains the capacity of Eskom's power generating system Load shedding is characterized by periods of widespread national-level rolling blackouts [289] Crime such as theft, and sabotage at Eskom power stations had also been a significant issue contributing to South Africa's energy crisis [290]\n\n\nScience and technology\nSeveral important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa South Africa was ranked 69th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [292] The first human-to-human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in December 1967; Max Theiler developed a vaccine against yellow fever, Allan MacLeod Cormack pioneered X-ray computed tomography (CT scan); and Aaron Klug developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques Cormack and Klug received Nobel Prizes for their work Sydney Brenner won in 2002, for his pioneering work in molecular biology Mark Shuttleworth founded an early Internet security company Thawte [293]\n\n\nTransport\nModes of transport include roads, railways, airports, water, and pipelines for petroleum oil The majority of people in South Africa use informal minibus taxis as their main mode of transport Bus rapid transit has been implemented in some cities in an attempt to provide more formalised and safer public transport services South Africa has many major ports including Cape Town, Durban, and Port Elizabeth that allow ships and other boats to pass through, some carrying passengers and some carrying petroleum tankers.\n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nTwo distinctive features of the South African water sector are the policy of free basic water and the existence of water boards, which are bulk water supply agencies that operate pipelines and sell water from reservoirs to municipalities These features have led to significant problems concerning the financial sustainability of service providers, leading to a lack of attention to maintenance Following the end of apartheid, the country had made improvements in the levels of access to water as those with access increased from 66% to 79% from 1990 to 2010 [295] Sanitation access increased from 71% to 79% during the same period [295] However, water supply and sanitation has come under increasing pressure in recent years despite a commitment made by the government to improve service standards and provide investment subsidies to the water industry [296]\n\n\nCulture\nThe South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives It is among these people that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly urbanised and Westernised, aspects of traditional culture have declined Members of the middle class, who have historically been predominantly white but whose ranks include growing numbers of black, Coloured and Indian people, [303] [304] have lifestyles similar in many respects to that of people found in Western Europe, North America and Australasia.\n\n\nArts\nSouth African art includes the oldest art objects in the world, which were discovered in a South African cave and dated from roughly 75,000 years ago [305] The scattered tribes of the Khoisan peoples moving into South Africa from around 10,000 BC had their own fluent art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings They were superseded by the Bantu/Nguni peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms Forms of art evolved in the mines and townships: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes The Dutch-influenced folk art of the Afrikaner trekboers and the urban white artists, earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards, also contributed to this eclectic mix which continues to evolve to this day.\n\n\nPopular culture\nThe South African media sector is large, and South Africa is one of Africa's major media centres While the many broadcasters and publications reflect the diversity of the population as a whole, the most commonly used language is English However, all ten other official languages are represented to some extent or another.\n\n\nLiterature\nSouth African literature emerged from a unique social and political history One of the first well known novels written by a black author in an African language was Solomon Thekiso Plaatje's Mhudi, written in 1930 During the 1950s, Drum magazine became a hotbed of political satire, fiction, and essays, giving a voice to the urban black culture.\n\n\nCuisine\nThe cuisine of South Africa is diverse, and foods from many different cultures and backgrounds are enjoyed by all communities, and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety available The cuisine is mostly meat-based and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as the braai, a variation of the barbecue South Africa has also developed into a major wine producer, with some of the best vineyards lying in valleys around Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, Paarl and Barrydale [310]\n\n\nSports\nSouth Africa's most popular sports are association football, rugby union and cricket [311] Other sports with significant support are swimming, athletics, golf, boxing, tennis, rugby league, ringball, field hockey, surfing and netball Although football (soccer) commands the greatest following among the youth, other sports like basketball, judo, softball and skateboarding are becoming increasingly popular amongst the populace [312]\n\n\nSee also\n World portal\n\n\nReferences\n World portal\n\n\nFurther reading\n World portal\n\n\nExternal links\n World

It is a vast and diverse country, with a population of over 62 million people, speaking 11 official languages. The country has a rich and complex history, with a mix of indigenous, European, and African cultures. South Africa is known for its stunning natural beauty, from the majestic mountains of the Drakensberg to the beautiful coastlines along the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"South Africa\" is derived from the country's geographic location at the southern tip of Africa. Upon formation, the country was named the Union of South Africa in English and Unie van Zuid-Afrika in Dutch, reflecting its origin from the unification of four British colonies. Since 1961, the long formal name in English has been the \"Republic of South Africa\" and Republiek van Suid-Afrika in Afrikaans. The country has an official name in 12 official languages.\n\nHistory\nSouth Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and human-fossil sites in the world. Archaeologists have recovered extensive fossil remains from a series of caves in Gauteng Province, the area known as \"the Cradle of Humankind\". The sites include Sterkfontein, one of the richest sites for hominin fossils in the world, as well as Swartkrans, Gondolin Cave, Kromdraai, Cooper's Cave and Malapa. Raymond Dart identified the first hominin fossil discovered in Africa, the Taung Child (found near Taung) in 1924. Other hominin remains have come from the sites of Makapansgat in Limpopo Province; Cornelia and Florisbad in Free State Province; Border Cave in KwaZulu-Natal Province; Klasies River Caves in Eastern Cape Province; and Pinnacle Point, Elandsfontein and Die Kelders Cave in Western Cape Province.\n\nPrehistoric Archaeology\nSouth Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and human-fossil sites in the world. Archaeologists have recovered extensive fossil remains from a series of caves in Gauteng Province, the area known as \"the Cradle of Humankind\". The sites include Sterkfontein, one of the richest sites for hominin fossils in the world, as well as Swartkrans, Gondolin Cave, Kromdraai, Cooper's Cave and Malapa.\n\nBantu Expansion\nSettlements of Bantu-speaking peoples, who were iron-using agriculturists and herdsmen, were present south of the Limpopo River (now the northern border with Botswana and Zimbabwe) by the 4th or 5th century CE. The Bantu slowly moved south. The earliest ironworks in modern-day KwaZulu-Natal Province are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the Xhosa people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoisan people. The Xhosa reached the Great Fish River, in today's Eastern Cape Province. As they migrated, these larger Iron Age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples.\n\nPortuguese Exploration\nIn 1487, the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias led the first European voyage to land in southern Africa. On 4 December, he landed at Walfisch Bay (now known as Walvis Bay in present-day Namibia). This was south of the furthest point reached in 1485 by his predecessor, the Portuguese navigator Diogo Cão (Cape Cross, north of the bay). Dias continued down the western coast of southern Africa. After 8 January 1488, prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast, he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of Africa without seeing it. He reached as far up the eastern coast of Africa as, what he called, Rio do Infante, probably the present-day Groot River, in May 1488. On his return he saw the cape, which he named Cabo das Tormentas ('Cape of Storms'). King John II renamed the point Cabo da Boa Esperança, or Cape of Good Hope, as it led to the riches of the East Indies.\n\nDutch Colonisation\nBy the early 17th century, Portugal's maritime power was starting to decline, and English and Dutch merchants competed to oust Portugal from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade. Representatives of the British East India Company sporadically called at the cape in search of provisions as early as 1601 but later came to favour Ascension Island and Saint Helena as alternative ports of refuge. Dutch interest was aroused after 1647, when two employees of the Dutch East India Company were shipwrecked at the cape for several months. They also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil. Upon their return to Holland, they reported favourably on the cape's potential as a \"warehouse and garden\" for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages.\n\nBritish Colonisation and the Great Trek\nGreat Britain occupied Cape Town between 1795 and 1803 to prevent it from falling under the control of the French First Republic, which had invaded the Low Countries. After briefly returning to Dutch rule under the Batavian Republic in 1803, the cape was occupied again by the British in 1806. Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, it was formally ceded to Great Britain and became an integral part of the British Empire. British emigration to South Africa began around 1818, subsequently culminating in the arrival of the 1820 Settlers. The new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons, namely to increase the size of the European workforce and to bolster frontier regions against Xhosa incursions.\n\nBoer Wars\nThe Boer republics successfully resisted British encroachments during the First Boer War (1880-1881) using guerrilla warfare tactics, which were well-suited to local conditions. The British returned with greater numbers, more experience, and new strategy in the Second Boer War (1899-1902) and, although suffering heavy casualties due to Boer attrition warfare, they were ultimately successful due in part to scorched earth tactics such as concentration camps, in which 27,000 Boer civilians died due to a combination of disease and neglect.\n\nIndependence\nAnti-British policies among white South Africans focused on independence. During the Dutch and British colonial years, racial segregation was mostly informal, though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of indigenous people, including the Native Location Act of 1879 and the system of pass laws.\n\nApartheid Era\nIn 1948, the National Party was elected to power. It strengthened the racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule. Taking Canada's Indian Act as a framework, the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races (Whites, Blacks, Indians and Coloured people (people of mixed race)) and developed rights and limitations for each. The white minority (less than 20%) controlled the vastly larger black majority. The legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid. While whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of Africa, comparable to First World Western nations, the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. The Freedom Charter, adopted in 1955 by the Congress Alliance, demanded a non-racial society and an end to discrimination.\n\nPost-Apartheid\nThe Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith, signed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Harry Schwarz in 1974, enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all, the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in South Africa. Ultimately, F.W de Klerk opened bilateral discussions with Nelson Mandela in 1993 for a transition of policies and government.\n\nGeography\nSouth Africa is in southernmost Africa, with a coastline that stretches more than 2,500 km (1,553 mi) and along two oceans (the South Atlantic and the Indian). At 1,219,912 km2 (471,011 sq mi), South Africa is the 24th-largest country in the world. Excluding the Prince Edward Islands, the country lies between latitudes 22° and 35°S, and longitudes 16° and 33°E. The interior of South Africa consists of a large, in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between 1,000 m (3,300 ft) and 2,100 m (6,900 ft), highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north, and slightly so to the south and south-west. This plateau is surrounded by the Great Escarpment, whose eastern, and highest, stretch is known as the Drakensberg. Mafadi in the Drakensberg at 3,450 m (11,320 ft) is the highest peak. The KwaZulu-Natal-Lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the Great Escarpment which reaches an altitude of over 3,000 m (9,800 ft).\n\nClimate\nSouth Africa has a generally temperate climate because it is surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides, because it is located in the climatically milder Southern Hemisphere, and because its average elevation rises steadily toward the north (toward the equator) and further inland. This varied topography and oceanic influence result in a great variety of climatic zones. The climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern Namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the border with Mozambique and the Indian Ocean. Winters in South Africa occur between June and August. The extreme southwest has a climate similar to that of the Mediterranean with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket. This area produces much of the wine in South Africa and is known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the Cape of Good Hope particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many shipwrecks. Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. The annual rainfall increases south of the Lowveld, especially near the coast, which is subtropical. The Free State is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the Vaal River, the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat. Johannesburg, in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 m (5,709 ft) above sea level and receives an annual rainfall of 760 mm (29.9 in). Winters in this region are cold, although snow is rare.\n\nBiodiversity\nSouth Africa signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 4 June 1994 and became a party to the convention on 2 November 1995. It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 7 June 2006. The country is ranked sixth out of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries. Ecotourism in South Africa has become more prevalent in recent years, as a possible method of maintaining and improving biodiversity.\n\nDemographics\nSouth Africa is a nation of about 62 million (as of 2022) people of diverse origins, cultures, languages, and religions. The last census was held in 2022, with estimates produced on an annual basis. According to the United Nations' World Population Prospects, South Africa's total population was 55.3 million in 2015, compared to only 13.6 million in 1950. South Africa is home to an estimated five million illegal immigrants, including some three million Zimbabweans. A series of anti-immigrant riots occurred beginning in May 2008.\n\nLanguages\nSouth Africa has 12 official languages: Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, English, Pedi, Tswana, Southern Sotho, Tsonga, Swazi, Venda, and Southern Ndebele (in order of first language speakers), as well as South African Sign Language, which was recognised as an official language in 2023. In this regard, it is fourth only to Bolivia, India, and Zimbabwe in number. While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2022 census, the three most spoken first languages are Zulu (24.4%), Xhosa (16.6%), and Afrikaans (10.6%). Although English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it is only the fifth most common home language, that of only 8.7% of South Africans in 2022; nevertheless, it has become the de facto lingua franca of the nation. Estimates based on the 1991 census suggest just under half of South Africans could speak English. It is the second most commonly used language outside of the household, after Zulu.\n\nReligion\nAccording to the 2001 census, Christians accounted for 79.8% of the population, with a majority of them being members of various Protestant denominations (broadly defined to include syncretic African-initiated churches) and a minority of Roman Catholics and other Christians. Christian category includes Zion Christian (11.1%), Pentecostal (Charismatic) (8.2%), Roman Catholic (7.1%), Methodist (6.8%), Dutch Reformed (6.7%), and Anglican (3.8%). Members of remaining Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population. Muslims accounted for 1.5% of the population, Hindus 1.2%, traditional African religions 0.3% and Judaism 0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 0.6% were \"other\" and 1.4% were \"unspecified\".\n\nEducation\nThe adult literacy rate in 2007 was 89%. South Africa has a three-tier system of education starting with primary school, followed by high school, and tertiary education in the form of (academic) universities and universities of technology. Learners have twelve years of formal schooling, from grade 1 to 12. Grade R, or grade 0, is a pre-primary foundation year. Primary schools span the first seven years of schooling. High school education spans a further five years. The National Senior Certificate examination takes place at the end of grade 12 and is necessary for tertiary studies at a South African university. Public universities are divided into three types: traditional universities, which offer theoretically oriented university degrees; universities of technology (formerly called technikons), which offer vocationally oriented diplomas and degrees; and comprehensive universities, which offer both types of qualification. There are 23 public universities in South Africa: 11 traditional universities, 6 universities of technology, and 6 comprehensive universities.\n\nHealth\nAccording to the South African Institute of Race Relations, the life expectancy in 2009 was 71 years for a white South African and 48 years for a black South African. The healthcare spending in the country is about 9% of GDP. About 84% of the population depends on the public healthcare system, which is beset with chronic human resource shortages and limited resources. About 20% of the population use private healthcare. Only 16% of the population are covered by medical aid schemes; the rest pay for private care out-of-pocket or through in-hospital-only plans. The three dominant hospital groups, Mediclinic, Life Healthcare and Netcare, together control 75% of the private hospital market.\n\nHIV/AIDS\nAccording to the 2015 UNAIDS medical report, South Africa has an estimated seven million people who are living with HIV – more than any other country in the world. In 2018, HIV prevalence – the percentage of people living with HIV – among adults (15–49 years) was 20.4%, and in the same year 71,000 people died from an AIDS-related illness.\n\nUrbanization\nOne online database lists South Africa having more than 12,600 cities and towns. The following are the largest cities and towns in South Africa.\n\nGovernment and Politics\nSouth Africa is a parliamentary republic, but unlike most such republics, the president is both head of state and head of government and depends for their tenure on the confidence of Parliament. The executive, legislature, and judiciary are all subject to the supremacy of the Constitution of South Africa, and the superior courts have the power to strike down executive actions and acts of Parliament if they are unconstitutional. The National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, consists of 400 members and is elected every five years by a system of party-list proportional representation. The National Council of Provinces, the upper house, consists of ninety members, with each of the nine provincial legislatures electing ten members.\n\nForeign Relations\nAs the Union of South Africa, the country was a founding member of the United Nations (UN), with Prime Minister Jan Smuts writing the preamble to the UN Charter. South Africa is one of the founding members of the African Union (AU) and has the third largest economy of all the members. It is a founding member of the AU's New Partnership for Africa's Development. After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the Commonwealth of Nations. The country is a member of the Group of 77 and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is also a member of the Southern African Development Community, South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone, Southern African Customs Union, Antarctic Treaty System, World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, G20, G8+5, and the Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa.\n\nMilitary\nThe South African National Defence Force (SANDF) was created in 1994 as a volunteer military composed of the former South African Defence Force, the forces of the African nationalist groups (uMkhonto we Sizwe and Azanian People's Liberation Army), and the former Bantustan defence forces. The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the South African Army, the South African Air Force, the South African Navy, and the South African Military Health Service. The SANDF consists of around 75,000 professional soldiers as of 2019. In recent years, the SANDF has become a major peacekeeping force in Africa, and has been involved in operations in Lesotho, the DRC, amongst others. It has also served in multinational UN Peacekeeping forces such as the UN Force Intervention Brigade. In 2022 the nation spent US$3.069 billion on its armed forces which is about 0.86% of the nation's entire GDP. Over the years, defence expenditure has been cut as the nation currently faces no external military threats.\n\nLaw Enforcement and Crime\nLaw enforcement in South Africa is primarily the responsibility of the South African Police Service (SAPS), South Africa's national police force. SAPS is responsible for investigating crime and security throughout the country. The South African Police Service has over 1,154 police stations across the country and over 150,950 officers. In 2023 the Special Task Force (SAPS) placed 9th at the international SWAT competition out of 55 law enforcement teams from across the world making it the best in Africa.\n\nAdministrative Divisions\nEach of the nine provinces is governed by a unicameral legislature, which is elected every five years by party-list proportional representation. The legislature elects a premier as head of government, and the premier appoints an Executive Council as a provincial cabinet. The powers of provincial governments are limited to topics listed in the constitution; these topics include such fields as health, education, public housing and transport.\n\nEconomy\nSouth Africa has a mixed", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"South_Africa\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"South Africa\" is derived from the country's geographic location at the southern tip of Africa Upon formation, the country was named the Union of South Africa in English and Unie van Zuid-Afrika in Dutch, reflecting its origin from the unification of four British colonies Since 1961, the long formal name in English has been the \"Republic of South Africa\" and Republiek van Suid-Afrika in Afrikaans The country has an official name in 12 official languages [29] [30]\n\n\nHistory\nSouth Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and human-fossil sites in the world [34] [35] [36] Archaeologists have recovered extensive fossil remains from a series of caves in Gauteng Province The area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been branded \"the Cradle of Humankind\" The sites include Sterkfontein, one of the richest sites for hominin fossils in the world, as well as Swartkrans, Gondolin Cave, Kromdraai, Cooper's Cave and Malapa Raymond Dart identified the first hominin fossil discovered in Africa, the Taung Child (found near Taung) in 1924 Other hominin remains have come from the sites of Makapansgat in Limpopo Province; Cornelia and Florisbad in Free State Province; Border Cave in KwaZulu-Natal Province; Klasies River Caves in Eastern Cape Province; and Pinnacle Point, Elandsfontein and Die Kelders Cave in Western Cape Province [37]\n\n\nPrehistoric archaeology\nSouth Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and human-fossil sites in the world [34] [35] [36] Archaeologists have recovered extensive fossil remains from a series of caves in Gauteng Province The area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has been branded \"the Cradle of Humankind\" The sites include Sterkfontein, one of the richest sites for hominin fossils in the world, as well as Swartkrans, Gondolin Cave, Kromdraai, Cooper's Cave and Malapa Raymond Dart identified the first hominin fossil discovered in Africa, the Taung Child (found near Taung) in 1924 Other hominin remains have come from the sites of Makapansgat in Limpopo Province; Cornelia and Florisbad in Free State Province; Border Cave in KwaZulu-Natal Province; Klasies River Caves in Eastern Cape Province; and Pinnacle Point, Elandsfontein and Die Kelders Cave in Western Cape Province [37]\n\n\nBantu expansion\nSettlements of Bantu-speaking peoples, who were iron-using agriculturists and herdsmen, were present south of the Limpopo River (now the northern border with Botswana and Zimbabwe) by the 4th or 5th century CE The Bantu slowly moved south The earliest ironworks in modern-day KwaZulu-Natal Province are believed to date from around 1050 The southernmost group was the Xhosa people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoisan people The Xhosa reached the Great Fish River, in today's Eastern Cape Province As they migrated, these larger Iron Age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples In Mpumalanga Province, several stone circles have been found along with a stone arrangement that has been named Adam's Calendar, and the ruins are thought to be created by the Bakone, a Northern Sotho people [41] [42]\n\n\nPortuguese exploration\nIn 1487, the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias led the first European voyage to land in southern Africa [43] On 4 December, he landed at Walfisch Bay (now known as Walvis Bay in present-day Namibia) This was south of the furthest point reached in 1485 by his predecessor, the Portuguese navigator Diogo Cão (Cape Cross, north of the bay) Dias continued down the western coast of southern Africa After 8 January 1488, prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast, he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of Africa without seeing it He reached as far up the eastern coast of Africa as, what he called, Rio do Infante, probably the present-day Groot River, in May 1488 On his return he saw the cape, which he named Cabo das Tormentas ('Cape of Storms') King John II renamed the point Cabo da Boa Esperança, or Cape of Good Hope, as it led to the riches of the East Indies [44] Dias' feat of navigation was immortalised in Luís de Camões' 1572 epic poem Os Lusíadas.\n\n\nDutch colonisation\nBy the early 17th century, Portugal's maritime power was starting to decline, and English and Dutch merchants competed to oust Portugal from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade [45] Representatives of the British East India Company sporadically called at the cape in search of provisions as early as 1601 but later came to favour Ascension Island and Saint Helena as alternative ports of refuge [46] Dutch interest was aroused after 1647, when two employees of the Dutch East India Company were shipwrecked at the cape for several months The sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives [46] They also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil [47] Upon their return to Holland, they reported favourably on the cape's potential as a \"warehouse and garden\" for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages [46]\n\n\nBritish colonisation and the Great Trek\nGreat Britain occupied Cape Town between 1795 and 1803 to prevent it from falling under the control of the French First Republic, which had invaded the Low Countries [53] After briefly returning to Dutch rule under the Batavian Republic in 1803, the cape was occupied again by the British in 1806 [54] Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, it was formally ceded to Great Britain and became an integral part of the British Empire [55] British emigration to South Africa began around 1818, subsequently culminating in the arrival of the 1820 Settlers [55] The new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons, namely to increase the size of the European workforce and to bolster frontier regions against Xhosa incursions [55]\n\n\nBoer Wars\nThe Boer republics successfully resisted British encroachments during the First Boer War (1880–1881) using guerrilla warfare tactics, which were well-suited to local conditions The British returned with greater numbers, more experience, and new strategy in the Second Boer War (1899–1902) and, although suffering heavy casualties due to Boer attrition warfare, they were ultimately successful due in part to scorched earth tactics such as concentration camps, in which 27,000 Boer civilians died due to a combination of disease and neglect [63]\n\n\nIndependence\nAnti-British policies among white South Africans focused on independence During the Dutch and British colonial years, racial segregation was mostly informal, though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of indigenous people, including the Native Location Act of 1879 and the system of pass laws [65] [66] [67] [68] [69]\n\n\nApartheid era\nIn 1948, the National Party was elected to power It strengthened the racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule Taking Canada's Indian Act as a framework, [73] the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races (Whites, Blacks, Indians and Coloured people (people of mixed race)) and developed rights and limitations for each The white minority (less than 20%) [74] controlled the vastly larger black majority The legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid While whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of Africa, comparable to First World Western nations, the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy [75] The Freedom Charter, adopted in 1955 by the Congress Alliance, demanded a non-racial society and an end to discrimination.\n\n\nPost-apartheid\nThe Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith, signed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Harry Schwarz in 1974, enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all, the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in South Africa Ultimately, F.W de Klerk opened bilateral discussions with Nelson Mandela in 1993 for a transition of policies and government.\n\n\nGeography\nSouth Africa is in southernmost Africa, with a coastline that stretches more than 2,500 km (1,553 mi) and along two oceans (the South Atlantic and the Indian) At 1,219,912 km2 (471,011 sq mi), [110] South Africa is the 24th-largest country in the world [111] Excluding the Prince Edward Islands, the country lies between latitudes 22° and 35°S, and longitudes 16° and 33°E The interior of South Africa consists of a large, in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between 1,000 m (3,300 ft) and 2,100 m (6,900 ft), highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north, and slightly so to the south and south-west [112] This plateau is surrounded by the Great Escarpment [113] whose eastern, and highest, stretch is known as the Drakensberg [114] Mafadi in the Drakensberg at 3,450 m (11,320 ft) is the highest peak The KwaZulu-Natal–Lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the Great Escarpment which reaches an altitude of over 3,000 m (9,800 ft) [115]\n\n\nClimate\nSouth Africa has a generally temperate climate because it is surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides, because it is located in the climatically milder Southern Hemisphere, and because its average elevation rises steadily toward the north (toward the equator) and further inland This varied topography and oceanic influence result in a great variety of climatic zones The climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern Namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the border with Mozambique and the Indian Ocean Winters in South Africa occur between June and August The extreme southwest has a climate similar to that of the Mediterranean with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket This area produces much of the wine in South Africa and is known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year The severity of this wind made passing around the Cape of Good Hope particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many shipwrecks Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape The annual rainfall increases south of the Lowveld, especially near the coast, which is subtropical The Free State is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau North of the Vaal River, the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat Johannesburg, in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 m (5,709 ft) above sea level and receives an annual rainfall of 760 mm (29.9 in) Winters in this region are cold, although snow is rare [123]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nSouth Africa signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 4 June 1994 and became a party to the convention on 2 November 1995 [132] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 7 June 2006 [133] The country is ranked sixth out of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries [134] Ecotourism in South Africa has become more prevalent in recent years, as a possible method of maintaining and improving biodiversity.\n\n\nDemographics\nSouth Africa is a nation of about 62 million (as of 2022) people of diverse origins, cultures, languages, and religions [145] The last census was held in 2022, with estimates produced on an annual basis According to the United Nations' World Population Prospects, South Africa's total population was 55.3 million in 2015, compared to only 13.6 million in 1950 [146] South Africa is home to an estimated five million illegal immigrants, including some three million Zimbabweans [147] [148] [149] A series of anti-immigrant riots occurred beginning in May 2008 [150] [151]\n\n\nLanguages\nSouth Africa has 12 official languages: [5] Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, English, Pedi, [155] Tswana, Southern Sotho, Tsonga, Swazi, Venda, and Southern Ndebele (in order of first language speakers), as well as South African Sign Language which was recognised as an official language in 2023 [5] In this regard it is fourth only to Bolivia, India, and Zimbabwe in number While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others According to the 2022 census, the three most spoken first languages are Zulu (24.4%), Xhosa (16.6%), and Afrikaans (10.6%) [8] Although English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it is only the fifth most common home language, that of only 8.7% of South Africans in 2022; nevertheless, it has become the de facto lingua franca of the nation [8] Estimates based on the 1991 census suggest just under half of South Africans could speak English [156] It is the second most commonly spoken language outside of the household, after Zulu [157]\n\n\nReligion\nAccording to the 2001 census, Christians accounted for 79.8% of the population, with a majority of them being members of various Protestant denominations (broadly defined to include syncretic African-initiated churches) and a minority of Roman Catholics and other Christians Christian category includes Zion Christian (11.1%), Pentecostal (Charismatic) (8.2%), Roman Catholic (7.1%), Methodist (6.8%), Dutch Reformed (6.7%), and Anglican (3.8%) Members of remaining Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population Muslims accounted for 1.5% of the population, Hindus 1.2%, [160] traditional African religions 0.3% and Judaism 0.2% 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 0.6% were \"other\" and 1.4% were \"unspecified.\" [161] [160] [162] [163]\n\n\nEducation\nThe adult literacy rate in 2007 was 89% [169] South Africa has a three-tier system of education starting with primary school, followed by high school, and tertiary education in the form of (academic) universities and universities of technology Learners have twelve years of formal schooling, from grade 1 to 12 Grade R, or grade 0, is a pre-primary foundation year [170] Primary schools span the first seven years of schooling [171] High school education spans a further five years The National Senior Certificate examination takes place at the end of grade 12 and is necessary for tertiary studies at a South African university [170] Public universities are divided into three types: traditional universities, which offer theoretically oriented university degrees; universities of technology (formerly called technikons), which offer vocationally-oriented diplomas and degrees; and comprehensive universities, which offer both types of qualification There are 23 public universities in South Africa: 11 traditional universities, 6 universities of technology, and 6 comprehensive universities.\n\n\nHealth\nAccording to the South African Institute of Race Relations, the life expectancy in 2009 was 71 years for a white South African and 48 years for a black South African [174] The healthcare spending in the country is about 9% of GDP [175] About 84% of the population depends on the public healthcare system, [175] which is beset with chronic human resource shortages and limited resources [176] About 20% of the population use private healthcare [177] Only 16% of the population are covered by medical aid schemes; [178] the rest pay for private care out-of-pocket or through in-hospital-only plans [177] The three dominant hospital groups, Mediclinic, Life Healthcare and Netcare, together control 75% of the private hospital market [177]\n\n\nHIV/AIDS\nAccording to the 2015 UNAIDS medical report, South Africa has an estimated seven million people who are living with HIV – more than any other country in the world [179] In 2018, HIV prevalence—the percentage of people living with HIV—among adults (15–49 years) was 20.4%, and in the same year 71,000 people died from an AIDS-related illness [180]\n\n\nUrbanization\nOne online database [187] lists South Africa having more than 12,600 cities and towns The following are the largest cities and towns in South Africa.\n\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nSouth Africa is a parliamentary republic, but unlike most such republics, the president is both head of state and head of government and depends for their tenure on the confidence of Parliament The executive, legislature, and judiciary are all subject to the supremacy of the Constitution of South Africa, and the superior courts have the power to strike down executive actions and acts of Parliament if they are unconstitutional The National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, consists of 400 members and is elected every five years by a system of party-list proportional representation The National Council of Provinces, the upper house, consists of ninety members, with each of the nine provincial legislatures electing ten members.\n\n\nForeign relations\nAs the Union of South Africa, the country was a founding member of the United Nations (UN), with Prime Minister Jan Smuts writing the preamble to the UN Charter [202] [203] South Africa is one of the founding members of the African Union (AU) and has the third largest economy of all the members It is a founding member of the AU's New Partnership for Africa's Development After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the Commonwealth of Nations The country is a member of the Group of 77 and chaired the organisation in 2006 South Africa is also a member of the Southern African Development Community, South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone, Southern African Customs Union, Antarctic Treaty System, World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, G20, G8+5, and the Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa.\n\n\nMilitary\nThe South African National Defence Force (SANDF) was created in 1994 [207] [208] as a volunteer military composed of the former South African Defence Force, the forces of the African nationalist groups (uMkhonto we Sizwe and Azanian People's Liberation Army), and the former Bantustan defence forces [207] The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the South African Army, the South African Air Force, the South African Navy, and the South African Military Health Service [209] The SANDF consists of around 75,000 professional soldiers as of 2019 [210] In recent years, the SANDF has become a major peacekeeping force in Africa, [211] and has been involved in operations in Lesotho, the DRC, [211] and Burundi, [211] amongst others It has also served in multinational UN Peacekeeping forces such as the UN Force Intervention Brigade In 2022 the nation spent US$3.069 billion on its armed forces which is about 0.86% of the nation's entire GDP Over the years, defence expenditure has been cut as the nation currently faces no external military threats [212]\n\n\nLaw enforcement and crime\nLaw enforcement in South Africa is primarily the responsibility of the South African Police Service (SAPS), South Africa's national police force SAPS is responsible for investigating crime and security throughout the country The South African Police Service has over 1,154 police stations across the country and over 150,950 officers [224] In 2023 the Special Task Force (SAPS) placed 9th at the international SWAT competition out of 55 law enforcement teams from across the world making it the best in Africa [225]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nEach of the nine provinces is governed by a unicameral legislature, which is elected every five years by party-list proportional representation The legislature elects a premier as head of government, and the premier appoints an Executive Council as a provincial cabinet The powers of provincial governments are limited to topics listed in the constitution; these topics include such fields as health, education, public housing and transport.\n\n\nEconomy\nSouth Africa has a mixed economy In Africa, the country's economy is the most industrialized and technologically advanced, [244] as well as the largest It also has a relatively high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita compared to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa US$16,080 at purchasing power parity as of 2023 ranked 95th Despite this, South Africa is still burdened by a relatively high rate of poverty and unemployment and is ranked in the top ten countries in the world for income inequality, [245] [246] [247] measured by the Gini coefficient.\n\n\nMining\nMining has been a major component of South Africa's economy throughout its history Until 2006 South Africa was the world's largest gold producer for almost a century, by the end of 2009 gold mining in South Africa had declined rapidly having produced 205 metric tons (mt) of gold in 2008 compared to 1,000 metric tons produced in 1970 (almost 80% of the world's mine supply at the time) [259] Despite this, the country still has 6,000 tonnes of gold reserves [260] and is still number 5 in gold production and remains a cornucopia of mineral riches [261] South Africa is home to worlds deepest gold mine, Mponeng Gold Mine, reaching nearly 4000m depth  [262]It is the world's largest producer [263] of chrome, manganese, platinum, vanadium and vermiculite It is the second largest producer [263] of ilmenite, palladium, rutile and zirconium It is the world's third largest coal exporter [264] It is a huge producer of iron ore; in 2012, it overtook India to become the world's third-biggest iron ore supplier to China, the world's largest consumers of iron ore [265]\n\n\nTourism\nSouth Africa is a tourist destination with the tourist industry accounting for 2.34% of GDP [266] in 2019 followed by a sharp drop in 2020 to 0.81% of GDP [266] due to lack of travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic The official marketing agency for the country South African Tourism is responsible for marketing South Africa to the world According to the World Travel & Tourism Council, the tourism industry directly contributed ZAR 102 billion to South African GDP in 2012, and supports 10.3% of jobs in the country [267] The official national marketing agency of the South African government, with the goal of promoting tourism in South Africa both locally and globally is known as South African Tourism [268]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nSouth Africa has a total road network of 750,000 kilometres, the largest of any African country and the 12th largest in the world According to SANRAL, the road network is valued at more than R2.1 trillion SANRAL manages national roads and has a network of 22 197 kilometres of paved roads Provinces are responsible for 222 951 kilometres while, according to the DoT, the municipal network is estimated at 275 661 kilometres of the proclaimed network The rest are unproclaimed gravel roads (mainly serving rural communities) and are therefore not owned or maintained by any road authority The country has more than 12 million motor vehicles with an average density of 16 motor vehicles per kilometre The provincial road network is about 222 951 kilometres in length, consisting of 170 837 kilometres of unpaved and 52 114 kilometres of paved roads [271]\n\n\nRoads\nSouth Africa has a total road network of 750,000 kilometres, the largest of any African country and the 12th largest in the world According to SANRAL, the road network is valued at more than R2.1 trillion SANRAL manages national roads and has a network of 22 197

unproclaimed gravel roads (mainly serving rural communities) and are therefore not owned or maintained by any road authority The country has more than 12 million motor vehicles with an average density of 16 motor vehicles per kilometre The provincial road network is about 222 951 kilometres in length, consisting of 170 837 kilometres of unpaved and 52 114 kilometres of paved roads [271]\n\n\nRailways\nRail transport in South Africa is an important element of the country's transport infrastructure All major cities are connected by rail Transnet Freight Rail mainly operates freight services while PRASA operates commuter services State-owned utility Transnet Freight Rail is the largest freight rail transport operator on the African continent, the company maintains a rail network of approximately 31,000 kilometres but only 20,900 kilometres of this are in use [272]\n\n\nAirports\nSouth Africa has international airports in six cities: Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Kimberley and Nelspruit [277]\n\n\nEnergy\nSouth Africa has a very large energy sector and is currently the only country on the African continent that possesses a nuclear power plant [281] The country is the largest producer of electricity on the African continent and it ranks 21st globally [282] South Africa is the 7th largest coal producer in the world and produces in excess of 248 million tonnes of coal and consumes almost three-quarters of that domestically Around 77% of South Africa's energy needs are directly derived from coal and 92% of coal consumed on the African continent is mined in South Africa South Africa is also the world's 14th largest emitter of greenhouse gases [283]\n\n\nEnergy crisis\nDue to severe mismanagement and corruption at Eskom, the company is R392bn ($22bn) in debt and is unable to meet the demands of the South African power grid [288] Due to this, Eskom implemented loadshedding for the first time in 2007, which is periodically switching off electricity to specific power grids in specific time frames In South Africa, load shedding is done to prevent a failure of the entire system when the demand for electricity strains the capacity of Eskom's power generating system Load shedding is characterized by periods of widespread national-level rolling blackouts [289] Crime such as theft, and sabotage at Eskom power stations had also been a significant issue contributing to South Africa's energy crisis [290]\n\n\nScience and technology\nSeveral important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa South Africa was ranked 69th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024 [292] The first human-to-human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in December 1967; Max Theiler developed a vaccine against yellow fever, Allan MacLeod Cormack pioneered X-ray computed tomography (CT scan); and Aaron Klug developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques Cormack and Klug received Nobel Prizes for their work Sydney Brenner won in 2002, for his pioneering work in molecular biology Mark Shuttleworth founded an early Internet security company Thawte [293]\n\n\nTransport\nModes of transport include roads, railways, airports, water, and pipelines for petroleum oil The majority of people in South Africa use informal minibus taxis as their main mode of transport Bus rapid transit has been implemented in some cities in an attempt to provide more formalised and safer public transport services South Africa has many major ports including Cape Town, Durban, and Port Elizabeth that allow ships and other boats to pass through, some carrying passengers and some carrying petroleum tankers.\n\n\nWater supply and sanitation\nTwo distinctive features of the South African water sector are the policy of free basic water and the existence of water boards, which are bulk water supply agencies that operate pipelines and sell water from reservoirs to municipalities These features have led to significant problems concerning the financial sustainability of service providers, leading to a lack of attention to maintenance Following the end of apartheid, the country had made improvements in the levels of access to water as those with access increased from 66% to 79% from 1990 to 2010 [295] Sanitation access increased from 71% to 79% during the same period [295] However, water supply and sanitation has come under increasing pressure in recent years despite a commitment made by the government to improve service standards and provide investment subsidies to the water industry [296]\n\n\nCulture\nThe South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives It is among these people that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly urbanised and Westernised, aspects of traditional culture have declined Members of the middle class, who have historically been predominantly white but whose ranks include growing numbers of black, Coloured and Indian people, [303] [304] have lifestyles similar in many respects to that of people found in Western Europe, North America and Australasia.\n\n\nArts\nSouth African art includes the oldest art objects in the world, which were discovered in a South African cave and dated from roughly 75,000 years ago [305] The scattered tribes of the Khoisan peoples moving into South Africa from around 10,000 BC had their own fluent art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings They were superseded by the Bantu/Nguni peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms Forms of art evolved in the mines and townships: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes The Dutch-influenced folk art of the Afrikaner trekboers and the urban white artists, earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards, also contributed to this eclectic mix which continues to evolve to this day.\n\n\nPopular culture\nThe South African media sector is large, and South Africa is one of Africa's major media centres While the many broadcasters and publications reflect the diversity of the population as a whole, the most commonly used language is English However, all ten other official languages are represented to some extent or another.\n\n\nLiterature\nSouth African literature emerged from a unique social and political history One of the first well known novels written by a black author in an African language was Solomon Thekiso Plaatje's Mhudi, written in 1930 During the 1950s, Drum magazine became a hotbed of political satire, fiction, and essays, giving a voice to the urban black culture.\n\n\nCuisine\nThe cuisine of South Africa is diverse, and foods from many different cultures and backgrounds are enjoyed by all communities, and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety available The cuisine is mostly meat-based and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as the braai, a variation of the barbecue South Africa has also developed into a major wine producer, with some of the best vineyards lying in valleys around Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, Paarl and Barrydale [310]\n\n\nSports\nSouth Africa's most popular sports are association football, rugby union and cricket [311] Other sports with significant support are swimming, athletics, golf, boxing, tennis, rugby league, ringball, field hockey, surfing and netball Although football (soccer) commands the greatest following among the youth, other sports like basketball, judo, softball and skateboarding are becoming increasingly popular amongst the populace [312]\n\n\nSee also\n World

{"title": "Mortal_Kombat", "content": "\nGameplay\nThe original three games and their updates, Mortal Kombat (1992), Mortal Kombat II (1993), Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), and Mortal Kombat Trilogy (1996), are 2D fighting games The arcade cabinet versions of the first two used a joystick and five buttons: high punch, low punch, high kick, low kick, and block; Mortal Kombat 3 and its updates added a sixth \"run\" button [1] Characters in the early Mortal Kombat games play virtually identically to one another, with the only major differences being their special moves [2] Through the 1990s, the developer and publisher Midway Games kept their single-styled fighting moves with four attack buttons for a different array of punches, kicks and blocks Mortal Kombat 4  was the first Mortal Kombat game in which the characters could move in three dimensions and the first to use 3D computer graphics From Deadly Alliance to Mortal Kombat: Deception, characters had three fighting styles per character: two unarmed styles, and one weapon style [3] While most of the styles used in the series are based on real martial arts, some are fictitious [4] Goro's fighting styles, for example, are designed to take advantage of the fact that he has four arms For Armageddon, fighting styles were reduced to a maximum of two per character (generally one hand-to-hand combat style and one weapon style) due to the sheer number of playable characters [5] Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe dropped multiple fighting styles for most characters in favor of giving each character a wider variety of special moves [6] [7] 2011's Mortal Kombat returned to a single 2D fighting plane, although characters are rendered in 3D; [8] unlike previous Mortal Kombat games, each of the controller's four attack buttons corresponds to one of the character's limbs, the buttons thus becoming front punch, back punch, front kick and back kick (\"front\" indicates the limb that is closer to the opponent, and \"back\" indicates the limb that is farther away from the opponent).\n\n\nFinishing moves\nI think  [Mortal Kombat] represents the difference in philosophy  [....] So in Street Fighter when you're playing it's the moment to moment gameplay that should be the best, whether you win or lose doesn't really matter Whereas in Mortal Kombat the fighting and playing is just a pathway to get to the result – it's the Fatality you want to see and you almost want to skip the fighting bit and get to the Fatality because that is the result [11]\n\n\nPlot\nThe series takes place in a fictional universe consisting of numerous realms which, according to in-game backstories, were created by the Elder Gods, an ancient, ethereal pantheon of almightest, eternal preternatural beings The Mortal Kombat: Deception manual described six of the realms as: \"Earthrealm, home to such legendary heroes as Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Sonya Blade, Johnny Cage, and Jax Briggs, and under the protection of the Thunder God Raiden; Netherrealm, the fiery depths of which are inhospitable to all but the most vile, a realm of demons and shadowy warriors such as Quan Chi and Noob Saibot; Outworld, a realm of constant strife which Emperor Shao Kahn claims as his own; Seido, the Realm of Order, whose inhabitants prize structure and order above all else; the Realm of Chaos, whose inhabitants do not abide by any rules whatsoever, and where constant turmoil and change are worshiped; and Edenia, which is known for its beauty, artistic expression, and the longevity of its inhabitants.\" [17] [18] The Elder Gods decreed that the denizens of one realm could only conquer another realm by defeating the defending realm's greatest warriors in ten consecutive martial arts tournaments, called Mortal Kombat.\n\n\nCharacters\nThrough its iterations, the series has featured scores of player characters, some of them becoming mainstays, such as Baraka, Cassie Cage, Cyrax, Ermac, Fujin, Goro, Jade, Jax, Johnny Cage, Kabal, Kano, Kenshi, Kintaro, Kitana, Kung Lao, Li Mei, Liu Kang, Mileena, Motaro, Nightwolf, Noob Saibot, Quan Chi, Raiden, Rain, Reptile, Scorpion, Sektor, Shang Tsung, Shao Kahn, Sheeva, Shinnok, Sindel, Skarlet, Smoke, Sonya Blade, Stryker, Sub-Zero and Tanya Among them are Earth's humans and cyborgs, good and evil deities, and denizens of Outworld and other realms.\n\n\nDevelopment\nMortal Kombat started development in 1991 with four people: Ed Boon (programming), John Tobias (art and story), John Vogel (graphics), and Dan Forden (sound design) [22] [23] According to Mortal Kombat actors Richard Divizio and Daniel Pesina, the first game began as a ninja-themed project by John Tobias (a young new employee of Midway Games at the time) and them as well as Carlos Pesina, however their pitch to Tobias' boss Ed Boon was rejected by the management of Midway [24] Midway was approached to create a video game adaptation of the then-upcoming 1992 film Universal Soldier, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, [25] and Tobias imagined a fighting game featuring a digitized version of Van Damme [26] Intending to make a game \"a lot more hard edge, a little bit more serious, a little bit more like Enter the Dragon or Bloodsport\" than contemporary cartoonish fighting games, [27] Tobias and Boon decided to continue their project even after the deal to use the Bloodsport license fell through [28] The first of Mortal Kombat characters, [24] Johnny Cage (Daniel Pesina), became \"a spoof on the whole Van Damme situation.\" [25] Divizio credits himself with convincing Tobias to go back to the original idea and trying again [24]\n\n\nOrigins\nMortal Kombat started development in 1991 with four people: Ed Boon (programming),

the original Mortal Kombat and its initial sequels were created using digitized sprites mostly based on filmed actors, as opposed to hand-drawn graphics [39] Mortal Kombat games were known for their extensive use of palette swapping, which was used for the ninja characters; many of the most popular characters have originated as palette swaps [40] In the first game, the male ninja fighters were essentially the same character; only the colors of their attire, fighting stance, and special techniques mark a difference [40] Later games added further ninjas based on the same model, as well as several female ninja color swap characters initially also using just one base model All of them gradually became very different characters in the following installments of the series Eventually, Mortal Kombat 4 brought the series into 3D, replacing the digitized fighters of previous games with polygon models animated using motion capture technology [41]\n\n\nHidden content\nMost series releases included secret characters, secret games, and other Easter eggs The original game contained the hidden fighter Reptile, who could be fought by players if they fulfilled an exact set of requirements A counter for ERMACS (short for error macros) on the game's audits screen was additionally interpreted by players as referring to a second hidden character named Ermac Midway denied the character's existence in the series before adding him to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 in response to the player rumors and feedback [42] [43]\n\n\nGames\nThe original Mortal Kombat game was released by Midway in arcades during October 1992, and has been ported to several console and home computer systems, with early ports released by Acclaim Entertainment [50] The sequel, Mortal Kombat II, was released for arcades in 1993, featuring an increased roster and improved graphics and gameplay, then ported to the numerous home systems in 1993–1995, released again by Acclaim [51] Mortal Kombat 3 followed in 1995 in both arcade and home versions [52] Mortal Kombat 3 received two updates which expanded the number of characters and other features from the game: Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, released that same year in arcades, [53] and Mortal Kombat Trilogy, released for home consoles the following year [54] The following game, Mortal Kombat 4, was released in 1997, and marked the jump of the series to 3D rendered graphics instead of the digitized 2D graphics used in previous games Mortal Kombat 4 was ported to the PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Microsoft Windows Mortal Kombat 4 was the last Mortal Kombat game released for arcades Its updated version titled Mortal Kombat Gold was released for the Dreamcast in 1999.\n\n\nMain series\nThe original Mortal Kombat game was released by Midway

titles that work as spin-offs from the Mortal Kombat storyline Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero was released in 1997 for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64; [70] [71] its story is focused on the first incarnation character of Sub-Zero and is focused in the timeline before the first Mortal Kombat game The next action game was Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, released in 2000 for the PlayStation, starring Major Jackson Briggs in his mission to destroy the Black Dragon [72] Both games were critically panned (although the reception of Mythologies was more mediocre) Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, developed by Midway Studios Los Angeles, was released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox, starring Liu Kang and Kung Lao and telling an alternate version of the events between the first and second Mortal Kombat games A similar game entitled Mortal Kombat: Fire & Ice, which was to star Scorpion and again Sub-Zero, was canceled when the developers of Shaolin Monks \"couldn't do it in time and under budget\" [73] On October 18, 2022, Mortal Kombat: Onslaught was announced; it is a role-playing game released in 2023 for Android and iOS NetherRealm said it would be a cinematic experience and also it will be loyal to its core visceral nature [74]\n\n\nOther media\nAn animated prequel to 1995's Mortal Kombat film, titled Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins, was released direct-to-video in

game was Mortal Kombat II, which had unprecedented opening week sales figures never seen before in the video game industry, for the first time beating the box office numbers of summer hit films [179] The Mortal Kombat games, however, have not been localized in Japan after the Super Famicom release of Mortal Kombat II, due to content guidelines against depictions of blood, gore and dismemberment

[180]).\n\n\nRatings, reviews, and awards\nThe 2008 edition of Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition awarded the Mortal Kombat series with seven world records, including \"most successful fighting game series\" [184] The franchise holds ten world records in the 2011 Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition, including the \"largest promotional campaign for a fighting video game\" (Mortal Kombat 3), \"highest grossing film based on a beat ‘em up video game\" (Mortal Kombat 1996), and \"most successful video game spin-off soundtrack album\" (Mortal Kombat: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) [185]\n\n\nLegacy and cultural impact\nAccording to IGN, during the 1990s \"waves of imitators began to flood the market, filling arcades with a sea of blood from games like Time Killers, Survival Arts, and Guardians of the Hood Mortal Kombat had ushered in an era of exploitation games, both on consoles and in arcades, all engaging in a battle to see who can cram the most blood and guts onto a low-res screen.\" [1] Notable Mortal Kombat clones, featuring violent finishing moves and/or digitized sprites, included Bio F.R.E.A.K.S., BloodStorm, Cardinal Syn, Catfight, Eternal Champions, Kasumi Ninja, Killer Instinct, Mace: The Dark Age, Primal Rage, Street Fighter: The Movie, Tattoo Assassins, Thrill Kill, Ultra Vortek, Way of the Warrior, and Midway's own War Gods [193] [194] John Tobias commented: \"Some of the copycat products back then kind of came and went because, on the surface level, the violence will attract some attention, but if there's not much to the product behind it, you're not going to last very long.\" [30]\n\n\nCompetitive play\nFighting games have been a popular genre among tournaments since the late 1990s Mortal Kombat has its place in some of the world's biggest fighting game tournaments including Evo and Combo Breaker, as well as many local and online tournaments around the world Since the 2011 Mortal Kombat game was released, the game has been one of the most popular games at these events Between 2014 and 2017, the game was mostly absent from the tournament scene, due to NetherRealm Studios being focused on their Injustice series as their top priority; [199] Mortal Kombat games returned to Combo Breaker in 2018 [200]\n\n\nControversies\nThe series was subject of a major video game controversy [201] and several court cases, largely related to its extremely violent content, especially in relation to the original game which paved a way for the introduction of the ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) game rating system in 1994 as well as the Australian Classification Board [28] [202] [203] [204] [205] Various games in the series, as well as advertisements for them, have been censored or banned in a number of countries According to SuperData Research CEO Joost van Dreunen, \"Because of the obvious rift between gamers on the one hand and adult society on the other, Mortal Kombat set the tone for what constituted gamer culture.\" [206]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Mortal Kombat**\n\nMortal Kombat is a popular fighting game franchise created by Midway Games and later acquired by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The series debuted in 1992 and has since become one of the most successful and iconic franchises in the gaming industry.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe original three games and their updates, Mortal Kombat (1992), Mortal Kombat II (1993), Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), and Mortal Kombat Trilogy (1996), are 2D fighting games. The arcade cabinet versions of the first two used a joystick and five buttons: high punch, low punch, high kick, low kick, and block. Mortal Kombat 3 and its updates added a sixth \"run\" button.

Mortal Kombat 4 was the first Mortal Kombat game in which the characters could move in three dimensions and the first to use 3D computer graphics. From Deadly Alliance to Mortal Kombat: Deception, characters had three fighting styles per character: two unarmed styles, and one weapon style. While most of the styles used in the series are based on real martial arts, some are fictitious. Goro's fighting styles, for example, are designed to take advantage of the fact that he has four arms. Armageddon reduced fighting styles to a maximum of two per character (generally one hand-to-hand combat style and one weapon style) due to the sheer number of playable characters. Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe dropped multiple fighting styles for most characters in favor of giving each character a wider variety of special moves. 2011's Mortal Kombat returned to a single 2D fighting plane, although characters are rendered in 3D; unlike previous Mortal Kombat games, each of the controller's four attack buttons corresponds to one of the character's limbs.\n\n**Finishing Moves**\n\nThe series is known for its finishing moves, also known as \"fatalities.\" Finishing moves are special moves that can be performed by the player to kill their opponent in a gruesome manner. The goal of a finishing move is to eliminate the opponent in the most creative and violent way possible. The first Mortal Kombat game introduced the concept of finishing moves, and it has since become a staple of the series. Finishing moves are often humorous and over-the-top, and they have become a key part of the series' appeal. The series' developers have continually pushed the boundaries of what is considered acceptable in a finishing move, often incorporating elaborate special effects and gruesome violence.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe series takes place in a fictional universe consisting of numerous realms, which were created by the Elder Gods, an ancient, ethereal pantheon of almighty, eternal preternatural beings. The Mortal Kombat: Deception manual described six of the realms as: \"Earthrealm, home to such legendary heroes as Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Sonya Blade, Johnny Cage, and Jax Briggs, and under the protection of the Thunder God Raiden; Netherrealm, the fiery depths of which are inhospitable to all but the most vile, a realm of demons and shadowy warriors such as Quan Chi and Noob Saibot; Outworld, a realm of constant strife which Emperor Shao Kahn claims as his own; Seido, the Realm of Order, whose inhabitants prize structure and order above all else; the Realm of Chaos, whose inhabitants do not abide by any rules whatsoever, and where constant turmoil and change are worshiped; and Edenia, which is known for its beauty, artistic expression, and the longevity of its inhabitants.\" The Elder Gods decreed that the denizens of one realm could only conquer another realm by defeating the defending realm's greatest warriors in ten consecutive martial arts tournaments, called Mortal Kombat.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThrough its iterations, the series has featured scores of player characters, some of them becoming mainstays, such as Baraka, Cassie Cage, Cyrax, Ermac, Fujin, Goro, Jade, Jax, Johnny Cage, Kabal, Kano, Kenshi, Kintaro, Kitana, Kung Lao, Li Mei, Liu Kang, Mileena, Motaro, Nightwolf, Noob Saibot, Quan Chi, Raiden, Rain, Reptile, Scorpion, Sektor, Shang Tsung, Shao Kahn, Sheeva, Shinnok, Sindel, Skarlet, Smoke, Sonya Blade, Stryker, Sub-Zero, and Tanya. Among them are Earth's humans and cyborgs, good and evil deities, and denizens of Outworld and other realms.\n\n**Development**\n\nMortal Kombat started development in 1991 with four people: Ed Boon (programming), John Tobias (art and story), John Vogel (graphics), and Dan Forden (sound design). According to Mortal Kombat actors Richard Divizio and Daniel Pesina, the first game began as a ninja-themed project by John Tobias and them as well as Carlos Pesina, however their pitch to Tobias' boss Ed Boon was rejected by the management of Midway. Midway was approached to create a video game adaptation of the then-upcoming 1992 film Universal Soldier, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Tobias imagined a fighting game featuring a digitized version of Van Damme. Intending to make a game \"a lot more hard edge, a little bit more serious, a little bit more like Enter the Dragon or Bloodsport\" than contemporary cartoonish fighting games, Tobias and Boon decided to continue their project even after the deal to use the Bloodsport license fell through. The first of Mortal Kombat characters, Johnny Cage (Daniel Pesina), became \"a spoof on the whole Van Damme situation.\" Divizio credits himself with convincing Tobias to go back to the original idea and trying again.\n\n**Graphics**\n\nThe characters of the original Mortal Kombat and its initial sequels were created using digitized sprites mostly based on filmed actors, as opposed to hand-drawn graphics. Mortal Kombat games were known for their extensive use of palette swapping, which was used for the ninja characters; many of the most popular characters have originated as palette swaps. In the first game, the male ninja fighters were essentially the same character; only the colors of their attire, fighting stance, and special techniques mark a difference. Later games added further ninjas based on the same model, as well as several female ninja color swap characters initially also using just one base model. All of them gradually became very different characters in the following installments of the series. Eventually, Mortal Kombat 4 brought the series into 3D, replacing the digitized fighters of previous games with polygon models animated using motion capture technology.\n\n**Hidden Content**\n\nMost series releases included secret characters, secret games, and other Easter eggs. The original game contained the hidden fighter Reptile, who could be fought by players if they fulfilled an exact set of requirements. A counter for ERMACS (short for error macros) on the game's audits screen was additionally interpreted by players as referring to a second hidden character named Ermac. Midway denied the character's existence in the series before adding him to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 in response to the player rumors and feedback.\n\n**Games**\n\nThe original Mortal Kombat game was released by Midway in arcades during October 1992, and has been ported to several console and home computer systems, with early ports released by Acclaim Entertainment. The sequel, Mortal Kombat II, was released for arcades in 1993, featuring an increased roster and improved graphics and gameplay, then ported to the numerous home systems in 1993–1995, released again by Acclaim. Mortal Kombat 3 followed in 1995 in both arcade and home versions. Mortal Kombat 3 received two updates which expanded the number of characters and other features from the game: Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, released that same year in arcades, and Mortal Kombat Trilogy, released for home consoles the following year. The following game, Mortal Kombat 4, was released in 1997, and marked the jump of the series to 3D rendered graphics instead of the digitized 2D graphics used in previous games. Mortal Kombat 4 was ported to the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Microsoft Windows. Mortal Kombat 4 was the last Mortal Kombat game released for arcades. Its updated version titled Mortal Kombat Gold was released for the Dreamcast in 1999.\n\n**Spin-off Games**\n\nBesides the fighting games, there are three action-adventure titles that work as spin-offs from the Mortal Kombat storyline. Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero was released in 1997 for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64; its story is focused on the first incarnation character of Sub-Zero and is focused in the timeline before the first Mortal Kombat game. The next action game was Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, released in 2000 for the PlayStation, starring Major Jackson Briggs in his mission to destroy the Black Dragon. Both games were critically panned (although the reception of Mythologies was more mediocre). Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, developed by Midway Studios Los Angeles, was released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox, starring Liu Kang and Kung Lao and telling an alternate version of the events between the first and second Mortal Kombat games. A similar game entitled Mortal Kombat: Fire & Ice, which was to star Scorpion and again Sub-Zero, was canceled when the developers of Shaolin Monks \"couldn't do it in time and under budget.\" On October 18, 2022, Mortal Kombat: Onslaught was announced; it is a role-playing game released in 2023 for Android and iOS. NetherRealm said it would be a cinematic experience and also it will be loyal to its core visceral nature.\n\n**Other Media**\n\nAn animated prequel to 1995's Mortal Kombat film, titled Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins, was released direct-to-video in the same year as the live-action film. An animated series titled Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm was released in 1996. It ran for one season and received negative reviews. In 1998, Mortal Kombat: Conquest was released. It lasted one season. In 2010, Warner Premiere ordered a web series inspired by the Rebirth short, titled Mortal Kombat: Legacy and also directed by Kevin Tancharoen. The series' first season was released for free on YouTube starting in April 2011, promoted by Machinima.com, and the second season arrived in 2013.\n\n**Print Media**\n\nMidway published official one-shot issues based on Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat II, which were written and illustrated by Tobias and set prior to the storylines of both games. From 1994 to 1995, Malibu Comics published a licensed series consisting of two six-issue miniseries in addition to one-shot specials and miniseries dedicated to specific characters. Special tie-in issues were packaged with the PC release of Mortal Kombat 4 and for Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe, respectively. A Mortal Kombat X series by DC Comics, set before the game's events, ran from January to September 2015 with three miniseries of twelve issues that were released weekly in 36 chapter installments.\n\n**Comics**\n\nMidway published official one-shot issues based on Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat II, which were written and illustrated by Tobias and set prior to the storylines of both games.

Novelizations of both Mortal Kombat feature films were written by Martin Delrio and Jerome Preisler, respectively.\n\n**Music**\n\nMortal Kombat: The Album, a techno album based on the first game, was created for Virgin America by Lords of Acid members Praga Khan and Oliver Adams as The Immortals in 1994. Its iconic theme \"Techno Syndrome,\" incorporating the \"Mortal Kombat!\" yell first shown in the Mortal Kombat commercial for home systems, was released in 1993 as a single and was used as a theme music for the Mortal Kombat film series. Each film had their own soundtracks (including the hit and award-winning compilation album Mortal Kombat: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), as had the second video game (Mortal Kombat II: Music from the Arcade Game Soundtrack). The 2011 video game saw the release of Mortal Kombat: Songs Inspired by the Warriors, a new soundtrack album featuring electronic music by various artists.\n\n**Television**\n\nAn animated series titled Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm was released in 1996. It ran for one season and received negative reviews. In 1998, Mortal Kombat: Conquest was released. It lasted one season. In 2010, Warner Premiere ordered a web series inspired by the Rebirth short, titled Mortal Kombat: Legacy and also directed by Kevin Tancharoen. The series' first season was released for free on YouTube starting in April 2011, promoted by Machinima.com, and the second season arrived in 2013.\n\n**Stage Show**\n\nA stage show titled Mortal Kombat: Live Tour was launched at the end of 1995, expanded to 1996, and featured Mortal Kombat characters in a theatrical display on stage.\n\n**Collectible Card Games**\n\nBradyGames produced the collectible card game Mortal Kombat Kard Game in 1995. The Duelist called the game a \"worse clone\" of Magic: the Gathering. Score Entertainment's 2005 collectible card game Epic Battles also used some of the Mortal Kombat characters.\n\n**Reception**\n\nMortal Kombat has been one of the most successful fighting game franchises in video game history, previously only trailing Bandai Namco's Tekken, Capcom's Street Fighter, and Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. As of 2021, it has surpassed the competitor fighting game franchises in worldwide lifetime series sales. It generated more than $4 billion by the late 1990s and $5 billion in total revenue by 2000. A particularly successful game was Mortal Kombat II, which had unprecedented opening week sales figures never seen before in the video game industry, for the first time beating the box office numbers of summer hit films. The Mortal Kombat games, however, have not been localized in Japan after the Super Famicom release of Mortal Kombat II, due to content guidelines against depictions of blood, gore, and dismemberment (Tobias blaming their \"very americanized\" character design).\n\n**Ratings, Reviews, and Awards**\n\nThe 2008 edition of Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition awarded the Mortal Kombat series with seven world records, including \"most successful fighting game series.\" The franchise holds ten world records in the 2011 Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition, including the \"largest promotional campaign for a fighting video game\" (Mortal Kombat 3), \"highest grossing film based on a beat ‘em up video game\" (Mortal Kombat 1996), and \"most successful video game spin-off soundtrack album\" (Mortal Kombat: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack).\n\n**Legacy and Cultural Impact**\n\nAccording to IGN, during the 1990s \"waves of imitators began to flood the market, filling arcades with a sea of blood from games like Time Killers, Survival Arts, and Guardians of the Hood. Mortal Kombat had ushered in an era of exploitation games, both on consoles and in arcades, all engaging in a battle to see who can cram the most blood and guts onto a low-res screen.\" Notable Mortal Kombat clones, featuring violent finishing moves and/or digitized sprites, included Bio F.R.E.A.K.S., BloodStorm, Cardinal Syn, Catfight, Eternal Champions, Kasumi Ninja, Killer Instinct, Mace: The Dark Age, Primal Rage, Street Fighter: The Movie, Tattoo Assassins, Thrill Kill, Ultra Vortek, Way of the Warrior, and Midway's own War Gods. John Tobias commented: \"Some of the copycat products back then kind of came and went because, on the surface level, the violence will attract some attention, but if there's not much to the product behind it, you're not going to last very long.\"\n\n**Competitive Play**\n\nFighting games have been a popular genre among tournaments since the late 1990s. Mortal Kombat has its place in some of the world's biggest fighting game tournaments, including Evo and Combo Breaker, as well as many local and online tournaments around the world. Since the 2011 Mortal Kombat game was released, the game has been one of the most popular games at these events. Between 2014 and 2017, the game was mostly absent from the tournament scene, due to NetherRealm Studios being focused on their Injustice series as their top priority. Mortal Kombat games returned to Combo Breaker in 2018.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nThe series was subject of a major video game controversy and several court cases, largely related to its extremely violent content, especially in relation to the original game which paved a way for the introduction of the ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) game rating system in 1994 as well as the Australian Classification Board. Various games in the series, as well as advertisements for them, have been censored or banned in a number of countries. According to SuperData Research CEO Joost van Dreunen, \"Because of the obvious rift between gamers on the one hand and adult society on the other, Mortal Kombat set the tone for what constituted gamer culture.\"\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Mortal Kombat (video game series)\n* List of Mortal Kombat characters\n* List of Mortal Kombat games\n* List of Mortal Kombat media\n\n**References**\n\n* Boon, Ed (2020).

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mortal_Kombat\" following this outline:\n\n\nGameplay\nThe original three games and their updates, Mortal Kombat (1992), Mortal Kombat II (1993), Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), and Mortal Kombat Trilogy (1996), are 2D fighting games The arcade cabinet versions of the first two used a joystick and five buttons: high punch, low punch, high kick, low kick, and block; Mortal Kombat 3 and its updates added a sixth \"run\" button [1] Characters in the early Mortal Kombat games play virtually identically to one another, with the only major differences being their special moves [2] Through the 1990s, the developer and publisher Midway Games kept their single-styled fighting moves with four attack buttons for a different array of punches, kicks and blocks Mortal Kombat 4  was the first Mortal Kombat game in which the characters could move in three dimensions and the first to use 3D computer graphics From Deadly Alliance to Mortal Kombat: Deception, characters had three fighting styles per character: two unarmed styles, and one weapon style [3] While most of the styles used in the series are based on real martial arts, some are fictitious [4] Goro's fighting styles, for example, are designed to take advantage of the fact that he has four arms For Armageddon, fighting styles were reduced to a maximum of two per character (generally one hand-to-hand combat style and one weapon style) due to the sheer number of playable characters [5] Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe dropped multiple fighting styles for most characters in favor of giving each character a wider variety of special moves [6] [7] 2011's Mortal Kombat returned to a single 2D fighting plane, although characters are rendered in 3D; [8] unlike previous Mortal Kombat games, each of the controller's four attack buttons corresponds to one of the character's limbs, the buttons thus becoming front punch, back punch, front kick and back kick (\"front\" indicates the limb that is closer to the opponent, and \"back\" indicates the limb that is farther away from the opponent).\n\n\nFinishing moves\nI think  [Mortal Kombat] represents the difference in philosophy  [....] So in Street Fighter when you're playing it's the moment to moment gameplay that should be the best, whether you win or lose doesn't really matter Whereas in Mortal Kombat the fighting and playing is just a pathway to get to the result – it's the Fatality you want to see and you almost want to skip the fighting bit and get to the Fatality because that is the result [11]\n\n\nPlot\nThe series takes place in a fictional universe consisting of numerous realms which, according to in-game backstories, were created by the Elder Gods, an ancient, ethereal pantheon of almightest, eternal preternatural beings The Mortal Kombat: Deception manual described six of the realms as: \"Earthrealm, home to such legendary heroes as Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Sonya Blade, Johnny Cage, and Jax Briggs, and under the protection of the Thunder God Raiden; Netherrealm, the fiery depths of which are inhospitable to all but the most vile, a realm of demons and shadowy warriors such as Quan Chi and Noob Saibot; Outworld, a realm of constant strife which Emperor Shao Kahn claims as his own; Seido, the Realm of Order, whose inhabitants prize structure and order above all else; the Realm of Chaos, whose inhabitants do not abide by any rules whatsoever, and where constant turmoil and change are worshiped; and Edenia, which is known for its beauty, artistic expression, and the longevity of its inhabitants.\" [17] [18] The Elder Gods decreed that the denizens of one realm could only conquer another realm by defeating the defending realm's greatest warriors in ten consecutive martial arts tournaments, called Mortal Kombat.\n\n\nCharacters\nThrough its iterations, the series has featured scores of player characters, some of them becoming mainstays, such as Baraka, Cassie Cage, Cyrax, Ermac, Fujin, Goro, Jade, Jax, Johnny Cage, Kabal, Kano, Kenshi, Kintaro, Kitana, Kung Lao, Li Mei, Liu Kang, Mileena, Motaro, Nightwolf, Noob Saibot, Quan Chi, Raiden, Rain, Reptile, Scorpion, Sektor, Shang Tsung, Shao Kahn, Sheeva, Shinnok, Sindel, Skarlet, Smoke, Sonya Blade, Stryker, Sub-Zero and Tanya Among them are Earth's humans and cyborgs, good and evil deities, and denizens of Outworld and other realms.\n\n\nDevelopment\nMortal Kombat started development in 1991 with four people: Ed Boon (programming), John Tobias (art and story), John Vogel (graphics), and Dan Forden (sound design) [22] [23] According to Mortal Kombat actors Richard Divizio and Daniel Pesina, the first game began as a ninja-themed project by John Tobias (a young new employee of Midway Games at the time) and them as well as Carlos Pesina, however their pitch to Tobias' boss Ed Boon was rejected by the management of Midway [24] Midway was approached to create a video game adaptation of the then-upcoming 1992 film Universal Soldier, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, [25] and Tobias imagined a fighting game featuring a digitized version of Van Damme [26] Intending to make a game \"a lot more hard edge, a little bit more serious, a little bit more like Enter the Dragon or Bloodsport\" than contemporary cartoonish fighting games, [27] Tobias and Boon decided to continue their project even after the deal to use the Bloodsport license fell through [28] The first of Mortal Kombat characters, [24] Johnny Cage (Daniel Pesina), became \"a spoof on the whole Van Damme situation.\" [25] Divizio credits himself with convincing Tobias to go back to the original idea and trying again [24]\n\n\nOrigins\nMortal Kombat started development in 1991 with four

[24]\n\n\nGraphics\nThe characters of the original Mortal Kombat and its initial sequels were created using digitized sprites mostly based on filmed actors, as opposed to hand-drawn graphics [39] Mortal Kombat games were known for their extensive use of palette swapping, which was used for the ninja characters; many of the most popular characters have originated as palette swaps [40] In the first game, the male ninja fighters were essentially the same character; only the colors of their attire, fighting stance, and special techniques mark a difference [40] Later games added further ninjas based on the same model, as well as several female ninja color swap characters initially also using just one base model All of them gradually became very different characters in the following installments of the series Eventually, Mortal Kombat 4 brought the series into 3D, replacing the digitized fighters of previous games with polygon models animated using motion capture technology [41]\n\n\nHidden content\nMost series releases included secret characters, secret games, and other Easter eggs The original game contained the hidden fighter Reptile, who could be fought by players if they fulfilled an exact set of requirements A counter for ERMACS (short for error macros) on the game's audits screen was additionally interpreted by players as referring to a second hidden character named Ermac Midway denied the character's existence in the series before adding him to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 in response to the player rumors and feedback [42] [43]\n\n\nGames\nThe original Mortal Kombat game was released by Midway in arcades during October 1992, and has been ported to several console and home computer systems, with early ports released by Acclaim Entertainment [50] The sequel, Mortal Kombat II, was released for arcades in 1993, featuring an increased roster and improved graphics and gameplay, then ported to the numerous home systems in 1993–1995, released again by Acclaim

its story is focused on the first incarnation character of Sub-Zero and is focused in the timeline before the first Mortal Kombat game The next action game was Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, released

Dean is an American attorney, author, and public speaker who served as the White House Counsel for President Richard Nixon from 1970 to 1973. He is best known for his role in the Watergate scandal and his subsequent cooperation with investigators.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nJohn Dean was born on October 14, 1938, in Akron, Ohio. He grew up in Marion, Ohio, the hometown of the 29th President of the United States, Warren Harding, whose biographer he later became. Dean's family moved to Flossmoor, Illinois, where he attended grade school. For high school, he attended Staunton Military Academy, where he became a close friend of the family of Barry Goldwater Jr., the son of Senator Barry Goldwater.\n\nDean attended Colgate University and then transferred to the College of Wooster in Ohio, where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1961. He received a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the Georgetown University Law Center in 1965.\n\n**Washington Lawyer**\n\nAfter graduation, Dean joined Welch & Morgan, a law firm in Washington, D.C. However, he was soon accused of conflict of interest violations and fired. He was alleged to have started negotiating his own private deal for a TV station broadcast license, after his firm had assigned him to complete the same task for a client.\n\n**Nixon Campaign and Administration**\n\nDean volunteered to write position papers on crime for Richard Nixon's presidential campaign in 1968. The following year, he became an associate deputy in the office of the Attorney General of the United States, serving under Attorney General John Mitchell, with whom he was on friendly terms. In July 1970, he accepted an appointment to serve as counsel to the president, after the previous holder of this post, Chuck Colson, became the president's director of the Office of Public Liaison.\n\n**Watergate Scandal**\n\nOn January 27, 1972, Dean, the White House Counsel, met with Jeb Magruder (Deputy Director of the Committee to Re-Elect the President, or CRP and CREEP) and Mitchell (Attorney General of the United States, and soon-to-be Director of CRP), in Mitchell's office, for a presentation by G. Gordon Liddy (counsel for CRP and a former FBI agent). Liddy presented a preliminary plan for intelligence-gathering operations during the campaign. Reaction to Liddy's plan was highly unfavorable. Liddy was ordered to scale down his ideas, and he presented a revised plan to the same group on February 4, which was also left unapproved.\n\n**Start of Watergate**\n\nOn May 27, 1972, Dean, the White House Counsel, met with E. Howard Hunt, G. Gordon Liddy, and other individuals at the Watergate complex. The meeting was part of a larger plan to gather intelligence on the Democratic Party. During the meeting, a break-in was occurring at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, and the participants were monitoring the situation.\n\n**Link to Cover-up**\n\nOn February 28, 1973, Acting FBI Director L. Patrick Gray testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee during his nomination to replace J. Edgar Hoover as director of the FBI. Armed with newspaper articles indicating the White House had possession of FBI Watergate files, committee chair Sam Ervin asked Gray what he knew about the White House obtaining the files. Gray said he had given FBI reports to Dean, and had discussed the FBI investigation with Dean on many occasions. It also came out that Gray had destroyed important evidence Dean entrusted to him. Gray's nomination failed and Dean was directly linked to the Watergate cover-up.\n\n**Cooperation with Prosecutors**\n\nOn March 22, 1973, Nixon requested that Dean put together a report with everything he knew about the Watergate matter, inviting him to take a retreat to Camp David to do so. Dean went to Camp David and did some work on a report, but since he was one of the cover-up's chief participants, the task put him in the difficult position of relating his own involvement as well as that of others. He correctly concluded that higher-ups were fitting him for the role of scapegoat. Dean did not complete the report.\n\n**Firing by Nixon**\n\nCoupled with his sense of distance from Nixon's inner circle, the \"Berlin Wall\" of advisors Haldeman and Ehrlichman, Dean sensed he was going to become the Watergate scapegoat and returned to Washington without completing his report. Nixon fired Dean on April 30, the same day he announced the resignations of Haldeman and Ehrlichman.\n\n**Testimony to Senate Watergate Committee**\n\nOn June 25, 1973, Dean began his testimony before the Senate Watergate Committee. The committee had voted to grant him use immunity. In his testimony, he implicated administration officials, including Mitchell, Nixon, and himself. His testimony attracted very high television ratings since he was breaking new ground in the investigation, and media attention grew apace, with more detailed newspaper coverage. Dean was the first administration official to accuse Nixon of direct involvement with Watergate and the resulting cover-up in press interviews.\n\n**Criminal Trial**\n\nDean pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice before Watergate trial judge John Sirica on October 19, 1973. He admitted supervising payments of \"hush money\" to the Watergate burglars, notably E. Howard Hunt, and revealed the existence of Nixon's enemies list. Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox was interested in meeting with Dean and planned to do so a few days later, but Cox was fired by Nixon the next day; it was not until a month later that Cox was replaced by Leon Jaworski. On August 2, 1974, Sirica handed down a sentence to Dean of one to four years in a minimum-security prison. But when Dean surrendered as scheduled on September 3, he was diverted to the custody of U.S. Marshals and kept instead at Fort Holabird (near Baltimore, Maryland) in a special \"safe house\" primarily used for witnesses against the Mafia.\n\n**Life After Watergate**\n\nShortly after Watergate, Dean became an investment banker, author, and lecturer based in Beverly Hills, California. He chronicled his White House experiences, with a focus on Watergate, in the memoirs Blind Ambition (1976) and Lost Honor (1982). Blind Ambition was ghostwritten by future Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Taylor Branch, and later made into a 1979 TV miniseries.\n\n**Investment Banker**\n\nDean worked as an investment banker for several years, before becoming a full-time author and lecturer. He has written numerous books and articles on politics, law, and history.\n\n**Watergate Comments**\n\nIn 2001, Dean published The Rehnquist Choice: The Untold Story of the Nixon Appointment that Redefined the Supreme Court, an exposé of the White House's selection process for a new Supreme Court justice in 1971, which led to the appointment of William Rehnquist.\n\n**Criticism of George W.

Bush, Worse than Watergate, in which he called for the impeachment of Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for allegedly lying to Congress.\n\n**Criticism of Donald Trump**\n\nDean later emerged as a strong critic of Donald Trump, saying in 2017 that he was even worse than Nixon. He said, \"It's a nightmare. They don't know what their jeopardy is. They don't know what they're looking at. They don't know if they're a part of a conspiracy that might unfold. They don't know whether to hire lawyers or not, how they're going to pay for them if they do. It's an unpleasant place.\"\n\n**Media Appearances and Portrayals**\n\nDean frequently served as a guest on the former MSNBC and Current TV news program, Countdown with Keith Olbermann, and The Randi Rhodes Show on Premiere Radio Networks.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Blind Ambition (1976)\n* Lost Honor (1982)\n* The Rehnquist Choice: The Untold Story of the Nixon Appointment that Redefined the Supreme Court (2001)\n* Worse than Watergate (2004)\n\n**References**\n\n* Dean, John.

{"title": "The_Satanic_Verses_controversy", "content": "\nBackground\nEven before the publication of The Satanic Verses, the books of Salman Rushdie had stoked controversy Rushdie saw his role as a writer \"as including the function of antagonist to the state\" [11] His second book Midnight's Children angered Indira Gandhi because it seemed to suggest \"that Mrs Gandhi was responsible for the death of her husband through neglect\" [12] His 1983 roman à clef Shame \"took an aim on Pakistan, its political characters, its culture and its religion..  [It covered] a central episode in Pakistan's internal life, which portrays as a family squabble between Iskander Harappa (Zulfikar Ali Bhutto) and his successor and executioner Raza Hyder (Zia ul-Haq).. 'The Virgin Ironpants'.. has been identified as Benazir Bhutto, a Prime Minister of Pakistan\" [12]\n\n\nControversial elements of The Satanic Verses\nThe title The Satanic Verses immediately sparked vehement protest against Rushdie's book The title refers to a legend of Muhammad; a few verses were supposedly spoken by him as part of the Qur'an which praised the pagan goddesses of Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat The verses were then withdrawn on the grounds that the devil had sent them to deceive Muhammad into thinking they came from God These \"Satanic Verses\" are said to have been revealed between verses 20 and 21 in Surah An-Najm of the Qur'an, [16] and feature in accounts by Al-Tabari and Ibn Ishaq The verses also appear in other accounts of the prophet's life Verse 23 in Surah An-Najm implies that the Satanic Verses were fabricated by the forefathers of idolaters \n\n\nEarly reaction\nBefore the publication of The Satanic Verses, the publisher received \"warnings from the publisher's editorial consultant\" that the book might be controversial [12] Later, Rushdie would reflect upon the time that the book was about to be published Speaking to an interviewer, he said, \"I expected a few mullahs would be offended, call me names, and then I could defend myself in public.. I honestly never expected anything like this\" [12]\n\n\nMuslim response and book bannings\nAfter the book was first published in the United Kingdom (in September 1988), there were protests by Muslims that predominantly took place in India and the UK When the book was published in February 1989 in the United States, it received renewed attention, and worldwide protests began to take a more violent form [citation needed]\n\n\nAttacks\nIn the United States, the FBI was notified of 78 threats to bookstores in early March 1989, thought to be a small proportion of the total number of threats The bookstore chain B Dalton, for instance, received 30 threats in less than three hours [citation needed] Bombings of book stores included two in Berkeley, California In New York, the office of a community newspaper, The Riverdale Press, was all but destroyed by firebombs following the publication of an editorial defending the right to read the novel and criticising the bookstores that pulled it from their shelves [33] But the United Kingdom was the country where violence against bookstores occurred most often and persisted the longest Two large bookstores in Charing Cross Road, London, (Collets and Dillons) were bombed on 9 April In May, explosions went off in the town of High Wycombe and again in London, on Kings Road Other bombings included one at a large London department store (Liberty's), in connection with the Penguin Bookshop inside the store, and at the Penguin store in York Unexploded devices were found at Penguin stores in Guildford, Nottingham, and Peterborough [34]\n\n\nFatwa by Ayatollah Khomeini\nOn 14 February 1989, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran and one of the most prominent Shi'a Muslim leaders, issued a fatwa calling for the death of Rushdie and his publishers This created a major international incident that persisted for many years.\n\n\nRushdie's apology and reaction\nOn 18 February, Iran's President Ali Khamenei (who would later that year succeed Khomeini as Supreme Leader) suggested that if Rushdie \"apologises and disowns the book, people may forgive him\" [40] Following this, Rushdie issued \"a carefully worded statement\", [40] saying:\n\n\nRushdie's apology\nOn 18 February, Iran's President Ali Khamenei (who would later that year succeed Khomeini as Supreme Leader) suggested that if Rushdie \"apologises and disowns the book, people may forgive him\" [40] Following this, Rushdie issued \"a carefully worded statement\", [40] saying:\n\n\nRejection of Rushdie's apology\nOn 19 February 1990, Ayatollah Khomeini's office replied:\n\n\nSupport for Khomeini's fatwa\nIn Britain, the Union of Islamic Students' Associations in Europe, which is the largest collective of Islamic Students in Europe, [citation needed] issued a statement offering to commit murder for Khomeini Despite incitement to murder being illegal in the United Kingdom, [42] one London property developer told reporters, \"If I see him, I will kill him straight away Take my name and address One day I will kill him\" [43]\n\n\nCriticism of Khomeini's fatwa\nKhomeini's fatwa was condemned across the Western world by governments on the grounds that it violated the universal human rights of free speech, freedom of religion, and that Khomeini had no right to condemn to death a citizen of another country living in that country [citation needed] The twelve members of the European Economic Community removed their ambassadors from Tehran for three weeks [39]\n\n\nOn Islamic grounds\nIn addition to criticism of the death sentence on the basis of human rights, the sentence was also criticised on Islamic grounds According to Bernard Lewis, a death warrant without trial, defence and other legal aspects of sharia violates Islamic jurisprudence In Islamic fiqh, apostasy by a mentally sound adult male is a capital crime For Lewis, fiqh also \"lays down procedures according to which a person accused of an offense is to be brought to trial, confronted with his accuser, and given the opportunity to defend himself.\" Lewis added that \" [a] judge will then give a verdict and if he finds the accused guilty, pronounce sentence\", and that \" [e]ven the most rigorous and extreme of the classical jurists only require a Muslim to kill anyone who insults the Prophet in his hearing and in his presence They say nothing about a hired killing for a reported insult in a distant country.\" [55]\n\n\nQuestions of political motivation\nSome speculate that the fatwa (or at least the reaffirmation of the death threat four days later) was issued with motives other than a sense of duty to protect Islam by punishing blasphemy/apostasy Namely:\n\n\nQuestions of personal motivation\nDespite claims by Iranian officials that \"Rushdie's book did not insult Iran or Iranian leaders\" and so they had no selfish personal motivation to attack the book, the book does include an eleven-page sketch of Khomeini's stay in Paris that could well be considered an insult to him It describes him as having \"grown monstrous, lying in the palace forecourt with his mouth yawning open at the gates; as the people march through the gates he swallows them whole\" In the words of one observer, \"If this is not an insult, Khomeini was far more tolerant than one might suppose\" [67] John Crowley has noted that the section of the book depicting the Khomeini-like character was selected to be read publicly by Rushdie in the promotional events leading up to and following the book's release [68] In Crowley's opinion, the fatwa was most likely declared because of this section of the novel and its public exposure, rather than the overall parodic treatment of Islam [68]\n\n\nAttempts to revoke the fatwa\nOn 24 September 1998, as a precondition to the restoration of diplomatic relations with Britain, the Iranian government, then headed by reformist Muhammad Khatami, gave a public commitment that it would \"neither support nor hinder assassination operations on Rushdie\" [69] [70] In early 2005, Khomeini's fatwa was reaffirmed by Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a message to Muslim pilgrims making the annual pilgrimage to Mecca [71] Additionally, the Revolutionary Guards have declared that the death sentence on him is still valid [72] Iran has rejected requests to withdraw the fatwa on the basis that only the person who issued it may withdraw it, [71] with Ruhollah Khomeini having died in 1989.\n\n\n2022 assassination attempt\nOn August 12, 2022 at around 10:47 a.m EDT, [74] a man stabbed Salman Rushdie as he was about to give a public lecture on the United States as safe haven for exiled writers at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York, United States [74] [75] [76] [77] The assailant stabbed him ten times, straining to continue the attack even as several people held him back [74] One of these people was the co-founder of City of Asylum, Henry Reese, onstage at the time, about to begin interviewing Rushdie During the assault, Reese sustained a shallow knife wound and deep bruising in the vicinity of his right eye [78] [79] A doctor, who was present for the lecture, immediately tended to Rushdie [80] Rushdie suffered four wounds to the stomach area of his abdomen, three wounds to the right side of the front part of his neck, one wound to his right eye, one wound to his chest and one wound to his right thigh [81] A 24-year-old suspect, Hadi Matar, was arrested at the scene, and was charged the following day with assault and attempted murder Rushdie was gravely wounded and hospitalized.\n\n\nSocial and political fallout\nOne of the immediate consequences of the fatwa was a worsening of Islamic-Western relations.\n\n\nHeightened tension\nRushdie lamented that the controversy fed the Western stereotype of \"the backward, cruel, rigid Muslim, burning books and threatening to kill the blasphemer\", [82] while another British writer compared the Ayatollah Khomeini \"with a familiar ghost from the past – one of those villainous Muslim clerics, a Faqir of Ipi or a mad Mullah, who used to be portrayed, larger than life, in popular histories of the British Empire\" [83] Media expressions of this included a banner headline in the popular British newspaper the Daily Mirror referring to Khomeini as \"that Mad Mullah\" [84]\n\n\nBook sales\nAlthough British bookseller W.H Smith sold \"a mere hundred copies\" within a week of the book's release in mid-January 1989, it \"flew off the shelves\" following the fatwa In America, it sold an \"unprecedented\" five times more copies than the number two book, Star by Danielle Steel, selling more than 750,000 copies of the book by May 1989 B Dalton, a bookstore chain that decided not to stock the book for security reasons, changed its mind when it found the book \"was selling so fast that even as we tried to stop it, it was flying off the shelves\" [90] [91] Rushdie earned about $2 million within the first year of the book's publication, [92] and the book is Viking's all-time best seller [93]\n\n\nRushdie\nThe author of the book himself was not immediately killed or injured as many militants wished, but visibly frustrated by a life locked in 24-hour armed guard – alternately defiant against his would-be killers and attempting overtures of reconciliation against the death threat A week after the death threat, and after his unsuccessful apology to the Iranian government, Rushdie described succumbing to \"a curious lethargy, the soporific torpor that overcomes .. while under attack\"; [94] then, a couple of weeks after that, wrote a poem vowing \"not to shut up\" but \"to sing on, in spite of attacks\" [95]\n\n\nExplanation of different reactions\nThe passionate international rage of Muslims towards the book surprised many Western readers because the book was written in English, not Arabic, Urdu, Persian or other languages for which the majority of mother tongue speakers are Muslims; it was never published or even sold in the countries where most Muslims lived, and was a work of fiction – a demanding, densely written novel unlikely to appeal to the average reader [100]\n\n\nMuslim\nThe passionate international rage of Muslims towards the book surprised many Western readers because the book was written in English, not

refers to the international outcry and protests that followed the publication of Salman Rushdie's novel of the same name in 1988. The book's depiction of the Prophet Muhammad and Islamic themes sparked widespread anger and violence, particularly among Muslims.\n\n**Background**\n\nSalman Rushdie, a British-Indian author, had stoked controversy with his previous books, including \"Midnight's Children\" and \"Shame\". However, \"The Satanic Verses\" was the most contentious and sparked international outrage. Rushdie saw his role as a writer as including the function of antagonist to the state and aimed to challenge societal norms and expectations.\n\n**Controversial Elements of The Satanic Verses**\n\nThe title \"The Satanic Verses\" immediately sparked vehement protest against Rushdie's book. The title refers to a legend of Muhammad; a few verses were supposedly spoken by him as part of the Qur'an, which praised the pagan goddesses of Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat. These \"Satanic Verses\" were said to have been revealed between verses 20 and 21 in Surah An-Najm of the Qur'an. The book features a central episode in Pakistan's internal life, which portrays as a family squabble between Iskander Harappa (Zulfikar Ali Bhutto) and his successor and executioner Raza Hyder (Zia ul-Haq).\n\n**Early Reaction**\n\nBefore the publication of \"The Satanic Verses\", the publisher received warnings from the publisher's editorial consultant that the book might be controversial. Rushdie expected a few mullahs to be offended, call him names, and then he could defend himself in public. However, he never expected anything like the widespread outrage and protests that followed.\n\n**Muslim Response and Book Bannings**\n\nAfter the book was first published in the United Kingdom in September 1988, there were protests by Muslims that predominantly took place in India and the UK.

{"title": "Kazakhstan", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe English word Kazakh, meaning a member of the Kazakh people, derives from Russian: казах [21] The native name is Kazakh: қазақ, romanized: qazaq It might originate from the Turkic word verb qaz-, 'to wander', reflecting the Kazakhs' nomadic culture [22] The term Cossack is of the same origin [22]\n\n\nHistory\nKazakhstan has been inhabited since the Paleolithic era [26] The Botai culture (3700–3100 BC) is credited with the first domestication of horses The Botai population derived most of their ancestry from a deeply European-related population known as Ancient North Eurasians, while also displaying some Ancient East Asian admixture [27] Pastoralism developed during the Neolithic The population was Caucasoid during the Bronze and Iron Age period [28] [29]\n\n\nCuman-Kipchak and the Golden Horde\nThe main migration of Turkic peoples occurred between the 5th and 11th centuries when they spread across most of Central Asia The Turkic peoples slowly replaced and assimilated the previous Iranian-speaking locals, turning the population of Central Asia from largely Iranian, into primarily of East Asian descent [35]\n\n\nKazakh Khanate\nIn 1465, the Kazakh Khanate emerged as a result of the dissolution of the Golden Horde Established by Janibek Khan and Kerei Khan, it continued to be ruled by the Turco-Mongol clan of Tore (Jochid dynasty) Throughout this period, traditional nomadic life and a livestock-based economy continued to dominate the steppe In the 15th century, a distinct Kazakh identity began to emerge among the Turkic tribes This was followed by the Kazakh War of Independence, where the Khanate gained its sovereignty from the Shaybanids The process was consolidated by the mid-16th century with the appearance of the Kazakh language, culture, and economy.\n\n\nRussian Kazakhstan\nIn the first half of the 18th century, the Russian Empire constructed the Irtysh line  [ru], a series of forty-six forts and ninety-six redoubts, including Omsk (1716), Semipalatinsk (1718), Pavlodar (1720), Orenburg (1743) and Petropavlovsk (1752), [39] to prevent Kazakh and Oirat raids into Russian territory [40] In the late 18th century the Kazakhs took advantage of Pugachev's Rebellion, which was centred on the Volga area, to raid Russian and Volga German settlements [41] In the 19th century, the Russian Empire began to expand its influence into Central Asia The \"Great Game\" period is generally regarded as running from approximately 1813 to the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 The tsars effectively ruled over most of the territory belonging to what is now the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\n\nKazakh SSR\nFollowing the collapse of central government in Petrograd in November 1917, the Kazakhs (then in Russia officially referred to as \"Kirghiz\") experienced a brief period of autonomy (the Alash Autonomy) before eventually succumbing to the Bolsheviks' rule On 26 August 1920, the Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) was established The Kirghiz ASSR included the territory of present-day Kazakhstan, but its administrative centre was the mainly Russian-populated town of Orenburg In June 1925, the Kirghiz ASSR was renamed the Kazak ASSR and its administrative centre was transferred to the town of Kyzylorda, and in April 1927 to Alma-Ata.\n\n\nIndependence\nOn 25 October 1990, Kazakhstan declared its sovereignty on its territory as a republic within the Soviet Union Following the August 1991 aborted coup attempt in Moscow, Kazakhstan declared independence on 16 December 1991, thus becoming the last Soviet republic to declare independence Ten days later, the Soviet Union itself ceased to exist.\n\n\nGeography\nAs it extends across both sides of the Ural River, considered the dividing line separating Europe and Asia, Kazakhstan is one of only two landlocked countries in the world that has territory in two continents (the other is Azerbaijan).\n\n\nNatural resources\nKazakhstan has an abundant supply of accessible mineral and fossil fuel resources Development of petroleum, natural gas, and mineral extractions has attracted most of the over $40 billion in foreign investment in Kazakhstan since 1993 and accounts for some 57 percent of the nation's industrial output (or approximately 13 percent of gross domestic product) According to some estimates, [65] Kazakhstan has the second largest uranium, chromium, lead, and zinc reserves; the third largest manganese reserves; the fifth largest copper reserves; and ranks in the top ten for coal, iron, and gold It is also an exporter of diamonds Perhaps most significant for economic development, Kazakhstan also has the 11th largest proven reserves of both petroleum and natural gas [66] One such location is the Tokarevskoye gas condensate field.\n\n\nClimate\nKazakhstan has an \"extreme\" continental and cold steppe climate, and sits solidly inside the Eurasian steppe, featuring the Kazakh steppe, with hot summers and very cold winters Indeed, Astana is the second coldest capital city in the world after Ulaanbaatar Precipitation varies between arid and semi-arid conditions, the winter being particularly dry [72]\n\n\nWildlife\nThere are ten nature reserves and ten national parks in Kazakhstan that provide safe haven for many rare and endangered plants and animals In total there are twenty five areas of conservancy Common plants are Astragalus, Gagea, Allium, Carex and Oxytropis; endangered plant species include native wild apple (Malus sieversii), wild grape (Vitis vinifera) and several wild tulip species (e.g., Tulipa greigii) and rare onion species Allium karataviense, also Iris willmottiana and Tulipa kaufmanniana [74] [75] Kazakhstan had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.23/10, ranking it 26th globally out of 172 countries [76]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nOfficially, Kazakhstan is a democratic, secular, constitutional unitary republic; Nursultan Nazarbayev led the country from 1991 to 2019 [79] [80] He was succeeded by Kassym-Jomart Tokayev [81] [82] The president may veto legislation that has been passed by the parliament and is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces The prime minister chairs the cabinet of ministers and serves as Kazakhstan's head of government There are three deputy prime ministers and sixteen ministers in the cabinet [83]\n\n\nPolitical system\nOfficially, Kazakhstan is a democratic, secular, constitutional unitary republic; Nursultan Nazarbayev led the country from 1991 to 2019 [79] [80] He was succeeded by Kassym-Jomart Tokayev [81] [82] The president may veto legislation that has been passed by the parliament and is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces The prime minister chairs the cabinet of ministers and serves as Kazakhstan's head of government There are three deputy prime ministers and sixteen ministers in the cabinet [83]\n\n\nPolitical reforms\nReforms have begun to be implemented after the election of Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in June 2019 Tokayev supports a culture of opposition, public assembly, and loosening rules on forming political parties [87] In June 2019, Tokayev established the National Council of Public Trust as a public platform for national conversation regarding government policies and reforms [88] In July 2019, the President of Kazakhstan announced a concept of a 'listening state' that quickly and efficiently responds to all constructive requests of the country's citizens [89] A law will be passed to allow representatives from other parties to hold chair positions on some Parliamentary committees, to foster alternative views and opinions [when?] The minimum membership threshold needed to register a political party will be reduced from 40,000 to 20,000 members [88] Special places for peaceful rallies in central areas will be allocated and a new draft law outlining the rights and obligations of organisers, participants and observers will be passed [88] In an effort to increase public safety, President Tokayev has strengthened the penalties for those who commit crimes against individuals [88]\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nKazakhstan is divided into twenty regions (Kazakh: облыстар, oblystar; Russian: области, oblasti) and three cities independent of their geographic region [85] The regions are subdivided into 177 districts (Kazakh: аудандар, audandar; Russian: районы, rayony) [93] The districts are further subdivided into rural districts at the lowest level of administration, which include all rural settlements and villages without an associated municipal government [94]\n\n\nMunicipal divisions\nMunicipalities exist at each level of administrative division in Kazakhstan Cities of republican, regional, and district significance are designated as urban inhabited localities; all others are designated rural [94] At the highest level are the cities of Almaty and Astana, which are classified as cities of republican significance on the administrative level equal to that of a region [93] At the intermediate level are cities of regional significance on the administrative level equal to that of a district Cities of these two levels may be divided into city districts [93] At the lowest level are cities of district significance, and over two-thousand villages and rural settlements (aul) on the administrative level equal to that of rural districts [93]\n\n\nUrban centres\nKazakhstan is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Economic Cooperation Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation The nations of Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan established the Eurasian Economic Community in 2000, to revive earlier efforts to harmonise trade tariffs and to create a free trade zone under a customs union On 1 December 2007, it was announced that Kazakhstan had been chosen to chair the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe for the year 2010 Kazakhstan was elected a member of the UN Human Rights Council for the first time on 12 November 2012 [99]\n\n\nForeign relations\nKazakhstan is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Economic Cooperation Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation The nations of Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan established the Eurasian Economic Community in 2000, to revive earlier efforts to harmonise trade tariffs and to create a free trade zone under a customs union On 1 December 2007, it was announced that Kazakhstan had been chosen to chair the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe for the year 2010 Kazakhstan was elected a member of the UN Human Rights Council for the first time on 12 November 2012 [99]\n\n\nMilitary\nMost of Kazakhstan's military was inherited from the Soviet Armed Forces' Turkestan Military District These units became the core of Kazakhstan's new military It acquired all the units of the 40th Army (the former 32nd Army) and part of the 17th Army Corps, including six land-force divisions, storage bases, the 14th and 35th air-landing brigades, two rocket brigades, two artillery regiments, and a large amount of equipment that had been withdrawn from over the Urals after the signing of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Since the late 20th century, the Kazakhstan Army has focused on expanding the number of its armoured units Since 1990, armoured units have expanded from 500 to 1,613 in 2005.\n\n\nHuman rights\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit has consistently ranked Kazakhstan as an \"authoritarian regime\" in its Democracy Index, ranking it 128th out of 167 countries for 2020 [127] [128]\n\n\nEconomy\nIn 2018, Kazakhstan had a GDP of $179.332 billion and an annual growth rate of 4.5 percent Per capita, Kazakhstan's GDP stood at $9,686 [147] Buoyed by high world crude oil prices, GDP growth figures were between 8.9 percent and 13.5 percent from 2000 to 2007 before decreasing to 1 to 3 percent in 2008 and 2009, and then rising again from 2010 [148] Other major exports of Kazakhstan include wheat, textiles, and livestock Kazakhstan is a leading exporter of uranium [149] [150]\n\n\nForeign trade\nKazakhstan's increased role in global trade and central positioning on the new Silk Road gave the country the potential to open its markets to billions of people [163] Kazakhstan joined the World Trade Organization in 2015 [164]\n\n\nAgriculture\nAgriculture accounts for approximately 5 percent of Kazakhstan's GDP [95] Grain, potatoes, grapes, vegetables, melons and livestock are the most important agricultural commodities Agricultural land occupies more than 846,000 square kilometres (327,000 sq mi) The available agricultural land consists of 205,000 km2 (79,000 sq mi) of arable land and 611,000 km2 (236,000 sq mi) of pasture and hay land Over 80 percent of the country's total area is classified as agricultural land, including almost 70 percent occupied by pasture Its arable land has the second highest availability per inhabitant (1.5 hectares) [167]\n\n\nEnergy\nEnergy has been the leading economic sector Production of crude oil and natural gas condensate from the oil and gas basins of Kazakhstan amounted to 79.2 million tonnes (77.9 million long tons; 87.3 million short tons) in 2012 up from 51.2 million tonnes (50.4 million long tons; 56.4 million short tons) in 2003 Kazakhstan raised oil and gas condensate exports to 44.3 million tons in 2003, 13 percent higher than in 2002 Gas production in Kazakhstan in 2003, amounted to 13.9 billion cubic metres (490 billion cubic feet), up 22.7 percent compared to 2002, including natural gas production of 7.3 billion cubic metres (260 billion cubic feet) Kazakhstan holds about 4 billion tonnes (3.9 billion long tons; 4.4 billion short tons) of proven recoverable oil reserves and 2,000 cubic kilometres (480 cubic miles) of gas Kazakhstan is the 19th largest oil-producing nation in the world [169] Kazakhstan's oil exports in 2003, were valued at more than $7 billion, representing 65 percent of overall exports and 24 percent of the GDP \nMajor oil and gas fields and recoverable oil reserves are Tengiz with 7 billion barrels (1.1 billion cubic metres); Karachaganak with 8 billion barrels (1.3 billion cubic metres) and 1,350 cubic kilometres (320 cubic miles) of natural gas; and Kashagan with 7 to 9 billion barrels (1.4 billion cubic metres).\n\n\nInfrastructure\nRailways provide 68 percent of all cargo and passenger traffic to over 57 percent of the country There are 15,333 km (9,527 mi) in common carrier service, excluding industrial lines [176]15,333 km (9,527 mi) of 1,520 mm (4 ft 11+27⁄32 in) gauge, 4,000 km (2,500 mi) electrified, in 2012 [176] Most cities are connected by railroad; high-speed trains go from Almaty (the southernmost city) to Petropavl (the northernmost city) in about 18 hours.\n\n\nTourism\nKazakhstan is the ninth-largest country by area and the largest landlocked country in the world As of 2014, tourism accounted for 0.3 percent of Kazakhstan's GDP, but the government had plans to increase it to 3 percent by 2020 [187] [188] According to the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report of 2017, travel and tourism industry GDP in Kazakhstan was $3.08 billion or only 1.6 percent of total GDP The WEF ranked Kazakhstan 80th in its 2019 report [189]\n\n\nForeign direct investment\nKazakhstan has attracted $330 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) from more than 120 countries since its independence (1991) [194] In 2015, the U.S State Department said Kazakhstan was widely considered to have the best investment climate in the region [195] In 2014, President Nazarbayev signed into law tax concessions to promote foreign direct investment which included a 10-year exemption from corporation tax, an eight-year exemption from property tax, and a 10-year freeze on most other taxes [196] Other incentives include a refund on capital investments of up to 30 percent once a production facility is in operation [196]\nIn 2012, Kazakhstan attracted $14 billion of foreign direct investment inflows into the country at a 7 percent growth rate [197] In 2018, $24 billion of FDI was directed into Kazakhstan, a significant increase since 2012 [198]\n\n\nBanking\nThe banking industry of Kazakhstan went through a boom-and-bust cycle in the early 21st century After several years of rapid expansion in the mid-2000s, the banking industry collapsed in 2008 Several large banking groups, including BTA Bank J.S.C and Alliance Bank, defaulted soon thereafter The industry shrank and was restructured, with system-wide loans dropping from 59 percent of GDP in 2007 to 39 percent in 2011 The Kazakh National Bank introduced deposit insurance in a campaign to strengthen the banking sector Several major foreign banks had branches in Kazakhstan, including RBS, Citibank, and HSBC Kookmin and UniCredit both entered Kazakhstan's financial services market through acquisitions and stake-building  [citation needed]\n\n\nEconomic competitiveness\nAccording to the 2010–11 World Economic Forum in Global Competitiveness Report, Kazakhstan was ranked 72nd in the world in economic competitiveness [203] One year later, the Global Competitiveness Report ranked Kazakhstan 50th in most competitive markets [204]\n\n\nCorruption\nIn 2005, the World Bank listed Kazakhstan as a corruption hotspot, on a par with Angola, Bolivia, Kenya, Libya and Pakistan [207] In 2012, Kazakhstan ranked low in an index of the least corrupt countries [208] and the World Economic Forum listed corruption as the biggest problem in doing business in the country [208] A 2017 OECD report on Kazakhstan indicated that Kazakhstan has reformed laws with regard to the civil service, judiciary, instruments to prevent corruption, access to information, and prosecuting corruption [209] Kazakhstan has implemented anticorruption reforms that have been recognised by organizations like Transparency International [210]\n\n\nScience and technology\nResearch remains largely concentrated in Kazakhstan's largest city and former capital, Almaty, home to 52 percent of research personnel Public research is largely confined to institutes, with universities making only a token contribution Research institutes receive their funding from national research councils under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education and Science Their output, however, tends to be disconnected from market needs In the business sector, few industrial enterprises conduct research themselves [216] [217]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe US Census Bureau International Database lists the population of Kazakhstan as 18.9 million (May 2019), [220] while United Nations sources such as the 2022 revision of the World Population Prospects [221] [222] give an estimate of 19,196,465 Official estimates put the population of Kazakhstan at 20 million as of November 2023 [223] In 2013, Kazakhstan's population rose to 17,280,000 with a 1.7 percent growth rate over the past year according to the Kazakhstan Statistics Agency [224]\n\n\nEthnic groups\nAs of

Ukrainians, Koreans, Volga Germans (0.9 percent), Chechens, [226] Meskhetian Turks, and Russian political opponents of the regime, had been deported to Kazakhstan in the 1930s and 1940s by Josef Stalin Some of the largest Soviet labour camps (Gulag) existed in the country [227]\n\n\nLanguages\nKazakhstan is officially a bilingual country [233] Kazakh (part of the Kipchak sub-branch of the Turkic languages) [234] is proficiently spoken by 80.1% of the population according to 2021 census, [235] and has the status of \"state language\" Russian, on the other hand, is spoken by 83.7% as of 2021 [236] It has equal status to Kazakh as an \"official language\", and is used routinely in business, government, and inter-ethnic communication [237] However, only 63.4% of ethnic Kazakhs and 49.3% of the country's population are daily speakers of Kazakh language, according to the same census [238]\n\n\nReligion\nAccording to the 2021 census, 69.3% of the population is Muslim, 17.2% are

Kazakhs had a highly developed culture based on their nomadic pastoral economy Islam was introduced into the region with the arrival of the Arabs in the 8th century It initially took hold in the southern parts of Turkestan and spread northward [257] The Samanids helped the religion take root through zealous missionary work The Golden Horde further propagated Islam amongst the tribes in the region during the 14th century [258]\n\n\nLiterature\nKazakh literature is defined as \"the body of literature, both oral and written, produced in the Kazakh language by the Kazakh people of Central Asia\" [259] Kazakh literature expands from the current territory of Kazakhstan, also including the era of Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, Kazakh recognised territory under the Russian Empire and the Kazakh Khanate There is some overlap with several complementary themes, including the literature of Turkic tribes that inhabited Kazakhstan over the course of its history and literature written by ethnic Kazakhs.\n\n\nMusic\nThe modern state of Kazakhstan is home to the Kazakh State Kurmangazy Orchestra of Folk Instruments, the Kazakh State Philharmonic Orchestra, the Kazakh National Opera and the Kazakh State Chamber Orchestra The folk instrument orchestra was named after Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly, a famous composer and dombra player from the 19th century The Musical-Dramatic Training College, founded in 1931, was the first institute of higher education for music Two years later, the Orchestra of Kazakh Folk Musical Instruments was formed [264]\nThe Foundation Asyl Mura is archiving and publishing historical recordings of great samples of Kazakh music both traditional and classical The leading conservatoire is in Almaty, the Qurmanghazy Conservatoire It competes with the national conservatoire in Astana, Kazakhstan's capital.\n\n\nFine arts\nIn Kazakhstan, the fine arts, in the classical sense, have their origins in the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century It was largely influenced by Russian artists, such as Vasily Vereshchagin and Nikolai Khludov, who intensively travelled in Central Asia Khludov had a particular influence on the development of the local school of painting, becoming the teacher of many local artists The most famous of these is Abilkhan Kasteyev, after whom the State Museum of Art of Kazakhstan was renamed in 1984 [266]\n\n\nCuisine\nIn the national cuisine, livestock meat, like horse meat [267] and beef can be cooked in a variety of ways and is usually served with a wide assortment of traditional bread products Refreshments include black tea, often served with milk and dried fruits (such as dried apricots) and nuts In southern provinces, people often prefer green tea Traditional milk-derived drinks such as ayran, shubat and kymyz A traditional Kazakh dinner involves a multitude of appetisers on the table, followed by a soup and one or two main courses such as pilaf and beshbarmak They also drink their national beverage, kumys, which consists of fermented mare's milk [268]\n\n\nSport\nKazakhstan consistently performs in Olympic competitions It is especially successful in boxing This has brought some attention to the Central Asian nation and increased world awareness of its athletes Dmitry Karpov and Olga Rypakova are among the most notable Kazakhstani athletes Dmitry Karpov is a distinguished decathlete, taking bronze in both the 2004 Summer Olympics, and the 2003 and 2007 World Athletics Championships Olga Rypakova is an athlete, specialising in

out of 180 countries on the Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index [278] A mid-March 2002 court order, with the government as a plaintiff, stated that Respublika were to stop printing for three months [279] The order was evaded by printing under other titles, such as Not That Respublika [279] In early 2014, a court also issued a cease publication order to the small-circulation Assandi-Times newspaper, saying it was a part of the Respublika group Human Rights Watch said: \"this absurd case displays the lengths to which Kazakh authorities are willing to go to bully critical media into silence.\" [280]\n\n\nUNESCO World Heritage sites\nKazakhstan has three cultural and two natural sites on the UNESCO World Heritage list The cultural sites are:\n\n\nPublic holidays\n This

the east, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan to the south, and the Caspian Sea to the west. It is the world's largest landlocked country, with a diverse geography that includes mountains, steppes, and deserts. Kazakhstan has a rich history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the Paleolithic era. The country has a population of approximately 19 million people, with a mix of ethnic groups, including Kazakhs, Russians, Ukrainians, and others.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe English word \"Kazakh\" refers to a member of the Kazakh people, who are an ethnic group native to Kazakhstan. The word \"Kazakh\" is derived from the Russian word \"казах,\" which was used to refer to the Kazakh people during the Russian Empire. The native name for the Kazakh people is \"қазақ,\" which is written in the Kazakh language. The term \"Cossack\" is also derived from the same origin, and refers to a group of people who were known for their military prowess and nomadic lifestyle.\n\n**History**\n\nKazakhstan has been inhabited since the Paleolithic era, with evidence of human habitation dating back to around 10,000 BCE. The Botai culture, which flourished from 3700 to 3100 BCE, is credited with the first domestication of horses. The population of the Botai culture was derived from a deeply European-related population known as Ancient North Eurasians, while also displaying some Ancient East Asian admixture.\n\nDuring the Neolithic period, pastoralism developed in Kazakhstan, with the population adopting a nomadic lifestyle. The population was Caucasoid during the Bronze and Iron Age periods. The Cuman-Kipchak and Golden Horde periods saw the migration of Turkic peoples into the region, who replaced and assimilated the previous Iranian-speaking locals.\n\n**Kazakh Khanate**\n\nIn 1465, the Kazakh Khanate emerged as a result of the dissolution of the Golden Horde.

It is not a comprehensive or exhaustive account of the country.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Kazakhstan\" following this outline:\n\n\nEtymology\nThe English word Kazakh, meaning a member of the Kazakh people, derives from Russian: казах [21] The native name is Kazakh: қазақ, romanized: qazaq It might originate from the Turkic word verb qaz-, 'to wander', reflecting the Kazakhs' nomadic culture [22] The term Cossack is of the same origin [22]\n\n\nHistory\nKazakhstan has been inhabited since the Paleolithic era [26] The Botai culture (3700–3100 BC) is credited with the first domestication of horses The Botai population derived most of their ancestry from a deeply European-related population known as Ancient North Eurasians, while also displaying some Ancient East Asian admixture [27] Pastoralism developed during the Neolithic The population was Caucasoid during the Bronze and Iron Age period [28] [29]\n\n\nCuman-Kipchak and the Golden Horde\nThe main migration of Turkic peoples occurred between the 5th and 11th centuries when they spread across most of Central Asia The Turkic peoples slowly replaced and assimilated the previous Iranian-speaking locals, turning the population of Central Asia from largely Iranian, into primarily of East Asian descent [35]\n\n\nKazakh Khanate\nIn 1465, the Kazakh Khanate emerged as a result of the dissolution of the Golden Horde Established by Janibek Khan and Kerei Khan, it continued to be ruled by the Turco-Mongol clan of Tore (Jochid dynasty) Throughout this period, traditional nomadic life and a livestock-based economy continued to dominate the steppe In the 15th century, a distinct Kazakh identity began to emerge among the Turkic tribes This was followed by the Kazakh War of Independence, where the Khanate gained its sovereignty from the Shaybanids The process was consolidated by the mid-16th century with the appearance of the Kazakh language, culture, and economy.\n\n\nRussian Kazakhstan\nIn the first half of the 18th century, the Russian Empire constructed the Irtysh line  [ru], a series of forty-six forts and ninety-six redoubts, including Omsk (1716), Semipalatinsk (1718), Pavlodar (1720), Orenburg (1743) and Petropavlovsk (1752), [39] to prevent Kazakh and Oirat raids into Russian territory [40] In the late 18th century the Kazakhs took advantage of Pugachev's Rebellion, which was centred on the Volga area, to raid Russian and Volga German settlements [41] In the 19th century, the Russian Empire began to expand its influence into Central Asia The \"Great Game\" period is generally regarded as running from approximately 1813 to the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 The tsars effectively ruled over most of the territory belonging to what is now the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\n\nKazakh SSR\nFollowing the collapse of central government in Petrograd in November 1917, the Kazakhs (then in Russia officially referred to as \"Kirghiz\") experienced a brief period of autonomy (the Alash Autonomy) before eventually succumbing to the Bolsheviks' rule On 26 August 1920, the Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) was established The Kirghiz ASSR included the territory of present-day Kazakhstan, but its administrative centre was the mainly Russian-populated town of Orenburg In June 1925, the Kirghiz ASSR was renamed the Kazak ASSR and its administrative centre was transferred to the town of Kyzylorda, and in April 1927 to Alma-Ata.\n\n\nIndependence\nOn 25 October 1990, Kazakhstan declared its sovereignty on its territory as a republic within the Soviet Union Following the August 1991 aborted coup attempt in Moscow,

gross domestic product) According to some estimates, [65] Kazakhstan has the second largest uranium, chromium, lead, and zinc reserves; the third largest manganese reserves; the fifth largest copper reserves; and ranks in the top ten for coal, iron, and gold It is also an exporter of diamonds Perhaps most significant for economic development, Kazakhstan also has the 11th largest proven reserves

Kazakhs.\n\n\nMusic\nThe modern state of Kazakhstan is home to the Kazakh State Kurmangazy Orchestra of Folk Instruments, the Kazakh State Philharmonic Orchestra, the Kazakh National Opera and the Kazakh State Chamber Orchestra The folk instrument orchestra was named after Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly, a famous composer and dombra player from the 19th century The Musical-Dramatic Training College, founded in 1931, was the first institute of higher education for music Two years later, the Orchestra of Kazakh Folk Musical Instruments was formed [264]\nThe Foundation Asyl Mura is archiving and publishing historical recordings of great samples of Kazakh music both traditional and classical The leading conservatoire is in Almaty, the Qurmanghazy Conservatoire It competes with the national conservatoire in Astana, Kazakhstan's capital.\n\n\nFine arts\nIn Kazakhstan, the fine arts, in the classical sense, have their origins in the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century It was largely influenced by Russian artists, such as Vasily Vereshchagin and Nikolai Khludov, who intensively travelled in Central Asia Khludov had a particular influence on the development of the local school of painting, becoming the teacher of many local artists The most famous of these is Abilkhan Kasteyev, after whom the State Museum of Art of Kazakhstan was renamed in 1984 [266]\n\n\nCuisine\nIn the national cuisine, livestock meat, like horse meat [267] and beef can be cooked in a variety of ways and is usually served with a wide assortment of traditional bread products Refreshments include black tea, often served with milk and dried fruits (such as dried apricots) and nuts In southern provinces, people often prefer green tea Traditional milk-derived drinks such as ayran, shubat and kymyz A traditional Kazakh dinner involves a multitude of appetisers on the table, followed by a soup and one or two main courses such as pilaf and beshbarmak They also drink their national beverage, kumys, which consists of fermented mare's milk [268]\n\n\nSport\nKazakhstan consistently performs in Olympic competitions It is especially successful in boxing This has brought some attention to the Central Asian nation and increased world awareness of its athletes Dmitry Karpov and Olga Rypakova are among the most notable Kazakhstani athletes Dmitry Karpov is a distinguished decathlete, taking bronze in both the 2004 Summer Olympics, and the 2003 and 2007 World Athletics Championships Olga Rypakova is an athlete, specialising in triple jump (women's), taking silver in the 2011 World Championships in Athletics and Gold in the 2012 Summer Olympics Kazakhstan's city of Almaty submitted bids twice for the Winter Olympics: in 2014 and again for the 2022 Winter Olympics Astana and Almaty hosted the 2011 Asian Winter Games [269]\n\n\nFilm\nKazakhstan's film industry is run through the state-owned Kazakhfilm studios based in Almaty The studio has produced movies such as Myn Bala, Harmony Lessons, and Shal [273] Kazakhstan is the host of the International Astana Action Film Festival and the Eurasia International Film Festival held annually Hollywood director Timur Bekmambetov is from Kazakhstan and has become active in bridging Hollywood to the Kazakhstan film industry [274]\n\n\nMedia\nKazakhstan is ranked 161 out of 180 countries on the Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index [278] A mid-March 2002 court order, with the government as a plaintiff, stated that Respublika were to stop printing for three months [279] The order was evaded by printing under other titles, such as Not That Respublika [279] In early 2014, a court also issued a cease publication order to the small-circulation Assandi-Times newspaper, saying it was a part of the Respublika group Human Rights Watch said: \"this absurd case displays the lengths to which Kazakh authorities are willing to go to bully critical media into silence.\"

Vélo, the first and the largest daily sports newspaper in France, [11] [12] on the other was L'Auto, which had been set up by journalists and businesspeople including Comte Jules-Albert de Dion, Adolphe Clément, and Édouard Michelin in 1899 The rival paper emerged following disagreements over the Dreyfus Affair De Dion, Clément and Michelin were particularly concerned with Le Vélo—which reported more than cycling—because its financial backer was one of their commercial rivals, the Darracq company De Dion believed Le Vélo gave Darracq too much attention and him too little De Dion was rich and could afford to indulge his whims The new newspaper appointed Henri Desgrange as the editor He was a prominent cyclist and owner with Victor Goddet of the velodrome at the Parc des Princes [13]\n\n\nThe first Tour de France (1903)\nThe first Tour de France was staged in 1903 The plan was a five-stage race from 31 May to 5 July, starting in Paris and stopping in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, and Nantes before returning to Paris Toulouse was added later to break the long haul across southern France from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Stages would go through the night and finish next afternoon, with rest days before riders set off again But this proved too daunting and the costs too great for most [17] and only 15 competitors had entered Desgrange had never been wholly convinced and he came close to dropping the idea [18] Instead, he cut the length to 19 days, changed the dates to 1 to 19 July, and offered a daily allowance to those who averaged at least 20 kilometres per hour (12 mph) on all the stages, [19] equivalent to what a rider would have expected to earn each day had he worked in a factory [20] He also cut the entry fee from 20 to 10 francs and set the first prize at 12,000 francs and the prize for each day's winner at 3,000 francs The winner would thereby win six times what most workers earned in a year [20] That attracted between 60 and 80 entrants – the higher number may have included serious inquiries and some who dropped out – among them not just professionals but amateurs, some unemployed, and some simply adventurous [14]\n\n\n1904–1939\nSuch was the passion that the first Tour created in spectators and riders that Desgrange said the 1904 Tour de France would be the last Cheating was rife, and riders were beaten up by rival fans as they neared the top of the col de la République, sometimes called the col du Grand Bois, outside St-Étienne [24] The leading riders, including the winner Maurice Garin, were disqualified, though it took the Union Vélocipèdique de France until 30 November to make the decision [25] McGann says the UVF waited so long \"...well aware of the passions aroused by the race.\" [26] Desgrange's opinion of the fighting and cheating showed in the headline of his reaction in L'Auto: THE END [27]\n\n\n1947–1969\nIn 1944, L'Auto was closed—its doors nailed shut—and its belongings, including the Tour, sequestrated by the state for publishing articles too close to the Germans [44] Rights to the Tour were therefore owned by the government Jacques Goddet was allowed to publish another daily sports paper, L'Équipe, but there was a rival candidate to run the Tour: a consortium of Sports and Miroir Sprint Each organised a candidate race L'Équipe and Le Parisien Libéré had La Course du Tour de France, [45] while Sports and Miroir Sprint had La Ronde de France Both were five stages, the longest the government would allow because of shortages [46] L'Équipe's race was better organised and appealed more to the public because it featured national teams that had been successful before the war, when French cycling was at a high L'Équipe was given the right to organise the 1947 Tour de France [42] However, L'Équipe's finances were never sound, and Goddet accepted an advance by Émilion Amaury, who had supported his bid to run the postwar Tour [42] Amaury was a newspaper magnate whose sole condition was that his sports editor, Félix Lévitan, should join Goddet for the Tour [42] The two worked together—with Goddet running the sporting side, and Lévitan the financial.\n\n\n1969–1987\nIn the early 1970s, the race was dominated by Eddy Merckx, who won the General Classification five times, the Mountains Classification twice, the Points Classification three times and held the record for the most stage victories (34) [57] until overtaken by Mark Cavendish in 2024 Merckx's dominating style earned him the nickname \"The Cannibal\" In 1969, he already had a commanding lead when he launched a long-distance solo attack in the mountains which none of the other elite riders could answer, resulting in an eventual winning margin of nearly eighteen minutes In 1973 he did not win because he did not enter the Tour; instead, his great rival Luis Ocaña won Merckx's winning streak came to an end when he finished 2nd to Bernard Thévenet in 1975.\n\n\n1988–1997\nMonths before the start of the 1988 Tour, director Jean-François Naquet-Radiguet was replaced by Xavier Louy [64] In 1988, the Tour was organised by Jean-Pierre Courcol, the director of L'Équipe, then in 1989 by Jean-Pierre Carenso and then by Jean-Marie Leblanc, who in 1989 had been race director The former television presenter Christian Prudhomme—he commentated on the Tour among other events—replaced Leblanc in 2007, having been assistant director for three years In 1993 ownership of L'Équipe moved to the Amaury Group, which formed Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) to oversee its sports operations, although the Tour itself is operated by its subsidiary the Société du Tour de France [65]\n\n\n1998–2011\nDuring the 1998 Tour de France, a doping scandal known as the Festina Affair shook the sport to its core when it became apparent that there was systematic doping going on in the sport Numerous riders and a handful of teams were either thrown out of the race, or left of their own free will, and in the end Marco Pantani survived to win his lone Tour in a decimated main field The 1999 Tour de France was billed as the ‘Tour of Renewal’ as the sport tried to clean up its image following the doping fiasco of the previous year Initially it seemed to be a Cinderella story when cancer survivor Lance Armstrong stole the show on Sestriere and kept on riding to the first of his astonishing seven consecutive Tour de France victories; however, in retrospect, 1999 was just the beginning of the doping problem getting much, much worse Following Armstrong's retirement in 2005, the 2006 edition saw his former teammate Floyd Landis finally get the chance he worked so hard for with a stunning and improbable solo breakaway on Stage 17 in which he set himself up to win the Tour in the final time trial, which he then did Not long after the Tour was over, however, Landis was accused of doping and had his Tour win revoked [69]\n\n\nSince 2012\nTeam Sky dominated the event for several years, with wins for Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome (four times) and Geraint Thomas before Egan Bernal became the first Colombian winner in 2019  The streak was interrupted only by Vincenzo Nibali's 2014 win.\n\n\nClassifications\nThe oldest and main competition in the Tour de France is known as the \"general classification\", for which the yellow jersey is awarded; the winner of this is said to have won the race [85] A few riders from each team aim to win overall, but there are three further competitions to draw riders of all specialties: points, mountains, and a classification for young riders with general classification aspirations [85] The leader of each of the aforementioned classifications wears a distinctive jersey, with riders leading multiple classifications wearing the jersey of the most prestigious that he leads [85] In addition to these four classifications, there are several minor and discontinued classifications that are competed for during the race [85]\n\n\nGeneral classification\nThe oldest and most sought-after classification in the Tour de France is the general classification [85] [86] All of the stages are timed to the finish [86] The riders' times are compounded with their previous stage times; so the rider with the lowest aggregate time is the leader of the race [85] [86] The leader is determined after each stage's conclusion: he gains the privilege to wear the yellow jersey, presented on a podium in the stage's finishing town, for the next stage If he is leading more than one classification that awards a jersey, he wears the yellow one, since the general classification is the most important one in the race [9] Between 1905 and 1912 inclusive, in response to concerns about rider cheating in the 1904 race, the general classification was awarded according to a point-based system based on their placings in each stage, and the rider with the lowest total of points after the Tour's conclusion was the winner [86]\n\n\nMountains classification\nThe mountains classification is the second-oldest jersey awarding classification in the Tour de France The mountains classification was added to the Tour de France in the 1933 edition and was first won by Vicente Trueba [85] [87] Prizes for the classification were first awarded in 1934 [87] During stages of the race containing climbs, points are awarded to the first riders to reach the top of each categorized climb, with points available for up to the first 10 riders, depending on the classification of the climb Climbs are classified according to the steepness and length of that particular hill, with more points available for harder climbs The classification was preceded by the meilleur grimpeur (English: best climber) which was awarded by the organising newspaper L'Auto to a cyclist who completed each race.\n\n\nPoints classification\nThe points classification is the third oldest of the currently awarded jersey classifications [85] It was introduced in the 1953 Tour de France and was first won by Fritz Schär The classification was added to draw the participation of the sprinters as well as celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Tour Points are given to the first 15 riders to finish a stage, with an additional set of points given to the first 15 riders to cross a pre-determined 'sprint' point during the route of each stage The point classification leader green jersey is worn by the rider who at the start of each stage, has the greatest number of points [86]\n\n\nYoung rider classification\nThe leader of the classification is determined the same way as the general classification, with the riders' times being added up after each stage and the eligible rider with lowest aggregate time is dubbed the leader The Young rider classification is restricted to the riders that will stay under the age of 26 in the calendar year the race is held Originally the classification was restricted to neo-professionals – riders that are in their first three years of professional racing – until 1983 In 1983, the organizers made it so that only first time riders were eligible for the classification In 1987, the organizers changed the rules of the classification to what they are today.\n\n\nMinor classifications and prizes\nThe prix de la combativité goes to the rider who most animates the day, usually by trying to break clear of the field The most combative rider wears a number printed white-on-beige instead of black-on-white next day An award goes to the most aggressive rider throughout the Tour Already in 1908 a sort of combativity award was offered, when Sports Populaires and L'Education Physique created Le Prix du Courage, 100 francs and a silver gilt medal for \"the rider having finished the course, even if unplaced, who is particularly distinguished for the energy he has used.\" [94] [95] The modern competition started in 1958 [94] [96] In 1959, a Super Combativity award for the most combative cyclist of the Tour was awarded It was initially not awarded every year, but since 1981 it has been given annually Eddy Merckx has the most wins (4) for the overall award.\n\n\nHistorical classifications\nThere has been an intermediate sprints classification, which from 1984 awarded a red jersey [98] for points awarded to the first three to pass intermediate points during the stage These sprints also scored points towards the points classification and bonuses towards the general classification The intermediate sprints classification with its red jersey was abolished in 1989, [99] but the intermediate sprints have remained, offering points for the points classification and, until 2007, time bonuses for the general classification.\n\n\nLanterne rouge\nThe rider who has taken most time is called the lanterne rouge (red lantern, as in the red light at the back of a vehicle so it can be seen in the dark) and in past years sometimes carried a small red light beneath his saddle Such was sympathy that he could command higher fees in the races that previously followed the Tour [clarification needed] In 1939 and 1948 the organisers excluded the last rider every day, to encourage more competitive racing [n 6]\n\n\nPrizes\nPrize money has always been awarded From 20,000 francs the first year, [102]\nprize money has increased each year, although from 1976 to 1987 the first prize was an apartment offered by a race sponsor The first prize in 1988 was a car, a studio-apartment, a work of art, and 500,000 francs in cash Prizes only in cash returned in 1990 [103]\n\n\nTrophy\nThe winner of general classification is the recipient of Coupe Omnisports, presented by the president of the French Republic [105] The Trophy is realized by the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres and was used since 1975, the first time Tour finished on the Champs-Élysées [106]\n\n\nStages\nThe modern tour typically has 21 stages, one per day.\n\n\nMass-start stages\nThe Tour directors categorise mass-start stages into 'flat', 'hilly', or 'mountain' [110] This affects the points awarded in the sprint classification, whether the 3 kilometer rule is operational [clarification needed], and the permitted disqualification time in which riders must finish (which is the winners' time plus a pre-determined percentage of that time) [111] Time bonuses of 10, 6, and 4 seconds are awarded to the first three finishers, though this was not done from 2008 to 2014 [112] Bonuses were previously also awarded to winners of intermediate sprints.\n\n\nTime trials\nThe first time trial in the Tour was between La Roche-sur-Yon and Nantes (80 km) in 1934 [113] The first stage in modern Tours is often a short trial, a prologue, to decide who wears yellow on the opening day The first prologue was in 1967 [54] The 1988 event, at La Baule, was called \"la préface\" [114] There are usually two or three time trials The final time trial has sometimes been the final stage, more recently often the penultimate stage.\n\n\nNotable stages\nSince 1975 the race has finished with laps of the Champs-Élysées As the peloton arrives in downtown Paris the French Air Force does a three-jet flyover with the three colors of the French flag in smoke behind them This stage rarely challenges the leader because it is flat and the leader usually has too much time in hand to be denied In modern times, there tends to be a gentlemen's agreement: while the points classification is still contended if possible, the overall classification is not fought over; because of this, it is not uncommon for the de facto winner of the overall classification to ride into Paris holding a glass of champagne The only time the maillot jaune was attacked in a manner that lasted all the way through the end of this stage was during the 1979 Tour de France In 1987, Pedro Delgado vowed to attack during the stage to challenge the 40-second lead held by Stephen Roche He was unsuccessful and he and Roche finished in the peloton [115] In 2005, controversy arose when Alexander Vinokourov attacked and won the stage, in the process taking fifth place overall from Levi Leipheimer [116] This attack was not a threat to the overall lead, but was a long-shot at the Podium standings, as Vinokourov was about five minutes behind third place.\n\n\nDeciding the route\nTo host a stage start or finish brings prestige and business to a town The prologue and first stage (Grand Départ) are particularly prestigious The race may start with a prologue (too short to go between towns) in which case the start of the next day's racing, which would be considered stage 1, usually in the same town In 2007 director Christian Prudhomme said that \"in general, for a period of five years we have the Tour start outside France three times and within France twice.\" [123]\n\n\nAdvertising caravan\nWith the switch to the use of national teams in 1930, the costs of accommodating riders fell to the organizers instead of the sponsors and Henri Desgrange raised the money by allowing advertisers to precede the race The procession of often colourfully decorated trucks and cars became known as the publicity caravan It formalised an existing situation, companies having started to follow the race The first to sign to precede the Tour was the chocolate company, Menier, one of those who had followed the race Its head of publicity, Paul Thévenin, had first put the idea to Desgrange [125] It paid 50,000 francs Preceding the race was more attractive to advertisers because spectators gathered by the road long before the race or could be attracted from their houses Advertisers following the race found that many who had watched the race had already gone home Menier handed out tons of chocolate in that first year of preceding the race, as well as 500,000 policemen's hats printed with the company's name The success led to the caravan's existence being formalised the following year.\n\n\nPolitics\nThe first three Tours from 1903 to 1905 stayed within France The 1906 race went into Alsace-Lorraine, territory annexed by the German Empire in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War Passage was secured through a meeting at Metz between Desgrange's collaborator, Alphonse Steinès, and the German governor.\n\n\nCorsica\nPrior to 2013, the Tour de France had visited every region of Metropolitan France except Corsica [131] Jean-Marie Leblanc, when he was organiser, said the island had never asked for a stage start there It would be difficult to find accommodation for 4,000 people, he said [132] The spokesman of the Corsican nationalist party Party of the Corsican Nation, François Alfonsi, said: \"The organisers must be afraid of terrorist attacks If they are really thinking of a possible terrorist action, they are wrong Our movement, which is nationalist and in favour of self-government, would be delighted if the Tour came to Corsica.\" [132] The opening three stages of the 2013 Tour de France were held on Corsica as part of the celebrations for the 100th edition of the race.\n\n\nStart and finish of the Tour\nMost stages are in mainland France, although since the mid-1950s it has become common to visit nearby countries [133] The Tour has visited thirteen different countries in its history: Andorra, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, San Marino, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, all of which have hosted stages or part of a stage [134] Since 1975 the finish has been on the Champs-Élysées in Paris; from 1903 to 1967 the race finished at the Parc des Princes stadium in western Paris and from 1968 to 1974 at the Piste Municipale south of the capital [100]  In the 111th edition, because of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, the race ended outside Paris for the first time, on the Place Masséna in Nice [135]\n\n\nStarts abroad\nThe following editions of the Tour started, or are planned to start, outside France: [137] [138]\n\n\nBroadcasting\nThe Tour was first followed only by journalists from L'Auto, the organisers The race was founded to increase sales of a floundering newspaper and its editor, Desgrange, saw no reason to allow rival publications to profit.\nThe first time papers other than L'Auto were allowed was 1921, when 15 press cars were allowed for regional and foreign reporters [139]\n\n\nCulture\nThe Tour is an important cultural event for fans in Europe Millions [158] line the route, some having camped for a week to get the best view.\n\n\nArts\nThe Tour has inspired several popular songs in France, notably P'tit gars du Tour (1932), Les Tours de France (1936) and Faire le Tour de France (1950) German electronic group Kraftwerk composed \"Tour de France\" in 1983 – described as a minimalistic \"melding of man and machine\" [165] – and produced an album, Tour de France Soundtracks in 2003, the centenary of the Tour.\n\n\nPost-Tour criteriums\nAfter the Tour de France there are criteriums in the Netherlands and Belgium These races are public spectacles where thousands of people can see their heroes from the Tour de France race The budget of a criterium is over 100,000 Euro, with most of the money going to the riders Jersey winners or big-name riders earn between 20 and 60 thousand euros per race in start money [176]\n\n\nDoping\nAllegations of doping have plagued the Tour almost since it began in 1903 Early riders consumed alcohol and used ether to dull the pain [177] Over the years they began to increase performance and the Union Cycliste Internationale and governments enacted policies to combat the practice.\n\n\nDeaths\nCyclists who have died during the Tour de France:\n\n\nRecords and statistics\nOne rider has been King of the Mountains, won the combination classification, combativity award, the points competition, and the Tour in the same year—Eddy Merckx in 1969, which was also the first year he participated [216] The following year he came close to repeating the feat, but was five points behind the winner in the points classification The only other rider to come close to this achievement is Bernard Hinault in 1979, who won the overall and points competitions and placed second in the mountains classification.\n\n\nRecord winners\nFour riders have won five times: Jacques Anquetil (FRA), Eddy Merckx (BEL), Bernard Hinault (FRA), and Miguel Induráin (ESP) Indurain achieved the mark with a record five consecutive wins.\n\n\nRelated events\nL'Étape du Tour (French for 'stage of the Tour') is an organised mass participation cyclosportive event that allows amateur cyclists to race over the same route as a Tour de France stage First held in 1993, and now organised by the ASO, in conjunction with Vélo Magazine, it takes place each July, normally on a Tour rest day [234]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Tour de France**\n\nThe Tour de France is an annual multiple-stage bicycle race primarily held in France, with the most difficult stages in the mountains. It is a prestigious event in the world of professional cycling, attracting top riders from around the globe. The Tour de France is one of the three Grand Tours, along with the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a España.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Tour de France was created in 1903 by the L'Auto newspaper, which aimed to increase its circulation by promoting a sporting event. The first Tour was won by Maurice Garin, who completed the 2,428 km route in 94 hours and 33 minutes. The early Tours were marred by cheating and violence, with riders being beaten up by rival fans.\n\n## Origins\n\nThe Tour de France was created in response to the emergence of two rival sports newspapers in France, Le Vélo and L'Auto. Le Vélo was the largest daily sports newspaper in France, while L'Auto was set up by journalists and businesspeople, including Comte Jules-Albert de Dion, Adolphe Clément, and Édouard Michelin. The rival paper emerged following disagreements over the Dreyfus Affair, a controversy that had split the French nation.\n\n## The First Tour\n\nThe first Tour de France was staged in 1903, with 60 entrants competing in the five-stage race. The plan was for the riders to start in Paris and stop in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, and Nantes before returning to Paris. However, the long haul across southern France proved too daunting for most riders, and only 15 competitors had entered the race by the time it started.\n\n## 1904-1939\n\nThe first Tour created a passion in spectators and riders alike, with Desgrange saying the 1904 Tour would be the last. However, the Tour continued to grow in popularity, and by the 1930s, it had become a major sporting event.\n\n## 1947-1969\n\nIn 1944, L'Auto was closed, and its belongings, including the Tour, were sequestrated by the state. Rights to the Tour were therefore owned by the government, and the race was organized by Jacques Goddet and Félix Lévitan. The Tour continued to grow in popularity, with Eddy Merckx dominating the event in the 1960s.\n\n## 1969-1987\n\nEddy Merckx won the Tour five times, with his first victory in 1969.

trace back to the emergence of two rival sports newspapers in the country On one hand was Le Vélo, the first and the largest daily sports newspaper in France, [11] [12] on the other was L'Auto, which had been set up by journalists and businesspeople including Comte Jules-Albert de Dion, Adolphe Clément, and Édouard Michelin in 1899 The rival paper emerged following disagreements over the Dreyfus Affair De Dion, Clément and Michelin were particularly concerned with Le Vélo—which reported more than cycling—because its financial backer was one of their commercial rivals, the Darracq company De Dion believed Le Vélo gave Darracq too much attention and him too little De Dion was rich and could afford to indulge his whims The new newspaper appointed Henri Desgrange as the editor He was a prominent cyclist and owner with Victor Goddet of the velodrome at the Parc des Princes [13]\n\n\nOrigins\nThe Tour de France was created in 1903 The roots of the Tour de France trace back to the emergence of two rival sports newspapers in the country On one hand was Le Vélo, the first and the largest daily sports newspaper in France, [11] [12] on the other was L'Auto, which had been set up by journalists and businesspeople including Comte Jules-Albert de Dion, Adolphe Clément, and Édouard Michelin in 1899 The rival paper emerged following disagreements over the Dreyfus Affair De Dion,

Vélo gave Darracq too much attention and him too little De Dion was rich and could afford to indulge his whims The new newspaper appointed Henri Desgrange as the editor He was a prominent cyclist and owner with Victor Goddet of the velodrome at the Parc des Princes [13]\n\n\nThe first Tour de France (1903)\nThe first Tour de France was staged in 1903 The plan was a five-stage race from 31 May to 5 July, starting in Paris and stopping in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, and Nantes before returning to Paris Toulouse was added later to break the long haul across southern France from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Stages would go through the night and finish next afternoon, with rest days before riders set off again But this proved too daunting and the costs too great for most [17] and only 15 competitors had entered Desgrange had never been wholly convinced and he came close to dropping the idea [18] Instead, he cut the length to 19 days, changed the dates to 1 to 19 July, and offered a daily allowance to those who averaged at least 20 kilometres per hour (12 mph) on all the stages, [19] equivalent to what a rider would have expected to earn each day had he worked in a factory [20] He also cut the entry fee from 20 to 10 francs and set the first prize at 12,000 francs and the prize for each day's winner at 3,000 francs The winner would thereby win six times what most workers earned in a year [20] That attracted between 60 and 80 entrants – the higher number may have included serious inquiries and some who dropped out – among them not just professionals but amateurs, some unemployed, and some simply adventurous [14]\n\n\n1904–1939\nSuch was the passion that the first Tour created in spectators and riders that Desgrange said the 1904 Tour de France would be the last Cheating was rife, and riders were beaten up by rival fans as they neared the top of the col de la République, sometimes called the col du Grand Bois, outside St-Étienne [24] The leading riders, including the winner Maurice Garin, were disqualified, though it took the Union Vélocipèdique de France until 30 November to make the decision [25] McGann says the UVF waited so long \"...well aware of the passions aroused by the race.\" [26] Desgrange's opinion of the fighting and cheating showed in the headline of his reaction in L'Auto: THE END [27]\n\n\n1947–1969\nIn 1944, L'Auto was closed—its doors nailed shut—and its belongings, including the Tour, sequestrated by the state for publishing articles too close to the Germans [44] Rights to the Tour were therefore owned by the government Jacques Goddet was allowed to publish another daily sports paper, L'Équipe, but there was a rival candidate to run the Tour: a consortium of Sports and Miroir Sprint Each organised a candidate race L'Équipe and Le Parisien Libéré had La Course du Tour de France, [45] while Sports and Miroir Sprint had La Ronde de France Both were five stages, the longest the government would allow because of shortages [46] L'Équipe's race was better organised and appealed more to the public because it featured national teams that had been successful before the war, when French cycling was at a high L'Équipe was given the right to organise the 1947 Tour de France [42] However, L'Équipe's finances were never sound, and Goddet accepted an advance by Émilion Amaury, who had supported his bid to run the postwar Tour [42] Amaury was a newspaper magnate whose sole condition was that his sports editor, Félix Lévitan, should join Goddet for the Tour [42] The two worked together—with Goddet running the sporting side, and Lévitan the financial.\n\n\n1969–1987\nIn the early 1970s, the race was dominated by Eddy Merckx, who won the General Classification five times, the Mountains Classification twice, the Points Classification three times and held the record for the most stage victories (34) [57] until overtaken by Mark Cavendish in 2024 Merckx's dominating style earned him the nickname \"The Cannibal\" In 1969, he already had a commanding lead when he launched a long-distance solo attack in the mountains which none of the other elite riders could answer, resulting in an eventual winning margin of nearly eighteen minutes In 1973 he did not win because he did not enter the Tour; instead, his great rival Luis Ocaña won Merckx's winning streak came to an end when he finished 2nd to Bernard Thévenet in 1975.\n\n\n1988–1997\nMonths before the start of the 1988 Tour, director Jean-François Naquet-Radiguet was replaced by Xavier Louy [64] In 1988, the Tour was organised by Jean-Pierre Courcol, the director of L'Équipe, then in 1989 by Jean-Pierre Carenso and then by Jean-Marie Leblanc, who in 1989 had been race director The former television presenter Christian Prudhomme—he commentated on the Tour among other events—replaced Leblanc in 2007, having been assistant director for three years In 1993 ownership of L'Équipe moved to the Amaury Group, which formed Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) to oversee its sports operations, although the Tour itself is operated by its subsidiary the Société du Tour de France [65]\n\n\n1998–2011\nDuring the 1998 Tour de France, a doping scandal known as the Festina Affair shook the sport to its core when it became apparent that there was systematic doping going on in the sport Numerous riders and a handful of teams were either thrown out of the race, or left of their own free will, and in the end Marco Pantani survived to win his lone Tour in a decimated main field The 1999 Tour de France was billed as the ‘Tour of Renewal’ as the sport tried to clean up its image following the doping fiasco of the previous year Initially it seemed to be a Cinderella story when cancer survivor Lance Armstrong stole the show on Sestriere and kept on riding to the first of his astonishing seven consecutive Tour de France victories; however, in retrospect, 1999 was just the beginning of the doping problem getting much, much worse Following Armstrong's retirement in 2005, the 2006 edition saw his former teammate Floyd Landis finally get the chance he worked so hard for with a stunning and improbable solo breakaway on Stage 17 in which he set himself up to win the Tour in the final time trial, which he then did Not long after the Tour was over, however, Landis was accused of doping and had his Tour win revoked [69]\n\n\nSince 2012\nTeam Sky dominated the event for several years, with wins for Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome (four times) and Geraint Thomas before Egan Bernal became the first Colombian winner in 2019  The streak was interrupted only by Vincenzo Nibali's 2014 win.\n\n\nClassifications\nThe oldest and main competition in the Tour de France is known as the \"general classification\", for which the yellow jersey is awarded; the winner of this is said to have won the race [85] A few riders from each team aim to win overall, but there are three further competitions to draw riders of all specialties: points, mountains, and a classification for young riders with general classification aspirations [85] The leader of each of the aforementioned classifications wears a distinctive jersey, with riders leading multiple classifications wearing the jersey of the most prestigious that he leads [85] In addition to these four classifications, there are several minor and discontinued classifications that are competed for during the race [85]\n\n\nGeneral classification\nThe oldest and most sought-after classification in the Tour de France is the general classification [85] [86] All of the stages are timed to the finish [86] The riders' times are compounded with their previous stage times; so the rider with the lowest aggregate time is the leader of the race [85] [86] The leader is determined after each stage's conclusion: he gains the privilege to wear the yellow jersey, presented on a podium in the stage's finishing town, for the next stage If he is leading more than one classification that awards a jersey, he wears the yellow one, since the general classification is the most important one in the race [9] Between 1905 and 1912 inclusive, in response to concerns about rider cheating in the 1904 race, the general classification was awarded according to a point-based system based on their placings in each stage, and the rider with the lowest total of points after the Tour's conclusion was the winner [86]\n\n\nMountains classification\nThe mountains classification is the second-oldest jersey awarding classification in the Tour de France The mountains classification was added to the Tour de France in the 1933 edition and was first won by Vicente Trueba [85] [87] Prizes for the classification were first awarded in 1934 [87] During stages of the race containing climbs, points are awarded to the first riders to reach the top of each categorized climb, with points available for up to the first 10 riders, depending on the classification of the climb Climbs are classified according to the steepness and length of that particular hill, with more points available for harder climbs The classification was preceded by the meilleur grimpeur (English: best climber) which was awarded by the organising newspaper L'Auto to a cyclist who completed each race.\n\n\nPoints classification\nThe points classification is the third oldest of the currently awarded jersey classifications [85] It was introduced in the 1953 Tour de France and was first won by Fritz Schär The classification was added to draw the participation of the sprinters as well as celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Tour Points are given to the first 15 riders to finish a stage, with an additional set of points given to the first 15 riders to cross a pre-determined 'sprint' point during the route of each stage The point classification leader green jersey is worn by the rider who at the start of each stage, has the greatest number of points [86]\n\n\nYoung rider classification\nThe leader of the classification is determined the same way as the general classification, with the riders' times being added up after each stage and the eligible rider with lowest aggregate time is dubbed the leader The Young rider classification is restricted to the riders that will stay under the age of 26 in the calendar year the race is held Originally the classification was restricted to neo-professionals – riders that are in their first three years of professional racing – until 1983 In 1983, the organizers made it so that only first time riders were eligible for the classification In 1987, the organizers changed the rules of the classification to what they are today.\n\n\nMinor classifications and prizes\nThe prix de la combativité goes to the rider who most animates the day, usually by trying to break clear of the field The most combative rider wears a number printed white-on-beige instead of black-on-white next day An award goes to the most aggressive rider throughout the Tour Already in 1908 a sort of combativity award was offered, when Sports Populaires and L'Education Physique created Le Prix du Courage, 100 francs and a silver gilt medal for \"the rider having finished the course, even if unplaced, who is particularly distinguished for the energy he has used.\" [94] [95] The modern competition started in 1958 [94] [96] In 1959, a Super Combativity award for the most combative cyclist of the Tour was awarded It was initially not awarded every year, but since 1981 it has been given annually Eddy Merckx has the most wins (4) for the overall award.\n\n\nHistorical classifications\nThere has been an intermediate sprints classification, which from 1984 awarded a red jersey [98] for points awarded to the first three to pass intermediate points during the stage These sprints also scored points towards the points classification and bonuses towards the general classification The intermediate sprints classification with its red jersey was abolished in 1989, [99] but the intermediate sprints have remained, offering points for the points classification and, until 2007, time bonuses for the general classification.\n\n\nLanterne rouge\nThe rider who has taken most time is called the lanterne rouge (red lantern, as in the red light at the back of a vehicle so it can be seen in the dark) and in past years sometimes carried a small red light beneath his saddle Such was sympathy that he could command higher fees in the races that previously followed the Tour [clarification needed] In 1939 and 1948 the organisers excluded the last rider every day, to encourage more competitive racing [n 6]\n\n\nPrizes\nPrize money has always been awarded From 20,000 francs the first year, [102]\nprize money has increased each year, although from 1976 to 1987 the first prize was an apartment offered by a race sponsor The first prize in 1988 was a car, a studio-apartment, a work of art, and 500,000 francs in cash Prizes only in cash returned in 1990 [103]\n\n\nTrophy\nThe winner of general classification is the recipient of Coupe Omnisports, presented by the president of the French Republic [105] The Trophy is realized by the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres and was used since 1975, the first time Tour finished on the Champs-Élysées [106]\n\n\nStages\nThe modern tour typically has 21 stages, one per day.\n\n\nMass-start stages\nThe Tour directors categorise mass-start stages into 'flat', 'hilly', or 'mountain' [110] This affects the points awarded in the sprint classification, whether the 3 kilometer rule is operational [clarification needed], and the permitted disqualification time in which riders must finish (which is the winners' time plus a pre-determined percentage of that time) [111] Time bonuses of 10, 6, and 4 seconds are awarded to the first three finishers, though this was not done from 2008 to 2014 [112] Bonuses were previously also awarded to winners of intermediate sprints.\n\n\nTime trials\nThe first time trial in the Tour was between La Roche-sur-Yon and Nantes (80 km) in 1934 [113] The first stage in modern Tours is often a short trial, a prologue, to decide who wears yellow on the opening day The first prologue was in 1967 [54] The 1988 event, at La Baule, was called \"la préface\" [114] There are usually two or three time trials The final time trial has sometimes been the final stage, more recently often the penultimate stage.\n\n\nNotable stages\nSince 1975 the race has finished with laps of the Champs-Élysées As the peloton arrives in downtown Paris the French Air Force does a three-jet flyover with the three colors of the French flag in smoke behind them This stage rarely challenges the leader because it is flat and the leader usually has too much time in hand to be denied In modern times, there tends to be a gentlemen's agreement: while the points classification is still contended if possible, the overall classification is not fought over; because of this, it is not uncommon for the de facto winner of the overall classification to ride into Paris holding a glass of champagne The only time the maillot jaune was attacked in a manner that lasted all the way through the end of this stage was during the 1979 Tour de France In 1987, Pedro Delgado vowed to attack during the stage to challenge the 40-second lead held by Stephen Roche He was unsuccessful and he and Roche finished in the peloton [115] In 2005, controversy arose when Alexander Vinokourov attacked and won the stage, in the process taking fifth place overall from Levi Leipheimer [116] This attack was not a threat to the overall lead, but was a long-shot at the Podium standings, as Vinokourov was about five minutes behind third place.\n\n\nDeciding the route\nTo host a stage start or finish brings prestige and business to a town The prologue and first stage (Grand Départ) are particularly prestigious The race may start with a prologue (too short to go between towns) in which case the start of the next day's racing, which would be considered stage 1, usually in the same town In 2007 director Christian Prudhomme said that \"in general, for a period of five years we have the Tour start outside France three times and within France twice.\" [123]\n\n\nAdvertising caravan\nWith the switch to the use of national teams in 1930, the costs of accommodating riders fell to the organizers instead of the sponsors and Henri Desgrange raised the money by allowing advertisers to precede the race The procession of often colourfully decorated trucks and cars became known as the publicity caravan It formalised an existing situation, companies having started to follow the race The first to sign to precede the Tour was the chocolate company, Menier, one of those who had followed the race Its head of publicity, Paul Thévenin, had first put the idea to Desgrange [125] It paid 50,000 francs Preceding the race was more attractive to advertisers because spectators gathered by the road long before the race or could be attracted from their houses Advertisers following the race found that many who had watched the race had already gone home Menier handed out tons of chocolate in that first year of preceding the race, as well as 500,000 policemen's hats printed with the company's name The success led to the caravan's existence being formalised the following year.\n\n\nPolitics\nThe first three Tours from 1903 to 1905 stayed within France The 1906 race went into Alsace-Lorraine, territory annexed by the German Empire in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War Passage was secured through a meeting at Metz between Desgrange's collaborator, Alphonse Steinès, and the German governor.\n\n\nCorsica\nPrior to 2013, the Tour de France had visited every region of Metropolitan France except Corsica [131] Jean-Marie Leblanc, when he was organiser, said the island had never asked for a stage start there It would be difficult to find accommodation for 4,000 people, he said [132] The spokesman of the Corsican nationalist party Party of the Corsican Nation, François Alfonsi, said: \"The organisers must be afraid of terrorist attacks If they are really thinking of a possible terrorist action, they are wrong Our movement, which is nationalist and in favour of self-government, would be delighted if the Tour came to Corsica.\" [132] The opening three stages of the 2013 Tour de France were held on Corsica as part of the celebrations for the 100th edition of the race.\n\n\nStart and finish of the Tour\nMost stages are in mainland France, although since the mid-1950s it has become common to visit nearby countries [133] The Tour has visited thirteen different countries in its history: Andorra, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, San Marino, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, all of which have hosted stages or part of a stage [134] Since 1975 the finish has been on the Champs-Élysées in Paris; from 1903 to 1967 the race finished at the Parc des Princes stadium in western Paris and from 1968 to 1974 at the Piste Municipale south of the capital [100]  In the 111th edition, because of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, the race ended outside Paris for the first time, on the Place Masséna in Nice [135]\n\n\nStarts abroad\nThe following editions of the Tour started, or are planned to start, outside France: [137] [138]\n\n\nBroadcasting\nThe Tour was first followed only by journalists from L'Auto, the organisers The race was founded to increase sales of a floundering newspaper and its editor, Desgrange, saw no reason to allow rival publications to profit.\nThe first time papers other than L'Auto were allowed was 1921, when 15 press cars were allowed for regional and foreign reporters [139]\n\n\nCulture\nThe Tour is an important cultural event for fans in Europe Millions [158] line the route, some having camped for a week to get the best view.\n\n\nArts\nThe Tour has inspired several popular songs in France, notably P'tit gars du Tour (1932), Les Tours de France (1936) and Faire le Tour de France (1950) German electronic group Kraftwerk composed \"Tour de France\" in 1983 – described as a minimalistic \"melding of man and machine\" [165] – and produced an album, Tour de France Soundtracks in 2003, the centenary of the Tour.\n\n\nPost-Tour criteriums\nAfter the Tour de France there are criteriums in the Netherlands and Belgium These races are public spectacles where thousands of people can see their heroes from the Tour de France race The budget of a criterium is over 100,000 Euro, with most of the money going to the riders Jersey winners or big-name riders earn between 20 and 60 thousand euros per race in start money [176]\n\n\nDoping\nAllegations of doping have plagued the Tour almost since it began in 1903 Early riders consumed alcohol and used ether to dull the pain [177] Over the years they began to increase performance and the Union Cycliste Internationale and governments enacted policies to combat the practice.\n\n\nDeaths\nCyclists who have died during the Tour de France:\n\n\nRecords and statistics\nOne rider has been King of the Mountains, won the combination classification, combativity award, the points competition, and the Tour in the same year—Eddy Merckx in 1969, which was also the first year he participated [216] The following year he came close to repeating the feat, but was five points behind the winner in the points classification The only other rider to come close to this achievement is Bernard Hinault in 1979, who won the overall and points competitions and placed second in the mountains classification.\n\n\nRecord winners\nFour riders have won five times: Jacques Anquetil (FRA), Eddy Merckx (BEL), Bernard Hinault (FRA), and Miguel Induráin (ESP) Indurain achieved the mark with a record five consecutive wins.\n\n\nRelated events\nL'Étape du Tour (French for 'stage of the Tour') is an organised mass participation cyclosportive event that allows amateur cyclists to race over the same route as a Tour de France stage First held in 1993, and now organised by the ASO, in conjunction with Vélo Magazine, it takes place each July, normally on a Tour rest day [234]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

The film stars Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan, Shiney Ahuja, and Amrita Rao in key roles. The movie's plot revolves around a haunted palace in Varanasi, and it explores themes of love, family, and the supernatural.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film begins with a flashback sequence that introduces the royal family of Varanasi. Badrinarayan \"Badri\" Chaturvedi, the head of the family, is a man with a dark past. He is haunted by the ghost of Manjulika, an Odissi dancer from Bengal who was killed by his father. The family's ancestral palace is believed to be cursed, and many people have lost their lives within its walls.\n\nThe story then shifts to the present day, where we are introduced to Siddharth, the son of Badri's elder brother, Kedar. Siddharth is a young man who has returned to Varanasi from the United States, where he has been living with his archeologist wife, Avni. They are on a whirlwind romance, and their marriage has just taken place.\n\nHowever, Siddharth's return to Varanasi is not without its complications. He is met with a mixture of happiness and anger from his family members, particularly his childhood friend, Radha, who has been in love with him for years. Radha is Badri's adopted daughter, and she has been waiting for Siddharth to return to her all these years.\n\nAs the story progresses, Siddharth and Avni become increasingly entangled in the mysteries of the haunted palace. They begin to experience strange occurrences, and they soon realize that the palace is indeed haunted by the ghost of Manjulika.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented ensemble cast, including:\n\n* Akshay Kumar as Siddharth\n* Vidya Balan as Avni\n* Shiney Ahuja as Kedar\n* Amrita Rao as Radha\n* Paresh Rawal as Badrinarayan \"Badri\" Chaturvedi\n* Ravi Kishan as a local guide\n* Vijay Raaz as a local musician\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's music score was composed and produced by Ranjit Barot.

It is a remake of a traditional Indian folk song, and it features Neeraj Shridhar on vocals. The track reportedly samples JtL's \"My Lecon.\"\n\nAnother popular song from the album is \"Labon Ko,\" which is sung by KK.

The design of the Slava-class cruisers began in the late 1960s, with the primary objective of creating a less expensive alternative to the nuclear-powered Kirov-class battlecruisers.\n\n**Design and History**\n\nThe Slava-class cruisers were designed to be conventionally powered, using a gas turbine propulsion system, unlike the Kirov-class battlecruisers, which were nuclear powered. The primary armament of the Slava-class was intended to be the P-500 Bazalt missile, which was a long-range anti-ship missile developed in the 1960s. However, the development of the Bazalt missile was plagued by technical issues and delays, which led to a significant delay in the construction of the Slava-class cruisers.\n\n## Development of the P-500 Bazalt Missile\n\nThe P-500 Bazalt missile was a long-range anti-ship missile developed by the Soviet Union in the 1960s. It was designed to be a high-speed, radar-guided missile that could engage targets at a distance of up to 500 kilometers. However, the development of the Bazalt missile was marred by technical issues, including problems with its propulsion system and guidance system. These issues led to a significant delay in the development of the missile, which ultimately affected the construction of the Slava-class cruisers.\n\n## Design Changes and Upgrades\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the design of the Slava-class cruisers underwent significant changes and upgrades. The primary armament of the cruisers was upgraded to the P-1000 Vulkan AShM missile, which was a more advanced and reliable anti-ship missile developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The P-1000 Vulkan AShM missile was a radar-guided, high-speed missile that could engage targets at a distance of up to 100 kilometers.\n\n## Construction and Service History\n\nThe first Slava-class cruiser, Marshal Ustinov, was commissioned in 1983. The second cruiser, Varyag, was commissioned in 1985, and the third cruiser, Moscow, was commissioned in 1988. The Slava-class cruisers served in the Soviet Navy and later in the Russian Navy, participating in various naval exercises and operations. In recent years, the Slava-class cruisers have undergone significant upgrades and modernizations, including the replacement of their primary armament with more advanced missiles.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* HVU Marshal Ustinov underway\n* Varyag in 2012\n* Moscow in 2013\n* Slava-class cruiser profile\n\n**Ships**\n\n* Marshal Ustinov (lead ship)\n* Varyag\n* Moscow\n* Georgy Pobedonosets (planned, but not completed)\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Kirov-class battlecruiser\n* P-500 Bazalt missile\n* P-1000 Vulkan AShM missile\n* Soviet Navy\n* Russian Navy\n* List of ships of the Soviet Navy\n\n**References**\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Russian Navy Slava-class cruiser page\n* Slava-class cruiser at globalsecurity.org", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Slava-class_cruiser\" following this outline:\n\n\nDesign and history\nThe design started in the late 1960s, based around use of the P-500 Bazalt missile The cruiser was intended as a less expensive conventionally powered alternative to the nuclear-powered Kirov-class battlecruisers All are now armed with P-1000 Vulkan AShM missiles, developed in the late 1970s to late 1980s There was a long delay in this programme, while the problems with the Bazalt were resolved [3]\n\n\nGallery\n\n\nShips\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He played a pivotal role in India's space program and was a key figure in the development of the country's nuclear energy program. Throughout his life, Sarabhai was driven by a passion for scientific research and a commitment to using science for the betterment of society.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nVikram Sarabhai was born on August 12, 1919, in Ahmedabad, India, to a Gujarati Jain family. His father, Ambalal Sarabhai, was a prominent industrialist who was committed to the Indian independence movement. Sarabhai's family was known for their strong cultural and intellectual traditions, and his parents encouraged his early interest in science and mathematics.\n\nSarabhai attended Gujarat College in Ahmedabad, but later moved to the University of Cambridge, England, where he took his tripos in natural sciences in 1940. He was a brilliant student and was drawn to the study of physics, particularly the field of cosmic rays. In 1945, he returned to Cambridge to pursue his PhD and wrote a thesis on \"Cosmic Ray Investigations in Tropical Latitudes\" in 1947.\n\nIn 1942, Sarabhai married the classical dancer Mrinalini, and the couple had two children. Their daughter, Mallika, gained prominence as an actress and activist, while their son, Kartikeya, also became an active person in science.\n\n**Professional Life**\n\nSarabhai's career in science was marked by a series of significant achievements. In 1947, he founded the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad, which was to become the cradle of space sciences in India. The laboratory had a modest beginning at his residence, \"The Retreat,\" where research on cosmic rays was conducted.\n\nSarabhai's work at PRL was focused on developing India's space program. He was instrumental in setting up the country's first rocket launching facility and was a key figure in the development of the SLV-3 (Satellite Launch Vehicle) rocket. The SLV-3 was a significant achievement for India's space program, as it marked the country's first indigenous satellite launch.\n\nSarabhai's contributions to science and technology were not limited to space exploration. He was also a pioneer in the field of nuclear energy and played a key role in the development of India's nuclear program. He was a strong advocate for the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and was a vocal critic of nuclear proliferation.\n\n**Death**\n\nSarabhai died on December 30, 1971, at the age of 52, in Trivandrum (now Thiruvananthapuram). He was to review the SLV design before his departure for Bombay the same night. Within an hour into the conversation, Sarabhai died of cardiac arrest. His body was cremated in Ahmedabad.\n\n**Distinguished Positions**\n\nSarabhai's legacy continues to be celebrated in India and around the world. On August 12, 2019, Google's Doodle for India commemorated Sarabhai's 100th birth anniversary. The doodle was a tribute to Sarabhai's contributions to science and his role in shaping India's space program.\n\nIn 2020, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and ACK Media released a book on Sarabhai's life and achievements. The book, titled \"Vikram Sarabhai: Pioneering India's Space Programme,\" was released in Amar Chitra Katha's digital platform and merchandise.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nSarabhai's legacy extends far beyond his contributions to science and technology. He was a true patriot who was committed to using science for the betterment of society. He was a strong advocate for the use of science and technology to address some of the most pressing challenges facing India, including poverty, hunger, and inequality.\n\nSarabhai's commitment to science and society is reflected in the many institutions and programs that have been established in his name. The Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, the Physical Research Laboratory, and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) are just a few examples of the many institutions that have been established to honor his legacy.\n\nIn conclusion, Vikram Sarabhai was a truly remarkable individual who left an indelible mark on the world of science and society. His contributions to space exploration, nuclear energy, and education continue to inspire and motivate people around the world. His legacy serves as a reminder of the power of science to transform society and improve the human condition.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Vikram_Sarabhai\" following this outline:\n\n\nPersonal life\nVikram Sarabhai was born on 12 August 1919 in a Gujarati Jain family, in Ahmedabad, India [3] [4] His father was Ambalal Sarabhai a major industrialist committed to the Indian independence movement [5] [1] Vikram Sarabhai married the classical dancer Mrinalini in 1942 The couple had two children His daughter Mallika gained prominence as an actress and activist, and his son Kartikeya too became an active person in science  He attended Gujarat College, Ahmedabad, but later moved to the University of Cambridge, England, where he took his tripos in natural sciences in 1940 [6] In 1945 he returned to Cambridge to pursue his PhD and wrote a thesis, \"Cosmic Ray Investigations in Tropical Latitudes\", in 1947 [6]\n\n\nProfessional life\nKnown as the cradle of space sciences in India, the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) was founded in 1947 by Vikram Sarabhai [7] PRL had a modest beginning at his residence, the \"RETREAT\", with research on cosmic rays.\n\n\nDeath\nOn 30 December 1971, Sarabhai was to review the SLV design before his departure for Bombay the same night He had spoken to A P J Abdul Kalam on the telephone Within an hour into the conversation, Sarabhai died of cardiac arrest at the age of 52 in Trivandrum (now Thiruvananthapuram) His body was cremated in Ahmedabad.\n\n\nDistinguished positions\nOn 12 August 2019, Google's Doodle for India commemorated Sarabhai's 100th birth anniversary [17]\nOn 30 September 2020, ACK Media along with ISRO released a book namely, Vikram Sarabhai: Pioneering India's Space Programme It was released in Amar Chitra Katha's digital platform and merchandise, ACK Comics [citation needed]\n\n\nLegacy\nOn 12 August 2019, Google's Doodle for India commemorated Sarabhai's 100th birth anniversary [17]\nOn 30 September 2020, ACK Media along with ISRO released a book namely, Vikram Sarabhai: Pioneering India's Space Programme It was released in Amar Chitra Katha's digital platform and merchandise, ACK Comics [citation needed]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nOn 12 August 2019, Google's Doodle for India commemorated Sarabhai's 100th birth anniversary [17]\nOn 30 September 2020, ACK Media along with ISRO released a book namely, Vikram Sarabhai: Pioneering India's Space Programme It was released in Amar Chitra Katha's digital platform and merchandise, ACK Comics [citation needed]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
