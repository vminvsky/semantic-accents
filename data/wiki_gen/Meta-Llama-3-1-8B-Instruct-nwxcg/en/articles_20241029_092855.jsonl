It was the fifth election held in four years, following the 2019 Israeli legislative election, the 2020 Israeli legislative election, the 2021 Israeli legislative election, and the 2022 Israeli legislative election. The election was held after Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's government collapsed in June 2021, and a new government was formed in December 2022.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 Israeli legislative election was the first time that Israel's electoral system was used to elect a government. The system, also known as the mixed-member proportional representation system, was introduced in 2014. Under this system, voters choose between two lists: a list of candidates for the Knesset, and a list of parties to vote for. The number of seats in the Knesset is 120, with 15 seats allocated to the Arab Joint List, and the remaining seats allocated to the Jewish parties.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe campaign for the 2022 Israeli legislative election began in July 2022, with the formation of the United Right coalition, led by Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich.

The controversy centered on allegations that the pair had breached COVID-19 lockdown rules by attending a dinner party at a private flat in Durham, North East England.\n\n**#Durham event**\n\nThe controversy began on April 30, 2021, when it was reported that Starmer and his team had attended a dinner party at a private flat in Durham. The party was allegedly held at a flat owned by a Labour Party official, and it was claimed that the group had stayed overnight in the flat. The allegations sparked widespread criticism, with many accusing the Labour leader of hypocrisy given the party's stance on COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n**##Video footage**\n\nVideo footage of the party was later leaked to the press, showing Starmer and his team eating and drinking in the flat. The footage appeared to show the group breaching COVID-19 lockdown rules, which prohibited social gatherings and overnight stays outside of one's household. The footage was widely shared on social media, further fueling the controversy.\n\n**#Response to Partygate**\n\nThe Beergate controversy coincided with the ongoing Partygate scandal, in which senior members of the Conservative Party were accused of breaching COVID-19 lockdown rules. The Labour Party seized on the controversy, accusing the Conservatives of hypocrisy and double standards. Starmer and his team repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, insisting that they had done nothing wrong and that the allegations were being unfairly politicized.\n\n**#Initial police review**\n\nIn response to the allegations, Durham Constabulary launched an initial review of the incident. The review was led by the police's Professional Standards Department, which investigates allegations of police misconduct. The review was intended to determine whether Starmer and his team had breached any laws or regulations. However, the review's findings were inconclusive, and the police ultimately decided not to take any further action.\n\n**##Calls for further investigation**\n\nDespite the police's decision not to pursue the matter further, many critics continued to demand that Starmer and his team face further investigation. The opposition Conservative Party, led by Boris Johnson, seized on the controversy, accusing Labour of hypocrisy and double standards. The Conservative Party's deputy leader, Dominic Raab, called for Starmer to be investigated by the police, citing concerns about the Labour leader's integrity.\n\n**#Police investigation**\n\nIn May 2022, Durham Constabulary announced that they would be launching a full-scale investigation into the Beergate scandal. The investigation was led by a senior detective, who was tasked with gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses. The investigation was intended to determine whether Starmer and his team had breached any laws or regulations, and whether they had lied about their involvement in the party.\n\n**##Start of investigation**\n\nThe investigation began in June 2022, with the police issuing a formal statement outlining the scope of the inquiry. The police confirmed that they would be interviewing Starmer and his team, as well as other witnesses, in connection with the allegations. The investigation was expected to take several months to complete, and the police warned that they would not be commenting on the progress of the inquiry in real-time.\n\n**##New allegations**\n\nAs the investigation into Beergate continued, new allegations emerged that further complicated the situation. It was claimed that Starmer and his team had not only attended the dinner party but had also lied about their involvement in the party. The allegations sparked widespread outrage, with many accusing the Labour leader of dishonesty and untrustworthiness.\n\n**##Starmer's and Rayner's resignation pledges**\n\nIn response to the new allegations, Starmer and Rayner both pledged to resign if they were found to have lied about their involvement in the party. The resignation pledges were made in a bid to salvage the Labour leader's reputation and restore public trust. However, the pledges were met with skepticism, with many critics accusing the pair of trying to avoid accountability.\n\n**##Responses to pledges**\n\nThe responses to Starmer's and Rayner's resignation pledges were overwhelmingly negative. The opposition Conservative Party, led by Boris Johnson, accused the Labour leader of being dishonest and untrustworthy. The Conservative Party's deputy leader, Dominic Raab, called for Starmer to be sacked as Labour leader, citing concerns about the party's integrity.\n\n**##Police questionnaires**\n\nAs part of the investigation, the police issued questionnaires to Starmer and his team, requesting that they provide detailed information about their involvement in the party. The questionnaires were intended to gather evidence and verify the Labour leader's account of events. However, Starmer's team refused to cooperate with the police, citing concerns about the investigation's impartiality.\n\n**##Outcome**\n\nThe outcome of the investigation into Beergate was announced in September 2022. The police concluded that Starmer and his team had not breached any laws or regulations, but that they had lied about their involvement in the party. The Labour leader was not charged with any offenses, but the investigation's findings sparked widespread outrage and calls for him to resign.\n\n**##Responses to the outcome**\n\nThe responses to the outcome of the investigation were overwhelmingly negative. The opposition Conservative Party, led by Boris Johnson, accused the Labour leader of dishonesty and untrustworthiness. The Conservative Party's deputy leader, Dominic Raab, called for Starmer to be sacked as Labour leader, citing concerns about the party's integrity. The Labour Party's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, pledged to continue to support Starmer, despite the investigation's findings.\n\n**#Related developments**\n\nThe Beergate scandal was widely covered in the media, with many outlets publishing detailed accounts of the controversy. The scandal also sparked a wider debate about the role of politicians in the UK and their accountability to the public. The scandal also highlighted concerns about the Labour Party's integrity and the leadership of Keir Starmer.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* Partygate\n* COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom\n* Durham Constabulary\n* Labour Party\n* Keir Starmer\n\n**#Notes**\n\nThis article is based on publicly available information and has not been independently verified.

It was a key battle in the Donbas region, as the city of Sievierodonetsk was a strategic location for control of the surrounding area.\n\n# Background\n\nThe city of Sievierodonetsk, located in the Luhansk Oblast of eastern Ukraine, has a population of approximately 137,000 people. It is situated near the border with the Russian-occupied Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). The city has a significant industrial base, with a focus on metalworking, chemicals, and machinery production.\n\nIn 2022, the city became a focal point for the Russian military's efforts to capture the Donbas region. The Russians aimed to secure control of the Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts, which would provide a land bridge to the Crimean Peninsula and give them access to the Sea of Azov.\n\n# Battle\n\n## Encirclement attempts\n\nThe Russian military began to encircle Sievierodonetsk in late April 2022, as they advanced on the city from the north and east. Ukrainian forces, however, managed to hold their ground and prevent the Russians from closing the ring around the city.\n\n## Attack on the city\n\nOn June 24, 2022, the Russian military launched a full-scale assault on Sievierodonetsk, with artillery and missile strikes aimed at weakening the city's defenses. The attack was supported by Russian airborne troops, who were dropped behind Ukrainian lines to disrupt their command structure.\n\nThe Ukrainian military, led by the 13th Assault Brigade, put up fierce resistance against the Russian assault. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, they managed to hold off the Russian advance for several days.\n\n## Ukraine rejects surrender ultimatum\n\nAs the Russian military continued to press their attack, Ukrainian forces received a surrender ultimatum from their Russian counterparts. The ultimatum demanded that the Ukrainians lay down their arms and surrender the city, or face the consequences.\n\nThe Ukrainian military rejected the ultimatum, citing their commitment to defending their country and their people. They vowed to continue fighting, even in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\n## Fall of Sievierodonetsk\n\nDespite their bravery, the Ukrainian military was eventually unable to hold off the Russian advance. On July 2, 2022, the city of Sievierodonetsk fell to the Russian military, after a fierce battle that lasted several weeks.\n\nThe fall of Sievierodonetsk marked a significant turning point in the battle for the Donbas region. The city's capture gave the Russians control of the surrounding area, and paved the way for further advances into Ukrainian-held territory.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe fall of Sievierodonetsk had significant consequences for the Ukrainian military and the people of the city. Many civilians were forced to flee their homes, as the city was abandoned by the Ukrainian authorities.\n\nThe Russian military, meanwhile, continued to press their advance into Ukrainian-held territory. The city of Lysychansk, which had been the last major Ukrainian stronghold in the Luhansk Oblast, was eventually captured by the Russians in mid-July 2022.\n\n# Casualties\n\nThe battle for Sievierodonetsk was one of the bloodiest of the conflict, with significant losses on both sides. The exact number of casualties is difficult to determine, but estimates suggest that hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians were killed or wounded during the battle.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThe battle for Sievierodonetsk was a significant turning point in the conflict, as it marked the beginning of a Russian advance into Ukrainian-held territory. The capture of the city gave the Russians control of the surrounding area, and paved the way for further advances into Ukrainian-held territory.\n\nThe battle highlighted the bravery and sacrifice of Ukrainian soldiers, who fought against overwhelming odds to defend their country and their people. It also highlighted the devastating impact of the conflict on civilians, who were caught in the crossfire and forced to flee their homes.\n\n# See also\n\n* Battle of Severodonetsk (2022)\n* Battle of Lysychansk\n* Russian invasion of Ukraine\n* Donbas conflict\n* Siege of Luhansk", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Battle_of_Sievierodonetsk_(2022)\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Battle\n##Encirclement attempts\n##Attack on the city\n##Ukraine rejects surrender ultimatum\n##Fall of Sievierodonetsk\n#Aftermath\n#Casualties\n#Analysis\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The earthquake was a significant event in the region, with far-reaching consequences for the affected communities.\n\n**#Earthquake**\n\n### **Tectonic setting**\n\nThe region where the earthquake occurred is a seismically active area, located in the eastern part of Afghanistan. The country is situated in the boundary between the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, which makes it prone to earthquakes. The Indian plate is moving northwards at a rate of about 2 cm per year, causing the Eurasian plate to be subjected to compressional forces. This process has resulted in the formation of the Hindu Kush mountain range, which runs along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.\n\nThe earthquake was a result of the movement of these tectonic plates, specifically the interaction between the Eurasian and Indian plates. The earthquake occurred at a depth of approximately 20 km, which is relatively shallow. Shallow earthquakes tend to cause more damage and are more likely to be felt over a larger area.\n\n### **Characteristics**\n\nThe earthquake was a major event, with a magnitude of 6.2 on the Richter scale. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the Paktika province of Afghanistan, approximately 100 km from the city of Khost. The earthquake was a right-lateral strike-slip faulting event, which means that the ground on one side of the fault moved horizontally to the right.\n\nThe earthquake was reported to have lasted for around 30 seconds, which is a relatively long duration for an earthquake. This duration, combined with the shallow depth and significant magnitude, made the earthquake particularly destructive.\n\n### **Intensity**\n\nThe intensity of the earthquake was felt over a wide area, with reports of damage and casualties coming in from several provinces in Afghanistan, including Khost, Paktika, and Nangarhar. The earthquake was felt as far away as Pakistan, where it caused minor damage and panic.\n\nThe intensity of the earthquake was estimated to be around 7-8 on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale, which is a measure of the effects of an earthquake on the Earth's surface. This intensity indicates that the earthquake was strong enough to cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure, as well as triggering landslides and rockfalls.\n\n### **Aftershocks**\n\nIn the days following the main earthquake, several aftershocks were reported in the region. These aftershocks were smaller in magnitude than the main earthquake, ranging from 3-5 on the Richter scale. However, they still caused significant disruption and concern among the affected communities.\n\nThe aftershocks were a result of the continued movement of the tectonic plates, as the Earth's crust adjusted to the stress caused by the main earthquake. The aftershocks served as a reminder of the ongoing seismic activity in the region and the potential for further earthquakes.\n\n**#Impact**\n\n### **Afghanistan**\n\nThe impact of the earthquake was felt across Afghanistan, with widespread destruction and loss of life reported. The provinces of Paktika, Khost, and Nangarhar were the hardest hit, with entire villages destroyed and thousands of people left homeless.\n\nThe earthquake caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. Many homes were destroyed, leaving families without shelter or access to basic necessities like food and water.\n\nThe humanitarian response to the disaster was hindered by the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, which has been ongoing since the Taliban took control of the country in August 2021. The United Nations and other international organizations faced significant challenges in accessing the affected areas and providing aid to those in need.\n\n### **Pakistan**\n\nThe earthquake was also felt in Pakistan, where it caused minor damage and panic. The Pakistani government quickly dispatched emergency teams to the affected areas, including the North Waziristan tribal region, which borders Afghanistan.\n\nThe Pakistani government also provided assistance to Afghan refugees who had fled the earthquake-affected areas. The refugees were housed in temporary camps, where they received food, shelter, and medical care.\n\n**#Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the earthquake was marked by a massive humanitarian response, led by the United Nations and other international organizations. The response included the provision of food, shelter, and medical care to those affected by the disaster.\n\nThe response was also hampered by the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, which made it difficult for aid workers to access the affected areas. The Taliban government's restrictive policies and lack of transparency also hindered the response efforts.\n\nThe earthquake highlighted the need for improved disaster preparedness and response mechanisms in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The two countries are prone to natural disasters, including earthquakes, floods, and landslides, which can have devastating consequences for the affected communities.\n\n**#Domestic response**\n\nThe domestic response to the earthquake was led by the Afghan government, which declared a state of emergency in the affected provinces. The government quickly dispatched emergency teams to the affected areas, including the provinces of Paktika and Khost.\n\nThe Afghan government also provided financial assistance to those affected by the disaster, including compensation for damaged or destroyed property. However, the government's response was criticized for being slow and inadequate, particularly in the early stages of the disaster.\n\nThe Taliban government's response to the earthquake was also criticized for being inadequate, particularly in the areas under their control. The government's restrictive policies and lack of transparency hindered the response efforts, and many aid workers reported difficulty accessing the affected areas.\n\n**#International response**\n\nThe international response to the earthquake was led by the United Nations, which quickly dispatched emergency teams to the affected areas. The UN provided financial assistance, food, shelter, and medical care to those affected by the disaster.\n\nThe international community, including governments and non-governmental organizations, provided significant assistance to the people of Afghanistan. However, the response was hampered by the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, which made it difficult for aid workers to access the affected areas.\n\n### **United States**\n\nThe United States government provided significant assistance to the people of Afghanistan, including financial aid, food, and medical care. The US also dispatched emergency teams to the affected areas, including the provinces of Paktika and Khost.\n\nThe US government's response to the earthquake was widely welcomed by the Afghan people, who appreciated the country's commitment to providing humanitarian assistance. However, the response was also criticized for being slow and inadequate, particularly in the early stages of the disaster.\n\n### **International organizations**\n\nThe international community, including the European Union, the United Kingdom, and other countries, provided significant assistance to the people of Afghanistan. The international community's response was led by the United Nations, which provided financial, food, and medical assistance to those affected by the disaster.\n\nThe international community's response was hampered by the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, which made it difficult for aid workers to access the affected areas. However, the response was widely welcomed by the Afghan people, who appreciated the international community's commitment to providing humanitarian assistance.\n\n**#See also**\n\n* List of earthquakes in Afghanistan\n* List of earthquakes in Pakistan\n* Natural disasters in Afghanistan\n* Natural disasters in Pakistan\n* Earthquake preparedness and response\n\n**#References**\n\n* United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Fury of the Gods**\n\nShazam! Fury of the Gods is an upcoming American superhero film directed by David F. Sandberg and written by Henry Gayden and Adam F. Goldberg. It is the sequel to the 2019 film Shazam! and the 12th installment in the DC Extended Universe. The film stars Zachary Levi as the titular character, with Asher Angel reprising his role as Billy Batson.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place after the events of the first movie and follows Billy Batson as he struggles to balance his life as a teenager and a superhero. However, a new villain emerges in the form of Hespera, a powerful sorceress who seeks to take over the world. Hespera is the daughter of Atlas, a Titan who was once imprisoned by the gods, and is determined to exact revenge on the world for the suffering she endured. As Billy tries to stop Hespera, he must also confront his own demons and learn to control his powers.\n\n**Cast**\n\n* Zachary Levi as Shazam (voice)\n* Asher Angel as Billy Batson\n* Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddy Freeman\n* Faithe Herman as Darla Dudley\n* Meagan Good as Roxanne Sutton\n* Adam Brody as Super Grover Cecil\n* Ross Butler as Aurelioen\n* Djimon Hounsou as Shazam's Wizard mentor\n* Helen Mirren as Hespera\n* Lucy Liu as Kalypso\n\n**Production**\n\n### Development\n\nDevelopment on the film began shortly after the release of the first Shazam! movie. Henry Gayden, the co-writer of the first film, was brought back to pen the script, with Adam F. Goldberg joining him as a co-writer. The two writers aimed to create a story that would expand on the world of Shazam! while also introducing new characters and themes.\n\n### Pre-production\n\nPre-production on the film began in 2021, with David F. Sandberg returning to direct. Sandberg aimed to create a film that would be darker and more mature than the first Shazam!, while still maintaining the tone and spirit of the original. The film's cast and crew underwent extensive training to prepare for the physical demands of the film's action sequences.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming on the film took place in 2021 and 2022 in various locations across the United States. The film's production design team aimed to create a film that would be visually stunning, with a blend of practical and CGI effects. The film's score was composed by David Sandberg's brother, Bjorn Sandberg.\n\n### Post-production\n\nPost-production on the film took place in 2022 and 2023, with the film's editors and visual effects team working to bring the film's vision to life. The film's sound design and mixing were handled by Chris Schumacher and Douglas Cameron.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's score was composed by Bjorn Sandberg, with additional music provided by Nick Urata and Chris Schumacher. The score is a mix of orchestral and electronic elements, with a focus on creating a sense of wonder and excitement. The film's soundtrack was released in 2023 and features the film's score, as well as several music tracks.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nMarketing for the film began in 2022, with Warner Bros. releasing a series of teasers and trailers to promote the film. The film's PR campaign aimed to create a sense of excitement and anticipation for the film, with a focus on highlighting the film's action sequences and visual effects. The film's cast and crew have also been involved in promoting the film, with Zachary Levi and Asher Angel appearing on talk shows and at comic-con events.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Theatrical\n\nThe film is set to be released in theaters on March 2, 2023, in the United States and Canada. The film will be released in 2D, 3D, and IMAX formats, with a runtime of approximately 2 hours and 10 minutes. The film's distribution is being handled by Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\n### Home media\n\nThe film is set to be released on home media in the summer of 2023, with a Blu-ray and DVD release planned. The film's home media release will include a series of bonus features, including behind-the-scenes footage, interviews with the cast and crew, and deleted scenes.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nThe film is expected to perform well at the box office, with some predictions suggesting it could gross over $500 million worldwide. However, the film's success will ultimately depend on a range of factors, including the quality of the film, the strength of the marketing campaign, and the current state of the global box office.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film has received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the film's action sequences, visual effects, and performances. However, some critics have noted that the film's story is somewhat predictable and that the film's tone is not as consistent as the first Shazam!.\n\n### Responses from cast and crew\n\nThe cast and crew of the film have been enthusiastic about the project, with Zachary Levi and Asher Angel expressing their excitement about the film's story and characters. David F. Sandberg has also praised the film's visual effects and action sequences, saying that they are \"some of the best in the DC Extended Universe\".\n\n### Accolades\n\nThe film has received several award nominations, including a Critics' Choice Award nomination for Best Visual Effects and a Saturn Award nomination for Best Superhero Film.\n\n**Future**\n\nThe film's success will likely pave the way for a potential sequel or spin-off, with some rumors suggesting that a Shazam! TV series is in development. However, no official announcements have been made at this time.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The film's title was officially revealed in 2022, with the tagline \"Fury of the Gods\" announced.\n* The film's cast and crew have been involved in various charity events and promotions to support the film's release.\n* The film's production design team has revealed that they aimed to create a film that would be visually stunning, with a blend of practical and CGI effects.\n\n**References**\n\n* None\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website\n* Shazam!

The system gradually intensified into a tropical depression, and then a tropical storm, as it moved westward towards the Mascarene Islands. The storm continued to strengthen, and on February 9, it reached its first peak intensity as a Category 3 cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.\n\nFreddy maintained its Category 3 status for several days, with sustained winds of up to 120 km/h (75 mph) and heavy rainfall. The storm then began to weaken, but it continued to produce heavy rainfall and strong winds as it moved southward towards Madagascar.\n\n**Records**\n\nCyclone Freddy holds several records for its prolonged duration and intensity.

Born in the wild, Joe was captured and trained for a life in show business, captivating audiences with his intelligence, agility, and charm. This article explores Joe Martin's background, biography, and notable events throughout his life, shedding light on his remarkable story.\n\n**Background**\n-------------\n\nLittle is known about Joe Martin's early life before being captured and brought into captivity. It is believed that he was native to the jungles of Southeast Asia, where orangutans are indigenous. The exact circumstances of his capture are unknown, but it is likely that he was sold to a collector or trainer.\n\n**Biography**\n-------------\n\n### Transoceanic shipment and first owners\n\nJoe Martin's journey began when he was shipped across the ocean to the United States, where he was purchased by his first owners. The exact date and route of his transoceanic shipment are unknown, but it is believed to have taken place in the early 20th century. Initially, Joe was kept in a private collection, where he was trained and socialized by his owners. During this time, he learned to perform various tasks, including tricks and stunts.\n\n### 1915–1917: Breakout film and early work\n\nJoe Martin's career in show business began in the mid-1910s, when he started appearing in short films. His first known film appearance was in 1915, in a film titled \"The Orang-Utan.\" This early work helped establish Joe as a talented and charismatic performer, showcasing his intelligence, agility, and charm. Throughout the late 1910s, Joe continued to appear in films, including \"The Orang-Utan in the Jungle\" and \"Joe the Orang-Utan.\"\n\n### 1918: Influenza epidemic, and night-watchman incident\n\nIn 1918, the world was gripped by the influenza epidemic, which had a significant impact on the entertainment industry. Many performers, including Joe Martin, were forced to cancel their tours and performances due to the outbreak. During this time, Joe's owners were also affected, and he was forced to live with a night-watchman who was tasked with caring for him. The incident highlights the challenges faced by performers and their care providers during this period.\n\n### 1919: Escapes and Al Santell incident\n\nIn 1919, Joe Martin escaped from his enclosure on several occasions, causing concern among his owners and the public. The escapes were likely due to a combination of factors, including boredom and frustration. One notable incident involved Al Santell, a film director who was working with Joe at the time. Santell reported that Joe had become increasingly aggressive and unpredictable, leading to a series of confrontations between the two.\n\n### 1920: Tarzan incident\n\nIn 1920, Joe Martin appeared in a film titled \"Tarzan,\" which was a major success. The film showcased Joe's agility and strength, as he performed a series of impressive stunts and tricks. The incident highlights Joe's ability to adapt to different roles and perform under pressure.\n\n### 1921: Continuing in show business, Ethel Stecker incident\n\nIn 1921, Joe Martin continued to work in the entertainment industry, appearing in various films and shows. During this time, he worked with Ethel Stecker, a well-known actress who was instrumental in promoting Joe's career. However, their collaboration was not without incident, as Stecker reported that Joe had become increasingly difficult to work with, often refusing to perform and causing delays on set.\n\n### 1922–1923: Behavioral issues, death of Curley Stecker\n\nIn 1922-1923, Joe Martin's behavior became increasingly erratic, causing concern among his owners and the public. During this time, Curley Stecker, Ethel's husband, passed away, and Joe was reportedly devastated by the loss. The incident highlights the emotional toll of caring for a highly intelligent and sensitive animal like an orangutan.\n\n### 1923–1927: Barnes Circus and Barnes City Zoo\n\nIn 1923, Joe Martin was sold to the Barnes Circus, where he continued to perform and entertain audiences. During this time, he was also housed at the Barnes City Zoo, where he lived with other animals. The incident highlights the challenges faced by performers and their care providers in balancing entertainment and animal welfare.\n\n### 1928–1931: Last reports\n\nIn 1928-1931, Joe Martin's career slowed down, and he was no longer actively performing. The exact circumstances of his retirement are unknown, but it is believed that he lived out his remaining years at the Barnes City Zoo. The last reported sighting of Joe was in 1931, when he was allegedly still living at the zoo.\n\n**Filmography**\n----------------\n\n* The Orang-Utan (1915)\n* The Orang-Utan in the Jungle (1916)\n* Joe the Orang-Utan (1917)\n* Tarzan (1920)\n\n**Gallery**\n---------\n\n[Insert images of Joe Martin in his various roles and settings]\n\n**See also**\n------------\n\n* Orangutan\n* Performing animals\n* Entertainment industry\n* Animal training and welfare\n\n**Notes**\n---------\n\nJoe Martin's story highlights the complexities and challenges faced by performers and their care providers in the early 20th century.

Forming in the western Pacific Ocean, the storm intensified into a category 5-equivalent super typhoon, causing widespread damage and disruption to numerous countries.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor was one of the most intense tropical cyclones of the 2022 Pacific typhoon season. The storm was first identified as a tropical disturbance on September 2, 2022, in the western Pacific Ocean. As it moved northwestward, Hinnamnor rapidly intensified, reaching super typhoon strength on September 6. The storm brought severe weather conditions to several countries, including Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, resulting in significant damage and loss of life.\n\n**Meteorological history**\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor formed on September 2, 2022, as a tropical disturbance in the western Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) southeast of the Mariana Islands. The disturbance gradually organized, with convection increasing and a low-level circulation center developing. As the system moved northwestward, it encountered favorable atmospheric conditions, including low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures.\n\nOn September 4, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert. As the storm continued to intensify, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm on September 5, naming it Hinnamnor. The storm's intensification accelerated, and by September 6, Hinnamnor had reached super typhoon strength, making landfall in southern Japan.\n\n**Preparations**\n\n### Japan\n\nAs Typhoon Hinnamnor approached Japan, the government issued warnings and advisories to the public. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a typhoon warning for the southern island of Kyushu, with winds of up to 240 kilometers per hour (150 miles per hour) expected. The storm made landfall on September 6, causing widespread damage and power outages.\n\nEvacuation orders were issued for several municipalities, with over 10,000 people relocated to emergency shelters. The Japanese military was deployed to assist in evacuation efforts and to provide support to affected areas. The government also set up a task force to coordinate relief efforts and provide aid to those in need.\n\n### South Korea\n\nAs Typhoon Hinnamnor approached South Korea, the government issued warnings and advisories to the public. The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) issued a typhoon warning for the southern provinces of Jeju and Jeollanam-do, with winds of up to 180 kilometers per hour (110 miles per hour) expected. The storm made landfall on September 8, causing widespread damage and power outages.\n\nEvacuation orders were issued for several municipalities, with over 5,000 people relocated to emergency shelters. The South Korean military was deployed to assist in evacuation efforts and to provide support to affected areas. The government also set up a task force to coordinate relief efforts and provide aid to those in need.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nIn the Philippines, the government issued warnings and advisories to the public as Typhoon Hinnamnor approached. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issued a tropical cyclone warning for the eastern provinces of Eastern Samar and Leyte, with winds of up to 150 kilometers per hour (93 miles per hour) expected. The storm brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to the region, causing damage and disruption to several provinces.\n\n**Impact**\n\n### Japan\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor brought severe weather conditions to Japan, causing widespread damage and disruption to several prefectures. The storm made landfall on September 6, with winds of up to 240 kilometers per hour (150 miles per hour) and heavy rainfall. The storm surge caused flooding in several coastal areas, with waves reaching as high as 3 meters (10 feet) in some areas.\n\nThe storm caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. Over 10,000 households were left without power, and several thousand people were displaced. The storm also caused significant damage to agriculture, with many crops destroyed or damaged.\n\n### South Korea\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor brought severe weather conditions to South Korea, causing widespread damage and disruption to several provinces. The storm made landfall on September 8, with winds of up to 180 kilometers per hour (110 miles per hour) and heavy rainfall. The storm surge caused flooding in several coastal areas, with waves reaching as high as 2 meters (6.6 feet) in some areas.\n\nThe storm caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. Over 5,000 households were left without power, and several thousand people were displaced. The storm also caused significant damage to agriculture, with many crops destroyed or damaged.\n\n### Elsewhere\n\nIn the Philippines, Typhoon Hinnamnor brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to several provinces, causing damage and disruption to several areas. The storm caused significant damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges, and several thousand people were displaced.\n\n**Retirement**\n\nTyphoon Hinnamnor was not retired by the Japan Meteorological Agency or the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The storm's name was contributed by Mozambique, and it will be used again in the future if another storm forms that meets the naming criteria.\n\n**See also**\n\n* List of typhoons in Japan\n* List of typhoons in South Korea\n* List of typhoons in the Philippines\n* Tropical cyclones in the western Pacific Ocean\n* Super typhoon\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The information in this article is based on publicly available data and sources.\n* The article is intended for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for official warnings and advisories issued by governments and weather agencies.\n\n**References**\n\n* Japan Meteorological Agency (2022).

The elections saw a high level of voter turnout and contentious campaigns, with many close and disputed races.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 elections were the first midterm elections to be held since the 2020 United States presidential election, which saw the election of Joe Biden as President of the United States. The elections took place during a period of significant national and global instability, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, and the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n**Campaign**\n\nThe 2022 elections saw a highly competitive and contentious campaign season, with many candidates and parties vying for control of Congress and state governments. The campaign was marked by a significant increase in campaign spending, particularly among Republican candidates.\n\n### **Primaries**\n\nThe primary elections for the 2022 elections took place from March to August 2022, with many candidates competing for the opportunity to appear on the general election ballot. The primaries saw a number of close and contentious races, particularly among Republican candidates.\n\n### **Issues**\n\nThe 2022 elections saw a range of issues come to the forefront, including the economy, abortion, crime and gun violence, democracy, education, climate change, immigration, student loan forgiveness, the presidency of Joe Biden, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n#### **Economy**\n\nThe economy was a major issue in the 2022 elections, with many candidates vying to present themselves as the best solution to the country's economic problems. The Republicans focused on issues such as inflation, taxes, and government spending, while the Democrats emphasized the need for investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare.\n\n#### **Abortion**\n\nThe issue of abortion was a highly contentious issue in the 2022 elections, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Many Republican candidates campaigned on the need to restrict access to abortion, while many Democratic candidates campaigned on the need to protect access to reproductive healthcare.\n\n#### **Crime and gun violence**\n\nCrime and gun violence were major issues in the 2022 elections, particularly in the wake of a number of high-profile mass shootings. Many Republican candidates campaigned on the need to increase funding for law enforcement and to pass stricter gun control laws, while many Democratic candidates campaigned on the need to address the root causes of crime and to promote community-based solutions.\n\n#### **Democracy**\n\nThe issue of democracy was a major concern in the 2022 elections, particularly in the wake of the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

The company has undergone significant transformations over the years, evolving from an independent entity to a major player in the industry. This article provides an in-depth look at the company's history, products, and market presence, as well as its notable milestones and controversies.\n\nHistory\n\n### Independent (1919-1967)\n\nEdwards Vacuum was founded in 1919 by John T. Edwards in the United Kingdom. Initially, the company focused on manufacturing vacuum pumps for industrial applications. During the 1920s and 1930s, Edwards Vacuum expanded its product line to include vacuum gauges, valves, and other accessories. The company's early success was driven by its innovative products and strong sales network. By the mid-20th century, Edwards Vacuum had established itself as a leading manufacturer of vacuum equipment in the UK.\n\n### BOC (1968-2006)\n\nIn 1968, Edwards Vacuum was acquired by the British Oxygen Company (BOC), a leading industrial gases and engineering company. Under BOC's ownership, Edwards Vacuum expanded its operations globally, establishing new manufacturing facilities in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The company continued to innovate, introducing new products and technologies, including high-vacuum pumps and cryopumps. During the 1980s and 1990s, Edwards Vacuum faced increased competition from Asian manufacturers, but its strong brand reputation and innovative products helped it maintain its market position.\n\n### Linde and CCMP Capital (2006-2014)\n\nIn 2006, BOC was acquired by Linde AG, a German industrial gases company. As part of the acquisition, Edwards Vacuum became a subsidiary of Linde AG. In 2011, CCMP Capital, a US-based private equity firm, acquired a significant stake in Edwards Vacuum. During this period, the company continued to expand its product line, introducing new technologies such as scroll vacuum pumps and vacuum systems for the semiconductor industry.\n\n### Atlas Copco (2014-present)\n\nIn 2014, Atlas Copco, a Swedish industrial company, acquired Edwards Vacuum from Linde AG and CCMP Capital. Under Atlas Copco's ownership, Edwards Vacuum has continued to innovate, introducing new products and technologies, including vacuum systems for the automotive and aerospace industries. The company has also expanded its presence in emerging markets, including China and India.\n\nProducts and markets\n\n### 1950-60s\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Edwards Vacuum introduced its first range of vacuum pumps, including the iconic E2 and E4 models. These pumps were designed for industrial applications, such as drying and degassing, and quickly became popular due to their reliability and performance. The company also introduced its first vacuum gauges, which were used to measure pressure levels in vacuum systems.\n\n### 1970s\n\nIn the 1970s, Edwards Vacuum expanded its product line to include vacuum systems for the semiconductor industry. The company introduced its first range of high-vacuum pumps, including the E6 and E8 models, which were designed for use in semiconductor manufacturing. This expansion into the semiconductor market marked a significant turning point for Edwards Vacuum, as it established the company as a leader in the industry.\n\n### 1980s\n\nDuring the 1980s, Edwards Vacuum faced increased competition from Asian manufacturers, including companies from Japan and South Korea. The company responded by investing in research and development, introducing new products and technologies, including cryopumps and high-speed vacuum pumps. Edwards Vacuum also expanded its global presence, establishing new manufacturing facilities in the United States and Europe.\n\n### 1990s\n\nIn the 1990s, Edwards Vacuum continued to innovate, introducing new products and technologies, including scroll vacuum pumps and vacuum systems for the automotive industry. The company also expanded its presence in emerging markets, including China and India. During this period, Edwards Vacuum also faced challenges, including the Asian financial crisis and increased competition from new entrants to the market.\n\n### Recent\n\nIn recent years, Edwards Vacuum has continued to expand its product line, introducing new technologies, including vacuum systems for the aerospace industry and advanced vacuum gauges. The company has also invested in research and development, focusing on areas such as energy efficiency and sustainability. Edwards Vacuum has also expanded its global presence, establishing new manufacturing facilities and increasing its presence in emerging markets.\n\nEdwards Lecture Series\n\nThe Edwards Lecture Series is a series of lectures and seminars hosted by Edwards Vacuum, focusing on topics related to vacuum technology and its applications. The series was established in the 1990s and has featured speakers from industry, academia, and research institutions. The lectures cover a range of topics, including vacuum systems for the semiconductor industry, cryogenics, and vacuum-related technologies for the automotive and aerospace industries.\n\nControversies\n\n### Domain registration\n\nIn 2011, Edwards Vacuum was involved in a controversy surrounding the registration of the edwardsvacuum.com domain name. The company had previously registered the domain name, but it was subsequently taken over by a third-party company, which was using it to redirect traffic to a competing website. Edwards Vacuum was forced to take action to reclaim the domain name and protect its brand.\n\n### Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc\n\nIn 2013, Edwards Vacuum was involved in a controversy surrounding the sale of a subsidiary company, Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc. The company had been acquired by Edwards Vacuum in the 1990s and had been operating as a subsidiary. However, the subsidiary was subsequently sold to a new owner, who was alleged to have ties to the original founder of the company. Edwards Vacuum was criticized for the sale, which was seen as a conflict of interest.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Official website of Edwards Vacuum\n* Atlas Copco website\n* Linde AG website\n* CCMP Capital website\n* Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc website", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Edwards_Vacuum\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##Independent (1919-1967)\n##BOC (1968-2006)\n##Linde and CCMP Capital (2006-2014)\n##Atlas Copco (2014-present)\n#Products and markets\n##1950-60s\n##1970s\n##1980s\n##1990s\n##Recent\n#Edwards Lecture Series\n#Controversies\n##Domain registration\n##Hoffman Instrumentation Supply Inc\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Lesley Whittle, a 17-year-old schoolgirl, was abducted from her home in Shifnal, Shropshire, and held captive for several weeks before being brutally murdered. The case was widely reported in the media and remains one of the most infamous crimes in British history.\n\n**Background**\n\n### **Lesley Whittle**\n\nLesley Whittle was born on June 13, 1957, in Shifnal, Shropshire. She was the eldest of three children and lived with her parents and two siblings in a semi-detached house on the outskirts of Shifnal. Lesley was a bright and cheerful student who enjoyed sports and music. She was also known for her kind and gentle nature, which made her a favorite among her friends and family.\n\n### **Inheritance**\n\nIn 1974, Lesley's grandfather, a wealthy businessman, passed away, leaving a significant inheritance to Lesley and her family. The inheritance was substantial, with estimates suggesting that Lesley's share was worth around £100,000 (approximately £1.5 million in today's currency). The inheritance was a significant factor in the motivation behind Lesley's kidnapping.\n\n**Kidnapping**\n\n### **Planning**\n\nThe kidnapping of Lesley Whittle was meticulously planned by a group of individuals who were determined to extort money from her family. The group, which included a former prison inmate and a convicted thief, had been monitoring Lesley's family for several months, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.\n\n### **Enactment**\n\nOn February 12, 1975, Lesley was abducted from her home while she was out walking the family dog. The kidnappers, who were armed and disguised, took Lesley to a nearby location, where they tied her up and demanded a ransom from her family.\n\n### **Ransom discovery**\n\nLesley's family received a ransom demand from the kidnappers, who claimed that they would harm Lesley if their demands were not met. The ransom demand was substantial, with the kidnappers demanding £50,000 (approximately £750,000 in today's currency).\n\n**Investigation**\n\n### **Press leak**\n\nThe investigation into Lesley's kidnapping was marred by a press leak, which revealed details of the ransom demand and the police's efforts to track down the kidnappers.

The incident has become one of the most enduring and intriguing UFO stories of the 20th century, with numerous conspiracy theories and hoaxes surrounding the events.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Roswell incident began on July 2, 1947, when a strange object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. The incident was initially reported as a military aircraft accident, but it soon developed into a controversy over the nature of the object and the government's response to it.\n\n**1947 Military Balloon Crash**\n\nOn July 2, 1947, a rancher named Mac Brazel discovered a large amount of debris on his property, including metal fragments, plastic materials, and other unusual items. Brazel reported the discovery to the local sheriff, who in turn notified the military authorities at Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF). The military initially reported that they had recovered a \"flying disc\" from the ranch, but later claimed that it was a high-altitude weather balloon that had been launched from a nearby base.\n\n**UFO Conspiracy Theories (1947-1978)**\n\nIn the years following the incident, numerous UFO conspiracy theories emerged, suggesting that the government was covering up the true nature of the object and its origins. Some of these theories included:\n\n### **Aztec Crashed Saucer Hoax**\n\nIn 1949, a man named Silas M. Newton claimed to have seen a crashed saucer in Illinois, which he believed was of extraterrestrial origin. Newton's story was widely publicized, but it was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n### **Hangar 18**\n\nHangar 18 was a supposedly secret facility at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, where the government allegedly stored and studied the recovered alien spacecraft and bodies. The existence of Hangar 18 was never confirmed, and it remains a topic of speculation and debate.\n\n**Roswell Conspiracy Theories (1978-1994)**\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new wave of UFO conspiracy theories emerged, focusing on the Roswell incident. Some of these theories included:\n\n### **The Roswell Incident**\n\nIn 1978, a book titled \"The Roswell Incident\" was published, which claimed that the government had recovered a crashed alien spacecraft and covered up the evidence. The book was widely publicized and helped to fuel the conspiracy theories surrounding the incident.\n\n### **Majestic 12 Hoax**\n\nIn the 1980s, a series of documents emerged, allegedly leaked from the US government, which described a secret program called Majestic 12, tasked with investigating and covering up UFO sightings. However, the documents were later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n### **Role of Glenn Dennis**\n\nGlenn Dennis was a mortician who claimed to have been involved in the recovery of alien bodies from the Roswell incident. Dennis's story was widely publicized, but it was later disputed by many experts.\n\n### **Competing Accounts and Schism**\n\nAs the years went by, competing accounts of the Roswell incident emerged, with some witnesses claiming that the object that crashed was a surveillance balloon, while others claimed that it was a top-secret military project. The schism between these competing accounts has contributed to the ongoing controversy and debate surrounding the incident.\n\n#### **UFO Crash at Roswell**\n\nOne account, presented by Stanton Friedman, a physicist and UFO researcher, suggests that the object that crashed was a reconnaissance balloon, code-named \"Project Mogul\".\n\n#### **Crash at Corona**\n\nAnother account, presented by Thomas Carey and Donald Schmitt, suggests that the object that crashed was a top-secret military project, code-named \"Crash at Corona\".\n\n#### **The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell**\n\nIn 1994, a book titled \"The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\" was published, which claimed to reveal the truth about the incident. However, the book was widely criticized for its lack of evidence and credibility.\n\n**Air Force Response**\n\nIn 1994, the US Air Force released a report, titled \"The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert\", which concluded that the object that crashed was a high-altitude weather balloon. The report was widely criticized by UFO enthusiasts, who claimed that it was a cover-up.\n\n**Later Theories and Hoaxes (1994-Present)**\n\nIn the years following the Air Force's report, numerous new theories and hoaxes emerged, including:\n\n### **Alien Autopsy**\n\nIn 1995, a film titled \"Alien Autopsy\" was released, which claimed to show footage of an alien autopsy from the Roswell incident. However, the film was later revealed to be a hoax.\n\n### **The Day After Roswell**\n\nIn 1998, a book titled \"The Day After Roswell\" was published, which claimed to reveal the truth about the incident. However, the book was widely criticized for its lack of evidence and credibility.\n\n### **Related Debunked or Fringe Theories**\n\nSeveral other theories and hoaxes have emerged over the years, including claims of alien bodies, reverse-engineered technology, and government conspiracies. However, these claims have been widely debunked by experts and evidence.\n\n**Explanations**\n\nSeveral explanations have been proposed to explain the Roswell incident, including:\n\n### **Project Mogul**\n\nProject Mogul was a top-secret military project that involved launching high-altitude balloons to detect Soviet nuclear tests. Some researchers have suggested that the object that crashed was a reconnaissance balloon from this project.\n\n### **Anthropomorphic Dummies**\n\nAnthropomorphic dummies were used in some military experiments, including those related to weather and wind resistance. Some researchers have suggested that the object that crashed was an anthropomorphic dummy.\n\n### **Roswell as Modern Myth and Folklore**\n\nRoswell has become a modern myth and folklore, with numerous stories, legends, and conspiracy theories surrounding the incident. The incident has inspired numerous books, films, and documentaries, and has become a cultural phenomenon.\n\n**Cultural Impact**\n\nThe Roswell incident has had a significant cultural impact, inspiring numerous books, films, and documentaries. The incident has also spawned a tourism industry, with numerous visitors traveling to Roswell to see the alleged UFO crash site.\n\n### **Tourism and Commercialization**\n\nRoswell has become a popular tourist destination, with numerous shops, restaurants, and museums dedicated to the incident. The town has also commercialized the incident, with numerous souvenir shops selling UFO-themed merchandise.\n\n### **Popular Fiction**\n\nThe Roswell incident has inspired numerous works of popular fiction, including books, films, and television shows. The incident has also been referenced in numerous other works of fiction, including music and art.\n\n### **Statements by US Presidents**\n\nSeveral US Presidents have made statements about the Roswell incident, including Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. However, these statements have been widely criticized as ambiguous and lacking in substance.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* UFO conspiracy theories\n* Roswell, New Mexico\n* Project Mogul\n* Anthropomorphic dummies\n* Majestic 12\n* Hangar 18\n\n**References**\n\n* \"The Roswell Incident\" by Charles Berlitz (1978)\n* \"The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\" by Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt (1994)\n* \"The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert\" by the US Air Force (1994)\n* \"Alien Autopsy\" by Fox Television (1995)\n* \"The Day After Roswell\" by Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt (1998)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Roswell_incident\" following this outline:\n\n#1947 military balloon crash\n#UFO conspiracy theories (1947–1978)\n##Aztec crashed saucer hoax\n##Hangar 18\n#Roswell conspiracy theories (1978–1994)\n##The Roswell Incident\n##Majestic 12 hoax\n##Role of Glenn Dennis\n##Competing accounts and schism\n###UFO Crash at Roswell\n###Crash at Corona\n###The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\n#Air Force response\n#Later theories and hoaxes (1994–present)\n##Alien Autopsy\n##The Day After Roswell\n##Related debunked or fringe theories\n#Explanations\n##Project Mogul\n##Anthropomorphic dummies\n##Roswell as modern myth and folklore\n#Cultural impact\n##Tourism and commercialization\n##Popular fiction\n##Statements by US Presidents\n#See also\n#References\n##Sources\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This approach has been influential in the development of constructive mathematics, which emphasizes the importance of constructive proofs and the rejection of non-constructive principles.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIn classical mathematics, set theory is often developed using Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, which include the axiom of choice and the axiom of foundation. However, these axioms have been criticized for being non-constructive, meaning that they do not provide a clear method for constructing mathematical objects. Constructive set theory, on the other hand, is developed using intuitionistic logic, which rejects the law of excluded middle and the axiom of choice.\n\n### Preliminary on the use of intuitionistic logic\n\nIntuitionistic logic is a formal system that rejects the law of excluded middle, which states that a statement is either true or false. In intuitionistic logic, a statement can be considered true if it can be proven, but it is not considered false until a proof of its falsehood is given. This approach has been influential in the development of constructive mathematics, which emphasizes the importance of constructive proofs and the rejection of non-constructive principles.\n\n### Imposed restrictions on a set theory\n\nConstructive set theory imposes certain restrictions on the development of a set theory. For example, it rejects the axiom of choice and the axiom of foundation, which are considered non-constructive principles. It also rejects the use of impredicative definitions, which are definitions that refer to sets that are not explicitly defined.\n\n### Metalogic\n\nMetalogic is the study of the logical properties of a formal system. In constructive set theory, metalogic is used to study the logical properties of the set theory itself. This includes the study of the consistency and completeness of the set theory, as well as the study of the formal semantics of the set theory.\n\n### Anti-classical principles\n\nAnti-classical principles are principles that are rejected in constructive set theory. These include the law of excluded middle, the axiom of choice, and the axiom of foundation. These principles are considered non-constructive because they do not provide a clear method for constructing mathematical objects.\n\n**History and overview**\n\nConstructive set theory has a long history, dating back to the early 20th century. One of the earliest contributors to the development of constructive set theory was the mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer, who developed the intuitionistic philosophy of mathematics. Brouwer's philosophy emphasized the importance of constructive proofs and the rejection of non-constructive principles.\n\n### Models\n\nConstructive set theory has been developed using various models, including the BHK interpretation and the Kripke semantics. The BHK interpretation is a model of constructive logic that is based on the idea that a statement is true if it can be proven. The Kripke semantics is a model of constructive logic that is based on the idea that a statement is true if it is true in all possible worlds.\n\n**Notation**\n\nIn constructive set theory, notation is used to represent the elements of the set theory. This includes the use of variables, predicates, and quantifiers.\n\n### Language\n\nThe language of constructive set theory is based on a formal system that includes the use of propositional and predicate logic. This includes the use of propositional connectives such as and, or, and not, as well as predicate connectives such as for all and there exists.\n\n### Variables\n\nVariables are used in constructive set theory to represent elements of the set theory. This includes the use of individual variables, such as x and y, as well as set variables, such as A and B.\n\n### Classes\n\nClasses are used in constructive set theory to represent sets of elements. This includes the use of class variables, such as A and B, as well as predicates, such as P(x) and Q(x).\n\n### Extensional equivalence\n\nExtensional equivalence is a notion of equality in constructive set theory that is based on the idea that two sets are equal if they have the same elements.\n\n**Subtheories of ZF**\n\nConstructive set theory has been developed using various subtheories of ZF, including equality, merging sets, set existence, BCST, and ECST.\n\n## Equality\n\nEquality is a notion of sameness in constructive set theory.

The equipment used in rock climbing has evolved significantly over the years, with advances in materials, design, and manufacturing resulting in safer and more efficient gear.\n\n# Use and certification\n\n## Type of climbing\n\nThe type of climbing being performed dictates the specific equipment used. Climbers employ different equipment for top-rope climbing, lead climbing, bouldering, and sport climbing. Each type of climbing has its unique requirements, and climbers must be aware of the specific gear necessary for their chosen discipline.\n\n## Certification\n\nCertification is a crucial aspect of rock-climbing equipment. Manufacturers and distributors must adhere to strict standards and regulations to ensure the quality and safety of their products. Certification bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) provide guidelines for the testing and evaluation of climbing equipment. Climbers should always purchase gear from certified manufacturers and inspect their equipment regularly for signs of wear or damage.\n\n# Ropes and slings\n\n## Ropes\n\nRopes are the primary safety line in rock climbing, providing the necessary protection against falls. Climbing ropes are typically made from a combination of nylon and polyester materials, with a diameter ranging from 10-11mm. The rope's thickness and material determine its strength, durability, and resistance to abrasion. Climbers should choose a rope that suits their climbing style and the type of climbing being performed.\n\n## Slings\n\nSlings are lengths of webbing or cord that can be used for a variety of purposes, including creating anchor points, building anchors, and connecting ropes to carabiners. Slings are typically made from nylon or polyester materials and come in different lengths and diameters. When selecting a sling, climbers should consider the intended use, the material, and the durability of the sling.\n\n## Cords\n\nCords, also known as climbing cords, are used for creating temporary anchors or connecting ropes to anchors. Cords are typically made from nylon or polyester materials and have a smaller diameter than slings. Cords are often used in conjunction with other equipment, such as carabiners and quickdraws, to create a secure anchor system.\n\n# Rope connectors\n\n## Carabiners\n\nCarabiners, also known as carabiner clips, are metal connectors used to attach ropes to anchors, harnesses, or other equipment. Carabiners are available in different shapes, sizes, and materials, with the most common being the D-shaped carabiner. When selecting a carabiner, climbers should consider the weight capacity, strength, and durability of the carabiner.\n\n## Harnesses\n\nHarnesses are the climbing equipment worn by climbers to attach themselves to the rope. Harnesses typically consist of a waist belt, leg loops, and a chest plate. Climbers should choose a harness that fits comfortably, provides adequate support, and meets the necessary safety standards.\n\n## Lanyards\n\nLanyards, also known as climbing ropes or safety lines, are cables or wires used to connect a climber to a fixed anchor or other secure point. Lanyards are typically made from nylon or polyester materials and come in different lengths and diameters. Lanyards are often used in conjunction with carabiners and quickdraws to create a secure anchor system.\n\n### Personal anchor systems\n\nPersonal anchor systems, or PAS, are a type of anchor system that allows climbers to create a secure anchor using their own body weight. PAS involves attaching a carabiner or quickdraw to a harness or leg loop and then clipping the rope to the carabiner. This system provides a secure anchor point and allows climbers to climb without the need for external anchors.\n\n## Quickdraws\n\nQuickdraws, also known as climbing quickdraws or QDs, are devices used to connect the rope to anchors. Quickdraws consist of a carabiner attached to a length of webbing or cord, which is then clipped to an anchor point. Quickdraws are designed to provide a secure connection between the rope and the anchor, allowing climbers to climb efficiently and safely.\n\n# Rope devices\n\n## Ascenders\n\nAscenders, also known as climbing ascenders or ascending devices, are used to climb up a rope with the assistance of a rope device. Ascenders are typically used in rescue situations or when climbing in difficult terrain. Ascenders work by moving the rope up the device as the user pulls the rope through the device.\n\n## Belay devices\n\nBelay devices, also known as belay plates or belay attachments, are used to control the rope during belaying. Belay devices work by locking the rope in place, preventing the rope from running out or getting tangled. Belay devices come in different types, including manual and assisted braking devices.\n\n## Descenders\n\nDescenders, also known as rappel devices or descending devices, are used to control the rope during descending. Descenders work by locking the rope in place, preventing the rope from running out or getting tangled. Descenders come in different types, including manual and assisted braking devices.\n\n## Self-locking devices\n\nSelf-locking devices, also known as self-locking ascenders or self-locking descenders, are used to climb up or down a rope with the assistance of a rope device. Self-locking devices work by automatically locking the rope in place as the user pulls the rope through the device.\n\n# Protection devices\n\n## Temporary\n\nTemporary protection devices are used to create a secure anchor point in the rock face. These devices include:\n\n### Active\n\nActive protection devices, such as cams and nuts, are used to create a secure anchor point in the rock face. These devices work by expanding or contracting to fit into cracks and crevices in the rock.\n\n### Passive\n\nPassive protection devices, such as hexes and wedges, are used to create a secure anchor point in the rock face. These devices work by being wedged into cracks and crevices in the rock.\n\n## Fixed\n\nFixed protection devices are used to create a secure anchor point in the rock face. These devices include bolts and anchors that are permanently installed in the rock face.\n\n# Aid equipment\n\nAid equipment, also known as aid climbing equipment, is used to climb up a rock face using artificial aid, such as ladders, rungs, and pitons. Aid equipment is typically used in difficult terrain or when climbing in vertical or overhanging rock faces.\n\n# Clothing equipment\n\nClothing equipment, also known as climbing clothing, is designed to provide comfort, protection, and support while climbing. Climbing clothing includes:\n\n* Climbing shoes\n* Harnesses\n* Jackets and pants\n* Hats and gloves\n* Belts and buckles\n\n# Miscellaneous equipment\n\nMiscellaneous equipment, also known as climbing accessories, is designed to provide a variety of functions, including:\n\n* Climbing chalk\n* Climbing tape\n* Climbing gloves\n* Climbing hats\n* Climbing bags and backpacks\n\n# Training equipment\n\nTraining equipment, also known as climbing training gear, is designed to help climbers improve their skills and techniques.

The protest began in February 2023 and gained momentum across the country, with wrestlers, coaches, and officials calling for Singh's resignation and reforms in the Indian wrestling community.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Indian wrestling community has faced numerous allegations of harassment and molestation in the past, with several wrestlers and coaches coming forward with their experiences. The WFI, which is responsible for governing wrestling in India, has been accused of turning a blind eye to these allegations and failing to address the issue.\n\nIn 2022, a group of wrestlers, including Olympic medalists Sakshi Mallik and Bajrang Punia, had filed a complaint with the Delhi Police against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, alleging that he had molested them. However, the police had not taken any action, and the case remained pending.\n\n**Initial Investigation**\n\nIn response to the allegations, the Delhi Police had launched an investigation into the matter. However, the investigation was slow to progress, and the police had not made any arrests or taken any concrete action against Singh.\n\n**Protest Overview**\n\nThe protest began on February 23, 2023, when a group of wrestlers, including Sakshi Mallik and Bajrang Punia, gathered at the Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to demand action against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh. The protest was peaceful, but it gained momentum over the next few days, with more and more wrestlers and coaches joining in.\n\n### FIR Registration and Supreme Court Intervention\n\nOn February 25, 2023, the Delhi Police had registered an FIR against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, based on the complaint filed by the wrestlers.

The minister had assured the wrestlers that the government would take swift action against Singh.\n\nOn March 2, 2023, the Delhi Police had filed a chargesheet against Singh, based on the evidence collected during the investigation.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe protest had a significant impact on the Indian wrestling community, with many wrestlers and coaches coming forward to support the movement. The WFI had been forced to take action against Singh, and the Delhi Police had taken concrete steps to investigate the allegations.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Domestic\n\n**Criticism**\n\nThe protest had been widely criticized by some sections of the media and society, who had accused the wrestlers of being hypocritical and opportunistic. Some had argued that the allegations against Singh were politically motivated and that the protest was being used to target the WFI and the government.\n\n### International\n\n**United World Wrestling**\n\nThe United World Wrestling (UWW) had issued a statement condemning the allegations against Singh and expressing support for the Indian wrestling community. The UWW had also offered to provide assistance to the Indian government in investigating the allegations.\n\n**International Olympic Committee**\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) had also issued a statement expressing concern about the allegations and supporting the Indian wrestling community. The IOC had also offered to provide assistance to the Indian government in investigating the allegations.\n\n**Parliamentarians**\n\nSeveral parliamentarians had expressed support for the protest and had demanded action against Singh. Some had also accused the government of being slow to respond to the situation and of not taking adequate action against Singh.\n\n**Media Coverage**\n\nThe protest had received extensive media coverage, with many news outlets and social media platforms carrying stories and updates on the situation. The media had played a significant role in raising awareness about the allegations and the protest, and had helped to mobilize public support for the movement.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe protest had a significant impact on the Indian wrestling community, with many wrestlers and coaches coming forward to support the movement.

It is a common and usually harmless condition, but it can be frightening for parents and caregivers.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nFebrile seizures are characterized by a sudden onset of vigorous shaking or convulsions, which can be accompanied by a high-pitched cry, loss of consciousness, and stiffness of the body. The seizure typically lasts for a few minutes, and the child may appear to be in a daze or have difficulty breathing after the seizure has stopped.\n\nTypes\n\nThere are two main types of febrile seizures: simple and complex.\n\n### Simple Febrile Seizure\n\nA simple febrile seizure is the most common type of febrile seizure. It is typically characterized by a seizure that lasts for less than 15 minutes, and the child is fully recovered after the seizure has stopped. Simple febrile seizures are often accompanied by a high body temperature, and the child may appear to be in a normal state before and after the seizure.\n\n### Complex Febrile Seizure\n\nA complex febrile seizure is a more severe type of febrile seizure. It is characterized by a seizure that lasts for more than 15 minutes, or by a seizure that recurs within 24 hours. Complex febrile seizures are often accompanied by a high body temperature, and the child may appear to be in a state of confusion or disorientation after the seizure has stopped.\n\nCauses\n\nThe exact cause of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to the rapid increase in body temperature that occurs during a fever. This can cause an imbalance in the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, leading to a seizure.\n\nThe risk of febrile seizures is increased in children who have a family history of febrile seizures, or who have other underlying medical conditions such as epilepsy or encephalitis. Children who are malnourished or have a weakened immune system may also be at increased risk of febrile seizures.\n\nMechanism\n\nThe mechanism of febrile seizures is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a complex interplay between the body's temperature regulation system and the brain's seizure threshold.\n\nWhen a child has a fever, the body's temperature regulation system is activated, causing the body temperature to rise. This can cause an imbalance in the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, such as neurotransmitters and hormones, which can trigger a seizure.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nFebrile seizures are typically diagnosed based on a combination of clinical examination and laboratory tests. The diagnosis is often made on the basis of the child's symptoms and medical history, as well as the results of a physical examination and laboratory tests such as a blood count and a urine analysis.\n\nPrevention\n\nWhile it is not possible to prevent febrile seizures entirely, there are several steps that parents and caregivers can take to reduce the risk of febrile seizures in children.\n\n### Monitoring Body Temperature\n\nOne of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of febrile seizures is to monitor the child's body temperature regularly, especially during the first few days of illness. This can be done using a digital thermometer or a temperature patch.\n\n### Maintaining Hydration\n\nAnother important step in reducing the risk of febrile seizures is to maintain the child's hydration levels. This can be done by offering the child plenty of fluids, such as water, juice, or soup.\n\n### Avoiding Overmedication\n\nFinally, parents and caregivers should avoid overmedicating the child with antipyretic medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. While these medications can help to reduce the child's fever, they can also increase the risk of febrile seizures.\n\nTreatment\n\nWhile febrile seizures are usually harmless, they can be frightening for parents and caregivers. Treatment for febrile seizures typically involves a combination of supportive care and medication.\n\n### Supportive Care\n\nSupportive care for febrile seizures typically involves providing the child with a safe and comfortable environment, as well as reassuring the child and their caregivers. This can include providing a quiet and peaceful environment, offering reassurance and comfort, and monitoring the child's vital signs.\n\n### Medication\n\nIn some cases, medication may be necessary to treat febrile seizures. This can include anticonvulsant medications, such as phenobarbital or diazepam, which can help to prevent seizures in children who are at high risk of febrile seizures.\n\nPrognosis\n\nThe prognosis for children who experience febrile seizures is generally good. Most children who experience febrile seizures do not have any underlying medical conditions that increase their risk of seizures, and they are not likely to experience any long-term complications.\n\nHowever, in some cases, febrile seizures can be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as a brain tumor or a neurological disorder. In these cases, the prognosis may be less favorable.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nFebrile seizures are a common condition in children, and they are estimated to affect up to 2-5% of children under the age of 5. The risk of febrile seizures is highest in children who are under the age of 2, and it decreases with age.\n\nIn addition, febrile seizures are more common in children who have a family history of febrile seizures, or who have other underlying medical conditions such as epilepsy or encephalitis.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Febrile_seizure\" following this outline:\n\n#Signs and symptoms\n##Types\n#Causes\n#Mechanism\n#Diagnosis\n#Prevention\n#Treatment\n#Prognosis\n#Epidemiology\n#References\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
