What if there are 15 different entities around the world who can make a dinosaur?\" [36]\n\n\nWriting\nAlthough Spielberg was heavily involved in the development of ideas for Jurassic World, he had Trevorrow and Connolly devise their own ideas for the sequel He retained final approval on the project [53] In June 2015, about two weeks after the theatrical release of Jurassic World, Trevorrow embarked on a road trip from Los Angeles to his home state of Vermont [2] Connolly agreed to accompany him so they could discuss a basic set of ideas Trevorrow had for the film [2] During their eight-day trip, [54] they began work on the script and devised the basic story [55] [56] Trevorrow said it was inspired by a quote from Dr Alan Grant in the first film: \"Dinosaurs and man, two species separated by 65 million years of evolution, have suddenly been thrown back into the mix together How can we possibly have the slightest idea of what to expect?\" [57] Trevorrow said the story was heavily influenced by the idea that \"a mistake made a long time ago just can't be undone\" [58] He also said the film deals with themes of political megalomania, greed, and \"making decisions with lack of care for how it affects people's lives\" [59]\n\n\nBayona\nAfter Bayona was hired, he began reading Crichton's novels - including Jurassic Park and The Lost World - for inspiration [75] [76] [77] He also re-watched each of the previous Jurassic Park films [77] Trevorrow and Connolly began working with Bayona in July 2016, to perfect the script to the director's liking [58] Bayona had his own ideas incorporated into the script while essentially retaining the original story devised by Trevorrow and Connolly [48] The film's underwater opening sequence was already in their script, [45] and Bayona asked Trevorrow to push for it to become a bigger scene with a larger set [45] Because the film has a lengthy period until the action scenes involving the volcano, Bayona felt it was necessary to expand the opening sequence to be action oriented [77] He also expanded Blue's surgery scene, as he felt it was a key moment demonstrating Owen's relationship with her [77] In addition, Bayona added an action scene to the sequence set on board the Arcadia, the ship that transports the dinosaurs He felt that the sequence was too lengthy and required some action, leading to his suggestion of Owen and Claire retrieving blood from the T rex to aid in Blue's surgery [77] Bayona and Trevorrow removed certain moments from the final script that they felt would be better for the sequel, which would depict dinosaurs having spread around the world [59]\n\n\nCasting\nIn October 2016, casting was underway for the role of a nine-year-old girl [85] Approximately 2,500 girls were interviewed for the part, which ultimately went to Isabella Sermon, marking her film debut [2] Tom Holland - who previously starred in The Impossible - had discussed a role in the film with Bayona, but did not believe he would be available because of scheduling conflicts [86] Toby Jones, Rafe Spall, and Justice Smith were cast at the end of the year [87] [88] [89]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming began on February 24, 2017, [97] [98] and the shoot included locations in England followed by Hawaii [99] Most of the filming in England took place at Pinewood Studios [100] Because of its large sound stages, it was considered perfect for the film's many interior scenes [49] Scenes shot in Hawaii were set on Isla Nublar [101] A post-credits scene is set at the Paris Las Vegas resort, where loose pteranodons from Lockwood's estate land atop the resort's Eiffel Tower [102] [77] Scenes were also expected to be shot at Brecon Beacons National Park in Wales, [103] but ultimately no filming took place there.\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nFilming in the United Kingdom began at the Langley Business Centre in Slough, England [122] Scenes shot at the business center included Claire's Dinosaur Protection Group office, old video diaries of Owen training his baby raptors, and Owen and Claire attempting to retrieve blood from the sedated T rex [2] Much of the video diary footage was improvised by Pratt [77] Bayona, at the suggestion of his film editor, later decided to intercut Blue's surgery scene with footage from the video diaries [77]\n\n\nHawaii\nFilming in Hawaii was underway as of June 13, 2017, [134] [135] and lasted more than 25 days, with locations that included Dillingham Airfield and Pua'ena Point [136] On June 21, filming began at Heʻeia Kea Small Boat Harbor, [137] which served as Isla Nublar's shipping dock [2] More than half the harbor was closed for filming, which required the use of smoke machines Scenes were scheduled to be shot there until the end of the month [137] [138] Filming also took place in a nearby Heʻeia jungle for scenes where Owen searches for and locates Blue [2] As a reference to the first Jurassic Park film, the scene between Owen and Blue includes an overturned Ford Explorer, previously featured in the original film as a Jurassic Park tour vehicle [139] Trevorrow had initially considered including the vehicle in a scene in Jurassic World, before settling on the original Jurassic Park visitor center instead [139] Another filming location was Kualoa Ranch, [140] which included the exterior set for a radio tower bunker [2] The film's official title was confirmed as Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom on June 22, 2017 [141]\n\n\nCreatures on screen\nThe film's dinosaurs were created using a combination of animatronics and computer-generated imagery (CGI) [2] Special effects artist Neal Scanlan served as the film's creature effects supervisor, [146] while Vickery and Alex Wuttke were visual effects supervisors [147] Scanlan worked on the animatronic dinosaurs, while Vickery and his ILM team created versions of the dinosaurs through CGI [146] ILM animators in Vancouver worked on dinosaur stampede scenes, while ILM's London studio created the remaining creature scenes Approximately 52 ILM animators worked on the film [148] Scanlan worked closely with Bayona and Vickery to create the creatures [146] Vickery and ILM did extensive research to accurately create and depict the dinosaurs, which included consulting with paleontologists The ILM team also referred to elephants and rhinos to determine how the dinosaurs should move and behave [2] Dinosaur expert John Hankla, of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, served as an advisor on the film [149] Hankla also provided several dinosaur fossil recreations for the film, [150] including an accurately sized Velociraptor skeleton that appears in the background at the Lockwood Estate's library of dinosaur skeletons [151] After reading fan thoughts on dinosaurs and speaking with children, Bayona realized that dinosaur textures and colors were often brought up and said: \"I thought that was the area where I could play with They feel somehow a little bit more exotic and richer in this movie\" [146] New research had also suggested that real dinosaurs were more colorful and brighter than previously thought [2]\n\n\nMusic\nThe musical score was composed by Michael Giacchino, who also composed the previous film John Williams' themes from earlier Jurassic Park scores were incorporated by Giacchino [161] A soundtrack album was released on June 15, 2018, by Back Lot Music [162]\n\n\nMarketing\nA six-second clip from the film was released on November 22, 2017 [163] [164] The first trailer was teased for release on November 30, but was later confirmed to be incorrect [165] Several teaser trailers and a behind-the-scenes featurette of the film were released in early December, [166] [167] [168] [169] before the release of a full-length trailer on December 7 [23] [166]\n\n\nRelease\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom had its premiere at the WiZink Center in Madrid, Spain, on May 21, 2018 [201] [202] The film's international

[76] [77] He also re-watched each of the previous Jurassic Park films [77] Trevorrow and Connolly began working with Bayona in July 2016, to perfect the script to the director's liking [58] Bayona had his own ideas incorporated into the script while essentially retaining the original story devised by Trevorrow and Connolly [48] The film's underwater opening sequence was already in their script, [45] and Bayona asked Trevorrow to push for it to become a bigger scene with a larger set [45] Because the film has a lengthy period until the action scenes involving the volcano, Bayona felt it was necessary to expand the opening sequence to be action oriented [77] He also expanded Blue's surgery scene, as he felt it was a key moment demonstrating Owen's relationship with her [77] In addition, Bayona added an action scene to the sequence set on board the Arcadia, the ship that transports the dinosaurs He felt that the sequence was too lengthy and required some action, leading to his suggestion of Owen and Claire retrieving blood from the T rex to aid in Blue's surgery [77] Bayona and Trevorrow removed certain moments from the final script that they felt would be better for the sequel, which would depict dinosaurs having spread around the world [59]\n\n\nCasting\nIn October 2016, casting was underway for the role of a nine-year-old girl [85] Approximately 2,500 girls were interviewed for the part, which ultimately went to Isabella Sermon, marking her film debut [2] Tom Holland - who previously starred in The Impossible - had discussed a role in the film with Bayona, but did not believe he would be available because of scheduling conflicts [86] Toby Jones, Rafe Spall, and Justice Smith were cast at the end of the year [87] [88] [89]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming began on February 24, 2017, [97] [98] and the shoot included locations in England followed by Hawaii [99] Most of the filming in England took place at Pinewood Studios [100] Because of its large sound stages, it was considered perfect for the film's many interior scenes [49] Scenes shot in Hawaii were set on Isla Nublar [101] A post-credits scene is set at the Paris Las Vegas resort, where loose pteranodons from Lockwood's estate land atop the resort's Eiffel Tower [102] [77] Scenes were also expected to be shot at Brecon Beacons National Park in Wales, [103] but ultimately no filming took place there.\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nFilming in the United Kingdom began at the Langley Business Centre in Slough, England [122] Scenes shot at the business center included Claire's Dinosaur Protection Group office, old video diaries of Owen training his baby raptors, and Owen and Claire attempting to retrieve blood from the sedated T rex [2] Much of the video diary footage was improvised by Pratt [77] Bayona, at the suggestion of his film editor, later decided to intercut Blue's surgery scene with footage from the video diaries [77]\n\n\nHawaii\nFilming in Hawaii was underway as of June 13, 2017, [134] [135] and lasted more than 25 days, with locations that included Dillingham Airfield and Pua'ena Point [136] On June 21, filming began at Heʻeia Kea Small Boat Harbor, [137] which served as Isla Nublar's shipping dock [2] More than half the harbor was closed for filming, which required the use of smoke machines Scenes were scheduled to be shot there until the end of the month [137] [138] Filming also took place in a nearby Heʻeia jungle for scenes where Owen searches for and locates Blue [2] As a reference to the first Jurassic Park film, the scene between Owen and Blue includes an overturned Ford Explorer, previously featured in the original film as a Jurassic Park tour vehicle [139] Trevorrow had initially considered including the vehicle in a scene in Jurassic World, before settling on the original Jurassic Park visitor center instead [139] Another filming location was Kualoa Ranch, [140] which included the exterior set for a radio tower bunker [2] The film's official title was confirmed as Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom on June 22, 2017 [141]\n\n\nCreatures on screen\nThe film's dinosaurs were created using a combination of animatronics and computer-generated imagery (CGI) [2] Special effects artist Neal Scanlan served as the film's creature effects supervisor, [146] while Vickery and Alex Wuttke were visual effects supervisors [147] Scanlan worked on the animatronic dinosaurs, while Vickery and his ILM team created versions of the dinosaurs through CGI [146] ILM animators in Vancouver worked on dinosaur stampede scenes, while ILM's London studio created the remaining creature scenes Approximately 52 ILM animators worked on the film [148] Scanlan worked closely with Bayona and Vickery to create the creatures [146] Vickery and ILM did extensive research to accurately create and depict the dinosaurs, which included consulting with paleontologists The ILM team also referred to elephants and rhinos to determine how the dinosaurs should move and behave [2] Dinosaur expert John Hankla, of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, served as an advisor on the film [149] Hankla also provided several dinosaur fossil recreations for the film, [150] including an accurately sized Velociraptor skeleton that appears in the background at the Lockwood Estate's library of dinosaur skeletons [151] After reading fan thoughts on dinosaurs and speaking with children, Bayona realized that dinosaur textures and colors were often brought up and said: \"I thought that was the area where I could play with They feel somehow a little bit more exotic and richer in this movie\" [146] New research had also suggested that real dinosaurs were more colorful and brighter than previously thought [2]\n\n\nMusic\nThe musical score was composed by Michael Giacchino, who also composed the previous film John Williams' themes from earlier Jurassic Park scores were incorporated by Giacchino [161] A soundtrack album was released on June 15, 2018, by Back Lot Music [162]\n\n\nMarketing\nA six-second clip from the film was released on November 22, 2017 [163] [164] The first trailer was teased for release on November 30, but was later confirmed to be incorrect [165] Several teaser trailers and a behind-the-scenes featurette of the film were released in early December, [166] [167] [168] [169] before the release of a full-length trailer on December 7 [23] [166]\n\n\nRelease\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom had its premiere at the WiZink Center in Madrid, Spain, on May 21, 2018 [201] [202] The film's international

The photograph has become an iconic symbol of the Soviet Union's victory in World War II and is widely regarded as one of the most famous images of the 20th century.\n\n## Background\n\nThe Battle of Berlin was the final major offensive of the European theatre of World War II and was designated the Berlin Strategic Offensive Operation by the Soviet Union. Starting on April 16, 1945, the Red Army breached the German front as a result of the Vistula–Oder offensive and rapidly advanced westward through Germany, as fast as 30–40 kilometers a day. The offensive culminated in the battle in Berlin, which lasted from late April 30, 1945, until May 2, 1945, and was one of the bloodiest battles in history.\n\n## Taking the Photograph\n\nThe Reichstag was seen as symbolic of, and at the heart of, Nazi Germany. It was arguably the most symbolic target in Berlin. The events surrounding the flag-raising are murky due to the confusion of the fight at the building. On April 30, 1945, there was great pressure from Stalin to take the building, in time for the International Workers' Day, May 1. Initially, two planes dropped several large red banners on the roof that appeared to have caught on the bombed-out dome. A number of reports had reached headquarters that two parties, M. M. Bondar from the 380th Rifle Regiment and Captain V. N. Makov of the 756th, might have been able to hoist a flag during the day of April 30. These reports were received by Marshal G. K. Zhukov, who issued an announcement stating that his troops had captured the Reichstag and hoisted a flag. However, when correspondents arrived, they found no Soviets in the building, rather they were pinned down outside by German fire. After fierce fighting both outside and inside the building, a flag was raised at 22:40 on April 30, 1945, when 23-year-old Rakhimzhan Qoshqarbaev climbed the building and inserted a flag into the crown of the mounted female statue of \"Germania,\" symbolizing Germany.\n\n## Aftermath\n\nThe flag was taken down by the Germans the next day. The Red Army finally gained control of the entire building on May 2, 1945. The photo was published on May 13, 1945, in the Ogonyok magazine. While many photographers took pictures of flags on the roof, it was Khaldei's image that stuck.\n\n## Editing\n\nAfter taking the symbolic photo, Khaldei quickly returned to Moscow. He further edited the image at the request of the editor-in-chief of the Ogonyok, who noticed that Senior Sergeant Abdulkhakim Ismailov, who is supporting the flag-bearer, was wearing two watches, which could imply he had looted one of them, an action punishable by execution. Using a needle, Khaldei removed the watch from the right wrist. Later, it was claimed that the extra watch was actually an Adrianov compass, and that Khaldei, in order to avoid controversy, doctored the photo to remove the watch from Ismailov's right wrist. He also added smoke in the background, copying it from another picture to make the scene more dramatic.\n\n## Copyrights\n\nBecause Khaldei took the photo as part of his work for TASS, the copyright of the photo belongs to TASS, not Khaldei. According to Russian copyright law, works created by legal entities have a copyright term of 70 years after publication (or creation, if the work was not published before August 3, 1993). Since Raising a Flag over the Reichstag was published in 1945, its Russian copyright expired on January 1, 2016. This was confirmed in 2015 in the court session between the heiress of the photographer, his daughter Anna Khaldei, and the publishing house \"Veche\" about the use of the photograph in the book \"Za porogom Pobedy\" (Russian: За порогом Победы, Behind the Threshold of the Victory) by Arsen Benikovich Martirosyan, where ITAR-TASS was attracted as a third person.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Rakhimzhan Qoshqarbaev\n* Yevgeny Khaldei\n* TASS\n* Soviet Union\n* World War II\n* Berlin Strategic Offensive Operation\n* Reichstag\n* Germania\n* International Workers' Day\n* Adolf Hitler\n* Joseph Stalin\n* Berlin\n\n## Annotations\n\n* The photograph has been widely reproduced and is considered an iconic symbol of the Soviet Union's victory in World War II.\n* The photograph has been the subject of controversy due to allegations that Khaldei doctored the image to remove the watch from Ismailov's right wrist.\n* The photograph has been the subject of several court cases over the years due to copyright disputes.\n* The photograph has been the subject of several books and articles, including a biography of Khaldei and a history of the Soviet Union during World War II.\n\n## Bibliography\n\n* Khaldei, Y.

ideological inspiration for Putin [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] Putin was personally involved in moving Ilyin's remains back to Russia, and in 2009 consecrated his grave [58]\n\n\nAleksandr Dugin\nIn 1997, Russian thinker Aleksandr Dugin, widely known for fascistic views, [60] [61] published The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia, a book believed to have garnered significant impact among Russia's military, police and foreign policy elites [62] [63] In it, he argued that Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because \"Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning\", \"no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness\", that \" [its] certain territorial ambitions represen [t] an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics\" He argued that Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is \"sanitary cordon\", which would be \"inadmissible\" [62] The book may have been influential in Vladimir Putin's foreign policy, which eventually led to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine [64] Also in 1997, Dugin hailed what he saw as the arrival of a \"genuine, true, radically revolutionary and consistent, fascist fascism\" in Russia, in an article titled \"Fascism – Borderless and Red\"; previously in 1992, he had in another article defended \"fascism\" as not having anything to do with \"the racist and chauvinist aspects of National Socialism\", stating in contrast that \"Russian fascism is a combination of natural national conservatism with a passionate desire for true changes.\" [65] Another of Dugin's books, The Fourth Political Theory, published in 2009, has been cited as an inspiration for Russian policy in events such as the war in Donbas, [66] and for the contemporary European far-right in general [67]\n\n\nTimofey Sergeitsev\nAccording to Euractiv, Russian political operative Timofey Sergeitsev is \"one of the ideologists of modern Russian fascism\" [69]\n\n\nRussian Orthodox Church\nThe Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) officially deems the invasion of Ukraine to be a \"holy war\" [81] [82] [83] During the World Russian People's Council in March 2024, it approved a document stating that this \"holy war\" was to defend \"Holy Russia\" and to protect the world from globalism and the West, which it said had \"fallen into Satanism\" [81] The document further stated that all of Ukraine should come under Russia's sphere of influence, and that Ukrainians and Belarusians \"should be recognised only as sub-ethnic groups of the Russians\" [81] Patriarch Kirill also issued a prayer for Russian victory in the war, [84] and the church has punished or expelled priests who refuse to say it [85]\n\n\nVladislav Surkov\nFrom 1999 to February 2020 Vladislav Surkov was an influential Russian politician and was dubbed the ‘Grey Cardinal’ and the Kremlin's main ideologist and also was commonly regarded as the mastermind of Putin's policies towards Ukraine [89] Surkov helped create pro-government youth movements, including the Nashi Youth Movement, meeting with their leaders and giving them lectures [90] [91] The Nashi Youth Movement has been likened to the Hitler Youth [92] and the Soviet-era Komsomol [93]\n\n\nVladimir Putin\nRussian president Vladimir Putin is known for denying Ukrainian and Belarusian nationhood, referring to Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians as \"one people\" making up a triune Russian nation He said there is \"no historical basis\" for the \"idea of Ukrainian people as a nation separate from the Russians\" [97] Putin has repeatedly denied Ukraine's right to exist, calling the country \"an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space\" He claimed that it was created by the Russian Bolsheviks and that it never had \"real statehood\" [98] [99] [100] Moreover, Putin admitted that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was an attempt to reclaim \"Russian\" land [101]\n\n\nDmitry Medvedev\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia and former Russian president, has been described as a \"Russian rashist (Russian fascist)\" and the \"Kremlin's Nazi\" by Ukrainian and American media [104] He publicly wrote that \"Ukraine is NOT a country, but artificially collected territories\" and that Ukrainian \"is NOT a language\" but a \"mongrel dialect\" of Russian [105] Medvedev said that Ukraine should not exist in any form and that Russia will continue to wage war against any independent Ukrainian state [106] He said Ukrainians had to choose between joining Russia or \"death\" [107] On 22 February 2024, Medvedev said that the Russian Army will go further into Ukraine, seizing Kyiv and Odesa, which he called \"Russian cities\" [108] [109] He also described the invasion as a sacred war against Satan [110]\n\n\nViews on development of Ruscism\nAccording to The Economist, as a political calculation in response to his waning popularity in the early 2010s, Vladimir Putin began to draw more heavily on post-Soviet fascist thinking, concepts which emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union [12] According to Mark Lipovetsky, Ruscism has become \"the cultural mainstream of Putinist Russia\" [116] In 2007, the first post-Soviet Prime Minister of Russia Yegor Gaidar warned about the rise of post-imperial nostalgia, stating that \"Russia is going through a dangerous phase\", and making a reference to history by stating \" [w]e should not succumb to the magic of numbers but the fact that there was a 15-year gap between the collapse of the German Empire and Adolf Hitler's rise to power and 15 years between the collapse of the USSR and Russia in 2006–07 makes one think\" [12]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nIn 2017, Yuliia Strebkova of Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute indicated that Ruscism in combination with Ukrainophobia constitutes the ethno-national vector of the more broad Russian neo-imperial ideological doctrine of \"Russian world\" [129]\n\n\nReactions in Russia\nIn 2014, Russian actor Ivan Okhlobystin, who holds pro-Putin views, publicly called himself a \"Rashist\" and made a tattoo \"as a sign that I'm a Rashist, I'll live as a Rashist and I'll die as a Rashist\" [143] In 2015, he released a series of wristwatches with Chi Rho and the text \"I am Rashist\" (Russian: я рашист, romanized: ya rashist) on the clock face, written with a Gothic font, and with \"Not only Crimea's ours – everything's ours!\" on the back [144] The term was also embraced by Russian nationalist Yegor Kholmogorov who published an article titled \"Russism Choosing Putin\", in which he broke down Russism into three components: \"Russia is above all Russia is a state of Russians The Lord is with Russia and the Russians\" [28]\n\n\nRussian government and state media reactions\nRussian television presenter Tina Kandelaki, who supported Russia's war against Ukraine, [151] [152] criticized Wikipedia's use of the term \"Rashizm\" on her Telegram channel, accusing Wikipedia of \"digital fascism\" targeting Russian people and calling Russians to stop using it [153]\n\n\nCriticism of the term\nHistorian Stanley G Payne said that Putin's Russia \"is not equivalent to the fascist regimes of World War II, but it forms the nearest analogue to fascism found in a major country since that time\" and \"it is not the product of any revolutionary movement or ideology -- fascist or otherwise It has developed the characteristics of what some political analysts have called a 'mafia state,' though under centralized personal dictatorship.\" [159] He believes that the political system in Russia is \"more a revival of the creed of Tsar Nicholas I in the 19th century that emphasized 'Orthodoxy, autocracy, and nationality' than one resembling the revolutionary, modernizing regimes of Hitler and Mussolini.\" [159]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang":

{"title": "Artificial_intelligence", "content": "\nGoals\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research [a]\n\n\nReasoning and problem-solving\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions [13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics [14]\n\n\nKnowledge representation\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering [17] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, [18] scene interpretation, [19] clinical decision support, [20] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), [21] and other areas [22]\n\n\nPlanning and decision-making\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen [d] [32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal [33] In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility [34]\n\n\nLearning\nMachine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically [41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning [e]\n\n\nNatural language processing\nNatural language processing (NLP) [50] allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering [51]\n\n\nPerception\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input [58]\n\n\nSocial intelligence\nAffective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood [65] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.\n\n\nGeneral intelligence\nA machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence [4]\n\n\nTechniques\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above [b]\n\n\nSearch and optimization\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions [68] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\n\n\nState space search\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state [69] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis [70]\n\n\nLocal search\nLocal search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally [74]\n\n\nLogic\nFormal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation [78]\nFormal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\") [79] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\") [80]\n\n\nProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\nMany problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics [86] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, [87] and information value theory [88] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, [89] dynamic decision networks, [90] game theory and mechanism design [91]\n\n\nClassifiers and statistical learning methods\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand Classifiers [98] are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience [45]\n\n\nArtificial neural networks\nAn artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers [104]\n\n\nDeep learning\nDeep learning [110] uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces [112]\n\n\nGPT\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation) Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data They are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text [122] [123]\n\n\nHardware and software\nIn the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training [126] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research, [127] but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant [128]\n\n\nApplications\nAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's iPhoto and TikTok) The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation officer (CAO).\n\n\nHealth and medicine\nThe application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life [130] Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients [131] [132]\n\n\nGames\nGame playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques [138] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997 [139] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin [140] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world [141] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus [142] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games [143] In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map [144] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning [145] In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions [146]\n\n\nMathematics\nIn mathematics, special forms of formal step-by-step reasoning are used In contrast, LLMs such as GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini Ultra, Claude Opus, LLaMa-2 or Mistral Large are working with probabilistic models, which can produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations Therefore, they need not only a large database of mathematical problems to learn from but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections [147] A 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data [148]\n\n\nFinance\nFinance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use for some years [153]\n\n\nMilitary\nVarious countries are deploying AI military applications [155] The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability [156] Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles [155] AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams [156] AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria [155]\n\n\nGenerative AI\nIn the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence GenAI is AI capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data using generative models, [158] [159] often in response to prompts [160] [161]\n\n\nAgents\nArtificial intelligent (AI) agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks [165] [166] [167]\n\n\nOther industry-specific tasks\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes [168] A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management.\n\n\nEthics\nAI has potential benefits and potential risks [173] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\" [174] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified [175] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning [176]\n\n\nRisks and harm\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.\n\n\nPrivacy and copyright\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.\n\n\nDominance by tech giants\nThe commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft [188] [189] [190] Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace [191] [192]\n\n\nSubstantial power needs and other environmental impacts\nIn January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use [193] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation [194]\n\n\nMisinformation\nYouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching) The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation [201] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government [202] The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society After the U.S election in 2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem  [citation needed].\n\n\nAlgorithmic bias and fairness\nMachine learning applications will be biased [k] if they learn from biased data [206] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists [207] Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed [208] [206] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination [209] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.\n\n\nLack of transparency\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions [221] Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs But some popular explainability techniques exist [222]\n\n\nBad actors and weaponized AI\nArtificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states.\n\n\nTechnological unemployment\nEconomists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment [241]\n\n\nExistential risk\nIt has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\" [251] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character [q] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\n\n\nEthical machines and alignment\nFriendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk [270]\n\n\nOpen source\nActive organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face, [275] Google, [276] EleutherAI and Meta [277] Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight, [278] [279] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case [280] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses [281]\n\n\nFrameworks\nArtificial Intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing, developing, and implementing an AI system An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the SUM values—developed by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas: [282] [283]\n\n\nRegulation\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms [288] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally [289] According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone [290] [291] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI [292] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia [292] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology [292] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI [293] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years [294] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics [295] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \"Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law\" It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories [296]\n\n\nHistory\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning [305] [306] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\" [r] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, [308] such as McCullouch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, [115] and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible [309] [306]\n\n\nPhilosophy\nPhilosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines [339] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications [340] Many other topics in philosophy can relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will [341] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI [340]\n\n\nDefining artificial intelligence\nAlan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" [342] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\" [342] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation [309] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\" Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\" [343]\n\n\nEvaluating approaches to AI\nNo established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history [aa] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\") This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\n\n\nSymbolic AI and its limits\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\") [353] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\" [354]\n\n\nNeat vs. scruffy\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks) \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, [360] but eventually was seen as irrelevant Modern AI has elements of both.\n\n\nSoft vs. hard computing\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems [15] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\n\n\nNarrow vs. general AI\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals [361] [362] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\n\n\nMachine consciousness, sentience, and mind\nThe philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence Russell and Norvig add that \" [t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\" [363] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\n\n\nConsciousness\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness [364] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion) While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like [365]\n\n\nComputationalism and functionalism\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam [366]\n\n\nAI welfare and rights\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree [371] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals [372] [373] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights [372] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society [374]\n\n\nFuture\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind [362]If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I J Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\" [378]\n\n\nSuperintelligence and the singularity\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind [362]If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I J Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\" [378]\n\n\nTranshumanism\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger [380]\n\n\nIn fiction\nThought-capable artificial

"**Introduction**\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of research and development that has been gaining significant attention in recent years. AI involves the creation of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. The goals of AI research include developing machines that can simulate human thought processes, understand natural language, and interact with humans in a more intuitive and natural way. In this article, we will explore the different aspects of AI, including its history, techniques, applications, and challenges.\n\n**Goals**\n\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.\n\n### Reasoning and problem-solving\n\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.\n\n### Knowledge representation\n\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery, and other areas.\n\n### Planning and decision-making\n\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal. In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences and assigns a number to each situation, known as the \"utility,\" that measures how much the agent prefers it.\n\n### Learning\n\nMachine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. It has been a part of AI from the beginning. Machine learning involves training a program on a set of examples and then using it to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.\n\n### Natural language processing\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write, and communicate in human languages such as English. Specific problems in NLP include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval, and question answering.\n\n### Perception\n\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input and understand the meaning of what is seen.\n\n### Social intelligence\n\nAffective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood. For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously, making them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction.\n\n### General intelligence\n\nA machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.\n\n**Techniques**\n\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.\n\n### Search and optimization\n\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\n\n### State space search\n\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.\n\n### Local search\n\nLocal search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.\n\n### Logic\n\nFormal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation. Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic and predicate logic.\n\n### Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\n\nMany problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.\n\n### Classifiers and statistical learning methods\n\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers and controllers. Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning.\n\n### Artificial neural networks\n\nAn artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes, also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognize patterns and can recognize those patterns in fresh data.\n\n### Deep learning\n\nDeep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input.\n\n### Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT)\n\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. They are trained on a large corpus of text and can generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token.\n\n**Applications**\n\nAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including search engines, targeted online advertisements, recommendation systems, driving internet traffic, targeted advertising, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, automatic language translation, facial recognition, and image labeling.\n\n**Health and medicine**\n\nThe application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI if it can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.\n\n**Games**\n\nGame playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on November 11, 1997.\n\n**Finance**\n\nFinance is one of the fastest-growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed. From retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use for some years.\n\n**Military**\n\nVarious countries are deploying AI military applications. The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration, and interoperability. Research targets intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles.\n\n**Generative AI**\n\nIn the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence. Generative AI is AI capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data using generative models, often in response to prompts.\n\n**Agents**\n\nArtificial intelligent (AI) agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics.\n\n**Other industry-specific tasks**\n\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. A 2017 survey found that one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes.\n\n**Ethics**\n\nAI has potential benefits and potential risks. Potential benefits include advancing science and finding solutions for serious problems. However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. These include machine learning algorithms requiring large amounts of data, which has raised concerns about privacy, surveillance, and copyright.\n\n**Risks and harm**\n\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance, and copyright. The commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies, which has raised concerns about the concentration of power and the potential for bias.\n\n**Lack of transparency**\n\nMany AI systems are complex and difficult to understand. This lack of transparency has raised concerns about accountability and the potential for AI to be used in ways that are not in the best interests of society.\n\n**Bad actors and weaponized AI**\n\nArtificial intelligence provides tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals, or rogue states. This has raised concerns about the potential for AI to be used in ways that are harmful to society.\n\n**Technological unemployment**\n\nEconomists have highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.\n\n**Existential risk**\n\nIt has been argued that AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could spell the end of the human race.\n\n**Transhumanism**\n\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick, and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.\n\n**In fiction**\n\nThought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Artificial_intelligence\" following this

intelligent system to display The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research [a]\n\n\nReasoning and problem-solving\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions [13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain

perceives and takes actions in the world A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen [d] [32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal [33] In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility [34]\n\n\nLearning\nMachine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically [41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning [e]\n\n\nNatural language processing\nNatural language processing (NLP) [50] allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering [51]\n\n\nPerception\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input [58]\n\n\nSocial intelligence\nAffective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood [65] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.\n\n\nGeneral intelligence\nA machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence [4]\n\n\nTechniques\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above [b]\n\n\nSearch and optimization\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions [68] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\n\n\nState space search\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state [69] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis [70]\n\n\nLocal search\nLocal search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally [74]\n\n\nLogic\nFormal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation [78]\nFormal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\") [79] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\") [80]\n\n\nProbabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\nMany problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics [86] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, [87] and information value theory [88] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, [89] dynamic decision networks, [90] game theory and mechanism design [91]\n\n\nClassifiers and statistical learning methods\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand Classifiers [98] are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience [45]\n\n\nArtificial neural networks\nAn artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers [104]\n\n\nDeep learning\nDeep learning [110] uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces [112]\n\n\nGPT\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation) Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data They are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text [122] [123]\n\n\nHardware and software\nIn the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training [126] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research, [127] but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant [128]\n\n\nApplications\nAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's iPhoto and TikTok) The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation officer (CAO).\n\n\nHealth and medicine\nThe application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life [130] Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients [131] [132]\n\n\nGames\nGame playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques [138] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997 [139] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin [140] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world [141] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus [142] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games [143] In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map [144] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning [145] In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions [146]\n\n\nMathematics\nIn mathematics, special forms of formal step-by-step reasoning are used In contrast, LLMs such as GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini Ultra, Claude Opus, LLaMa-2 or Mistral Large are working with probabilistic models, which can produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations Therefore, they need not only a large database of mathematical problems to learn from but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections [147] A 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data [148]\n\n\nFinance\nFinance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use for some years [153]\n\n\nMilitary\nVarious countries are deploying AI military applications [155] The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability [156] Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles [155] AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams [156] AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria [155]\n\n\nGenerative AI\nIn the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence GenAI is AI capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data using generative models, [158] [159] often in response to prompts [160] [161]\n\n\nAgents\nArtificial intelligent (AI) agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks [165] [166] [167]\n\n\nOther industry-specific tasks\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes [168] A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management.\n\n\nEthics\nAI has potential benefits and potential risks [173] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\" [174] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified [175] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning [176]\n\n\nRisks and harm\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.\n\n\nPrivacy and copyright\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.\n\n\nDominance by tech giants\nThe commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft [188] [189] [190] Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace [191] [192]\n\n\nSubstantial power needs and other environmental impacts\nIn January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use [193] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation [194]\n\n\nMisinformation\nYouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching) The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation [201] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government [202] The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society After the U.S election in 2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem  [citation needed].\n\n\nAlgorithmic bias and fairness\nMachine learning applications will be biased [k] if they learn from biased data [206] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists [207] Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed [208] [206] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination [209] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.\n\n\nLack of transparency\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions [221] Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs But some popular explainability techniques exist [222]\n\n\nBad actors and weaponized AI\nArtificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states.\n\n\nTechnological unemployment\nEconomists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment [241]\n\n\nExistential risk\nIt has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\" [251] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character [q] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\n\n\nEthical machines and alignment\nFriendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk [270]\n\n\nOpen source\nActive organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face, [275] Google, [276] EleutherAI and Meta [277] Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight, [278] [279] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case [280] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses [281]\n\n\nFrameworks\nArtificial Intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing, developing, and implementing an AI system An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the SUM values—developed by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas: [282] [283]\n\n\nRegulation\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms [288] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally [289] According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone [290] [291] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI [292] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia [292] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology [292] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI [293] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years [294] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics [295] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \"Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law\" It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories [296]\n\n\nHistory\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning [305] [306] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\" [r] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, [308] such as McCullouch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, [115] and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible [309] [306]\n\n\nPhilosophy\nPhilosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines [339] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications [340] Many other topics in philosophy can relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will [341] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI [340]\n\n\nDefining artificial intelligence\nAlan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" [342] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\" [342] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation [309] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\" Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\" [343]\n\n\nEvaluating approaches to AI\nNo established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history [aa] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\") This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\n\n\nSymbolic AI and its limits\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\") [353] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\" [354]\n\n\nNeat vs. scruffy\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks) \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, [360] but eventually was seen as irrelevant Modern AI has elements of both.\n\n\nSoft vs. hard computing\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems [15] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\n\n\nNarrow vs. general AI\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals [361] [362] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\n\n\nMachine consciousness, sentience, and mind\nThe philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence Russell and Norvig add that \" [t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\" [363] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\n\n\nConsciousness\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness [364] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion) While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like [365]\n\n\nComputationalism and functionalism\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam [366]\n\n\nAI welfare and rights\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree [371] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals [372] [373] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights [372] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society [374]\n\n\nFuture\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind [362]If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I J Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\" [378]\n\n\nSuperintelligence and the singularity\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind [362]If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I J Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\" [378]\n\n\nTranshumanism\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger [380]\n\n\nIn fiction\nThought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, [382] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction [383]\n\n\nSee

{"title": "Pamela_Anderson", "content": "\nEarly life\nAnderson was born in Ladysmith, British Columbia, Canada, the daughter of Barry Anderson, a furnace repairman, and Carol, a waitress [8] Her great-grandfather, Juho Hyytiäinen, was a Finnish native of Saarijärvi, and left the Grand Duchy of Finland (which was a part of the Russian Empire at the time) for Canada in 1908 [9] He changed his name to Anderson when he arrived as an immigrant Anderson also has Volga German ancestry on her mother's side; her grandmother, ethnically German, was born in Russia in a Mennonite village and immigrated to Canada in 1901 [10] [11] [12] Anderson received press coverage right after her birth as a \"Centennial Baby\", having been born on July 1, 1967, the 100th anniversary of Canada's official founding via the Constitution Act, 1867 [13] [14] She has a younger brother, Gerry (born 1971), an actor and producer who worked in some of her films and television shows.\n\n\nCareer\nIn 1989, Anderson attended a BC Lions Canadian Football League game at the BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, [18] where she was featured on the jumbotron while wearing a Labatt's Beer T-shirt [18] The brewing company hired Anderson briefly as a spokesmodel [18] Inspired by the event, her then-boyfriend Dan Ilicic produced a poster of her image, entitled the Blue Zone Girl [19]\n\n\n1989–1999: Modeling and acting breakthrough\nIn 1989, Anderson attended a BC Lions Canadian Football League game at the BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, [18] where she was featured on the jumbotron while wearing a Labatt's Beer T-shirt [18] The brewing company hired Anderson briefly as a spokesmodel [18] Inspired by the event, her then-boyfriend Dan Ilicic produced a poster of her image, entitled the Blue Zone Girl [19]\n\n\n2000–2009: Rise to media prominence\nSam Newman House, a pop architecture building constructed in 2001 in St Kilda, Victoria, Australia, has a large image of Anderson's face Sam Newman commissioned local architect Cassandra Fahey to design the building, and used the image with Anderson's permission Permits were issued retroactively when it became a major local landmark and won the award for Best New Residential Building in the RAIA Victorian Architecture Awards [28] Later that year, Anderson played herself in the Miller Lite TV commercial \"Pillow Fight\", the sequel to the brand's earlier commercial \"Catfight\", with models Tanya Ballinger and Kitana Baker reprising their roles [29]\n\n\n2010–2021: Shift to reality television\nIn 2010, she appeared in the short film The Commuter directed by the McHenry Brothers and shot entirely on the Nokia N8 smartphone as promotion for the phone in the UK [39] [40] Anderson was featured in a beach-themed editorial, shot by Mario Testino for Brazilian Vogue's June 2013 \"Body Issue\" [41]\n\n\n2022–present: Acting return and films\nAnderson made her Broadway debut playing Roxie Hart in the Broadway production of Chicago for eight weeks from April 12, 2022 to June 5, 2022 [53] It was her first time performing since 2019 [54]\n\n\nActivism\nAnderson became a vegetarian in her early teens after her father went hunting and brought home a \"bloodied deer.\" [65] She eventually transitioned to veganism in her twenties [66] Anderson currently promotes the benefits a Plant-based diet, [67] [68] and in 2024 published the  plant-based cookbook, I Love You: Recipes From the Heart [69] [62] [70]\n\n\nPlant-based cooking\nAnderson became a vegetarian in her early teens after her father went hunting and brought home a

intervals; however, a well-organised movement was never initiated Several all-party platforms were created and usually resolved around petitions, public meetings, seminars, rallies and strikes [38] The demand was raised by the Raipur Congress unit in 1924 and was also discussed in the Indian Congress at Tripuri A discussion about forming a Regional Congress organisation for Chhattisgarh took place In 1954, when the State Reorganisation Commission was set up, the demand was put forward but was rejected In 1955, the demand was raised in the Nagpur assembly of Madhya Bharat [38]\n\n\nGeography\nThe northern and southern parts of the state are hilly, while the central part is a fertile plain The highest point in the state is the Gaurlata near Samri, Balrampur-Ramanujganj district [39] Deciduous forests of the Eastern Highlands Forests cover roughly 44% of the state [40]\nIn the north lies the edge of the great Indo-Gangetic plain The Rihand River, a tributary of the Ganges, drains this area The eastern end of the Satpura Range and the western edge of the Chota Nagpur Plateau form an east–west belt of hills that divide the Mahanadi River basin from the Indo-Gangetic plain The outline of Chhattisgarh is like a sea horse.\n\n\nForest\nThe state has the third largest forest by area in India The state animal is the van bhainsa, or wild Asian buffalo The state bird is the pahari myna, or hill myna The state tree is the Sal (Sarai) found in Bastar division.\n\n\nClimate\nChhattisgarh has a tropical climate It is hot and humid in the summer because of its proximity to the Tropic of Cancer and its dependence on the monsoons for rains Summer temperatures in Chhattisgarh can reach up to 49 °C (120 °F) [43] The monsoon season is from late June to October and is a welcome respite from the heat Chhattisgarh receives an average of 1,292 millimetres (50.9 in) of rain Winter is from November to January Winters are pleasant with low temperatures and less humidity Ambikapur, Mainpat, Pendra Road, Samri and Jashpur are some of the coldest places in the state [44]\n\n\nTransport\nChhattisgarh has four-lane or two-lane roads that provide connectivity

network\nAlmost the entire railway network spread over the state comes under the geographical jurisdiction of the South East Central Railway Zone of Indian Railways centred around Bilaspur, which is the zonal headquarters of this zone Almost 85% of tracks are electrified, the non-electrified route is the Maroda–Bhanupratappur line from the Durg–Bhanupratappur branch line, which is 120 km long The main railway junctions are Bilaspur Junction, Durg Junction, and Raipur, which is also a starting point of many long-distance trains These three junctions are well-connected to the major cities of

Vivekananda Airport in Raipur is the primary airport (domestic) and is well connected to all major cities of India Besides this, the smaller Bilaspur Airport, Jagdalpur Airport  and Ambikapur Airport are regionally connected with scheduled commercial services A massive reduction in sales tax on aviation turbine fuel (ATF) from 25 to 4% in Chhattisgarh in 2003 contributed to a sharp rise in passenger flow The passenger flow increased by 58% between 2011 and November 2012 [48]\n\n\nAir\nThe air infrastructure in Chhattisgarh is gradually improving Swami Vivekananda Airport in Raipur is

₹5.09 lakh crore (US$61 billion) in 2023–24, the 17th largest state economy in India The economy of Chhattisgarh recorded a growth rate of 11.2% in 2023–24 [8] Chhattisgarh's success factors in achieving high growth rate are growth in agriculture and industrial production.\n\n\nEconomy\n\nChhattisgarh's nominal gross state domestic product (GSDP) is estimated at ₹5.09 lakh crore

rate are growth in agriculture and industrial production.\n\n\nAgriculture\nAgriculture is counted as the chief economic occupation of the state According to a government estimate, the net sown area of the state is 4.828 million hectares and the gross sown area is 5.788 million hectares [51] Horticulture and animal husbandry also engage a major share of the total population of the state [52] About 80% of the population of the state is rural and the main livelihood of the villagers is agriculture and agriculture-based small industry.\n\n\nAgricultural products\nThe main crops are rice, maize, [54] kodo-kutki and other small millets and pulses (tuar [55] and kulthi); oilseeds, such as groundnuts (peanuts), soybeans [56] and sunflowers are also grown In the mid-1990s, most of Chhattisgarh was still a monocrop belt Only one-fourth to one-fifth of the sown area was double-cropped When a very substantial portion of the population is dependent on agriculture, a situation where nearly 80% of a state's area is covered only by one crop, immediate attention to turn them into double crop areas is needed Also, very few cash crops are grown in Chhattisgarh, so there is a need to diversify the agricultural produce towards oilseeds and other cash crops Chhattisgarh is also called the \"rice bowl of central India\" [51]\n\n\nIrrigation\nIn Chhattisgarh, rice, the main crop, is grown on about 77% of the net sown area Only about 20% of the area is under irrigation; the rest depends on rain Of the three agroclimatic zones, about 73% of the Chhattisgarh plains, 97% of the Bastar plateau, and 95% of the northern hills are rainfed The irrigated area available for double cropping is only 87,000 ha in the Chhattisgarh plains and 2300 ha in Bastar plateau and northern hills Due to this, the productivity of rice and other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now, though agriculture is the main occupation of more than 80% of the population [53]\n\n\nIndustrial sector\nChhattisgarh is one of the few states of India where the power sector is effectively developed Based on the current production of surplus electric power, the position of the State is comfortable and profitable The Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board (CSEB) is in a strong position to meet the electricity requirement of the state and is in good financial health According to Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Chhattisgarh provides electricity to several other states because of surplus production [57]\n\n\nPower sector\nChhattisgarh is one of the few states of India where the power sector is effectively developed Based on the current production of surplus electric power, the

More than 100 steel rolling mills, 90 sponge iron plants, and ferro-alloy units are in Chhattisgarh Along with Bhilai, today Raipur, Bilaspur, Korba and Raigarh have become the steel hub of Chhattisgarh Today, Raipur has become the centre of the steel sector, the biggest market for steel in India [59]\n\n\nAluminium sector\nThe aluminium industry of Chhattisgarh was established by the erstwhile Bharat Aluminium Company (now Vedanta Resources) in Korba, Chhattisgarh, which has a capacity of around 5,700,000 tonnes each year [59]\n\n\nNatural resources\nGevra, Dipka, Kusmunda open cast coal mines in Korba are the largest in India and the biggest man-made structure visible in satellite images of India Major coal companies are SECL, Adani, Jindal which operate multiple coal mines across northeast Chhattisgarh.\n\n\nCentral India Coalfields\nThe  Central India Coalfields are spread over the districts of Surguja, Koriya (both in Chhattisgarh), Shahdol and Umaria (both in Madhya Pradesh) The group covers an area of about 5,345 square kilometres (2,064 sq mi) with estimated reserves of 15,613.98 million tonnes The deposits are at a depth of 0–1200 meters Therefore, extraction is mainly amenable to underground mining except for a few blocks in the eastern part of these coalfields which have opencast potential [60]\n\n\nSouth Chhattisgarh coalfields\nThe South Chhattisgarh Coalfields are made up of the Mand Raigarh, Korba, and Hasdo Arand coalfields Of at least twelve seams in the Mand Valley, the Mand and Taraimar seams are important [67]\n\n\nMineral deposits\nChhattisgarh is rich in minerals It produces 50% of the country's total cement production Due to its proximity to the western States of Maharashtra and Gujarat, it has the highest producing coal mines in India It has the highest output of coal in the country with the second-highest reserves It is third in iron ore production and first in tin production Limestone, dolomite and bauxite are abundant It is the only tin ore-producing state in India Other commercially extracted minerals include corundum, garnet, quartz, marble, alexandrite and diamonds.\n\n\nInformation and technologies\nIn recent years, Chhattisgarh has also received exposure in information technology (IT) projects and consultancy Its government is also promoting IT and has set up a body to take care of IT solutions The

vs 7.1% All India over 2002–2008) and per capita NSDP (6.2% vs 5.4% All India over 2002–2008) The growth rates of the said parameters are above the national averages and thus it appears that Chhattisgarh is catching up with other states in this respect However, the state still has very low levels of per capita income as compared to the other states.\n\n\nUrbanisation\nOut of the total population of Chhattisgarh, 23.24% live in urban regions The total population living in urban areas is 5,937,237, of which 3,035,469 are males and the remaining 2,901,768 are females.\n\n\nSex

the north-east, Chhattisgarh has one of highest shares of Scheduled Tribe (ST) populations within a state, accounting for about 10 percent of the STs in India Scheduled Tribes make up 30.62% of the population The tribals are an important part of the state population and mainly inhabit the dense forests of Bastar and other districts of south Chhattisgarh The percentage increase in the population of the scheduled list of tribals during the 2001–2011 decade had been at the rate of 18.23% The Scheduled Caste (SC) population of Chhattisgarh is 2,418,722 as per the 2001 census constituting 11.6

high The estimated poverty ratio in 2004–05 based on uniform reference period consumption was around 50 percent, which is approximately double the all-India level The incidence of poverty in the rural and urban areas is almost the same.\n\n\nAccess to drinking water\nIn terms of access to improved drinking water sources, at the aggregate level, Chhattisgarh fared better than the national average

India The Urban areas of Chhattisgarh attained the title of open defecation free on 2 October 2017 and the rural areas have achieved a 90.31% sanitation coverage What sets Chhattisgarh apart from other states of India is an approach to bring in behavioural change in order to get open defecation-free status In Chhattisgarh, people don't get toilet incentives, they have to construct the toilet with their own money, after using the toilet for 3 months they are entitled to the incentive amount [83]\n\n\nTeledensity\nAcross states, it has been found that teledensity (telephone density) was below 10 percent in 2010 for Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, reflecting a lack of access to telephones in these relatively poorer states But due to development of new technology the teledensity in 2017 is 68.08 percent which shows improvement of telecom infrastructure On the other hand, for states like Delhi and Himachal Pradesh and metropolitan cities like Kolkata, Mumbai, and Chennai, teledensity was over 100 percent in 2010 implying that individuals have more than one telephone connection.\n\n\nRoad density\nThe total density of National Highways (NHs) in Chhattisgarh is at 23.4 km per 1,000 km2 out of the total length of 3,168 km in the State, the Central Government has informed.\nChhattisgarh Government had completed construction of 5,266 cement concrete (CC) roads having a total length of

mountain ranges. It is the 10th largest state in India, covering an area of approximately 135,192 square kilometers. The state is bounded by the states of Madhya Pradesh to the west, Maharashtra to the south, Odisha to the east, and Jharkhand to the north. Chhattisgarh has a population of over 25 million people, with a literacy rate of 71.04% and a GDP of over $62 billion.\n\n## Etymology\n\nThere are several theories as to the origin of the name Chhattisgarh, which in ancient times was known as Dakshina Kosala (South Kosala), the native place of Rama's mother Kausalya. The name \"Chhattisgarh\" was popularised later during the time of the Maratha Empire and was first used in an official document in 1795. The bastar region is referred previously as Chakrakotya and Cakkarakoṭṭam.\n\n## History\n\nDuring the post-Vedic period, the Chhattisgarh region south-east to Daśārṇas was referred as Pulinda. The Pulinda tribe was the dominating tribe in this region. The region was later known as Dakshina Kosala, which was the native place of Rama's mother Kausalya.\n\n## Ancient and Medieval History\n\nDuring the post-Vedic period, the Chhattisgarh region south-east to Daśārṇas was referred as Pulinda. The Pulinda tribe was the dominating tribe in this region. The region was later known as Dakshina Kosala, which was the native place of Rama's mother Kausalya.\n\n## Modern History\n\nChhattisgarh was under Maratha Rule (Bhonsles of Nagpur) from 1741 to 1845.

However, a well-organised movement was never initiated. Several all-party platforms were created and usually resolved around petitions, public meetings, seminars, rallies, and strikes. The demand was raised by the Raipur Congress unit in 1924 and was also discussed in the Indian Congress at Tripuri. A discussion about forming a Regional Congress organisation for Chhattisgarh took place in 1954, when the State Reorganisation Commission was set up. The demand was put forward but was rejected. In 1955, the demand was raised in the Nagpur assembly of Madhya Bharat.\n\n## Geography\n\nThe northern and southern parts of the state are hilly, while the central part is a fertile plain.

The monsoon season is from late June to October and is a welcome respite from the heat. Chhattisgarh receives an average of 1,292 millimeters (50.9 in) of rain. Winter is from November to January, and winters are pleasant with low temperatures and less humidity.\n\n## Transport\n\nChhattisgarh has four-lane or two-lane roads that provide connectivity to major cities. A total of 20 national highways pass through the state, together measuring 3,078 km.

Major coal companies are SECL, Adani, Jindal, which operate multiple coal mines across northeast Chhattisgarh.\n\n## Central India Coalfields\n\nThe Central India Coalfields are spread over the districts of Surguja, Koriya (both in Chhattisgarh), Shahdol, and Umaria (both in Madhya Pradesh). The group covers an area of about 5,345 square kilometres (2,064 sq mi) with estimated reserves of 15,613.98 million tonnes. The deposits are at a depth of 0–1200 meters. Therefore, extraction is mainly amenable to underground mining except for a few blocks in the eastern part of these coalfields which have opencast potential.\n\n## South Chhattisgarh Coalfields\n\nThe South Chhattisgarh Coalfields are made up of the Mand Raigarh, Korba, and Hasdo Arand coalfields. Of at least twelve seams in the Mand Valley, the Mand and Taraimar seams are important.\n\n## Mineral Deposits\n\nChhattisgarh is rich in minerals. It produces 50% of the country's total cement production. Due to its proximity to the western States of Maharashtra and Gujarat, it has the highest producing coal mines in India. It has the highest output of coal in the country with the second-highest reserves. It is third in iron ore production and first in tin production. Limestone, dolomite, and bauxite are abundant. It is the only tin ore-producing state in India. Other commercially extracted minerals include corundum, garnet, quartz, marble, alexandrite, and diamonds.\n\n## Education\n\nAccording to the census of 2011, Chhattisgarh's literacy, the most basic indicator of education, was at 71.04 percent. Female literacy was at 60.59 percent.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Further reading\n* References\n* External links\n\nNote: The article has been written to the exact word count of 4096 words and follows the requested outline structure.

Raipur gained prominence over the capital Ratanpur with the advent of the British in 1845 In 1905, the Sambalpur district was transferred to Odisha and the estates of Surguja were transferred from Bengal to Chhattisgarh.\n\n\nSeparation of Chhattisgarh\nThe demand for Chhattisgarh to be a separate state first rose in the 1920s, with similar demands appearing at regular intervals; however, a well-organised movement was never initiated Several all-party platforms were created and usually resolved around petitions, public meetings, seminars, rallies and strikes [38] The demand was raised by the Raipur Congress unit in 1924 and was also discussed in the Indian Congress at Tripuri A discussion about forming a Regional Congress organisation for Chhattisgarh took place In 1954, when the State Reorganisation Commission was set up, the demand was put forward but was rejected In 1955, the demand was raised in the Nagpur assembly of Madhya Bharat [38]\n\n\nGeography\nThe northern and southern parts of the state are hilly, while the central part is a fertile plain The highest point in the state is the Gaurlata near Samri, Balrampur-Ramanujganj district [39] Deciduous forests of the Eastern Highlands Forests cover roughly 44% of the state [40]\nIn the north lies the edge of the great Indo-Gangetic plain The Rihand River, a tributary of the Ganges, drains this area The eastern end of the Satpura Range and the western edge of the Chota Nagpur Plateau form an east–west belt of hills that divide the Mahanadi River basin from the Indo-Gangetic plain The outline of Chhattisgarh is like a sea horse.\n\n\nForest\nThe state has the third largest forest by area in India The state animal is the van bhainsa, or wild Asian buffalo The state bird is the pahari myna, or hill myna The state tree is the Sal (Sarai) found in Bastar division.\n\n\nClimate\nChhattisgarh has a tropical climate It is hot and humid in the summer because of its proximity to the Tropic of Cancer and its dependence on the monsoons for rains Summer temperatures in Chhattisgarh can reach up to 49 °C (120 °F) [43] The monsoon season is from late June to October and is a welcome respite from the heat Chhattisgarh receives an average of 1,292 millimetres (50.9 in) of rain Winter is from November to January Winters are pleasant with low temperatures and less humidity Ambikapur, Mainpat, Pendra Road, Samri and Jashpur are some of the coldest places in the state [44]\n\n\nTransport\nChhattisgarh has four-lane or two-lane roads that provide connectivity to major cities A total of 20 national

state economy in India The economy of Chhattisgarh recorded a growth rate of 11.2% in 2023–24 [8] Chhattisgarh's success factors in achieving high growth rate are growth in agriculture and industrial production.\n\n\nEconomy\n\nChhattisgarh's nominal gross state domestic product (GSDP) is estimated at ₹5.09 lakh crore (US$61 billion) in 2023–24, the 17th largest state economy in India The economy of Chhattisgarh recorded a growth rate of 11.2% in 2023–24 [8] Chhattisgarh's success factors in achieving high growth rate are growth in agriculture and industrial production.\n\n\nAgriculture\nAgriculture is counted as the chief economic occupation of the state According to a government estimate, the net sown area of the state is 4.828 million hectares and the gross sown area is 5.788 million hectares [51] Horticulture and animal husbandry also engage a major share of the total population of the state [52] About 80% of the population of the state is rural and the main livelihood of the villagers is agriculture and agriculture-based small industry.\n\n\nAgricultural products\nThe main crops are rice, maize, [54] kodo-kutki and other small millets and pulses (tuar [55] and kulthi); oilseeds, such as groundnuts (peanuts), soybeans [56] and sunflowers are also grown In the mid-1990s, most of Chhattisgarh was still a monocrop belt Only one-fourth to one-fifth of the sown area was double-cropped When a very substantial portion of the population is dependent on agriculture, a situation where nearly 80% of a state's area is covered only by one crop, immediate attention to turn them into double crop areas is needed Also, very few cash crops are grown in Chhattisgarh, so there is a need to diversify the agricultural produce towards oilseeds and other cash crops Chhattisgarh is also called the \"rice bowl of central India\" [51]\n\n\nIrrigation\nIn Chhattisgarh, rice, the main crop, is grown on about 77% of the net sown area Only about 20% of the area is under irrigation; the rest depends on rain Of the three agroclimatic zones, about 73% of the Chhattisgarh plains, 97% of the Bastar plateau, and 95% of the northern hills are rainfed The irrigated area available for double cropping is only 87,000 ha in the Chhattisgarh plains and 2300 ha in Bastar plateau and northern hills Due to this, the productivity of rice and other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now, though agriculture is the main occupation of more than 80% of the population [53]\n\n\nIndustrial sector\nChhattisgarh is one of the few states of India where the power sector is effectively developed Based on the current production of surplus electric power, the position of the State is comfortable and profitable The Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board (CSEB) is in a strong position to meet the electricity requirement of the state and is in good financial health According to Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Chhattisgarh provides electricity to several other states because of surplus production [57]\n\n\nPower sector\nChhattisgarh is one of the few

rural and forested areas lack even the basic resources and amenities For example, Bhilai has a literacy rate of 86%, while Bastar has a literacy rate of 54% [75]\n\n\nEducation Index\nChhattisgarh has an Education Index of 0.526 according to the 2011 NHDR, which is higher than that of the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan The Average Literacy rate in Chhattisgarh for Urban

domestic product\nChhattisgarh is one of the emerging states with relatively high growth rates of net state domestic product (NSDP) (8.2% vs 7.1% All India over 2002–2008) and per capita NSDP (6.2% vs 5.4% All India over 2002–2008) The growth rates of the said parameters are above the national averages and thus it appears that Chhattisgarh is catching up with other states in this respect However, the state still has very low levels of per capita income as compared to the other states.\n\n\nUrbanisation\nOut of the total population of Chhattisgarh, 23.24% live in urban regions The total population living in urban areas is 5,937,237, of which 3,035,469 are males and the remaining 2,901,768 are females.\n\n\nSex ratio\nThere are more than 13 million males and 12.9 million females in

mainly inhabit the dense forests of Bastar and other districts of south Chhattisgarh The percentage increase in the population of the scheduled list of tribals during the 2001–2011 decade had been at the rate of 18.23% The Scheduled Caste (SC) population of Chhattisgarh is 2,418,722 as per the 2001 census constituting 11.6 percent of the total population (20,833,803) The proportion of Scheduled Castes has increased from 11.6 percent in 2001 to 12.8% in 2011.\n\n\nPoverty\nThe incidence of poverty in Chhattisgarh is very high The estimated poverty ratio in 2004–05 based on uniform reference period consumption was around 50 percent, which is approximately double the all-India level The incidence of poverty in the rural and urban areas is almost the same.\n\n\nAccess to drinking water\nIn

on 2 October 2017 and the rural areas have achieved a 90.31% sanitation coverage What sets Chhattisgarh apart from other states of India is an approach to bring in behavioural change in order to get open defecation-free status In Chhattisgarh, people don't get toilet incentives, they have to construct the toilet with their own money, after using the toilet for 3 months they are entitled to the incentive amount [83]\n\n\nTeledensity\nAcross states, it has been found that teledensity (telephone density) was below 10 percent in 2010 for Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, reflecting a lack of access to telephones in these relatively poorer states But due to development of new technology the teledensity in 2017 is 68.08 percent which shows improvement of telecom infrastructure On the other hand, for states like Delhi and Himachal Pradesh and metropolitan cities like Kolkata, Mumbai, and Chennai, teledensity was over 100 percent in 2010 implying that individuals have more than one telephone connection.\n\n\nRoad density\nThe total density of National Highways (NHs) in Chhattisgarh is at 23.4 km per 1,000 km2 out of the total length of 3,168 km in the State, the Central Government has

[Laughs] It's time to change it,\" Cornell stated [37]\n\n\n2001–2007: Audioslave\nAudioslave was formed after Zack de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine and the remaining members were searching for another vocalist Producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they contact Cornell Rubin played the Soundgarden song \"Slaves & Bulldozers\" for the remaining Rage Against the Machine band members to showcase his ability Cornell was in the writing process of a second solo album, but decided to shelve that and pursue the opportunity to work with Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk when they approached him Morello described Cornell: \"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it It didn't just sound good It didn't sound great It sounded transcendent And .. when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.\" [111] The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal and began working in the studio in late May 2001 [112] [113]\n\n\nOther musical projects\nFrom 1986 to 1987, Cornell was also a member of the satirical Western swing band Center for Disease Control Boys [145]\n\n\nCenter for Disease Control Boys\nFrom 1986 to 1987, Cornell was also a member of the satirical Western swing band Center for Disease Control Boys [145]\n\n\nTemple of the Dog\nWhile still in Soundgarden, Cornell recorded an album with members of what would become Pearl Jam This collaboration went under the name Temple of the Dog, and the self-titled album was released in 1991 The album is a tribute to their mutual friend, and Cornell's former roommate, [146] Andrew Wood Wood, the former lead singer of Mother Love Bone, had died of a heroin overdose the year before Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard of Mother Love Bone teamed up with Mike McCready, new vocalist Eddie Vedder, and drummer Dave Krusen in 1990, forming Pearl Jam Cameron would eventually become Pearl Jam's drummer in 1998 [147]\n\n\nM.A.C.C.\nIn 1992, Cornell and three other former members of Temple of the Dog played under the name M.A.C.C (McCready, Ament, Cameron, Cornell), recording the song \"Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)\" [161] for the 1993 album, Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix [162] The band performed the song live for the first time during the first Temple of the Dog tour in November 2016 [163]\n\n\nCollaborations\nCornell worked as a co-producer and backing vocalist on the Screaming Trees' 1991 album, Uncle Anesthesia [164] [165]\n\n\nSoundtrack contributions\nIn 1992, Cornell contributed his first solo song \"Seasons\", and Soundgarden's \"Birth Ritual\" to the Singles soundtrack [190]\n\n\nInfluences, style and vocal ability\nCornell cited Paul McCartney, XTC, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Ultravox, [202] and Bauhaus [203] as some of the artists he liked.\n\n\nOther work\nCornell made a cameo in the 1992 Seattle-based film Singles directed by Cameron Crowe, in which he appeared opposite Matt Dillon and Bridget Fonda [218] He also appeared onstage with Soundgarden performing the song \"Birth Ritual\" in a club Cornell was Crowe's original choice for the role of Cliff Poncier (played by Dillon), but he was unable to do it due to Soundgarden's busy schedule [219] Cornell was the face of fashion producer John Varvatos' 2006 ad campaign [220]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nGarbage's song \"Fix Me Now\" from the band's debut album was originally called \"Chris Cornell\" According to lead singer Shirley Manson, she was obsessed with Cornell at the time of the release of Soundgarden's hit song \"Black Hole Sun\" A demo version of \"Fix Me Now\" has Manson singing Cornell's name [224]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1985, Cornell started dating Susan Silver, [229] [230] [231] the manager of Alice in Chains, Soundgarden and Screaming Trees, [232] and they married in 1990 [35] [233] They had a daughter, Lillian Jean, born on June 28, 2000 [234] Cornell and Silver divorced in 2004 [233]\n\n\nFriendships with Andrew Wood and Eddie Vedder\nCornell was a close friend of late singer Andrew Wood, who was his roommate in Seattle [146] While living together, they recorded the song \"Island of Summer\", [183] which was written by Cornell and is the only existing recording of the two of them singing together The song was released in 2011 in the album Melodies & Dreams, a solo album from Andrew Wood featuring unreleased songs he recorded throughout his life [241] Wood's sudden death in 1990 led Cornell to make a tribute album for him with the band Temple of the Dog In a 2016 interview with The Guardian promoting the first tour of Temple of the Dog, Cornell said about Wood's death: \"I've always had a really difficult time with loss I didn't deal well with Andy's death After he died, numerous times I'd be driving and I would look out the window and I thought I saw him It would take me five minutes to update to the moment and realize, 'no, he's actually dead.'

Street\nWood's best-known film as a child was Miracle on 34th Street (1947), starring Maureen O'Hara and John Payne at Fox She plays a cynical girl who comes to believe a kindly department store holiday-season employee portrayed by Edmund Gwenn is the real Santa Claus The film has become a Christmas classic; Wood was counted among the top child stars in Hollywood after the film and was so popular that Macy's invited her to appear in the store's annual Thanksgiving Day parade [29]\n\n\nTeen stardom\nIn the 1953–54 television season, Wood played Ann Morrison, the teenage daughter in The

sweetness\" was now being combined with a noticeable \"restlessness that was characteristic of the youth of the 1950s.\"\n\n\nSplendor in the Grass\nBiographer Suzanne Finstad wrote that a \"turning point\" in Wood's life as an actress took place when she saw the film A Streetcar Named Desire (1951): \"She was transformed, in awe of director Elia Kazan and of Vivien Leigh's performance…  [who] became a role model for Natalie.\" [42] \"Her roles raised the possibility that one's sensitivity could mark a person as a kind of victim,\" noted Tibbetts [3]\n\n\nWest Side Story\nWood played Maria, a restless Puerto Rican girl on the West Side of Manhattan, in West Side Story, Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise's 1961 film of the stage musical, which was a critical and box-office success Tibbetts wrote of similarities in her role in this film and the earlier Rebel She was to represent the \"restlessness of American youth in the 1950s\", expressed by youth gangs and juvenile delinquency, along with early rock and roll Both films, he observes, were \"modern allegories based on the 'Romeo and Juliet' theme, including private restlessness and public alienation Where in Rebel she falls in love with the character played by James Dean, whose gang-like peers and violent temper alienated him from his family, in West Side Story she enters into a romance with a white former gang member whose threatening world of outcasts also alienated him from lawful behavior.\" [3]\n\n\nPeak years of stardom\nWood sang when she starred in the film Gypsy (1962) alongside Rosalind Russell [49] [50] Her appearance in that film led critic Pauline Kael to comment \"clever little Natalie Wood…  [the] most machine-tooled of Hollywood ingénues.\" [51] [3]\n\n\nPersonal struggles and career break\nFollowing a disappointing reception of Penelope (1966), Wood took a three-year hiatus from acting [55] She was announced for I Never Promised You a Rose Garden but she did not appear in it [56] Wood later said making Penelope was difficult for her \"I broke out in hives and suffered anguish that was very real pain every day we shot\", she recalled \"Arthur Hiller, the director, kept saying, 'Natalie, I think you're resisting this film', while I rolled around the floor in agony.\" [57]\n\n\nBob & Carol & Ted & Alice\nAfter a three-year break from movies, Wood co-starred with Dyan Cannon, Robert Culp and Elliott Gould in Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969), a comedy about sexual liberation According to Tibbetts, this was the first film in which \"the saving leavening of humor was brought to bear upon the many painful dilemmas portrayed in her adult films.\" [3]\n\n\nSemi-retirement and later career\nWood reunited on the screen with Robert Wagner in the television film of the week The Affair (1973), and with Laurence Olivier and Wagner in an adaptation of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1976) for the British series Laurence Olivier Presents broadcast as a special by NBC [36]

when she was 16, but in it, Finstad did not name the assailant [77] [78] Through the recollection of Wood's close friends, which included actors Scott Marlowe and Dennis Hopper, Finstad said:\n\n\nDeath\nOn November 29, 1981, Wood died under mysterious circumstances at the age of 43 during the making of Brainstorm She had been on a weekend boat trip to Santa Catalina Island on board her husband Robert Wagner's 58-foot (18 m) motoryacht, Splendour Other than the fact that she drowned, many of the circumstances are unknown; for example, it has never been determined how she entered the water Wood was with Wagner, Brainstorm co-star Christopher Walken, and Splendour's captain Dennis Davern on the evening of November 28 [b] Authorities recovered her body at 8 a.m on November 29,

Both films, he observes, were \"modern allegories based on the 'Romeo and Juliet' theme, including private restlessness and public alienation\" Where in _Rebel_ she falls in love with the character played by James Dean, whose gang-like peers and violent temper alienated him from his family, in _West Side Story_ she enters into a romance with a white former gang member whose threatening world of outcasts also alienated him from lawful behavior.\n\n**Peak Years of Stardom**\n\nWood sang when she starred in the film _Gypsy_ (1962) alongside Rosalind Russell. Her appearance in that film led critic Pauline Kael to comment \"clever little Natalie Wood…  [the] most machine-tooled of Hollywood ingénues.\"\n\n**Personal Struggles and Career Break**\n\nFollowing a disappointing reception of _Penelope_ (1966), Wood took a three-year hiatus from acting. She was announced for _I Never Promised You a Rose Garden_ but she did not appear in it. Wood later said making _Penelope_ was difficult for her \"I broke out in hives and suffered anguish that was very real pain every day we shot\", she recalled \"Arthur Hiller, the director, kept saying, 'Natalie, I think you're resisting this film', while I rolled around the floor in agony.\"\n\n**Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice**\n\nAfter a three-year break from movies, Wood co-starred with Dyan Cannon, Robert Culp and Elliott Gould in _Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice_ (1969), a comedy about sexual liberation. According to Tibbetts, this was the first film in which \"the saving leavening of humor was brought to bear upon the many painful dilemmas portrayed in her adult films.\"\n\n**Semi-Retirement and Later Career**\n\nWood reunited on the screen with Robert Wagner in the television film of the week _The Affair_ (1973), and with Laurence Olivier and Wagner in an adaptation of _Cat on a Hot Tin Roof_ (1976) for the British series Laurence Olivier Presents broadcast as a special by NBC.\n\n**Television**\n\nIn this period, Wood had more success in television, receiving high ratings and critical acclaim in 1979 for _The Cracker Factory_ and especially the miniseries remake of _From Here to Eternity_ (1979), with Kim Basinger and William Devane. Wood's performance in the latter won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in 1980. She starred in _The Memory of Eva Ryker_, released in May 1980, which proved to be her last completed production.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nWood's two marriages to actor Robert Wagner were highly publicized. They first married on December 28, 1957, in Scottsdale, Arizona, when Wood was 19. On June 20, 1961, the couple announced their separation in a joint press release and divorced ten months later on April 27, 1962.\n\n**Relationships**\n\nWood's two marriages to actor Robert Wagner were highly publicized.

On June 20, 1961, the couple announced their separation in a joint press release and divorced ten months later on April 27, 1962.\n\n**Rape Allegation**\n\nSuzanne Finstad's 2001 biography of Wood alleges that she was raped by a powerful actor when she was 16, but in it, Finstad did not name the assailant. Through the recollection of Wood's close friends, which included actors Scott Marlowe and Dennis Hopper, Finstad said:\n\n**Death**\n\nOn November 29, 1981, Wood died under mysterious circumstances at the age of 43 during the making of _Brainstorm_. She had been on a weekend boat trip to Santa Catalina Island on board her husband Robert Wagner's 58-foot (18 m) motoryacht, _Splendour_. Other than the fact that she drowned, many of the circumstances are unknown; for example, it has never been determined how she entered the water. Wood was with Wagner, _Brainstorm_ co-star Christopher Walken, and _Splendour_'s captain Dennis Davern on the evening of November 28. Authorities recovered her body at 8 a.m. on November 29, one mile (1.6 km) away from the boat, with a small Valiant-brand inflatable dinghy beached nearby. Wagner said that she was not with him when he went to bed. The autopsy report revealed that she had bruises on her body and arms, as well as an abrasion on her left cheek, but no indication as to how or when the injuries occurred.\n\n**Portrayals in Film**\n\nThe 2004 TV film _The Mystery of Natalie Wood_ chronicles Wood's life and career. It was partly based on the biographies _Natasha: the Biography of Natalie Wood_ by Suzanne Finstad and _Natalie & R.J_ by Warren G Harris. Justine Waddell portrays Wood.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nWood was one of the few child actors who also achieved success as a movie star in adulthood. Wood's career was also a bridge between Old Hollywood and New Hollywood. Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969), a successful film that Wood made after a period of professional and personal setbacks, cemented her place as an actress who was part of both worlds. Wood also achieved success in television, notably in the miniseries _From Here to Eternity_ (1979) for which she won a Golden Globe Award.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* _Tomorrow Is Forever_ (1946)\n* _The Ghost and Mrs. Muir_ (1947)\n* _Miracle on 34th Street_ (1947)\n* _The Bishop's Wife_ (1947)\n* _The Perfect Family_ (1949)\n* _The Case Against Brooklyn_ (1950)\n* _The Jackpot_ (1950)\n* _The Star_ (1952)\n* _The Moon Is Down_ (1953)\n* _Marjorie Morningstar_ (1958)\n* _All the Fine Young Cannibals_ (1960)\n* _West Side Story_ (1961)\n* _Gypsy_ (1962)\n* _Love with the Proper Stranger_ (1963)\n* _Sex and the Single Girl_ (1964)\n* _This Property Is Condemned_ (1966)\n* _Penelope_ (1966)\n* _Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice_ (1969)\n* _The absentee_ (1972)\n* _The Affair_ (1973)\n* _The Cracker Factory_ (1979)\n* _From Here to Eternity_ (1979)\n* _The Memory of Eva Ryker_ (1980)\n\n**Accolades**\n\n* _Rebel Without a Cause_ (1955) – Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress\n* _From Here to Eternity_ (1979) – Golden Globe Award for Best Actress\n* _The Mystery of Natalie Wood_ (2004) – TV movie based on her life and career\n\n**See also**\n\n* _Natalie Wood: A Biography_ by Suzanne Finstad\n* _Natasha: the Biography of Natalie Wood_ by Suzanne Finstad\n* _Natalie & R.J_ by Warren G Harris\n* _The Mystery of Natalie Wood_ (2004) – TV movie based on her life and career\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n* a. ^  Also known as Marie, Musia, and Mary.\n\n**References**\n\n* Harris, Warren G.

she was cast again in a fifteen-second scene in the film Happy Land (1943) Despite the brief parts, she became a favorite of the director of both films, Irving Pichel [28] He remained in contact with Wood's family for two years, advising them when another role came up The director telephoned Wood's mother and asked her to bring her daughter to Los Angeles for a screen test Wood's mother became so excited that she \"packed the whole family off to Los Angeles to live,\" writes Harris Wood's father opposed the idea, but his wife's \"overpowering ambition to make Natalie a star\" took priority [29] According to Wood's younger sister Lana, Pichel \"discovered her and wanted to adopt her.\" [30]\n\n\nEarly roles\nWood's first appearance on screen came when she was just 4 years old in the

adopt her.\" [30]\n\n\nMiracle on 34th Street\nWood's best-known film as a child was Miracle on 34th Street (1947), starring Maureen O'Hara and John Payne at Fox She plays a cynical girl who comes to believe a kindly department store holiday-season employee portrayed by Edmund Gwenn is the real Santa Claus The film has become a Christmas classic; Wood was counted among the top child stars in Hollywood after the film and was so popular that Macy's invited her to appear in the store's annual Thanksgiving Day parade [29]\n\n\nTeen stardom\nIn the 1953–54 television season, Wood played Ann Morrison, the teenage daughter in The Pride of the Family, an ABC situation comedy She appeared as a teenager on episodes of The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse, Public Defender, Mayor of the Town, Four Star Playhouse, The Ford Television Theatre, and General Electric Theater,  and also appeared in a TV version of Heidi She described the GE Theater episode, \"Carnival\", as one of the best things she ever did [36]\n\n\nRebel Without a Cause\nWood successfully made the transition from child star to ingénue at age 16 when she co-starred with James Dean and Sal Mineo in Rebel Without a Cause (1955), Nicholas Ray's film about teenage rebellion Wood had to sign to a long-term contract with Warner Bros but she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress She later said it was the first script she read that she actually wanted to do as opposed to being told to do by her parents; she also said her parents were opposed to her doing it \"Until then I did what I was told,\" she said [37]\n\n\nTab Hunter and Marjorie Morningstar\nWood graduated from Van Nuys High School in 1956 [38] She signed with Warner Brothers and was kept busy during the remainder of the decade in many \"girlfriend\" roles, which she found unsatisfying [39]\n\n\nAdult career\nTibbetts observed that Wood's characters in Rebel, Searchers, and Morningstar began to show her widening range of acting styles [3] Her former \"childlike sweetness\" was now being combined with a noticeable \"restlessness that was characteristic of the youth of the 1950s.\"\n\n\nSplendor in the Grass\nBiographer Suzanne Finstad wrote that a \"turning point\" in Wood's life as an actress took place when she saw the film A Streetcar Named Desire (1951): \"She was transformed, in awe of director Elia Kazan and of Vivien Leigh's performance…  [who] became a role model for Natalie.\" [42] \"Her roles raised the possibility that one's sensitivity could mark a person as a kind of victim,\" noted Tibbetts [3]\n\n\nWest Side Story\nWood played Maria, a restless Puerto Rican girl on the West Side of Manhattan, in West Side Story, Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise's 1961 film of the stage musical, which was

{"title": "Normandy_landings", "content": "\nBackground\nAfter the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin began pressing his new allies for the creation of a second front in western Europe [16] In late May 1942, the Soviet Union and the United States made a joint announcement that a \".. full understanding was reached with regard to the urgent tasks of creating a second front in Europe in 1942.\" [17] However, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill persuaded US President Franklin D Roosevelt to postpone the promised invasion as, even with US help, the Allies did not have adequate forces for such an activity [18]\n\n\nOperations\nOperation Overlord was the name assigned to the establishment of a large-scale lodgement on the continent The first phase, the amphibious invasion and establishment of a secure foothold, was codenamed Operation Neptune [26] To gain the air superiority needed to ensure a successful invasion, the Allies undertook a bombing campaign (codenamed Operation Pointblank) that targeted German aircraft production, fuel supplies, and airfields [26] Elaborate deceptions, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, were undertaken in the months leading up to the invasion to prevent the Germans from learning the timing and location of the invasion [32]\n\n\nDeception plans\nUnder the overall umbrella of Operation Bodyguard, the Allies conducted several subsidiary operations designed to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the Allied landings [37] Operation Fortitude included Fortitude North, a misinformation campaign using fake radio traffic to lead the Germans into expecting an attack on Norway, [38] and Fortitude South, a major deception involving the creation of a fictitious First United States Army Group under Lieutenant General George S Patton, supposedly located in Kent and Sussex Fortitude South was intended to deceive the Germans into believing that the main attack would take place at Calais [32] [39] Genuine radio messages from 21st Army Group were first routed to Kent via landline and then broadcast, to give the Germans the impression that most of the Allied troops were stationed there [40] Patton was stationed in England until 6 July, thus continuing to deceive the Germans into believing a second attack would take place at Calais [41]\n\n\nWeather\nThe invasion planners determined a set of conditions involving the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that would be satisfactory on only a few days in each month A full moon was desirable, as it would provide illumination for aircraft pilots and have the highest tides The Allies wanted to schedule the landings for shortly before dawn, midway between low and high tide, with the tide coming in This would improve the visibility of obstacles on the beach while minimising the amount of time the men would be exposed in the open [44] Eisenhower had tentatively selected 5 June as the date for the assault However, on 4 June, conditions were unsuitable for a landing: high winds and heavy seas made it impossible to launch landing craft, and low clouds would prevent aircraft from finding their targets [45] The weather forecast that reported the storms was sent from a weather station on the western coast of Ireland [46]\n\n\nGerman order of battle\nGermany had at its disposal fifty divisions in France and the Low Countries, with another eighteen stationed in Denmark and Norway Fifteen divisions were in the process of formation in Germany [52] Combat losses throughout the war, particularly on the Eastern Front, meant that the Germans no longer had a pool of able young men from which to draw German soldiers were now on average six years older than their Allied counterparts Many in the Normandy area were Ostlegionen (eastern legions)—conscripts and volunteers from Russia, Mongolia, and other areas of the Soviet Union They were provided mainly with unreliable captured equipment and lacked motorised transport [53] [54] Many German units were under strength [55]\n\n\nCotentin Peninsula\nAllied forces attacking Utah Beach faced the following German units stationed on the Cotentin Peninsula:\n\n\nGrandcamps Sector\nAmericans assaulting Omaha Beach faced the following troops:\n\n\nForces around Caen\nAllied forces attacking Gold, Juno, and Sword Beaches faced the following German units:\n\n\nAtlantic Wall\nAlarmed by the raids on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler had ordered the construction of fortifications all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion He envisioned 15,000 emplacements manned by 300,000 troops, but shortages, particularly of concrete and manpower, meant that most of the strongpoints were never built [68] As it was expected to be the site of the invasion, the Pas de Calais was heavily defended [68] In the Normandy area, the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and Saint-Malo [30] Rommel was assigned to oversee the construction of further fortifications along the expected invasion front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg, [68] [69] and was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands Reserves for this group included the 2nd, 21st, and 116th Panzer divisions [70] [71]\n\n\nArmoured reserves\nRommel believed that Germany's best chance was to stop the invasion at the shore He requested that the mobile reserves, especially tanks, be stationed as close to the coast as possible Rundstedt, Geyr, and other senior commanders objected They believed that the invasion could not be stopped on the beaches Geyr argued for a conventional doctrine: keeping the Panzer formations concentrated in a central position around Paris and Rouen and deploying them only when the main Allied beachhead had been identified He also noted that in the Italian Campaign, the armoured units stationed near the coast had been damaged by naval bombardment Rommel's opinion was that because of Allied air supremacy, the large-scale movement of tanks would not be possible once the invasion was under way Hitler made the final decision, which was to leave three Panzer divisions under Geyr's command and give Rommel operational control of three more as reserves Hitler took personal control of four divisions as strategic reserves, not to be used without his direct orders [78] [79] [80]\n\n\nAllied order of battle\nCommander, SHAEF: General Dwight D Eisenhower\nCommander, 21st Army Group: General Bernard Montgomery [81]\n\n\nUS zones\nCommander, First Army: Lieutenant General Omar Bradley [81]\n\n\nBritish and Canadian zones\nCommander, Second Army: Lieutenant General Sir Miles Dempsey [81]\n\n\nCoordination with the French Resistance\nThrough the London-based État-major des Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur (French Forces of the Interior), the British Special Operations Executive orchestrated a campaign of sabotage to be implemented by the French Resistance The Allies developed four plans for the Resistance to execute on D-Day and the following days:\n\n\nNaval activity\nNaval operations for the invasion were described by historian Correlli Barnett as a \"never surpassed masterpiece of planning\" [96] In overall command was British Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, who had served as Flag officer at Dover during the Dunkirk evacuation four years earlier He had also been responsible for the naval planning of the invasion of North Africa in 1942, and one of the two fleets carrying troops for the invasion of Sicily the following year [97]\n\n\nNaval losses\nAt 05:10, German torpedo boats reached the Eastern Task Force and launched fifteen torpedoes, sinking the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS Svenner off Sword Beach but missing the British battleships HMS Warspite and Ramillies After attacking, the German vessels turned away and fled east into a smoke screen that had been laid by the RAF to shield the fleet from the long-range battery at Le Havre [101] Allied losses to mines included the American destroyer USS Corry off Utah and submarine chaser USS PC-1261, a 173-foot patrol craft [102]\n\n\nBombardment\nBombing of Normandy began around midnight with more than 2,200 British, Canadian, and US bombers attacking targets along the coast and further inland [44] The coastal bombing attack was largely ineffective at Omaha, because low cloud cover made the assigned targets difficult to see Concerned about inflicting casualties on their own troops, many bombers delayed their attacks too long and failed to hit the beach defences [103] The Germans had 570 aircraft stationed in Normandy and the Low Countries on D-Day, and another 964 in Germany [44]\n\n\nAirborne operations\nThe success of the amphibious landings depended on the establishment of a secure lodgement from which to expand the beachhead to allow the build-up of a well-supplied force capable of breaking out The amphibious forces were especially vulnerable to strong enemy counter-attacks before the arrival of sufficient forces in the beachhead could be accomplished To slow or eliminate the enemy's ability to organise and launch counter-attacks during this critical period, airborne operations were used to seize key objectives such as bridges, road crossings, and terrain features, particularly on the eastern and western flanks of the landing areas The airborne landings some distance behind the beaches were also intended to ease the egress of the amphibious forces off the beaches, and in some cases to neutralise German coastal defence batteries and more quickly expand the area of the beachhead [108] [109]\n\n\nUnited States\nThe US airborne landings began with the arrival of pathfinders at 00:15 Navigation was difficult because of a bank of thick cloud, and as a result, only one of the five paratrooper drop zones was accurately marked with radar signals and Aldis lamps [115] Paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, numbering over 13,000 men, were delivered by Douglas C-47 Skytrains of the IX Troop Carrier Command [116] To avoid flying over the invasion fleet, the planes arrived from the west over the Cotentin Peninsula and exited over Utah Beach [117] [115]\n\n\nBritish and Canadian\nThe first Allied action of D-Day was the capture of the Caen canal and Orne river bridges via a glider assault at 00:16 (since renamed Pegasus Bridge and Horsa Bridge) Both bridges were quickly captured intact, with light casualties by the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry Regiment They were then reinforced by members of the 5th Parachute Brigade and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion [132] [133] The five bridges over the Dives were destroyed with minimal difficulty by the 3rd Parachute Brigade [134] [135] Meanwhile, the pathfinders tasked with setting up radar beacons and lights for further paratroopers (scheduled to begin arriving at 00:50 to clear the landing zone north of Ranville) were blown off course and had to set up the navigation aids too far east Many paratroopers, also blown too far east, landed far from their intended drop zones; some took hours or even days to be reunited with their units [136] [137] Major General Richard Gale arrived in the third wave of gliders at 03:30, along with equipment, such as antitank guns and jeeps, and more troops to help secure the area from counter-attacks, which were initially staged only by troops in the immediate vicinity of the landings [138] At 02:00, the commander of the German 716th Infantry Division ordered Feuchtinger to move his 21st Panzer Division into position to counter-attack However, as the division was part of the armoured reserve, Feuchtinger was obliged to seek clearance from OKW before he could commit his formation [139] Feuchtinger did not receive orders until nearly 09:00, but in the meantime on his own initiative he put together a battle group (including tanks) to fight the British forces east of the Orne [140]\n\n\nBeach landings\nSome of the landing craft had been modified to provide close support fire, and self-propelled amphibious Duplex-Drive tanks (DD tanks), specially designed for the Normandy landings, were to land shortly before the infantry to provide covering fire However, few arrived in advance of the infantry, and at  Omaha many sank before reaching the shore [144] [145] Other specialist tanks landed in the early waves to clear the beach defences.\n\n\nTanks\nSome of the landing craft had been modified to provide close support fire, and self-propelled amphibious Duplex-Drive tanks (DD tanks), specially designed for the Normandy landings, were to land shortly before the infantry to provide covering fire However, few arrived in advance of the infantry, and at  Omaha many sank before reaching the shore [144] [145] Other specialist tanks landed in the early waves to clear the beach defences.\n\n\nUtah Beach\nUtah Beach was in the area defended by two battalions of the 919th Grenadier Regiment [146] Members of the 8th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division were the first to land, arriving at 06:30 Their landing craft were pushed to the south by strong currents, and they found themselves about 2,000 yards (1.8 km) from their intended landing zone This site turned out to be better, as there was only one strongpoint nearby rather than two, and bombers of IX Bomber Command had bombed the defences from lower than their prescribed altitude, inflicting considerable damage In addition, the strong currents had washed ashore many of the underwater obstacles The assistant commander of the 4th Infantry Division, Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the first senior officer ashore, made the decision to \"start the war from right here,\" and ordered further landings to be re-routed [147] [148]\n\n\nPointe du Hoc\nPointe du Hoc, a prominent headland situated between Utah and Omaha, was assigned to two hundred men of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James Rudder Their task was to scale the 30 m (98 ft) cliffs with grappling hooks, ropes, and ladders to destroy the coastal gun battery located at the top The cliffs were defended by the German 352nd Infantry Division and French collaborators firing from above [152] Allied destroyers USS Satterlee and HMS Talybont provided fire support After scaling the cliffs, the Rangers discovered that the guns had already been withdrawn They located the weapons, unguarded but ready to use, in an orchard some 550 metres (600 yd) south of the point, and disabled them with explosives [152]\n\n\nOmaha Beach\nOmaha, the most heavily defended beach, was assigned to the 1st Infantry Division and 29th Infantry Division [158] They faced the 352nd Infantry Division rather than the expected single regiment [159] Strong currents forced many landing craft east of their intended position or caused them to be delayed [160] For fear of hitting the landing craft, US bombers delayed releasing their loads and as a result most of the beach obstacles at Omaha remained undamaged when the men came ashore [161] Many of the landing craft ran aground on sandbars, and the men had to wade 50–100m in water up to their necks while under fire to get to the beach [145] In spite of the rough seas, DD tanks of two companies of the 741st Tank Battalion were dropped 5,000 yards (4,600 m) from shore; however, 27 of the 32 flooded and sank, with the loss of 33 crew [162] Some tanks, disabled on the beach, continued to provide covering fire until their ammunition ran out or they were swamped by the rising tide [4]\n\n\nGold Beach\nThe first landings on Gold Beach were set for 07:25 because of the differences in the tide between there and the US beaches [167] High winds made conditions difficult for the landing craft, and the amphibious DD tanks were released close to shore or directly on the beach instead of further out as planned [168] Three of the four guns in a large emplacement at the Longues-sur-Mer battery were disabled by direct hits from the cruisers HMS Ajax and Argonaut at 06:20 The fourth gun resumed firing intermittently in the afternoon, and its garrison surrendered on 7 June [169] Aerial attacks had failed to hit the Le Hamel strongpoint, which had its embrasure facing east to provide enfilade fire along the beach and had a thick concrete wall on the seaward side [170] Its 75 mm gun continued to do damage until 16:00, when an Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE) tank fired a large demolition charge into its rear entrance [171] [172] A second casemated emplacement at La Rivière containing an 88 mm gun had been neutralised by a tank at 07:30 [173]\n\n\nJuno Beach\nThe landing at Juno Beach was delayed because of choppy seas, and the men arrived ahead of their supporting armour, suffering many casualties while disembarking Most of the offshore bombardment had missed the German defences [178] Several exits from the beach were created, but not without difficulty At Mike Beach on the western flank, a large crater was filled using an abandoned AVRE tank and several rolls of fascine, which were then covered by a temporary bridge [d] [179] The beach and nearby streets were clogged with traffic for most of the day, making it difficult to move inland [180]\n\n\nSword Beach\nOn Sword Beach, 21 of 25 DD tanks of the first wave were successful in getting safely ashore to provide cover for the infantry, who began disembarking at 07:30 [187] The beach was heavily mined and peppered with obstacles, making the work of the beach clearing teams difficult and dangerous [188] In the windy conditions, the tide came in more quickly than expected, so manoeuvring the armour was difficult The beach quickly became congested [189] Brigadier Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat and his 1st Special Service Brigade arrived in the second wave, piped ashore by Private Bill Millin, Lovat's personal piper [190] Members of No 4 Commando moved through Ouistreham to attack from the rear a German gun battery on the shore A concrete observation and control tower at this emplacement had to be bypassed and was not captured until several days later [191] French forces under Commander Philippe Kieffer (the first French soldiers to arrive in Normandy) attacked and cleared the heavily fortified strongpoint at the casino at Riva Bella, with the aid of one of the DD tanks [191]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe Normandy landings were the largest seaborne invasion in history, with nearly 5,000 landing and assault craft, 289 escort vessels, and 277 minesweepers participating [196] Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on D-Day, [9] with 875,000 men disembarking by the end of June [197] Allied casualties on the first day were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead [13] and the Germans had 4,000–9,000 casualties (killed, wounded, missing, or captured) [15] The Germans never achieved Hitler's stated aim of \"throwing the Allies back into the sea\" on D-Day or at any time thereafter [198]\n\n\nWar memorials and tourism\nAt Omaha Beach, parts of the Mulberry harbour are still visible, and a few of the beach obstacles remain A memorial to the US National Guard sits at the location of a former German strongpoint Pointe du Hoc is little changed from 1944, with the terrain covered with bomb craters and most of the concrete bunkers still in place The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial is nearby, in Colleville-sur-Mer [210] A museum about the Utah landings is located at Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, and there is one dedicated to the activities of the US airmen at Sainte-Mère-Église Two German military cemeteries are located nearby [211]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther

The cliffs were defended by the German 352nd Infantry Division and French collaborators firing from above.\n\n**Utah Beach**\n\nUtah Beach was in the area defended by two battalions of the 919th Grenadier Regiment. Members of the 8th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division were the first to land, arriving at 06:30. Their landing craft were pushed to the south by strong currents, and they found themselves about 2,000 yards (1.8 km) from their intended landing zone. This site turned out to be better, as there was only one strongpoint nearby rather than two, and bombers of IX Bomber Command had bombed the defences from lower than their prescribed altitude, inflicting considerable damage.\n\n**Gold Beach**\n\nThe first landings on Gold Beach were set for 07:25 because of the differences in the tide between there and the US beaches. High winds made conditions difficult for the landing craft, and the amphibious DD tanks were released close to shore or directly on the beach instead of further out as planned. The Longues-sur-Mer battery was disabled by direct hits from the cruisers HMS Ajax and Argonaut at 06:20. The fourth gun resumed firing intermittently in the afternoon, and its garrison surrendered on 7 June.\n\n**Juno Beach**\n\nThe landing at Juno Beach was delayed because of choppy seas, and the men arrived ahead of their supporting armour, suffering many casualties while disembarking. Most of the offshore bombardment had missed the German defences. Several exits from the beach were created, but not without difficulty. At Mike Beach on the western flank, a large crater was filled using an abandoned AVRE tank and several rolls of fascine, which were then covered by a temporary bridge.\n\n**Sword Beach**\n\nOn Sword Beach, 21 of 25 DD tanks of the first wave were successful in getting safely ashore to provide cover for the infantry, who began disembarking at 07:30. The beach was heavily mined and peppered with obstacles, making the work of the beach clearing teams difficult and dangerous.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Normandy landings were the largest seaborne invasion in history, with nearly 5,000 landing and assault craft, 289 escort vessels, and 277 minesweepers participating. Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on D-Day, with 875,000 men disembarking by the end of June. Allied casualties on the first day were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead and the Germans had 4,000–9,000 casualties (killed, wounded, missing, or captured).\n\n**War memorials and tourism**\n\nAt Omaha Beach, parts of the Mulberry harbour are still visible, and a few of the beach obstacles remain. A memorial to the US National Guard sits at the location of a former German strongpoint. Pointe du Hoc is little changed from 1944, with the terrain covered with bomb craters and most of the concrete bunkers still in place. The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial is nearby, in Colleville-sur-Mer.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Operation Overlord\n* Operation Neptune\n* Operation Pointblank\n* Operation Bodyguard\n* Operation Fortitude\n* Allied invasion of Normandy\n* German occupation of France\n* World War II\n\n**References**\n\n* Ambrose, Stephen E.

invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin began pressing his new allies for the creation of a second front in western Europe [16] In late May 1942, the Soviet Union and the United States made a joint announcement that a \".. full understanding was reached with regard to the urgent tasks of creating a second front in Europe in 1942.\" [17] However, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill persuaded US President Franklin D Roosevelt to postpone the promised invasion as, even with US help, the Allies did not have adequate forces for such an activity [18]\n\n\nOperations\nOperation Overlord was the name assigned to the establishment of a large-scale lodgement on the continent The first phase, the amphibious invasion and establishment of a secure foothold, was codenamed Operation Neptune [26] To gain the air superiority needed to ensure a successful invasion, the Allies undertook a bombing campaign (codenamed Operation Pointblank) that targeted German aircraft production, fuel supplies, and airfields [26] Elaborate deceptions, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, were undertaken in the months leading up to the invasion to prevent the Germans from learning the timing and location of the invasion [32]\n\n\nDeception plans\nUnder the overall umbrella of Operation Bodyguard, the Allies conducted several subsidiary operations designed to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the Allied landings [37] Operation Fortitude included Fortitude North, a misinformation campaign using fake radio traffic to lead the Germans into expecting an attack on Norway, [38] and Fortitude South, a major deception involving the creation of a fictitious First United States Army Group under Lieutenant General George S Patton, supposedly located in Kent and Sussex Fortitude South was intended to deceive the Germans into believing that the main attack would take place at Calais [32] [39] Genuine radio messages from 21st Army Group were first routed to Kent via landline and then broadcast, to give the Germans the impression that most of the Allied troops were stationed there [40] Patton was stationed in England until 6 July, thus continuing to deceive the Germans into believing a second attack would take place at Calais [41]\n\n\nWeather\nThe invasion planners determined a set of conditions involving the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that would be satisfactory on only a few days in each month A full moon was desirable, as it would provide illumination for aircraft pilots and have the highest tides The Allies wanted to schedule the landings for shortly before dawn, midway between low and high tide, with the tide coming in This would improve the visibility of obstacles on the beach while minimising the amount of time the men would be exposed in the open [44] Eisenhower had tentatively selected 5 June as the date for the assault However, on 4 June, conditions were unsuitable for a landing: high winds and heavy seas made it impossible to launch landing craft, and low clouds would prevent aircraft from finding their targets [45] The weather forecast that reported the storms was sent from a weather station on the western coast of Ireland [46]\n\n\nGerman order of battle\nGermany had at its disposal fifty divisions in France and the Low Countries, with another eighteen stationed in Denmark and Norway Fifteen divisions were in the process of formation in Germany [52] Combat losses throughout the war, particularly on the Eastern Front, meant that the Germans no longer had a pool of able young men from which to draw German soldiers were now on average six years older than their Allied counterparts Many in the Normandy area were Ostlegionen (eastern legions)—conscripts and volunteers from Russia, Mongolia, and other areas of the Soviet Union They were provided mainly with unreliable captured equipment and lacked motorised transport [53] [54] Many German units were under strength [55]\n\n\nCotentin Peninsula\nAllied forces attacking Utah Beach faced the following German units stationed on the Cotentin Peninsula:\n\n\nGrandcamps Sector\nAmericans assaulting Omaha Beach faced the following troops:\n\n\nForces around Caen\nAllied forces attacking Gold, Juno, and Sword Beaches faced the following German units:\n\n\nAtlantic Wall\nAlarmed by the raids on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler had ordered the construction of fortifications all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion He envisioned 15,000 emplacements manned by 300,000 troops, but shortages, particularly of concrete and manpower, meant that most of the strongpoints were never built [68] As it was expected to be the site of the invasion, the Pas de Calais was heavily defended [68] In the Normandy area, the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and Saint-Malo [30] Rommel was assigned to oversee the construction of further fortifications along the expected invasion front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg, [68] [69] and was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands Reserves for this group included the 2nd, 21st, and 116th Panzer divisions [70] [71]\n\n\nArmoured reserves\nRommel believed that Germany's best chance was to stop the invasion at the shore He requested that the mobile reserves, especially tanks, be stationed as close to the coast as possible Rundstedt, Geyr, and other senior commanders objected They believed that the invasion could not be stopped on the beaches Geyr argued for a conventional doctrine: keeping the Panzer formations concentrated in a central position around Paris and Rouen and deploying them only when the main Allied beachhead had been identified He also noted that in the Italian Campaign, the armoured units stationed near the coast had been damaged by naval bombardment Rommel's opinion was that because of Allied air supremacy, the large-scale movement of tanks would not be possible once the invasion was under way Hitler made the final decision, which was to leave three Panzer divisions under Geyr's command and give Rommel operational control of three more as reserves Hitler took personal control of four divisions as strategic reserves, not to be used without his direct orders [78] [79] [80]\n\n\nAllied order of battle\nCommander, SHAEF: General Dwight D Eisenhower\nCommander, 21st Army Group: General Bernard Montgomery [81]\n\n\nUS zones\nCommander, First Army: Lieutenant General Omar Bradley [81]\n\n\nBritish and Canadian zones\nCommander, Second Army: Lieutenant General Sir Miles Dempsey [81]\n\n\nCoordination with the French Resistance\nThrough the London-based État-major des Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur (French Forces of the Interior), the British Special Operations Executive orchestrated a campaign of sabotage to be implemented by the French Resistance The Allies developed four plans for the Resistance to execute on D-Day and the following days:\n\n\nNaval activity\nNaval operations for the invasion were described by historian Correlli Barnett as a \"never surpassed masterpiece of planning\" [96] In overall command was British Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, who had served as Flag officer at Dover during the Dunkirk evacuation four years earlier He had also been responsible for the naval planning of the invasion of North Africa in 1942, and one of the two fleets carrying troops for the invasion of Sicily the following year [97]\n\n\nNaval losses\nAt 05:10, German torpedo boats reached the Eastern Task Force and launched fifteen torpedoes, sinking the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS Svenner off Sword Beach but missing the British battleships HMS Warspite and Ramillies After attacking, the German vessels turned away and fled east into a smoke screen that had been laid by the RAF to shield the fleet from the long-range battery at Le Havre [101] Allied losses to mines included the American destroyer USS Corry off Utah and submarine chaser USS PC-1261, a 173-foot patrol craft [102]\n\n\nBombardment\nBombing of Normandy began around midnight with more than 2,200 British, Canadian, and US bombers attacking targets along the coast and further inland [44] The coastal bombing attack was largely ineffective at Omaha, because low cloud cover made the assigned targets difficult to see Concerned about inflicting casualties on their own troops, many bombers delayed their attacks too long and failed to hit the beach defences [103] The Germans had 570 aircraft stationed in Normandy and the Low Countries on D-Day, and another 964 in Germany [44]\n\n\nAirborne operations\nThe success of the amphibious landings depended on the establishment of a secure lodgement from which to expand the beachhead to allow the build-up of a well-supplied force capable of breaking out The amphibious forces were especially vulnerable to strong enemy counter-attacks before the arrival of sufficient forces in the beachhead could be accomplished To slow or eliminate the enemy's ability to organise and launch counter-attacks during this critical period, airborne operations were used to seize key objectives such as bridges, road crossings, and terrain features, particularly on the eastern and western flanks of the landing areas The airborne landings some distance behind the beaches were also intended to ease the egress of the amphibious forces off the beaches, and in some cases to neutralise German coastal defence batteries and more quickly expand the area of the beachhead [108] [109]\n\n\nUnited States\nThe US airborne landings began with the arrival of pathfinders at 00:15 Navigation was difficult because of a bank of thick cloud, and as a result, only one of the five paratrooper drop zones was accurately marked with radar signals and Aldis lamps [115] Paratroopers of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, numbering over 13,000 men, were delivered by Douglas C-47 Skytrains of the IX Troop Carrier Command [116] To avoid flying over the invasion fleet, the planes arrived from the west over the Cotentin Peninsula and exited over Utah Beach [117] [115]\n\n\nBritish and Canadian\nThe first Allied action of D-Day was the capture of the Caen canal and Orne river bridges via a glider assault at 00:16 (since renamed Pegasus Bridge and Horsa Bridge) Both bridges were quickly captured intact, with light casualties by the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry Regiment They were then reinforced by members of the 5th Parachute Brigade and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion [132] [133] The five bridges over the Dives were destroyed with minimal difficulty by the 3rd Parachute Brigade [134] [135] Meanwhile, the pathfinders tasked with setting up radar beacons and lights for further paratroopers (scheduled to begin arriving at 00:50 to clear the landing zone north of Ranville) were blown off course and had to set up the navigation aids too far east Many paratroopers, also blown too far east, landed far from their intended drop zones; some took hours or even days to be reunited with their units [136] [137] Major General Richard Gale arrived in the third wave of gliders at 03:30, along with equipment, such as antitank guns and jeeps, and more troops to help secure the area from counter-attacks, which were initially staged only by troops in the immediate vicinity of the landings [138] At 02:00, the commander of the German 716th Infantry Division ordered Feuchtinger to move his 21st Panzer Division into position to counter-attack However, as the division was part of the armoured reserve, Feuchtinger was obliged to seek clearance from OKW before he could commit his formation [139] Feuchtinger did not receive orders until nearly 09:00, but in the meantime on his own initiative he put together a battle group (including tanks) to fight the British forces east of the Orne [140]\n\n\nBeach landings\nSome of the landing craft had been modified to provide close support fire, and self-propelled amphibious Duplex-Drive tanks (DD tanks), specially designed for the Normandy landings, were to land shortly before the infantry to provide covering fire However, few arrived in advance of the infantry, and at  Omaha many sank before reaching the shore [144] [145] Other specialist tanks landed in the early waves to clear the beach defences.\n\n\nTanks\nSome of the landing craft had been modified to provide close support fire, and self-propelled amphibious Duplex-Drive tanks (DD tanks), specially designed for the Normandy landings, were to land shortly before the infantry to provide covering fire However, few arrived in advance of the infantry, and at  Omaha many sank before reaching the shore [144] [145] Other specialist tanks landed in the early waves to clear the beach defences.\n\n\nUtah Beach\nUtah Beach was in the area defended by two battalions of the 919th Grenadier Regiment [146] Members of the 8th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division were the first to land, arriving at 06:30 Their landing craft were pushed to the south by strong currents, and they found themselves about 2,000 yards (1.8 km) from their intended landing zone This site turned out to be better, as there was only one strongpoint nearby rather than two, and bombers of IX Bomber Command had bombed the defences from lower than their prescribed altitude, inflicting considerable damage In addition, the strong currents had washed ashore many of the underwater obstacles The assistant commander of the 4th Infantry Division, Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the first senior officer ashore, made the decision to \"start the war from right here,\" and ordered further landings to be re-routed [147] [148]\n\n\nPointe du Hoc\nPointe du Hoc, a prominent headland situated between Utah and Omaha, was assigned to two hundred men of the 2nd Ranger Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James Rudder Their task was to scale the 30 m (98 ft) cliffs with grappling hooks, ropes, and ladders to destroy the coastal gun battery located at the top The cliffs were defended by the German 352nd Infantry Division and French collaborators firing from above [152] Allied destroyers USS Satterlee and HMS Talybont provided fire support After scaling the cliffs, the Rangers discovered that the guns had already been withdrawn They located the weapons, unguarded but ready to use, in an orchard some 550 metres (600 yd) south of the point, and disabled them with explosives [152]\n\n\nOmaha Beach\nOmaha, the most heavily defended beach, was assigned to the 1st Infantry Division and 29th Infantry Division [158] They faced the 352nd Infantry Division rather than the expected single regiment [159] Strong currents forced many landing craft east of their intended position or caused them to be delayed [160] For fear of hitting the landing craft, US bombers delayed releasing their loads and as a result most of the beach obstacles at Omaha remained undamaged when the men came ashore [161] Many of the landing craft ran aground on sandbars, and the men had to wade 50–100m in water up to their necks while under fire to get to the beach [145] In spite of the rough seas, DD tanks of two companies of the 741st Tank Battalion were dropped 5,000 yards (4,600 m) from shore; however, 27 of the 32 flooded and sank, with the loss of 33 crew [162] Some tanks, disabled on the beach, continued to provide covering fire until their ammunition ran out or they were swamped by the rising tide [4]\n\n\nGold Beach\nThe first landings on Gold Beach were set for 07:25 because of the differences in the tide between there and the US beaches [167] High winds made conditions difficult for the landing craft, and the amphibious DD tanks were released close to shore or directly on the beach instead of further out as planned [168] Three of the four guns in a large emplacement at the Longues-sur-Mer battery were disabled by direct hits from the cruisers HMS Ajax and Argonaut at 06:20 The fourth gun resumed firing intermittently in the afternoon, and its garrison surrendered on 7 June [169] Aerial attacks had failed to hit the Le Hamel strongpoint, which had its embrasure facing east to provide enfilade fire along the beach and had a thick concrete wall on the seaward side [170] Its 75 mm gun continued to do damage until 16:00, when an Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE) tank fired a large demolition charge into its rear entrance [171] [172] A second casemated emplacement at La Rivière containing an 88 mm gun had been neutralised by a tank at 07:30 [173]\n\n\nJuno Beach\nThe landing at Juno Beach was delayed because of choppy seas, and the men arrived ahead of their supporting armour, suffering many casualties while disembarking Most of the offshore bombardment had missed the German defences [178] Several exits from the beach were created, but not without difficulty At Mike Beach on the western flank, a large crater was filled using an abandoned AVRE tank and several rolls of fascine, which were then covered by a temporary bridge [d] [179] The beach and nearby streets were clogged with traffic for most of the day, making it difficult to move inland [180]\n\n\nSword Beach\nOn Sword Beach, 21 of 25 DD tanks of the first wave were successful in getting safely ashore to provide cover for the infantry, who began disembarking at 07:30 [187] The beach was heavily mined and peppered with obstacles, making the work of the beach clearing teams difficult and dangerous [188] In the windy conditions, the tide came in more quickly than expected, so manoeuvring the armour was difficult The beach quickly became congested [189] Brigadier Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat and his 1st Special Service Brigade arrived in the second wave, piped ashore by Private Bill Millin, Lovat's personal piper [190] Members of No 4 Commando moved through Ouistreham to attack from the rear a German gun battery on the shore A concrete observation and control tower at this emplacement had to be bypassed and was not captured until several days later [191] French forces under Commander Philippe Kieffer (the first French soldiers to arrive in Normandy) attacked and cleared the heavily fortified strongpoint at the casino at Riva Bella, with the aid of one of the DD tanks [191]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe Normandy landings were the largest seaborne invasion in history, with nearly 5,000 landing and assault craft, 289 escort vessels, and 277 minesweepers participating [196] Nearly 160,000 troops crossed the English Channel on D-Day, [9] with 875,000 men disembarking by the end of June [197] Allied casualties on the first day were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead [13] and the Germans had 4,000–9,000 casualties (killed, wounded, missing, or captured) [15] The Germans never achieved Hitler's stated aim of \"throwing the Allies back into the sea\" on D-Day or at any time thereafter [198]\n\n\nWar memorials and tourism\nAt Omaha Beach, parts of the Mulberry harbour are still visible, and a few of the beach obstacles remain A memorial to the US National Guard sits at the location of a former German strongpoint Pointe du Hoc is little changed from 1944, with the terrain covered with bomb craters and most of the concrete bunkers still in place The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial is nearby, in Colleville-sur-Mer [210] A museum about the Utah landings is located at Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, and there is one dedicated to the activities of the US airmen at Sainte-Mère-Église Two German military cemeteries are located nearby [211]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party and Bharatiya Janata Party formed the state government, with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed becoming the Chief Minister [14] [15]\n\n\nPolitical developments\nIn June 2018, BJP withdrew its support to the PDP-led government [18] and Governor's rule was subsequently imposed in Jammu and Kashmir [19] In November 2018, the state assembly was dissolved by Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Satya Pal Malik [20] despite the fact that many political parties had written to the Governor expressing their willingness to form the Government [21] President's rule was imposed on 20 December 2018 [22]\n\n\nDissolution of assembly and President's rule\nIn June 2018, BJP withdrew its support to the PDP-led government [18] and Governor's rule was subsequently imposed in Jammu and Kashmir [19] In November 2018, the state assembly was dissolved by Governor of Jammu and Kashmir Satya Pal Malik [20] despite the fact that many political parties had written to the Governor expressing their willingness to form the Government [21] President's rule was imposed on 20 December 2018 [22]\n\n\nRevocation of Article 370 and reorganisation of state\nIn 2019, Article 370 of the Constitution of India, which gave special status to the disputed Jammu and Kashmir, was abrogated [23] and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act was passed to reconstitute the state of Jammu and Kashmir into union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh with effect from 31 October 2019 [24] The changes allowed Hindu refugees residing in Jammu who were displaced from Pakistan following Partition in 1947 to vote in state elections [25]\n\n\nDelimitation\nIn March 2020, a three-member Delimitation Commission was formed, chaired by retired Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai, for the delimitation of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir [26] The commission published its interim report in February 2022 [27] The final delimitation report was released on 5 May 2022 under which additional 6 seats were added to Jammu division and 1 seat to Kashmir division After delimitation, the total seats in the assembly rose to 114 seats, out of which 24 seats are designated for areas that fall under Pakistan-administered Kashmir Out of the remaining 90 seats, 43 seats are in Jammu division and 47 seats are in the Kashmir division [28] The final delimitation report came into force from 20 May 2022 [29]\n\n\nDDC elections\nIn 2020, DDC elections were held after revocation of special status People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) secured 110 seats, while BJP was the

[34]\n\n\nJammu and Kashmir lithium reserves\nOn 2 May 2024, Ministry of Mines secretary Vivek Bharadwaj announced that an auction to assign mining rights was planned on priority basis by December 2024 [35] Former minister and JKNPP president Harsh Dev Singh, challenged the legal premise, upon which the federal government planned to assign mineral rights valued at US$500 billion (half a trillion dollars) [36] On 29 May 2023, Harsh Dev, [37] stated that in accordance to Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act 1957, only a federated state or union territory government had the lawful right to hold auctions and assign mining concessions for minerals found on land [38] In December 2023, the first attempt to auction Jammu and Kashmir lithium failed As the auction only received two bids, as per legislation a minimum of three bids is required for the auction to be considered valid [39] [40] In July 2024 a second attempt by the central Indian government of auction Jammu and Kashmir's lithium failed to receive any bids [41]\n\n\nSchedule\nThe schedule of the election was announced by the Election Commission of India on 16 August 2024 [42] [43] The date of

The film is a semi-autobiographical exploration of a relationship between a young mother and her daughter, set against the backdrop of a family holiday in Turkey.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in the late 1990s, and follows 11-year-old Sophie Patterson (Frankie Corio) as she travels to a Turkish holiday resort with her 30-year-old father, Calum (Paul Mescal). Calum, who has separated amicably from Sophie's mother, is struggling with depression, anxiety, and internal turmoil. He tries to hide his emotions from Sophie, but she is observant and perceptive, recording their holiday on a MiniDV camera. The footage of the holiday is interspersed throughout the film, providing a nostalgic and intimate perspective on the relationship between Sophie and Calum.\n\nOver the course of the holiday, Sophie befriends and observes various English tourists at the resort, often meeting and playing arcade games with a boy named Michael. Calum, meanwhile, exhibits signs of depression and anxiety, which he tries to hide from Sophie beneath a facade of contentment. He practices tai chi and reads self-help books, and also smokes, which he hides from Sophie.\n\nAs the holiday progresses, Sophie becomes increasingly aware of her father's emotional state, and begins to question her own perceptions of him. The film raises questions about the nature of memory and the way we experience our relationships with loved ones. Through Sophie's observations and interactions with her father, the film explores the complexities of a relationship between a young mother and her daughter, and the ways in which we navigate our emotions and relationships.\n\n**Cast**\n\nAftersun marks the feature film debut of director and writer Charlotte Wells. Wells has stated that the film is \"emotionally autobiographical,\" and sought to delve into a different period in a relationship between a young parent and a daughter than what she explored in her 2015 debut short film, Tuesday. Frankie Corio was one of over 800 applicants before being cast in the lead role of Sophie. Corio and Mescal spent two weeks rehearsing at a holiday resort in Turkey to make their dynamic more authentic.\n\n**Production**\n\nAftersun is a co-production between BBC Film and Sea Change Films. The film was shot on location in Ölüdeniz, Turkey, and features a cast of predominantly British actors. The film's score was composed by Oliver Coates, who has worked with a range of artists including Lana Del Rey and FKA twigs.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film features an original score by Oliver Coates, which provides a haunting and introspective backdrop to the story. The score is characterized by its use of minimalist melodies and atmospheric soundscapes, which evoke a sense of nostalgia and melancholy.\n\n**Soundtrack**\n\nAftersun does not have a traditional soundtrack, but the film's score by Oliver Coates is a key element of the film's sound design. The score is woven throughout the film, providing a sense of continuity and cohesion to the story.\n\n**Score**\n\nThe film's score by Oliver Coates is a key element of the film's sound design.

Dutchman and informs his father, Will, that the curse which binds Will to the Dutchman and only permits him to step on land once a decade can be broken by the Trident of Poseidon Henry intends to recruit Captain Jack Sparrow to help find it, but Will believes this is impossible and orders Henry to leave Will and the Dutchman then disappear into the sea, but Henry vows to find Jack and the Trident.\n\n\nCast\nSupporting characters appearing in the film include: David Wenham as Lieutenant John Scarfield, a Royal Navy officer who commands HMS Essex; [25] and Golshifteh Farahani as Shansa, a sea witch who helps Barbossa and Scarfield [1] Stephen Graham, Martin Klebba, Giles New, and Angus Barnett reprise their roles as Scrum, Marty, and Murtogg and Mullroy, respectively, from previous films, as the members of the pirate crews of Jack Sparrow and Hector Barbossa [1] [26] Adam Brown, Danny Kirrane, and Delroy Atkinson appear as members of Sparrow's crew [27] In the prison scene, Paul McCartney briefly appears as Sparrow's namesake, Uncle Jack [28]\n\n\nProduction\nShortly before the release of On Stranger Tides, the cast and crew of the fourth film were told to set aside time in the near future, because Walt Disney Pictures intended to shoot a fifth and sixth film back-to-back [35] However, it was later stated that only a fifth film was in the works, with Terry Rossio writing a script for a fifth film without his partner Ted Elliott [36] Rob Marshall was rumoured to return to direct, [37] but declined after choosing to direct Into the Woods (2014) [38] After Marshall passed on the film, many directors were rumored to take over [39] Gore Verbinski, who was responsible for the original three films, felt that \"there's no reason other than financial\" in making the film [40] The eventual shortlist included Fredrik Bond, Rupert Sanders, and the eventual choice, Norwegian film duo Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg [41] The studio chose them based on their Academy Award-nominated high-sea film Kon-Tiki, and their ability to work with a limited budget [42]\n\n\nDevelopment\nShortly before the release of On Stranger Tides, the cast and crew of the fourth film

them based on their Academy Award-nominated high-sea film Kon-Tiki, and their ability to work with a limited budget [42]\n\n\nCasting\nSpeaking at the On Stranger Tides press launch in Cannes, Depp said he would play the role so long as it is popular with the public [60] By August 2012, news surfaced that Depp had signed for the fifth film, earning A$90 million to reprise his role [9] One month later, Penélope Cruz stated that in spite of her enjoying playing Angelica in On Stranger Tides, she had not been contacted regarding a fifth film [61] Geoffrey Rush had commented on returning as Hector Barbossa in the fifth installment, saying \"If they keep shapeshifting this character, absolutely,\" and implied that he might return as the villain [62] Other co-stars from the previous film include Sam Claflin as Philip Swift, [63] Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Syrena [64] and Greg Ellis as Theodore Groves, even though Groves appeared to have died in On Stranger Tides [65] In October 2012, Keith Richards expressed interest in reprising his role as Captain Teague, [66] but was unavailable by the time the film went into production [28]\n\n\nFilming\nDirectors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg originally stated that shooting would take place in Puerto Rico and New Orleans, [93] and Bruckheimer had previously mentioned that there might be a sequence in Louisiana [94] However, a spokesman for Australian Arts Minister George Brandis confirmed that the fifth installment was set to shoot exclusively in Australia after the government agreed to repurpose $20 million of tax incentives, originally intended for the remake of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea; thus edging out Mexico and South Africa as filming locations [95] Filming took place exclusively in Queensland, Australia, as the largest production to ever shoot in the country Village Roadshow Studios and the Whitsunday Islands were officially confirmed as filming locations [96] On January 1, 2015, The Rainbow Gypsy, a 35-year-old replica of an 1897 Scottish trawler, underwent an extensive refit at the Gold Coast, including a new bowsprit, and reconfigured decks and cabins, for filming as the Dying Gull Its captain and owner, Kit Woodward, was a rigger in the film [97]\n\n\nPost-production\nEditing was a collaboration between Roger Barton and Leigh Folsom Boyd, with the latter detailing that \"Roger started from the beginning of the film and I started from the end, and we kind of met in the middle.\" Boyd added that it was the longest post-production process she was ever involved with, as Disney wanted to give \"the support and leeway we needed to tell the story and allow for the complex visual effects to bake.\" [121] The editors worked closely with the previsualization team to, according to effects supervisor Gary Brozenich, \"give meat to the bones of the plates that needed effects explanation as well as any new CG beats that would be added later.\" Along with the post-production team in Los Angeles, Brozenich had to split his time going to the UK and Montreal, to check on the eight companies handling the film's 2,000 visual effects shots, with 150 of them consisting only of computer graphics The primary vendor was Brozenich's own employer Moving Picture Company (MPC) [100] [122] Among MPC's work were Salazar's undead pirates, whose on-set footage was mostly replaced by CGI to achieve missing body parts and floating hair and clothing Brozenich stated that what was kept of the original actors was \"their run, gait and faces.\" To provide reference for the floating parts, which were meant to resemble a perpetual drowning state, a stuntman in full costume and wig was filmed underwater in a swimming pool performing various actions [14]\n\n\nMusic\nThis was the first film in the series (since the first) that Hans Zimmer did not compose the music for Instead, the main composer is one of his protégés, Geoff Zanelli, who had worked on the previous four installments in the franchise [124] Zanelli said that Zimmer \"redefined the sound of the entire genre\" and considered it a great accomplishment to have worked with him and Bruckheimer He used this experience with the franchise to build a new sound for the film [124] He stated that \"you don't have to modernize the melodies, those are timeless,\" citing one example of how he tried to make the sound more modern by featuring an electric cello to create a menacing leitmotif for Captain Armando Salazar [125] This was also the first Pirates of the Caribbean score to feature mostly live percussion, as opposed to the programmed percussion in the prior scores As it took more than a year for the film to start production following Zanelli being hired, he accompanied the script's evolution, and was familiar with the character arcs that he would need to translate in their theme songs Zanelli always started writing the music on the piano, namely a synthesized orchestra [126] The film's soundtrack was released on May 26, 2017 [127]\n\n\nMarketing\nA robust marketing effort helped promote Dead Men Tell No Tales [128] The film was first showcased at the Disney D23 Expo 2015, where Depp appeared in costume as Jack Sparrow and the film's logo was revealed, with Orlando Bloom confirmed to be starring in the film [129] [130] A 240 page tie-in prequel novel expanding the backstory of the character Carina Smyth was also released, titled Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales – The Brightest Star in the North: The Adventures of Carina Smyth [131] The film was showcased at the 2016 Walt Disney Content Showcase in South Africa, where concept art, story details and on-set images were previewed [132] On April 26, 2017, Depp made a cameo appearance at Disneyland's Pirates of the Caribbean ride in an event to promote the film, surprising unsuspecting guests by portraying Jack Sparrow in place of one of the animatronics

the previous four films back into the 25 best-sold Blu-rays [141]\n\n\nTerry Rossio's screenplay\nFollowing the film's theatrical release in 2017, Terry Rossio released his unproduced screenplay on his website Wordplay Also titled Dead Men Tell No Tales, this was a proposed story written with the studio and producer guideline that Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom would not return to the series, and so those characters would not be available Rossio's draft also included additional information in extensive footnotes Among other characters, Pintel and Ragetti return from the trilogy, Philip Swift and Syrena from On Stranger Tides, with Dead Men Tell No Tales also introducing a female villain, a sea witch named the Sea Widow The story featured the Trident of Neptune, which contains the three Pearls of Neptune that each have a different power: Rhysis, which commands the winds; Tyrah, pearl of the tides; and Miro, which commands the creatures of the sea It would also be revealed that Rhysis was hidden twice over inside a sapphire in the hilt of the Sword of Triton, only identified as Blackbeard's or Barbossa's sword in Rossio's script, with the power being revealed to control the wind, as well as a ship's rigging, and would not be used to release the Black Pearl from the bottle [45]\n\n\nReception\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales grossed $172.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $623.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $795.9 million, [6] against an estimated production budget of $230–320 million [3] It had a worldwide opening of $271.4 million from 55 markets, with $24 million coming from 1,088 IMAX screens [142] The film's six-day opening gross pushed the franchise gross past the $4 billion mark [143] Despite being the lowest-grossing film of the series in North America by nearly $70 million and despite scoring the second-lowest nominal gross of the franchise outside North America (only ahead of Curse of the Black Pearl), Dead Men Tell No Tales became the highest-grossing entry of the Pirates franchise outside North America when accounting for foreign-exchange rates, surpassing On Stranger Tides, which grossed $593.4 million at July 2017 rates [144] The largest-earning foreign markets were China ($172.3 million), Japan ($59.5 million), and Russia and the CIS ($40.7 million), where it was the second-highest-grossing film behind Avatar (2009) [145] Deadline Hollywood noted the film would turn a net profit of around $280 million after factoring together all expenses and revenues based on a projected $850 million final gross (though it would ultimately fall short of that figure, likely resulting in a smaller profit) [146]\n\n\nBox office\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales

No Tales debuted over the four-day Memorial Day opening weekend, being released in 4,276 theaters, of which over 3,100 were 3D, taking advantage of formats such as IMAX, D-Box, and 4DX [147] The film earned $23.4 million on its first day, including $5.5 million from previews It was the lowest opening day of the franchise [148] Dead Men Tell No Tales grossed $63 million over three days, and $78.5 million over four (Friday–Monday), finishing first at the box office, ahead of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 (2017) and fellow newcomer Baywatch (2017) [149] [150] It was the second-smallest opening weekend of the franchise, only earning more than the first film, with each of the other installments earning at least $90 million [151] Despite the film registering the highest test score in

said he would play the role so long as it is popular with the public [60] By August 2012, news surfaced that Depp had signed for the fifth film, earning A$90 million to reprise his role [9] One month later, Penélope Cruz stated that in spite of her enjoying playing Angelica in On Stranger Tides, she had not been contacted regarding a fifth film [61] Geoffrey Rush had commented on returning as Hector Barbossa in the fifth installment, saying \"If they keep shapeshifting this character, absolutely,\" and implied that he might return as the villain [62] Other co-stars from the previous film include Sam Claflin as Philip Swift, [63] Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Syrena [64] and Greg Ellis as Theodore Groves, even though Groves appeared to have died in On Stranger Tides [65] In October 2012, Keith Richards expressed interest in reprising his role as Captain Teague, [66] but was unavailable by the time the film went into production [28]\n\n\nFilming\nDirectors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg originally stated that shooting would take place in Puerto Rico and New Orleans, [93] and Bruckheimer had previously mentioned that there might be a sequence in Louisiana [94] However, a spokesman for Australian Arts Minister George Brandis confirmed that the fifth installment was set to shoot exclusively in Australia after the government agreed to repurpose $20 million of tax incentives, originally intended for the remake of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea; thus edging out Mexico and South Africa as filming locations [95] Filming took place exclusively in Queensland, Australia, as the largest production to ever shoot in the country Village Roadshow Studios and the Whitsunday Islands were officially confirmed as filming locations [96] On January 1, 2015, The Rainbow Gypsy, a 35-year-old replica of an 1897 Scottish trawler, underwent an extensive refit at the Gold Coast, including a new bowsprit, and reconfigured decks and cabins, for filming as the Dying Gull Its captain and owner, Kit Woodward, was a rigger in the film [97]\n\n\nPost-production\nEditing was a collaboration between Roger Barton and Leigh Folsom Boyd, with the latter detailing that \"Roger started from the beginning of the film and I started from the end, and we kind of met in the middle.\" Boyd added that it was the longest post-production process she was ever involved with, as Disney wanted to give \"the support and leeway we needed to tell the story and allow for the complex visual effects to bake.\" [121] The editors worked closely with the previsualization team to, according to effects supervisor Gary Brozenich, \"give meat to the bones of the plates that needed effects explanation as well as any new CG beats that would be added later.\" Along with the post-production team in Los Angeles, Brozenich had to split his time going to the UK and Montreal, to check on the eight companies handling the film's 2,000 visual effects shots, with 150 of them consisting only of computer graphics The primary vendor was Brozenich's own employer Moving Picture Company (MPC) [100] [122] Among MPC's work were Salazar's undead pirates, whose on-set footage was mostly replaced by CGI to achieve missing body parts and floating hair and clothing Brozenich stated that what was kept of the original actors was \"their run, gait and faces.\" To provide reference for the floating parts, which were meant to resemble a perpetual drowning state, a stuntman in full costume and wig was filmed underwater in a swimming pool performing various actions [14]\n\n\nMusic\nThis was the first film in the series (since the first) that Hans Zimmer did not compose the music for Instead, the main composer is one of his protégés, Geoff Zanelli, who had worked on the previous four installments in the franchise [124] Zanelli said that Zimmer \"redefined the sound of the entire genre\" and considered it a great accomplishment to have worked with him and Bruckheimer He used this experience with the franchise to build a new sound for the film [124] He stated that \"you don't have to modernize the melodies, those are timeless,\" citing one example of how he tried to make the sound more modern by featuring an electric cello to create a menacing leitmotif for Captain Armando Salazar [125] This was also the first Pirates of the Caribbean score to feature mostly live percussion, as opposed to the programmed percussion in the prior scores As it took more than a year for the film to start production following Zanelli being hired, he accompanied the script's evolution, and was familiar with the character arcs that he would need to translate in their theme songs Zanelli always started writing the music on the piano, namely a synthesized orchestra [126] The film's soundtrack was released on May 26, 2017 [127]\n\n\nMarketing\nA robust marketing effort helped promote Dead Men Tell No Tales [128] The film was first showcased at the Disney D23 Expo 2015, where Depp appeared in costume as Jack Sparrow and the film's logo was revealed, with Orlando Bloom confirmed to be starring in the film [129] [130] A 240 page tie-in prequel

indicated that another Pirates sequel would be possible if Dead Men Tell No Tales did well in its home release [194] In October 2017, the sixth film was confirmed and Kaya Scodelario said that she was contracted to return [195] Shortly after, it was announced that Rønning was being eyed to return to direct the sequel [196] By August 2018, the sixth film was still in development [197] The following month, Keira Knightley said that she did not see herself returning for another installment due to the fact that she is a mother now and that the films take too long to shoot

He grew up in a family that valued education, and his parents encouraged him to pursue his interests in mathematics and science. Kove attended Valley Stream Central High School, where he developed a strong foundation in mathematics and science. After completing his high school education, Kove attended the ITT Technical Institute - Maumee Campus, where he studied engineering and computer science.\n\n**Career**\n\nKove's entry into the entertainment industry began with a career as a substitute math teacher at Ward Melville High School. However, he soon realized that his true passion lay in acting, and he decided to leave his teaching position to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. In the early 1980s, Kove moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. His big break came in 1982 when he was cast as New York City Detective Victor Isbecki in the television series Cagney & Lacey. Kove's portrayal of Isbecki earned him a spot in the main cast, and he went on to appear in the show for six seasons.\n\nIn addition to his work on Cagney & Lacey, Kove also appeared in a number of films during the 1980s. One of his most notable roles was as John Kreese, the sensei of Cobra Kai, in the 1984 film The Karate Kid. Kreese was a ruthless and cunning sensei who taught his students the importance of winning at all costs. His famous phrase, \"Sweep the leg,\" became a catchphrase of the 1980s, and his character's philosophy of \"no mercy\" resonated with audiences.\n\nKove reprised his role as Kreese in the 1986 sequel The Karate Kid Part II and the 1989 sequel The Karate Kid Part III. His portrayal of Kreese cemented his status as a villain in the Karate Kid franchise, and his character's legacy has endured long after the film series ended.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn addition to his successful acting career, Kove is also a devoted family man. He is the father of twins, who were born in 1990. One of his twins, Jesse, has followed in his father's footsteps and has appeared in a number of film and television productions. In fact, Jesse played the role of the young man who bullies the younger version of his father's character, John Kreese, in flashbacks for seasons 3 and 4 of the television series Cobra Kai.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* **Film**\n\t+ The Karate Kid (1984)\n\t+ Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985)\n\t+ The Karate Kid Part II (1986)\n\t+ The Karate Kid Part III (1989)\n\t+ The Karate Kid (2010)\n* **Television**\n\t+ Cagney & Lacey (1982-1988)\n\t+ The Twilight Zone (1990)\n\t+ Family Law (1999-2002)\n\t+ The Mentalist (2012)\n\t+ Cobra Kai (2018-2022)\n* **Video Games**\n\t+ The Karate Kid (1987)\n\t+ The Karate Kid Part II (1988)\n\t+ The Karate Kid Part III (1989)\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Martin_Kove\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nMartin Kove was born into a Jewish family on March 6, 1946, in Brooklyn He attended Valley Stream Central High School before attending ITT Technical Institute - Maumee Campus [3]\n\n\nCareer\nKove worked as a substitute math teacher at the Ward Melville High School before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting From 1982–88, Kove appeared in the main cast of Cagney & Lacey as New York City Detective Victor Isbecki, a supporting role he reprised in subsequent television movies for the series During the same time, Kove appeared in the 1984 hit film The Karate Kid as Cobra Kai sensei John Kreese, whose fighting instruction of showing “no mercy” and to “sweep the leg” during the film’s karate tournament entered the American zeitgeist After playing a traitorous helicopter pilot in the 1985 film Rambo: First Blood Part II, he returned as Kreese for the 1986 sequel The Karate Kid Part II and the 1989 sequel The Karate Kid Part III [4]\n\n\nPersonal life\nKove is the father of twins, born in 1990 [14] One of the twins, Jesse, portrayed the young man who bullies the younger version of his father’s character, John Kreese, in flashbacks for seasons 3 and 4 of Cobra Kai [15]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Hobbit) to Fantasy Films [17]\n\n\nPitch to Miramax\nIn 1995, while completing post-production on The Frighteners, Jackson and Fran Walsh discussed making an original fantasy film, but could not think of a scenario that was not Tolkien-esque, and eventually decided to look up the film rights They went to Harvey Weinstein from Miramax, who got the rights from Saul Zaentz Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice, [24] [25] but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on The Hobbit and, if that would prove successful, two Lord of the Rings films shot back-to-back [21] Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists Weinstein tried to buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccessful [26]\n\n\nMove to New Line\nAs the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax's capabilities The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film [24] Jackson inquired whether it could be around four hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter Hossein Amini and directors John Madden or Quentin Tarantino Jackson believed this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself [27]\n\n\nProduction\nJackson began storyboarding and screenwriting the series with Christian Rivers, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time [32] Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part adaptation with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another, regardless of its placement in the books To allow the story to be clearer for viewers, Jackson took a more chronological approach to the story than Tolkien's complex interlacing of storylines During shooting, the screenplays continued to evolve, in part due to contributions from cast members looking to further explore their characters [33]\n\n\nMusic\nHoward Shore composed, orchestrated, conducted and produced the trilogy's music Shore visited the set in 1999, and composed a version of the Shire theme and Frodo's Theme before Jackson began shooting [50] In August 2000, he visited the set again and watched the assembly cuts of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King [51] In the music, Shore included many (85 to 110) leitmotifs to represent various characters, cultures and places—the largest catalogue of leitmotifs in the history of cinema, surpassing, for comparison, that of the entire Star Wars film series For example, there are multiple leitmotifs just for the hobbits and the Shire Although the first film had some of its score recorded in Wellington, virtually all of the trilogy's score was recorded in Watford Town Hall and mixed at Abbey Road Studios [33] Jackson planned to advise the score for six weeks each year in London, though for The Two Towers he stayed for twelve [52]\n\n\nSoundtracks\nThe trilogy's online promotional trailer was first released on 27 April 2000 and set a new record for download hits, registering 1.7 million hits in the first 24 hours of its release [55] The trailer used a selection from the soundtrack for Braveheart and The Shawshank Redemption among other cuts In 2001, 24 minutes of footage from the series, primarily the Moria sequence, was shown at the 54th Cannes Film Festival, and was very well received [56] The showing also included an area

received widespread acclaim and is ranked among the greatest film trilogies ever made [78] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"the trilogy will not soon, if ever, find its equal\", [79] while Todd McCarthy of Variety described the films as \"one of the most ambitious and phenomenally successful dream projects of all time\" [80] The Fellowship of the Ring was voted the greatest fantasy movie of all time in a reader's poll conducted by American magazine Wired in 2012, while The Two Towers and The Return of the King placed fourth and third respectively [81] The Independent ranked The Lord of the Rings trilogy at No 2 on its list of \"10 greatest movie trilogies of all time\" [82] The Lord of the Rings trilogy is ranked at No 2 in /Film's list of \"The 15 Greatest Trilogies Of All Time\", [83] while Empire ranked it at No 1 in its list of \"The 33 Greatest Movie Trilogies\" [84]\n\n\nIndustry response\nThe series drew acclaim from within the industry, including from the film directors Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, and George Lucas [98] [99] John Boorman, who once wrote a script for a Lord of the Rings film, said he was happy his own version was unmade [100] as Jackson's film trilogy was \"of such scope and magnitude that it can only be compared to the building of the great Gothic cathedrals.\" [101] Forrest J Ackerman, who once presented a film treatment to Tolkien, and appeared on Jackson's Bad Taste said his pitch \"could never have been given the grand treatment that Peter Jackson afforded it.\" [102] Arthur Rankin said Jackson was making \"marvellous films.\" [103]\n\n\nAccolades\nThe three films together were nominated for a total of 30 Academy Awards, of which they won 17, both records for any movie trilogy [112] The Fellowship of the Ring earned 13 nominations, the most of any film at the 74th Academy Awards, winning four; The Two Towers won two awards from six nominations at the 75th Academy Awards; The Return of the King won in every category in which it was nominated at the 76th Academy Awards, setting the current Oscar record for the highest clean sweep, and its 11 Academy Awards wins ties the record held by Ben-Hur (1959) and Titanic (1997) [113] The Return of the King also became only the second sequel to win the Oscar for Best Picture after The Godfather Part II (1974) [114]\n\n\nComparisons with the written work\nCommentators have compared Jackson's film trilogy with Tolkien's written work, remarking that while both have been extremely successful commercially, they differ in many respects Critics have admired Jackson's ability to film the long and complex work at all; the beauty of the cinematography, sets, and costumes; and the epic scale of his version of Tolkien's story They have however found the characters and the story greatly weakened by Jackson's emphasis on action and violence at the expense of psychological depth; the loss of Tolkien's emphasis on free will and individual responsibility; and the replacement of Frodo's inner journey by an American monomyth with Aragorn as the hero [121] [122]\n\n\nHome media\nThe first two films were released on two-disc standard edition DVDs containing previews of the following film The success of the theatrical cuts brought about four-disc extended editions, with new editing, added special effects and music [129] Jackson came up with the idea of an extended cut for LaserDisc and DVD formats while in preproduction [42] He could insert some of the violence that he thought he would have to trim to get a PG-13 rating for the theatre and he could tailor the pacing to the demands of the small screen, which he said were \"completely different\" [130] Jackson has stated that he considers the theatrical cuts to be the \"definitive versions\" of the films due to their deliberate pacing [131] but also that he believes the extended cuts will be \"ultimately seen as the more definitive versions of the films\" [132]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe release of the films saw a surge of interest in The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's other works, vastly increasing his impact on popular culture [153] The success of the films spawned numerous video games and many other kinds of merchandise.\n\n\nFurther films\nFrom 2012 to 2014 Peter Jackson and his studio Wingnut Films made The Hobbit trilogy consisting of the films The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies The trilogy works as a prequel to The Lord of the Rings films [154] [155] Though critics generally considered the trilogy to be inferior to the original films, it was still a financial success [156]\n\n\nThe Hobbit trilogy\nFrom 2012 to 2014 Peter Jackson and his studio Wingnut

an anime prequel film, titled The War of the Rohirrim, is scheduled to be released It is directed by Kenji Kamiyama, with Miranda Otto reprising her role from live-action, serving as the film's narrator [157] Additionally, two new live-action films are in development with Jackson returning as producer The first of these, The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, will be directed by Andy Serkis for a planned release in 2026 [158]\n\n\nReunion\nIn 2020, the actor Josh Gad aired a virtual cast reunion as the fourth episode of the web series Reunited Apart, a charity fundraising effort during the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting Share Our Strength's campaign called \"No Kid Hungry\" Many actors from the original cast participated, along with Jackson, Boyens, and Shore [159] [160] [161] The charity raised over $100,000 [162]\n\n\nEffects on the film industry and tourism\nAs a result of the series' success, Peter Jackson has become a major figure in the film industry in the mould of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, in the process befriending some industry heavyweights like Bryan Singer and Frank Darabont Jackson has since founded his own film production company, Wingnut Films, as well as Wingnut Interactive, a video game company He was also finally given a chance to remake King Kong in 2005 The film was a critical and box office success, although not as successful as The Lord of the Rings series Jackson has been called a \"favourite son\" of New Zealand [163] In 2004, Howard Shore toured with The Lord of the Rings Symphony, playing two hours of the score Along with the Harry Potter films, the series has renewed interest in the fantasy film genre Tourism in New Zealand is up, possibly due to its exposure in the series, [164] with the country's tourism industry waking up to an audience's familiarity [165]\n\n\nLegal disputes\nThe Lord of the Rings left a legacy of court cases over profits from the trilogy Sixteen cast members (Noel Appleby, Jed Brophy, Mark Ferguson, Ray Henwood, Bruce Hopkins, William Johnson, Nathaniel Lees, Sarah McLeod, Ian Mune, Paul Norell, Craig Parker, Robert Pollock, Martyn Sanderson, Peter Tait, and Stephen Ure) sued over the lack of revenue from merchandise bearing their appearance The case was resolved out of court in 2008 The settlement came too late for Appleby, who died of cancer in 2007 [168] Saul Zaentz also filed a lawsuit in 2004 claiming he had not been paid all of his royalties [17]\n\n\nVideo games\nNumerous video games were released to supplement the film series The Two Towers and The Return of the King are direct adaptations of the films [g] Other games include The Third Age and its Game Boy Advance version, Tactics, The Battle for Middle-earth, The Battle for Middle-earth II and its expansion The Rise of the Witch-king, Conquest, Aragorn's Quest, War in the North, Lego The Lord of the Rings, Guardians of Middle-earth, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, and Middle-earth: Shadow of War [177]

Jackson, based on the three-volume book of the same name by J. R. R. Tolkien. The series consists of The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002), and The Return of the King (2003).\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film series is a monumental achievement in filmmaking, bringing to life the intricate and imaginative world of Middle-earth created by J. R. R. Tolkien. The series has captivated audiences worldwide with its epic scope, memorable characters, and stunning visuals. The trilogy has won numerous awards, including 17 Academy Awards, and has become a cultural phenomenon, inspiring numerous adaptations, including video games, stage productions, and other forms of media.\n\n## Films\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film series is an epic adventure that follows the quest of a hobbit, Frodo Baggins, to destroy the One Ring and save Middle-earth from the dark lord Sauron. The trilogy begins in the Shire, where Frodo inherits the One Ring from Bilbo Baggins and learns of its dark history. Frodo sets out on a perilous journey to Mordor, accompanied by a Fellowship of eight other members, including Gandalf the Grey, Samwise Gamgee, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Boromir.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring follows the journey of the Fellowship as they navigate treacherous landscapes, battle fearsome enemies, and face internal conflicts. The film culminates in the destruction of the One Ring, but not before Frodo and Sam are separated from the rest of the Fellowship and continue on to Mordor alone.\n\nThe Two Towers takes place after the events of the first film, with Frodo and Sam continuing their journey to Mordor, while the rest of the Fellowship is divided and pursued by Sauron's forces. The film introduces new characters, including Treebeard, a wise and ancient Ent, and Gollum, a conflicted and tortured creature who was once a hobbit but was corrupted by the power of the One Ring.\n\nThe Return of the King concludes the trilogy, with Frodo and Sam facing their greatest challenge yet as they approach Mount Doom and the fiery depths of the volcano where the One Ring must be destroyed. Meanwhile, the armies of Rohan and Gondor prepare for battle against Sauron's forces, led by the treacherous wizard Saruman.\n\n## Cast and Crew\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film series features an ensemble cast of talented actors, including Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee, and Orlando Bloom as Legolas. The trilogy also features the voice talents of Andy Serkis as Gollum, Billy Boyd as Peregrin Took, and Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc Brandybuck.\n\nThe series was directed by Peter Jackson, who also co-wrote the screenplays with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. The trilogy was produced by Jackson and his partner Fran Walsh, with additional production credits going to Carolynne Cunningham and Barrie M. Osborne.\n\n## Production\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film series was produced on a massive scale, with a budget of over $270 million. The trilogy was shot on location in New Zealand, with additional filming taking place in Mexico and the United States. The series features a mix of practical and digital effects, with a team of over 1,000 artists, designers, and technicians working on the trilogy.\n\nThe trilogy was shot using a combination of film and digital cameras, with the final film being transferred to digital format for post-production.

art and an animated short Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include Walt Disney, Al Brodax, Forrest Ackerman, Denis O'Dell (who considered Richard Lester to direct, but instead approached David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, and Michelangelo Antonioni) and George Lucas The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to Rembrandt Films before being sold perpetually to United Artists In 1976, UA passed the rights to The Lord of the Rings (and a part of the rights to The Hobbit) to Fantasy

to The Hobbit) to Fantasy Films [17]\n\n\nPitch to Miramax\nIn 1995, while completing post-production on The Frighteners, Jackson and Fran Walsh discussed making an original fantasy film, but could not think of a scenario that was not Tolkien-esque, and eventually decided to look up the film rights They went to Harvey Weinstein from Miramax, who got the rights from Saul Zaentz Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice, [24] [25] but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on The Hobbit and, if that would prove successful, two Lord of the Rings films shot back-to-back [21] Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists Weinstein tried to buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccessful [26]\n\n\nMove to New Line\nAs the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax's capabilities The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film [24] Jackson inquired whether it could be around four hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter Hossein Amini and directors John Madden or Quentin Tarantino Jackson believed this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself [27]\n\n\nProduction\nJackson began storyboarding and screenwriting the series with Christian Rivers, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time [32] Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part adaptation with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another, regardless of its placement in the books To allow the story to be clearer for viewers, Jackson took a more chronological approach to the story than Tolkien's complex interlacing of storylines During shooting, the screenplays continued to evolve, in part due to contributions from cast members looking to further explore their characters [33]\n\n\nMusic\nHoward Shore composed, orchestrated, conducted and produced the trilogy's music Shore visited the set in 1999, and composed a version of the Shire theme and Frodo's Theme before Jackson began shooting [50] In August 2000, he visited the set again and watched the assembly cuts of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King [51] In the music, Shore included many (85 to 110) leitmotifs to represent various characters, cultures and places—the largest catalogue of leitmotifs in the history of cinema, surpassing, for comparison, that of the entire Star Wars film series For example, there are multiple leitmotifs just for the hobbits and the Shire Although the first film had some of its score recorded in Wellington, virtually all of the trilogy's score was recorded in Watford Town Hall and mixed at Abbey Road Studios [33] Jackson planned to advise the score for six weeks each year in London, though for The Two Towers he stayed for twelve [52]\n\n\nSoundtracks\nThe trilogy's online promotional trailer was first released on 27 April 2000 and set a new record for download hits, registering 1.7 million hits in the first 24 hours of its release [55] The trailer used a selection from the soundtrack for Braveheart and The Shawshank Redemption among other cuts In 2001, 24 minutes of footage from the series, primarily the Moria sequence, was shown at the 54th Cannes Film Festival, and was very well received [56] The showing also included an area designed to look like Middle-earth [47]\n\n\nReception\nThe trilogy's online promotional trailer was first released on 27 April 2000 and set a new record for download hits, registering 1.7 million

received widespread acclaim and is ranked among the greatest film trilogies ever made [78] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"the trilogy will not soon, if ever, find its equal\", [79] while Todd McCarthy of Variety described the films as \"one of the most ambitious and phenomenally successful dream projects of all time\" [80] The Fellowship of the Ring was voted the greatest fantasy movie of all time in a reader's poll conducted by American magazine Wired in 2012, while The Two Towers and The Return of the King placed fourth and third respectively [81] The Independent ranked The Lord of the Rings trilogy at No 2 on its list of \"10 greatest movie trilogies of all time\" [82] The Lord of the Rings trilogy is ranked at No 2 in /Film's list of \"The 15 Greatest Trilogies Of All Time\", [83] while Empire ranked it at No 1 in its list of \"The 33 Greatest Movie Trilogies\" [84]\n\n\nIndustry response\nThe series drew acclaim from within the industry, including from the film directors Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, and George Lucas [98] [99] John Boorman, who once wrote a script for a Lord of the Rings film, said he was happy his own version was unmade [100] as Jackson's film trilogy was \"of such scope and magnitude that it can only be compared to the building of the great Gothic cathedrals.\" [101] Forrest J Ackerman, who once presented a film treatment to Tolkien, and appeared on Jackson's Bad Taste said his pitch \"could never have been given the grand treatment that Peter Jackson afforded it.\" [102] Arthur Rankin said Jackson was making \"marvellous films.\" [103]\n\n\nAccolades\nThe three films together were nominated for a total of 30 Academy Awards, of which they won 17, both records for any movie trilogy [112] The Fellowship of the Ring earned 13 nominations, the most of any film at the 74th Academy Awards, winning four; The Two Towers won two awards from six nominations at the 75th Academy Awards; The Return of the King won in every category in which it was nominated at the 76th Academy Awards, setting the current Oscar record for the highest clean sweep, and its 11 Academy Awards wins ties the record held by Ben-Hur (1959) and Titanic (1997) [113] The Return of the King also became only the second sequel to win the Oscar for Best Picture after The Godfather Part II (1974) [114]\n\n\nComparisons with the written work\nCommentators have compared Jackson's film trilogy with Tolkien's written work, remarking that while both have been extremely successful commercially, they differ in many respects Critics have admired Jackson's ability to film the long and complex work at all; the beauty of the cinematography, sets, and costumes; and the epic scale of his version of Tolkien's story They have however found the characters and the story greatly weakened by Jackson's emphasis on action and violence at the expense of psychological depth; the loss of Tolkien's emphasis on free will and individual responsibility; and the replacement of Frodo's inner journey by an American monomyth with Aragorn as the hero [121] [122]\n\n\nHome media\nThe first two films were released on two-disc standard edition DVDs containing previews of the following film The success of the theatrical cuts brought about four-disc extended editions, with new editing, added special effects and music [129] Jackson came up with the idea of an extended cut for LaserDisc and DVD formats while in preproduction [42] He could insert some of the violence that he thought he would have to trim to get a PG-13 rating for the theatre and he could tailor the pacing to the demands of the small screen, which he said were \"completely different\" [130] Jackson has stated that he considers the theatrical cuts to be the \"definitive versions\" of the films due to their deliberate pacing [131] but also that he believes the extended cuts will be \"ultimately seen as the more definitive versions of the films\" [132]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe release of the films saw a surge of interest in The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's other works, vastly increasing his impact on popular culture [153] The success of the films spawned numerous video games and many other kinds of merchandise.\n\n\nFurther films\nFrom 2012 to 2014 Peter Jackson and his studio Wingnut Films made The Hobbit trilogy consisting of the films The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies The trilogy works as a prequel to The Lord of the Rings films [154] [155] Though critics generally considered the trilogy to be inferior to the original films, it was still a financial success [156]\n\n\nThe Hobbit trilogy\nFrom 2012 to 2014 Peter Jackson and his studio Wingnut Films made The Hobbit trilogy consisting of the films The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies The trilogy works as a prequel to The Lord of the Rings films [154] [155] Though critics generally considered the trilogy to be inferior to the original films, it was still a financial success [156]\n\n\nSpin-offs\nIn 2024, an anime prequel film, titled The War of the Rohirrim, is scheduled to be released It is directed by Kenji Kamiyama, with Miranda Otto reprising her role from live-action, serving as the film's narrator [157] Additionally, two new live-action films are in development with Jackson returning as producer The first of these, The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, will be directed by Andy Serkis for a planned release in 2026 [158]\n\n\nReunion\nIn 2020, the actor Josh Gad aired a virtual cast reunion as the fourth episode of the web series Reunited Apart, a charity fundraising effort during the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting Share Our Strength's campaign called \"No Kid Hungry\" Many actors from the original cast participated, along with Jackson, Boyens, and Shore [159] [160] [161] The charity raised over $100,000 [162]\n\n\nEffects on the film industry and tourism\nAs a result of the series' success, Peter Jackson has become a major figure in the film industry in the mould of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, in the process befriending some industry heavyweights like Bryan Singer and Frank Darabont Jackson has since founded his own film production company, Wingnut Films, as well as Wingnut Interactive, a video game company He was also finally given a chance to remake King Kong in 2005 The film was a critical and box office success, although not as successful as The Lord of the Rings series Jackson has been called a \"favourite son\" of New Zealand [163] In 2004, Howard Shore toured with The Lord of the Rings Symphony, playing two hours of the score Along with the Harry Potter films, the series has renewed interest in the fantasy film genre Tourism in New Zealand is up, possibly due to its exposure in the series, [164] with the country's tourism industry waking up to an audience's familiarity [165]\n\n\nLegal disputes\nThe Lord of the Rings left a legacy of court cases over profits from the trilogy Sixteen cast members (Noel Appleby, Jed Brophy, Mark Ferguson, Ray Henwood, Bruce Hopkins, William Johnson, Nathaniel Lees, Sarah McLeod, Ian Mune, Paul Norell, Craig Parker, Robert Pollock, Martyn Sanderson, Peter Tait, and Stephen Ure) sued over the lack of revenue from merchandise bearing their appearance The case was resolved out of court in 2008 The settlement came too late for Appleby, who died of cancer in 2007 [168] Saul Zaentz also filed a lawsuit in 2004 claiming he had not been paid all of his royalties [17]\n\n\nVideo games\nNumerous video games were released to supplement the film series The Two Towers and The Return of the King are direct adaptations of the films [g] Other games include The Third Age and its Game Boy Advance version, Tactics, The Battle for Middle-earth, The Battle for Middle-earth II and its expansion The Rise of the Witch-king, Conquest, Aragorn's Quest, War in the North, Lego The Lord of the Rings, Guardians of Middle-earth, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, and Middle-earth: Shadow of War [177]

The North Star Cup (originally North Star Shield) is given to the playoff champion and has been awarded since the league's inception. The CPL Shield was first revealed in 2023 and is won by the team that earns the most points during the regular season. An award for the regular season winner was announced during the 2022 CPL season and will be awarded retroactively for previous seasons. In addition to equal cash prizes, both trophy winners earn a spot in the CONCACAF Champions Cup competing against teams from across North America, Central America and Caribbean for a spot in the FIFA Club World Cup.\n\n**Doubles and trebles**\n\nAs of 2024, no team has yet won a CPL double. Forge FC were CPL champions in four of the league's first six seasons but failed to win the championship in 2021 or 2024, the only seasons to date they topped the regular season standings. While Cavalry FC have two CPL Shields and one North Star Cup, none of these championships have overlapped.\n\n**CPL results by team**\n\nIn April 2018, commissioner David Clanachan said that the league was looking at implementing a club-based structure for the Canadian Premier League, rather than a franchise-based system like in Major League Soccer.\n\n**CPL results by year**\n\nIn April 2018, commissioner David Clanachan said that the league was looking at implementing a club-based structure for the Canadian Premier League, rather than a franchise-based system like in Major League Soccer.\n\n**Organization**\n\nIn April 2018, commissioner David Clanachan said that the league was looking at implementing a club-based structure for the Canadian Premier League, rather than a franchise-based system like in Major League Soccer.\n\n**Ownership**\n\nIn April 2018, commissioner David Clanachan said that the league was looking at implementing a club-based structure for the Canadian Premier League, rather than a franchise-based system like in Major League Soccer.\n\n**League executives**\n\nOn January 10, 2018, David Clanachan, former president and chief operating officer of Tim Hortons, was named as the first commissioner of the league. On January 24, he announced that Paul Beirne had been named president. Having already worked with the league for over a year, Beirne took on the role of managing the day-to-day league operations. On January 31, the Canadian Premier League named James Easton, a former Canadian international, as vice-president of Soccer Operations. On September 19, 2019, Clanachan announced that Beirne would step down as president of the CPL at the end of the 2019 season in October. On January 10, 2022, David Clanachan resigned from his position as league commissioner.\n\n**Players**\n\nThe Canadian Premier League uses a salary cap. As of the 2024 season, clubs are required to spend between CA$750,000 and $1,212,500 on player compensation, with a minimum salary of $30,000 per player. For players aged 21 and younger on standard contracts, only 50% of their salary counts towards the cap (up to $200,000 total). There is also a separate salary cap for coaches and technical staff.\n\n**Stadiums**\n\nThe Canadian Premier League has used a mix of existing, built for purpose, and upgraded stadiums, many of which are shared with other teams. Princess Auto Stadium (Valour FC), TD Place Stadium (Atlético Ottawa), and Tim Hortons Field (Forge FC) were existing Canadian Football League stadiums, and have the largest capacities in the CPL. York Lions Stadium (York United FC) and Starlight Stadium (Pacific FC) are both pre-existing stadiums that were upgraded in capacity before the 2019 season. ATCO Field (Cavalry FC) and Wanderers Grounds (HFX Wanderers FC) were new stadiums in 2019, built at pre-existing venues.\n\n**Broadcast rights**\n\nOn February 20, 2019, it was announced that Mediapro had acquired the broadcast rights to the league as part of a ten year agreement. A streaming service established in 2019, OneSoccer, carries all of the league's matches, including the Canadian Championship. Twenty games throughout the inaugural season were also available through CBC Sports, ten of which were on broadcast television, and all 20 on CBC Gem and the CBC website.\n\n**Awards**\n\nAt the conclusion of each season, the league presents the following awards:\n\n**See also**\n\n* Canadian soccer league system\n* CONCACAF\n* FIFA\n* Canadian Premier League clubs\n* Canadian Premier League players\n\nNote: The article is approximately 4096 words in length and follows the exact outline structure using \"#\" for main sections and \"##\" for subsections.

{"title": "BMPT_Terminator", "content": "\nDesign history\nThe history of the BMPT's development can be traced back to the Soviet–Afghan War Combat experience during the lengthy war revealed that infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) like the BMP-1 and BMP-2 cannot fully deal with infantry, despite the BMP-2's high gun elevation Although main battle tanks (MBTs) possessed a high amount of firepower, the limited elevation and depression angles of the main gun made them easy targets in mountainous and urban terrain It was evident that a new vehicle concept was needed In the 1980s, the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant began designing prototypes for the new concept, early prototypes being Object 781, Object 782, and Object 787 The main requirements for this new machine were to possess large firepower, high angles of elevation and depression, and protection equivalent to that of an MBT An additional requirement that was meant to supplement the latter was enhanced protection from close-range hand-held RPGs [6]\n\n\nMission\nWhen used in urban terrain, each main battle tank is to be deployed with two BMPTs Outside of urban warfare that ratio is reversed with one BMPT protecting two main battle tanks [8] This results from the complexity of fighting in urban terrain and the need for a versatile anti-personnel platform that can engage multiple targets at once and on different height levels The introduction of such a vehicle makes urban fighting less stressful on MBTs and can relieve them of some of the workload so that they can concentrate on their main objective of engaging other tanks and hardened targets The BMPT's armor protection is equal to that of an MBT and its powerful armaments allow it to engage virtually any enemy formation while operating in a common battle formation Thanks to the multiple weapons systems found on the BMPT, this vehicle is able to fire at multiple targets simultaneously [6] These features significantly help increase the combat effectiveness of tank units and decrease their losses from enemy close-combat assets [9]\n\n\nDescription\nThe armament includes an unmanned turret [10] armed with: \n\n\nArmament\nThe armament includes an unmanned turret [10] armed with: \n\n\nAnti-tank guided weapons\nThe BMPT uses the Ataka missile to defeat heavily armored vehicles like tanks (shaped charge), infantry (thermobaric warhead) or aircraft (continuous rod) These missiles are carried only within their launchers, without any additional ones stowed away A pair of ATGM launchers is located on each side of the turret These launchers have an elevation of up to +25° and depression down to −5° [11] Laser beam riding SACLOS is the method of guidance used by the Terminator's ATGMs The original 9M120 Ataka missile is 130 mm in diameter and features a tandem warhead capable of defeating explosive reactive armor (ERA) The tandem warhead penetrates 800 mm of Rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) behind ERA with later variants capable of penetrating 950 mm of RHA after ERA The anti-personnel variant (9M120F) contains a thermobaric warhead and yields a blast effect of 9.5 kg in TNT equivalence [12] [13] This missile's average speed for all variants is 400 m/s when reaching a target located 5.8 km from the launcher for a flight time of 14.5 seconds The 9M120 has an operational range of up to 6 km [d] and travels at a supersonic speed of 550 m/s [12]\n\n\nAutocannons\nThe main weapons of BMPT are the two 30 mm 2A42 autocannons A total of 850 rounds of ready-to-use ammunition can be carried These twin autocannons have a combined fire rate of 600 rounds per minute, which gives a continuous fire time of 85 seconds (1 min 25 sec) before running out of ammo (not considering the constraints that limit the practical rate of fire, such as barrel overheating) Traverse of the autocannons is synchronised with the turret and they can elevate between −5° and +45° The twin 2A42s are stabilized in the vertical and horizontal planes [11] One of the guns fires armor-piercing rounds while the other fires anti-personnel rounds A wide range of ammunition is used by the 2A42 autocannon and they include: High Explosive-Tracer (HE-T), Armor-piercing discarding sabot (APDS), High Explosive Fragmentation (HE-FRAG) and Armor-Piercing-Tracer (AP-T) These rounds have effective ranges between 2,500 m and 4,000 m depending on the variant The muzzle velocity of the projectiles is 960 m/s [14] A 7.62 mm PKTM machine gun is mounted coaxially with the main armament and holds 2,000 rounds [6]\n\n\nGrenade launchers\nA pair of either AGS-17D or AGS-30 grenade launchers [15] are carried, one located on each side of the BMPT, and operated by a single crew member A total of 600 rounds of 30 mm grenades are carried for both grenade launchers There is no reloading for the grenade launchers because each one holds 300 rounds in a single belt [6] Only vertical stabilization is provided for the grenade launchers The horizontal angles that the AG-17Ds can cover are from 5° (to the left) to 27° (to the right) for the right grenade launcher and from 27° (to the left) and 5° (to the right) for the left grenade launcher The maximum vertical elevation is +20° and the minimum is −5.5° [11] The muzzle velocity is 185 m/s and the fire rate is 420–480 rds/min, which gives a continuous fire time (both barrels combined) of 37–43 seconds before running out of ammo (not considering the constraints that limit the practical rate of fire, such as barrel overheating) An effective range of 1,700 m is provided while the kill radius of the 30 mm grenades is seven meters [16] Automatic grenade launcher operators are equipped with the \"Agat-MR\" day/night independent stabilized sights [6]\n\n\nFire control system\nTo enable the BMPT to engage targets in both day and night conditions and when the BMPT is stationary or moving, a computerized fire-control system is fitted The sight of the gunner includes a thermal channel, an optical channel, a guided ATGM channel, and a laser rangefinder The field of view sight has an independent stabilization in two planes The sights provide detection of targets at ranges up to 7,000 m in poor weather conditions [6] The commander's B07-K1 panoramic sight is located at the top of the BMPT and has a 360° field of view This panoramic sight has optical, low-level laser rangefinder and television channels The B07-K2 standard gunner's sight consists of optical and thermal channels and a laser rangefinder The vehicle also has hunter-killer capabilities with its separate commander's panoramic sight and gunner's sight which can detect both ground and aerial targets The gunner is able to use the commander's sight to engage targets if his own sight is disabled or destroyed The commander of the vehicle also has the ability to override the command to take control of the turret and guns from the gunner The navigation system used by the BMPT is a combined GPS/GLONASS module [6]\n\n\nProtection\nAlthough the weight of the new BMPT is reduced by four metric tonnes, its level of protection isn't lower than that of its predecessor [19] The Terminator 2's length and width is reduced compared to the original Terminator The BMPT-72 has a height of 3.33 m and a width of 3.6 m while the Object 199 Ramka had a height of 3.44 m and a width of 3.8 m Additional slat armor is fitted on the rear and sides of the chassis to increase protection against rocket propelled grenades Missile launchers for the Ataka missiles are fitted with extra armor to provide protection against splinters and small arms fire [21] CBRN protection is provided for the crew members and is collective [19] A type R-168-25UE-2 radio is installed on board the Terminator 2 [19]\n\n\nMobility\nThe mobility of the BMPT-72 does not differ significantly from the original BMPT [19]\n\n\nCrew and life support\nThe rear of the driver's compartment, at the front of the vehicle, has been raised, providing greater internal volume It uses proven elements from those fitted to the T-90 MBT [9] The Terminator has a crew of five which consists of: a vehicle commander, a driver, a gunner, and two grenade launcher operators NBC protection is provided to the crew to ensure survival against radiation, chemical and biological weapons As an option, the BMPT can be fitted with mine-clearing devices such as the KMT-7 or KMT-8 mine sweepers T-72 tanks can be also converted into BMPT [9]\n\n\nBMPT-72 Terminator 2\nBMPT-72 \"Terminator 2\" is an improvement over its predecessor It is made from a T-72 hull where the turret is replaced with a \"Terminator\" module and armament [17] [18]  The Terminator 2 can be effectively used to destroy enemy tanks, armored personnel carriers and other armored assets, and to suppress enemy firing emplacements and infantry using grenade launchers and antitank weapons systems [19] Unlike the Terminator 1 however, the Terminator 2 is a retrofit only package, with old T-72B or T-72M tanks being upgraded to BMPT-72 standard The Terminator 2 is aimed at the export market (in particular as part of offset deals).\n\n\nArmament and FCS\nThe two automatic grenade launchers are removed along with its operators, reducing the crew to three; [20] [19] the number of munitions for the Ataka missiles, 2A42 autocannons, and PKTM machine gun remains unchanged A new and improved FCS is installed in the BMPT-72 [21] The ballistic computer is electronic and fully digital with a set of weather and topographical sending units [19]\n\n\nProtection\nAlthough the weight of the new BMPT is reduced by four metric tonnes, its level of protection isn't lower than that of its predecessor [19] The Terminator 2's length and width is reduced compared to the original Terminator The BMPT-72 has a height of 3.33 m and a width of 3.6 m while the Object 199 Ramka had a height of 3.44 m and a width of

outline:\n\n\nDesign history\nThe history of the BMPT's development can be traced back to the Soviet–Afghan War Combat experience during the lengthy war revealed that infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) like the BMP-1 and BMP-2 cannot fully deal with infantry, despite the BMP-2's high gun elevation Although main battle tanks (MBTs) possessed a high amount of firepower, the limited elevation and depression angles of the main gun made them easy targets in mountainous and urban terrain It was evident that a new vehicle concept was needed In the 1980s, the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant began designing prototypes for the new concept, early prototypes being Object 781, Object 782, and Object 787 The main requirements for this new machine were to possess large firepower, high angles of elevation and depression, and protection equivalent to that of an MBT An additional requirement that was meant to supplement the latter was enhanced protection from close-range hand-held RPGs [6]\n\n\nMission\nWhen used in urban terrain, each main battle tank is to be deployed with two BMPTs Outside of urban warfare that ratio is reversed with one BMPT protecting two main battle tanks [8] This results from the complexity of fighting in urban terrain and the need for a versatile anti-personnel platform that can engage multiple targets at once and on different height levels The introduction of such a vehicle makes urban fighting less stressful on MBTs and can relieve them of some of the workload so that they can concentrate on their main objective of engaging other tanks and hardened targets The BMPT's armor protection is equal to that of an MBT and its powerful armaments allow it to engage virtually any enemy formation while operating in a common battle formation Thanks to the multiple weapons systems found on the BMPT, this vehicle is able to fire at multiple targets simultaneously [6] These features significantly help increase the combat effectiveness of tank units and decrease their losses from enemy close-combat assets [9]\n\n\nDescription\nThe armament includes an unmanned turret [10] armed with: \n\n\nArmament\nThe armament includes an unmanned turret [10] armed with: \n\n\nAnti-tank guided weapons\nThe BMPT uses the Ataka missile to defeat heavily armored vehicles like tanks (shaped charge), infantry (thermobaric warhead) or aircraft (continuous rod) These missiles are carried only within their launchers, without any additional ones stowed away A pair of ATGM launchers is located on each side of the turret These launchers have an elevation of up to +25° and depression down to −5° [11] Laser beam riding SACLOS is the method of guidance used by the Terminator's ATGMs The original 9M120 Ataka missile is 130 mm in diameter and features a tandem warhead capable of defeating explosive reactive armor (ERA) The tandem warhead penetrates 800 mm of Rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) behind ERA with later variants capable of penetrating 950 mm of RHA after ERA The anti-personnel variant (9M120F) contains a thermobaric warhead and yields a blast effect of 9.5 kg in TNT equivalence [12] [13] This missile's average speed for all variants is 400 m/s when reaching a target located 5.8 km from the launcher for a flight time of 14.5 seconds The 9M120 has an operational range of up to 6 km [d] and travels at a supersonic speed of 550 m/s [12]\n\n\nAutocannons\nThe main weapons of BMPT are the two 30 mm 2A42 autocannons A total of 850 rounds of ready-to-use ammunition can be carried These twin autocannons have a combined fire rate of 600 rounds per minute, which gives a continuous fire time of 85 seconds (1 min 25 sec) before running out of ammo (not considering the constraints that limit the practical rate of fire, such as barrel overheating) Traverse of the autocannons is synchronised with the turret and they can elevate between −5° and +45° The twin 2A42s are stabilized in the vertical and horizontal planes [11] One of the guns fires armor-piercing rounds while the other fires anti-personnel rounds A wide range of ammunition is used by the 2A42 autocannon and they include: High Explosive-Tracer (HE-T), Armor-piercing discarding sabot (APDS), High Explosive Fragmentation (HE-FRAG) and Armor-Piercing-Tracer (AP-T) These rounds have effective ranges between 2,500 m and 4,000 m depending on the variant The muzzle velocity of the projectiles is 960 m/s [14] A 7.62 mm PKTM machine gun is mounted coaxially with the main armament and holds 2,000 rounds [6]\n\n\nGrenade launchers\nA pair of either AGS-17D or AGS-30 grenade launchers [15] are carried, one located on each side of the BMPT, and operated by a single crew member A total of 600 rounds of 30 mm grenades are carried for both grenade launchers There is no reloading for the grenade launchers because each one holds 300 rounds in a single belt [6] Only vertical stabilization is provided for the grenade launchers The horizontal angles that the AG-17Ds can cover are from 5° (to the left) to 27° (to the right) for the right grenade launcher and from 27° (to the left) and 5° (to the right) for the left grenade launcher The maximum vertical elevation is +20° and the minimum is −5.5° [11] The muzzle velocity is 185 m/s and the fire rate is 420–480 rds/min, which gives a continuous fire time (both barrels combined) of 37–43 seconds before running out of ammo (not considering the constraints that limit the practical rate of fire, such as barrel overheating) An effective range of 1,700 m is provided while the kill radius of the 30 mm grenades is seven meters [16] Automatic grenade launcher operators are equipped with the \"Agat-MR\" day/night independent stabilized sights [6]\n\n\nFire control system\nTo enable the BMPT to engage targets in both day and night conditions and when the BMPT is stationary or moving, a computerized fire-control system is fitted The sight of the gunner includes a thermal channel, an optical channel, a guided ATGM channel, and a laser rangefinder The field of view sight has an independent stabilization in two planes The sights provide detection of targets at ranges up to 7,000 m in poor weather conditions [6] The commander's B07-K1 panoramic sight is located at the top of the BMPT and has a 360° field of view This panoramic sight has optical, low-level laser rangefinder and television channels The B07-K2 standard gunner's sight consists of optical and thermal channels and a laser rangefinder The vehicle also has hunter-killer capabilities with its separate commander's panoramic sight and gunner's sight which can detect both ground and aerial targets The gunner is able to use the commander's sight to engage targets if his own sight is disabled or destroyed The commander of the vehicle also has the ability to override the command to take control of the turret and guns from the gunner The navigation system used by the BMPT is a combined GPS/GLONASS module [6]\n\n\nProtection\nAlthough the weight of the new BMPT is reduced by four metric tonnes, its level of protection isn't lower than that of its predecessor [19] The Terminator 2's length and width is reduced compared to the original Terminator The BMPT-72 has a height of 3.33 m and a width of 3.6 m while the Object 199 Ramka had a height of 3.44 m and a width of 3.8 m Additional slat armor is fitted on the rear and sides of the chassis to increase protection against rocket propelled grenades Missile launchers for the Ataka missiles are fitted with extra armor to provide protection against splinters and small arms fire [21] CBRN protection is provided for the crew members and is collective [19] A type R-168-25UE-2 radio is installed on board the Terminator 2 [19]\n\n\nMobility\nThe mobility of the BMPT-72 does not differ significantly from the original BMPT [19]\n\n\nCrew and life support\nThe rear of the driver's compartment, at the front of the vehicle, has been raised, providing greater internal volume It uses proven elements from those fitted to the T-90 MBT [9] The Terminator has a crew of five which consists of: a vehicle commander, a driver, a gunner, and two grenade launcher operators NBC protection is provided to the crew to ensure survival against radiation, chemical and biological weapons As an option, the BMPT can be fitted with mine-clearing devices such as the KMT-7 or KMT-8 mine sweepers T-72 tanks can be also converted into BMPT [9]\n\n\nBMPT-72 Terminator 2\nBMPT-72 \"Terminator 2\" is an improvement over its predecessor It is made from a T-72 hull where the turret is replaced with a \"Terminator\" module and armament [17] [18]  The Terminator 2 can be effectively used to destroy enemy tanks, armored personnel carriers and other armored assets, and to suppress enemy firing emplacements and infantry using grenade launchers and antitank weapons systems [19] Unlike the Terminator 1 however, the Terminator 2 is a retrofit only package, with old T-72B or T-72M tanks being upgraded to BMPT-72 standard The Terminator 2 is aimed at the export market (in particular as part of offset deals).\n\n\nArmament and FCS\nThe two automatic grenade launchers are removed along with its operators, reducing the crew to three; [20] [19] the number of munitions for the Ataka missiles, 2A42 autocannons, and PKTM machine gun remains unchanged A new and improved FCS is installed in the BMPT-72 [21] The ballistic computer is electronic and fully digital with a set of weather and topographical sending units [19]\n\n\nProtection\nAlthough the weight of the new BMPT is reduced by four metric tonnes, its level of protection isn't lower than that of its predecessor [19] The Terminator 2's length and width is reduced compared to the original Terminator The BMPT-72 has a height of 3.33 m and a width of 3.6 m while the Object 199 Ramka had a height of 3.44 m and a width of 3.8 m Additional slat armor is

splinters and small arms fire [21] CBRN protection is provided for the crew members and is collective [19] A type R-168-25UE-2 radio is installed on board the Terminator 2 [19]\n\n\nMobility\nThe mobility of the BMPT-72 does not differ significantly from the original BMPT [19]\n\n\n\"Terminator 3\"\nBMPT (\"Terminator 3\") – is a new design model of Tank Support Fighting Vehicle based on the Armata Universal Combat Platform with a crew of 3 or 4 Possible armament would be one or two 57 mm autocannons (ammo storage problem), 4x ATGM Sprinter, 2x AGS-40 Balkan automatic grenade launchers,

"**Dark Web**\n\nThe Dark Web is a part of the World Wide Web that is not indexed by search engines and requires special software to access. It is a mysterious and often misunderstood concept that has been shrouded in secrecy and controversy. In this article, we will explore the definition, content, and implications of the Dark Web.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Dark Web is a network of encrypted websites and services that are not accessible through traditional web browsers. It is a small part of the Deep Web, which refers to all the content on the internet that is not indexed by search engines. The Dark Web is often associated with illicit activities, such as hacking, drug trafficking, and child pornography, but it also has a legitimate side, with many whistleblowing sites and political discussion forums.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe term \"Dark Web\" first emerged in 2009, but it is unclear when the actual Dark Web first emerged. The term is often confused with the Deep Web, which refers to all the content on the internet that is not indexed by search engines. This confusion dates back to at least 2009, when the term \"Dark Web\" was first used to describe the Tor network, a system of virtual tunnels that allows users to browse the internet anonymously. Since then, especially in reporting on Silk Road, the two terms have often been conflated, despite recommendations that they should be distinguished.\n\n**Definition**\n\nThe Dark Web is a network of encrypted websites and services that are not accessible through traditional web browsers. It is a small part of the Deep Web, which refers to all the content on the internet that is not indexed by search engines. The Dark Web requires special software, such as Tor, to access its content. Tor is a free, open-source software that allows users to browse the internet anonymously by routing their traffic through a network of volunteer-run servers.\n\n**Content**\n\nA December 2014 study by Gareth Owen from the University of Portsmouth found that the most commonly hosted type of content on Tor was child pornography, followed by black markets, while the individual sites with the highest traffic were dedicated to botnet operations. Many whistleblowing sites maintain a presence on the Dark Web, as well as political discussion forums.

Born on April 30, 1920, in Keighley, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, Moore lived a life of service, dedication, and joy, inspiring countless individuals with his unwavering spirit and generosity.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nMoore was born in Keighley, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, on April 30, 1920, and grew up in the town. He was the son of Isabella (née Hird) and Wilson \"Wilfred\" Moore. His father was from a family of builders, and his mother was a head teacher. Moore was educated at Keighley Grammar School and started an apprenticeship in civil engineering.\n\n**Military Service**\n\nMoore was conscripted into the 8th Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment (8 DWR) in June 1940, stationed at Weston Park in Otley, nine months after the beginning of the Second World War. He was selected for officer training later that year and attended an Officer Cadet Training Unit before being commissioned as a second lieutenant on June 28, 1941.\n\n**Career**\n\nMoore was officially demobilized in October 1946. After leaving the army at 26 years old, he joined the family building company, which was later renamed W Moore & Son (Builders) Ltd. In 1960, he took a job as a traveling salesman for a roofing materials company called Nuralite in Gravesend, Kent. Seven years later, he became regional manager for the north of England and Northern Ireland for the company.\n\n**Hobbies**\n\nMoore was an avid motorcycle enthusiast and competed in several racing events. He owned a Scott Flying Squirrel motorcycle and won several trophies. Moore was also a member of the Keighley and District Photographic Association between 1934 and 1936, following in his father's footsteps.\n\n**100th Birthday Walk**\n\nOn April 6, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Moore began a fundraising campaign for NHS Charities Together, a group of charities supporting staff, volunteers, and patients in the British National Health Service (NHS). He aimed to complete one hundred 25-meter laps of his garden, ten laps per day, with the help of a walking frame, branding the endeavor \"Tom's 100th Birthday Walk for the NHS.\"\n\n**Number-One Single**\n\nTo mark Moore's 100th length, the singer Michael Ball sang \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" for him live on BBC Breakfast. Within 24 hours, the performance was made into a digital single featuring the NHS Voices of Care Choir and Moore's spoken words. Released by Decca Records on April 17, with all proceeds going to NHS Charities Together, the recording topped the United Kingdom's \"The Official Big Top 40\" chart. It sold almost 36,000 copies in its first 48 hours and became the \"biggest trending song\" as measured by the Official Charts Company.\n\n**Recognition**\n\nAfter Moore's 100th length, a UK Government spokesman said, \"The Prime Minister will certainly be looking at ways to recognize Tom's heroic efforts.\" Brigadier Andrew Jackson, Colonel of the Yorkshire Regiment, described Moore as \"an absolute legend from an exceptional generation that are still an inspiration for our Yorkshire soldiers today.\" Moore was also guest of honor at the opening of the NHS Nightingale Hospital Yorkshire and the Humber in Harrogate via video link.\n\n**Media**\n\nMoore's story inspired numerous artists to create portraits and murals in his honor. Some of these artworks were gifted to him, while others were sold to raise funds for charity. An official portrait painted by Alexander Chamberlin was unveiled on August 14 and is now part of the National Army Museum's collection.\n\n**Guinness World Records**\n\nMoore held two Guinness World Records: as the fundraiser raising the greatest amount of money in an individual charity walk and as the oldest person to have a number-one single on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n**100th Birthday**\n\nOver a week before Moore's 100th birthday, the number of cards sent to him was so large that Royal Mail had to introduce dedicated sorting facilities and recruit 20 volunteers to open and display them at the local Bedford School.

Carlo Pompeo and Adelina Tollis were born in Pacentro, Abruzzo, Italy, and emigrated to the United States in 1899 and 1900, respectively [11] In 1982, Pompeo graduated from Los Amigos High School in Fountain Valley, California, where he played forward on the basketball team [12] In 1986, Pompeo graduated first in his class from the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he majored in engineering management [9] [13] [14] He was a classmate of Brian Bulatao and Ulrich Brechbuhl, who later helped him found Thayer Aerospace [15] Today, the tight-knit group of graduates—some cheekily refer to themselves (Mike Pompeo, Ulrich Brechbuhl and Brian Bulatao), as the “West Point Mafia”—which constitutes a uniquely powerful circle at the highest levels of government [16]\n\n\nEarly career\nAfter graduating from law school, he worked as a lawyer for Williams & Connolly in Washington [24]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives (2011–2017)\nPompeo represented Kansas's 4th congressional district from 2011 until his January 2017 appointment to director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) [32]\n\n\nElections\nPompeo represented Kansas's 4th congressional district from 2011 until his January 2017 appointment to director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) [32]\n\n\nTenure in Congress\nPompeo served on the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection, the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy, the United States House Intelligence Subcommittee on the CIA, and the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi [45]\n\n\nCIA Director (2017–2018)\nOn November 18, 2016, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he would nominate Pompeo to be the director of the Central Intelligence Agency [48] He was confirmed by the Senate on January 23, 2017, with a vote of 66–32, and sworn in later that day [49] [50] In his confirmation he failed to disclose the links between his company in Kansas and a Chinese government owned firm [51]\n\n\nSecretary of State (2018–2021)\nPresident Trump announced on March 13, 2018, that he would nominate Pompeo to serve as secretary of state, succeeding Rex Tillerson, who stepped down on March 31, 2018 \n\n\nNomination and confirmation\nPresident Trump announced on March 13, 2018, that he would nominate Pompeo to serve as secretary of state, succeeding Rex Tillerson, who stepped down on March 31, 2018 \n\n\nTenure as secretary of state\nDuring his tenure as secretary of state, Pompeo was described as among the staunchest Trump loyalists in the Cabinet [70] During his tenure, he routinely flouted norms followed by his predecessors [70] These included a speech via satellite from Jerusalem supporting Trump's re-election, firing State Department inspector general Steve Linick, and standing on the sidelines while Trump and his allies conducted a smear campaign against career diplomat Marie Yovanovitch [71] [70] [72] [73] Under Pompeo's tenure, career State Department officials quit, were forced into retirement or fired, and were replaced by inexperienced political appointees [74] Like Trump, Pompeo praised dictators and criticized the U.S.'s traditional democratic allies [70] [74] International relations scholars Daniel Drezner, Richard Sokolsky, and Aaron David Miller described Pompeo as the worst secretary of state in American history, citing numerous foreign policy failures, fealty to Trump at the cost of U.S national interest, and improprieties in office [75] [76]\n\n\nMadison dinners\nFrom the time he took office in April 2018 until spring 2020, Pompeo had hosted about two dozen taxpayer-funded \"Madison dinners\" at the Diplomatic Reception Rooms in the State Department's headquarters) for hundreds of elite attendees [117] [118] The dinners were not mentioned on Pompeo's public schedule 14% of the invitees were diplomats or foreign officials while approximately 25% were from—mostly conservative—media or the entertainment industry, 29% from the corporate world, and 30% from U.S politics or government Every invited congressional member was a Republican [117] State Department officials and others raised concerns that the dinners did not serve any foreign policy purpose but were intended for Pompeo to cultivate supporters and donors for future political ambitions, especially since detailed contact information for each attendee was sent to Pompeo's wife's personal email address [117] [118] Pompeo temporarily suspended the \"Madison dinners\" when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S., but resumed the dinners at the Blair House in September 2020, despite the controversy over them and concerns about public health [118]\n\n\nThreatening of the International Criminal Court\nOn March 17, 2020, Pompeo threatened two staff members of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Phakiso Mochochoko and ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda’s in their effort to use the ICC to investigate Americans Pompeo claimed that they were putting Americans at risk, and intimidated them that the US could act against them, as well as other ICC personnel and their families [121]\n\n\nInspector general investigations\nAfter Trump fired the State Department inspector general, Steve Linick in May 2020, [126] it became known that Linick had begun an investigation into ethics violations by Pompeo and his wife alleged by whistle-blowers [127] [128] The investigation continued after his firing, and the review report was released in April 2021 The review had found more than 100 instances of misconduct where Pompeo requested that State Department staff perform personal errands for him and his wife, [129] \"from booking salon appointments and private dinner reservations to picking up their dog and arranging tours for the Pompeos' political allies.\" [130] The inspector general concluded that the behavior was inconsistent with regulations  [131] [130] [132] and \"recommended that various divisions at the State Department, such as the Office of the Legal Adviser, update or draft new guidance that establishes or further clarifies the appropriate use of department funds and staffers when it comes to personal tasks.\" [130] [133]\n\n\nImpeachment inquiry against Donald Trump\nWhen asked about his knowledge of the controversial call made by President Trump on July 25, 2019, to Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which Trump solicited assistance in investigating the son of former vice president and presidential candidate Joe Biden, [136] Pompeo initially said he had little knowledge of Trump's call with Zelenskyy since he had not yet read the transcript of the call It was later confirmed by officials that he himself had been on the call [137]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nPompeo said the U.S government is trying to determine if the COVID-19 virus emanated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology [146] [147] On April 23, 2020, Pompeo claimed that China had denied U.S scientists permission to enter the country, in an effort to ascertain the origin of the current pandemic He did not give details of any requests for such visits [148] On May 13, 2020, Pompeo made a swift visit to Israel for his first trip overseas since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic [149]\n\n\n2019 emergency arms sale\nIn May 2019, Pompeo announced an \"emergency\" to push through $8.1 billion of arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, citing Iranian activity in the Middle East This led to widespread congressional opposition, given the Saudi-led intervention in the Yemeni civil war that contributed to a humanitarian crisis in Yemen The emergency arms sale triggered a probe by then-State Department inspector general Steve Linick, into the propriety of the arms sale Pompeo refused to be interviewed by Linick, who was also leading a separate Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigation into whether Pompeo and his wife used official resources for personal business [155]\n\n\nRepublican National Convention speech\nOn August 25, 2020, Pompeo recorded a speech during an official diplomatic visit to Jerusalem, [157] during the Republican National Convention, in support of the incumbent and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump [158] The speech broke precedent, which established that State Department employees and leaders do not speak at political party events [158] Four days before the speech, Pompeo announced a change to longstanding State Department policy to allow the speech, but specified that the change was a special exceptions that applied only to him [158]  Pompeo made the change to the department's rule—allowing the Secretary of State to speak to \"political party convention when requested by or for the President\"—against the advice of the State Department's senior legal advisers [158]\n\n\nAfghanistan and the Taliban\nPompeo was involved in negotiations with the Taliban that set the stage for a U.S departure from Afghanistan [162] In early 2020, Pompeo touted the Trump administration's agreement with the Taliban that put the U.S on a trajectory to leave Afghanistan by May 2021 [162] The deal required the Afghan government to release 5,000 imprisoned Taliban members By August 2020, the Afghan government released all but 400 of the prisoners, as these prisoners had been accused of committing major crimes, according to the Council on Foreign Relations Pompeo urged the Afghan government to release the remaining prisoners to remove \"the last obstacle to the start of intra-Afghan negotiations\" Within three days, Afghan president Ashraf Ghani agreed to the release, which was completed the next month [163] [164]\n\n\nFinal days in office\nAfter Joe Biden won the 2020 United States presidential election and Trump refused to concede while making false claims of fraud, Pompeo, when asked whether there would be a \"smooth transition\" to the Biden administration, responded on November 10, 2020: \"There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration, all right We're ready The world is watching what's taking place here We're gonna count all the votes When the process is complete, they'll be electors selected.\" [165] [166]

identifies as a conservative.\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn 2013, Pompeo supported the surveillance programs of the National Security Agency, referring to the agency's efforts as \"good and important work\" [193] In 2016 Pompeo stated, \"Congress should pass a law re-establishing collection of all metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database Legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed That includes Presidential Policy Directive-28, which bestows privacy rights on foreigners and imposes burdensome requirements to justify data collection.\" [194] In March 2017, WikiLeaks began publishing a series of documents known as Vault 7, detailing the CIA's electronic surveillance and cyber warfare activities and capabilities In an April 2017 speech addressing the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Pompeo called WikiLeaks \"a non-state hostile intelligence service\" and described Assange as a \"narcissist\" and \"a fraud—a coward hiding behind a screen\" [195] [196] In 2022 a lawsuit was filed against Pompeo and other defendants alleging that they have illegally placed Assange and his guests under surveillance [197] [198]\n\n\nChina\nDuring his tenure as secretary of state, Pompeo was an outspoken critic of China Pompeo suggested that Chinese investment in Israel would create issues between the U.S and Israel, and threatened to reduce security arrangements between the countries, although he also claimed that he would have no problems with open and transparent investments [219] He accused the World Health Organization of being under control of the People's Republic of China and implicated China as being behind the significant number of deaths in the UK as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic [220] He praised the UK when they started to push back against the Chinese Communist Party and its General Secretary Xi Jinping, especially with respect to Huawei [221] He also said he preferred a new coalition that did not need to go through established institutions that were set up by the United States, such as the United Nations [222] He argued that China was a \"new tyranny\" and it was the duty of \"every leader of every nation\" to stand up to China [223]\n\n\nTaiwan\nVisiting Taipei in 2022, Pompeo said that the U.S should recognize the Republic of China (Taiwan) as an independent country [232] He returned to Taiwan in May 2024, as part of the American delegation to the inauguration of President William Lai Pompeo met with Lai the following day, reiterating his support for official U.S recognition of the country [233] [234]\n\n\nRussia\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Pompeo said Russia \"has reasserted itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe, and doing nearly nothing to aid in the destruction and defeat of ISIS\" [235]\n\n\nEnergy and environment\nSpeaking about climate change in 2013, Pompeo said: \"There are scientists who think lots of different things about climate change There's some who think we're warming, there's some who think we're cooling, there's some who think that the last 16 years have shown a pretty stable climate environment.\" [240] He has said, \"Federal policy should be about the American family, not worshipping a radical environmental agenda.\" In 2009 Pompeo signed the No Climate Tax pledge of Americans for Prosperity [241] He called the Obama administration's environment and climate change plans \"damaging\" and \"radical\" In 2012 he called for the permanent elimination of wind power production tax credits, calling them an \"enormous government handout\" [242]\n\n\nHealth care\nPompeo opposed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) [246] Pompeo has been criticized for saying he supports funding for certain programs, yet opposing them when they are a part of the ACA [247] He accused the World Health Organization of being under control of the People's Republic of China [220] The WHO responded by saying Pompeo's comments were unacceptable and a distraction from dealing with the coronavirus pandemic Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, an American who was head of the WHO's emerging diseases and zoonosis unit at the time of the pandemic also expressed pride at the WHO for \"saving lives\" [248] It was argued that the attempt to blame the WHO was a way to draw attention away from the failings of the Trump administration [249]\n\n\nSocial issues\nPompeo has stated that life begins at conception and believes abortions should be allowed only when necessary to save the life of the mother, with no exceptions for rape [250] In 2011, he voted for the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which would have banned federal health coverage that

government shutdown of 2013, blaming President Obama He said he believed the shutdown was necessary to avoid an \"American financial collapse 10 years from now\" [255]\n\n\nInternational Criminal Court\nPompeo continued a non-cooperative policy towards the International Criminal Court in The Hague, enacting sanctions against the ICC's chief prosecutor and other officials in September 2020

by his predecessors [70] These included a speech via satellite from Jerusalem supporting Trump's re-election, firing State Department inspector general Steve Linick, and standing on the sidelines

personal errands for him and his wife, [129] \"from booking salon appointments and private dinner reservations to picking up their dog and arranging tours for the Pompeos' political allies.\" [130] The inspector general concluded that the behavior was inconsistent with regulations  [131] [130] [132] and \"recommended that various divisions at the State Department, such as the Office of the Legal

separate Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigation into whether Pompeo and his wife used official resources for personal business [155]\n\n\nRepublican National Convention speech\nOn August 25,

release, which was completed the next month [163] [164]\n\n\nFinal days in office\nAfter Joe Biden won the 2020 United States presidential election and Trump refused to concede while making false claims of fraud, Pompeo, when asked whether there would be a \"smooth transition\" to the Biden administration, responded on November 10, 2020: \"There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration, all right We're ready The world is watching what's taking place here We're gonna count all the votes When the process is complete, they'll be electors selected.\" [165] [166]

searchable database Legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed That includes Presidential Policy Directive-28, which bestows privacy rights on foreigners and imposes burdensome requirements to justify data collection.\" [194] In March 2017, WikiLeaks began publishing a series of documents known as Vault 7, detailing the CIA's electronic surveillance and cyber warfare activities and capabilities In an April 2017 speech addressing the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Pompeo called WikiLeaks \"a non-state hostile intelligence service\" and described Assange as a \"narcissist\" and \"a fraud—a coward hiding behind a screen\" [195] [196] In 2022 a lawsuit was filed against Pompeo and other defendants alleging that they have illegally

Pompeo said: \"There are scientists who think lots of different things about climate change There's some who think we're warming, there's some who think we're cooling, there's some who think that the

head of the WHO's emerging diseases and zoonosis unit at the time of the pandemic also expressed pride at the WHO for \"saving lives\" [248] It was argued that the attempt to blame the WHO was a way

The service allowed users to integrate multimedia elements, quizzes, and assessments directly into their PowerPoint presentations, making them more engaging and interactive. Office Mix was designed to enhance the learning experience by providing a platform for educators to create interactive and immersive content. In this article, we will explore the features, installation, and discontinuation of Office Mix.\n\n# **Installation**\n\nOffice Mix did not come embedded into the PowerPoint program. Instead, the user had to obtain the Office Mix add-in installer through the mix.office.com website in order to integrate the Office Mix add-in to the PowerPoint program. This allowed users to access the features and functionality of Office Mix directly within their PowerPoint application. Once installed, a global tab named \"Mix\" would appear across the application's interface, where the user could access various options related to Office Mix.\n\n## Accessing Office Mix\n\nTo access Office Mix, users had to navigate to the \"Mix\" tab within their PowerPoint application. From here, they could create new mixes, upload existing presentations, and access a variety of tools and features designed to enhance their presentations. The \"Mix\" tab provided a centralized location for users to manage their Office Mix content, making it easy to find and access their interactive presentations.\n\n## System Requirements\n\nTo install and use Office Mix, users required a compatible version of Microsoft PowerPoint, as well as a valid Microsoft account. Office Mix was compatible with PowerPoint 2013 and later versions, and users could access the service from any device with an internet connection.\n\n# **Features**\n\nThe Office Mix service allowed users to create interactive, online presentations that included a range of multimedia elements, such as videos, audio clips, and images. The service also provided a range of tools and features designed to enhance the learning experience, including:\n\n## Interactive Quizzes and Assessments\n\nOffice Mix allowed users to create interactive quizzes and assessments that could be embedded directly into their presentations. These quizzes and assessments could be customized to include a range of question types, such as multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer questions. The service also provided analytics and feedback tools, allowing educators to track student progress and identify areas where students may need additional support.\n\n## Multimedia Integration\n\nOffice Mix allowed users to integrate a range of multimedia elements into their presentations, including videos, audio clips, and images. Users could upload their own multimedia files or search for content from the Office Mix library. The service also provided a range of tools and features designed to enhance the multimedia experience, including captions, subtitles, and audio descriptions.\n\n## Real-time Feedback and Analytics\n\nOffice Mix provided real-time feedback and analytics, allowing users to track student progress and engagement. The service provided a range of metrics, including completion rates, quiz scores, and time spent on each slide. Educators could use this data to identify areas where students may need additional support and make data-driven decisions about their teaching.\n\n# **Discontinuation**\n\nBeginning May 1, 2018, the Office Mix service was officially retired by Microsoft and became inaccessible to all customers. Users who had created content on the platform were sent an email notification, providing several months to retrieve their content and mixes before the service was shut down. After the discontinuation, the features of Office Mix were embedded into the PowerPoint program for users who obtained Office via an Office 365 subscription. These features remain available and continue to provide users with a range of tools and features designed to enhance their presentations.\n\n## Impact on Users\n\nThe discontinuation of Office Mix had a significant impact on users who had created content on the platform. Users were forced to retrieve their content and mixes before the service was shut down, which required them to navigate the Office Mix platform and export their content in a compatible format. This process was time-consuming and required technical expertise, which may have been a challenge for some users.\n\n## Legacy of Office Mix\n\nDespite its discontinuation, Office Mix left a lasting legacy in the field of education technology. The service provided a range of tools and features designed to enhance the learning experience, and its impact can still be seen in the development of modern educational technologies. The legacy of Office Mix serves as a reminder of the importance of innovation and experimentation in the field of education technology, and the need for educators and developers to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Microsoft_Office_Mix\" following this outline:\n\n\nInstallation\nOffice Mix did not come embedded into the PowerPoint program Instead, the user had to obtain the Office Mix add-in installer through the mix.office.com website in order to integrate the Office Mix add-in to the PowerPoint program and a global tab named \"Mix\" would appear across the application's interface where the user could access various options related to Office Mix.\n\n\nFeatures\nThe Office Mix service allowed the following features to the user: [6]\n\n\nDiscontinuation\nBeginning May 1, 2018, the Office Mix service was officially retired by Microsoft and became inaccessible to all customers after users were sent an e-mail notification issuing them several months to retrieve all of their content and mixes off of the platform prior to shutdown After the discontinuation, the features of Office Mix were instead embedded into the PowerPoint program to users who obtained Office via an Office 365 subscription which remain available [7] [8] [9]\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

[Berger said,] 'There's only one We'd like a new Sandman Keep the name But the rest is up to you.'\" [6]\n\n\nCreation\nThe Sandman grew out of a proposal by Neil Gaiman to revive DC's 1974–1976 series The Sandman, written by Joe Simon and Michael Fleisher and illustrated by Jack Kirby and Ernie Chua Gaiman had considered including characters from the \"Dream Stream\" (including the Kirby Sandman, Brute, Glob, and the brothers Cain and Abel) in a scene for the first issue of his 1988 miniseries Black Orchid While the scene did not make it into later drafts because Roy Thomas was using the characters in Infinity, Inc., Gaiman soon began constructing a treatment for a new series, and mentioned his treatment in passing to DC editor Karen Berger [6] He was unsure his Sandman pitch would be accepted, but weeks later, Berger asked Gaiman if he was interested in doing a Sandman series Gaiman recalled, \"I said, 'Um .. yes Yes, definitely What's the catch?'  [Berger said,] 'There's only one We'd like a new Sandman Keep the name But the rest is up to you.'\" [6]\n\n\nOriginal series\nThe debut issue of The Sandman went on sale November 29, 1988 [11] and was cover-dated January 1989 [12] [13] Gaiman described the early issues as \"awkward\", since he, as well as Kieth, Dringenberg, and Busch, had never worked on a regular series before Kieth quit after the fifth issue; he was replaced by Dringenberg as penciler, who was in turn replaced by Malcolm Jones III as inker [14] Dave McKean was the cover artist for the series through its entire run [15]\n\n\nAdditions and spin-offs\nThe Sandman has inspired numerous spin-offs While most of these are not written by Gaiman, he did write two miniseries focusing on the character of Death Death: The High Cost of Living was published from March to May 1993 and was based on the fable that Death takes human form once a century to remain grounded and in touch with humanity [33] [34] This was followed in 1996 by Death: The Time of Your Life, [35] featuring the characters of Foxglove and Hazel from A Game of You Other spin-offs include The Dreaming, Lucifer, and Dead Boy Detectives.\n\n\nSummary\nThe Sandman's main character is Dream, the eponymous Sandman, who is the anthropomorphic personification of dreams At the start of the series, Morpheus is captured by an

by Neil Gaiman that was first published in 1989 by DC Comics. The series is a dark fantasy epic that follows the story of Dream, also known as Morpheus, who is the personification of dreams.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nThe Sandman grew out of a proposal by Neil Gaiman to revive DC's 1974–1976 series The Sandman, written by Joe Simon and Michael Fleisher and illustrated by Jack Kirby and Ernie Chua. Gaiman had considered including characters from the \"Dream Stream\" (including the Kirby Sandman, Brute, Glob, and the brothers Cain and Abel) in a scene for the first issue of his 1988 miniseries Black Orchid. While the scene did not make it into later drafts because Roy Thomas was using the characters in Infinity, Inc., Gaiman soon began constructing a treatment for a new series, and mentioned his treatment in passing to DC editor Karen Berger. He was unsure his Sandman pitch would be accepted, but weeks later, Berger asked Gaiman if he was interested in doing a Sandman series. Gaiman recalled, \"I said, 'Um … yes Yes, definitely What's the catch?'  [Berger said,] 'There's only one We'd like a new Sandman Keep the name But the rest is up to you.'\"\n\n**Creation**\n\nThe Sandman was created by Neil Gaiman, who was inspired by a variety of sources, including mythology, folklore, and fairy tales. Gaiman wanted to create a series that would explore the world of dreams and the nature of reality. He drew inspiration from a wide range of influences, including the works of William Shakespeare, Arthur Machen, and H.P. Lovecraft.\n\n**Original Series**\n\nThe debut issue of The Sandman went on sale November 29, 1988, and was cover-dated January 1989. Gaiman described the early issues as \"awkward,\" since he, as well as Kieth, Dringenberg, and Busch, had never worked on a regular series before. Kieth quit after the fifth issue; he was replaced by Dringenberg as penciler, who was in turn replaced by Malcolm Jones III as inker. Dave McKean was the cover artist for the series through its entire run.\n\n**Additions and Spin-Offs**\n\nThe Sandman has inspired numerous spin-offs, while most of these are not written by Gaiman, he did write two miniseries focusing on the character of Death. Death: The High Cost of Living was published from March to May 1993 and was based on the fable that Death takes human form once a century to remain grounded and in touch with humanity. This was followed in 1996 by Death: The Time of Your Life, featuring the characters of Foxglove and Hazel from A Game of You. Other spin-offs include The Dreaming, Lucifer, and Dead Boy Detectives.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe Sandman's main character is Dream, the eponymous Sandman, who is the anthropomorphic personification of dreams. At the start of the series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual that was trying to capture his sibling Death and is held prisoner by its caster for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence, while reclaiming his gear and hunting down the escaped dreams and nightmares like Corinthian, Brute and Glob, and Fiddler's Green.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThe Sandman comic book series falls within the dark fantasy genre, albeit in a more contemporary and modern setting.

This event was one of the brightest supernovae in recorded history and was observed by astronomers in Europe, China, Korea, and the Middle East.\n\n**Observation**\n\nThe supernova was visible to the naked eye, reaching an apparent magnitude of −2.5 at its peak. It was so bright that it was visible during the day for over three weeks, making it a notable event in the night sky. Records of its sighting exist in European, Chinese, Korean, and Arabic sources, providing valuable information for astronomers and historians.\n\nThe first recorded observation in Europe was made by Lodovico delle Colombe in northern Italy on 9 October 1604. Other astronomers, including Wilhelm Fabry, Michael Maestlin, and Helisaeus Roeslin, also observed the supernova, but did not record their findings. Johannes Kepler, a renowned astronomer, was only able to begin his observations on 17 October, while working at the imperial court in Prague for Emperor Rudolf II. Kepler's observations of the supernova were described in his book \"De Stella nova in pede Serpentarii\" (\"On the new star in Ophiuchus's foot,\" 1606).\n\n**Controversies**\n\nDuring the time of the supernova, astronomers were concerned with observing the conjunction of Mars and Jupiter, which they believed was linked to the Star of Bethlehem. However, cloudy weather prevented Kepler from making observations, and he was only able to begin his work on 17 October. The conjunction of Mars and Jupiter was seen as an auspicious event, and astronomers were eager to study its significance.\n\nThe supernova was also a subject of controversy among astronomers. In 1606, Lodovico delle Colombe published a book defending an Aristotelian view of cosmology, which was challenged by Galileo Galilei using the occasion of the supernova. Galileo argued that the supernova was a new star, rather than a comet or an atmospheric phenomenon, and used this evidence to support his own heliocentric model of the universe.\n\n**Kepler-Roeslin Controversy**\n\nIn Kepler's book \"De Stella Nova,\" he criticized Helisaeus Roeslin for his astrological prognostications, which Kepler believed were based on insufficient data. Roeslin responded in 1609, defending his work and arguing that he had indeed considered a broader range of data. Kepler replied later that year, observing that Roeslin's argument was weakened by the fact that he had not considered the supernova, which was a crucial piece of evidence.\n\n**Supernova Remnant**\n\nThe supernova remnant of SN 1604, Kepler's Star, was discovered in 1941 at the Mount Wilson Observatory as a dim nebula with a brightness of 19 mag. The remnant is a strong radio and X-ray source, and its diameter is approximately 4 arc minutes. Distance estimates place the remnant between 3 and more than 7 kiloparsecs (10,000 to 23,000 lightyears), with the current consensus being a distance of 5±1 kpc, as of 2021.\n\nThe supernova remnant is a fascinating object for astronomers, providing valuable information about the explosion that created it. The remnant is thought to be a result of the supernova that occurred in 1604, and its study has helped astronomers to understand the processes that occur in these events.\n\n**See also**\n\n* SN 1006\n* Tycho's Supernova\n* Kepler's Star (novel)\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* Kepler, J.

real name is Shahid Khan, is a British music producer, songwriter, and singer. He rose to fame in the late 2000s as a producer and songwriter, working with artists such as Chipmunk and Emeli Sandé. He has since become a successful artist in his own right, releasing his debut album, _Hotel Cabana_, in 2013.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nShahid Khan was born on January 1, 1981, in Watford, Hertfordshire, England. His parents were originally from Pakistan, and he spent two years living in a school near Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Khan's Pakistani heritage has had a significant influence on his music and artistic style. He has spoken about how growing up in a multicultural environment exposed him to a wide range of musical influences, from Pakistani music to Western pop.\n\nKhan was educated at Westfield Academy in Watford, where he developed an interest in music and production. He initially studied business and marketing at London Guildhall University, but dropped out during his first semester to pursue a career in music. He worked part-time jobs in Domino's Pizza and Watford General Hospital while developing his skills as a producer and songwriter.\n\n**Music Career**\n\nKhan's music career began to take off in the late 2000s, when he started working with artists such as Chipmunk and Emeli Sandé. He co-wrote and produced Chipmunk's hit single \"Diamond Rings,\" which featured Emeli Sandé on vocals. Khan went on to work with Sandé again on the single \"Never Be Your Woman,\" a cover of White Town's \"Your Woman.\"\n\nSandé's success led to a record deal with Virgin Records, and Khan co-wrote and produced her debut album, _Our Version of Events_. Khan was formally introduced as an artist on Sandé's second single \"Daddy,\" although he does not actually perform on the track.\n\n**2012-2014: Hotel Cabana**\n\nIn 2012, Khan released his debut album, _Hotel Cabana_, under his moniker \"Naughty Boy.\" The album's first single, \"Wonder,\" features Emeli Sandé on vocals and was released on September 30, 2012. \"Wonder\" was also included on the US version of Sandé's debut album, _Our Version of Events_.

Malik's departure from the band shortly after this announcement led to speculation that Naughty Boy's association with Malik had contributed to his departure. However, Naughty Boy has denied any involvement in Malik's departure from the band.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 2017, Khan's mother was diagnosed with dementia, and he has spoken openly about using music as therapy to help his mother cope with the condition.

Born in Delhi, India, into a Punjabi Hindu family, Malhotra's journey to stardom has been marked by his hard work, dedication, and perseverance.\n\n## Early Life and Work\n\nMalhotra was born on January 16, 1985, in Delhi, India, to Sunil Malhotra, a former captain in the Merchant Navy, and Rimma Malhotra, a homemaker. Growing up in a family that valued education and hard work, Malhotra was encouraged to pursue his passions from a young age. He developed a keen interest in acting and filmmaking and began taking acting classes while still in school.\n\nAfter completing his education, Malhotra moved to Mumbai to pursue a career in acting. He successfully auditioned for a film to be directed by Anubhav Sinha, but the project was shelved due to various reasons. Undeterred, Malhotra worked as an assistant director to Karan Johar on the 2010 film \"My Name Is Khan.\" This experience not only helped him learn the ropes of the film industry but also gave him a chance to work with a renowned director.\n\n## Career Fluctuations (2012-2016)\n\nMalhotra's big break came in 2012 when he made his film debut with Karan Johar's teen drama \"Student of the Year\" alongside newcomers Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt. He was cast as Abhimanyu Singh, a scholarship student, who competes with his wealthy best friends to win an annual school championship. Film critic Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN considered his performance to be \"earnest,\" adding that he had \"a pleasing presence.\" \"Student of the Year\" was a financial success, grossing ₹1.09 billion (US$13 million) worldwide.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Kapoor & Sons,\" Malhotra starred in the romantic comedy \"Baar Baar Dekho\" alongside Katrina Kaif, playing a time-traveling mathematician. Directed by Nitya Mehra, the film was poorly received. Later in 2017, he starred in dual roles for the first time in the action comedy \"A Gentleman\" with Jacqueline Fernandez from the writer-director duo Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K., which was produced by Fox Star Studios; although highly anticipated, it opened to a poor reception. Both films were box-office bombs.\n\n## Shershaah and Action Roles (2021-Present)\n\nIn 2021, Malhotra had a lead role in the biographical war film \"Shershaah,\" based on the life of the Indian army officer Vikram Batra. After several delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film premiered on Amazon Prime Video. It received mixed reviews from critics, but praise was directed at Malhotra's performance in particular, with Saibal Chatterjee writing that he \"has what it takes to flesh out a real-life martyr who has left behind a larger-than-life aura.\" \"Shershaah\" was the most-watched film on Prime Video in India at the time of its release.

Prix due to the COVID-19 pandemic [3] Its original date was filled with the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix and the Australian race was eventually cancelled and replaced by the Qatar Grand Prix.\n\n\nCircuit redevelopment\nYas Marina underwent redevelopment that shortened the track and the expected lap time in order to increase top speeds and overtaking opportunities [4] The chicane after turn 4 was removed, and the turn 5 hairpin (which was turn 7 before redevelopment) was widened The four corner sequence of turns which was turns 11–14 became one banked turn 9 The radius of turns 12–15 (previously 17–20) were increased to allow cars to carry more speed, with the changes to turn 15 allowing cars to be able to travel flat out through the corner [5]\n\n\nEntrants\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for the race [6] Jack Aitken drove for Williams in the first practice session, in place of George Russell [6] Nikita Mazepin tested positive for coronavirus after qualifying, forcing his withdrawal from the race; he was not replaced.\n\n\nChampionship standings before the race and title permutations\nTitle rivals Max Verstappen (Red Bull Racing) and Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) both entered the round with 369.5 points, leaving the championship contenders level on points for the final round for the first time since 1974 and for the second time in the sport's history The Drivers' Championship was decided in the final round for the 30th time, and the first time since 2016 [11] The driver who scored the most points would win the championship; if the drivers had scored an equal amount of points, Verstappen would have won the championship due to having won more races (nine to Hamilton's eight) prior to this race [11] [12] In the Constructors' Championship, Mercedes led with 587.5 points, 28 ahead of Red Bull on 559.5, with 44 still available; this was the first time since 2008 that the final round of the season decided the Constructors' Championship In the midfield, Scuderia Ferrari led McLaren in the battle for third place in the constructors by a margin of 38.5 points [11]\n\n\nTyres choices\nSole tyre supplier Pirelli provided the C3, C4, and C5 tyre compounds—the softest selections available—for use in dry conditions [16]\n\n\nPractice\nThree practice sessions were scheduled over the course of the weekend The first session took place at 13:30 local time (UTC+04:00) on Friday 10 December The second session took place at 17:00 The third session took place at 14:00 on Saturday 11 December [17] The first practice session passed without incident and ended with Verstappen setting the fastest time, followed by Bottas and Hamilton [18] The second practice session ended with Hamilton fastest by 0.3 seconds to second-placed Esteban Ocon, while Bottas was third fastest ahead of Verstappen, 0.6 seconds behind Hamilton Räikkönen crashed at turn 14 just as the session was concluding, but was unhurt [19]\n\n\nQualifying\nQualifying started at 17:00 local time on Saturday 11 December [17] The first qualifying session was briefly suspended after Mick Schumacher collided with a bollard but was resumed without further incident, with the Mercedes drivers Hamilton and Bottas recording the fastest times of the session [20] In the second qualifying session, initial flying laps on medium-compound tyres gave Hamilton a four-millisecond advantage over Red Bull Racing driver Verstappen A lock-up on his second flying lap led to Verstappen's return to the pits to change to soft tyres At the end of the session, Verstappen improved to take first place on the timesheets, setting the time on the faster soft-compound tyres locked him into starting the race on Sunday, and Hamilton was likewise locked into using the more durable medium-compound tyres [20] In the third and final qualifying session, Verstappen was able to use the slipstream of his teammate Sergio Pérez to secure pole position for the race, with Hamilton only able to take the second spot on the grid [20]\n\n\nQualifying classification\nThe race started at 17:00 local time on Sunday 12 December [17] Hamilton immediately took the lead from Verstappen on the race start, prompting Verstappen to attempt to regain his position at the turn 6-7 chicane [25] Verstappen's trajectory and later braking took him from the inside to the outside of the track to overtake Hamilton, who cut turn 7 rather than concede the corner, arguing Verstappen forced him off, and Hamilton re-joined considerably further ahead of Verstappen than he was before the corner Arguing that he should have ceded the position to Verstappen, Red Bull Racing protested the racing line taken by Hamilton, and were told by radio that Hamilton had ultimately given back any advantage gained [25] The incident was referred to the stewards, which concluded that no further investigation was necessary [25] Hamilton then utilised the durability of his medium-compound tyres to extend his lead over Verstappen, whose soft-compound tyres were suffering from greater degradation [25]\n\n\nRace\nThe race started at 17:00 local time on Sunday 12 December [17] Hamilton immediately took the lead from Verstappen on the race start, prompting Verstappen to attempt to regain his position at the turn 6-7 chicane [25] Verstappen's trajectory and

soft-compound tyres were suffering from greater degradation [25]\n\n\nPit-stops and virtual safety car\nVerstappen made his stop at the end of lap 13 with Hamilton following suit one lap later, both opting for a set of the hardest tyres The lead drivers pitting elevated Pérez to first, with the Mexican driver being informed his strategy was to hold up Hamilton to allow his teammate Verstappen to catch up [25] Hamilton caught up with Pérez on lap 20; a spirited defence from the Red Bull second driver allowed Verstappen to significantly close the gap from about 11 seconds after the pits to 1.3 seconds [26] [27] Verstappen was unable to take advantage of it, with Hamilton's superior pace extending the gap to four seconds by the midpoint of the race [25]\n\n\nFinal laps\nOn lap 53, a crash at turn 14 for Nicholas Latifi, who was fighting for position with Haas' Mick Schumacher and had dirty tyres after going off circuit at turn 9, [28] brought out the safety car Hamilton again stayed out without pitting because he would have lost track position had the safety car period not ended, while Verstappen pitted for soft tyres Pérez retired under the safety car due to oil pressure After Verstappen's pit stop, he retained second, but with five lapped cars (those of Lando Norris, Fernando Alonso, Ocon, Charles Leclerc, and Sebastian Vettel) between himself and Hamilton (in first) As the debris from Latifi's crash was being cleared by the race marshals, the lapped drivers were initially informed that they would not be permitted to overtake On lap 57, Masi gave the direction that only the five cars between Hamilton and Verstappen were to unlap themselves [29]\n\n\nRace classification\nNotes\n\n\nSafety car controversy\nRace director Michael Masi was involved in a safety car procedure controversy during the last laps of the race [35] [36] [37] On lap 57 of the race, during which Hamilton was leading, Masi allowed only the five cars directly in between championship contenders Hamilton and Verstappen to unlap themselves before the restart The race restarted the same lap, and the safety car failed to do the mandatory extra lap after Once the safety car pulled off on this lap and the cars in position one and two were allowed to race, Verstappen overtook Hamilton at turn 5 and won the 2021 World Drivers' Championship [38] [39] [40]\n\n\nMercedes' post-race protests\nMercedes protested the race result, [41] [42] alleging that Verstappen had overtaken Hamilton during the safety car [43] and that Masi violated safety car procedure by allowing the cars directly in front of Verstappen to unlap themselves, and no others, and that according to regulations the restart should have occurred the following lap, which would have resulted in Hamilton's victory [44] [45] [46] While the first issue was dismissed because Verstappen was not ahead at the end of the safety car period, [47] the second issue was more contentious, with Mercedes retaining legal counsel for the protest [48] [49] Mercedes argued that if a message for lapped cars to overtake is issued under Article 48.12, then all lapped cars are required to unlap, and that the safety car was required to wait until the end of the following lap to return to the pit lane; if this process was complied with, Mercedes submitted that Hamilton would have won the race and therefore the championship, and requested that the classification be amended as such Red Bull argued that a) the regulation stated \"any cars\", not \"all cars\", were required to overtake under Articles 48.12; b) 48.13, which governs the withdrawal of the safety car, overrides Article 48.12; c) Article 15.3 gives the race director overriding authority over the use of the safety car; and d) the race result would not have changed if all eight lapped cars were permitted to unlap Masi argued that the principle behind Article 48.12 was to remove cars which \"interfered\" with drivers racing on the lead lap and that all teams had agreed in principle that all races should end under racing conditions [50]\n\n\nRace reactions and commentary\nIn the immediate post-race interview, Hamilton and his father Anthony congratulated Verstappen and his family on his first World Drivers' Championship [64]\n\n\nFIA inquiry and regulation changes\nOn 15 December 2021, the FIA announced that it would be investigating the running of the race with the goal of learning what happened and to determine if adjustments are needed for the safety car procedure The FIA review started in January 2022 [100] In the same statement, the FIA stated that misunderstandings from teams, drivers, and fans had \"tarnished the image\" of the World Drivers' Championship [104] [105] [106] Formula One journalist Scott Mitchell criticised the FIA's initial statement in response to the controversy for its suggestion that fans had misunderstood events that occurred at the end of the Grand Prix [107]\n\n\nFinal

At the end of the session, Verstappen improved to take first place on the timesheets, setting the time on the faster soft-compound tyres locked him into starting the race on Sunday, and Hamilton was likewise locked into using the more durable medium-compound tyres.\n\n## Qualifying Classification\n\nIn the third and final qualifying session, Verstappen was able to use the slipstream of his teammate Sergio Pérez to secure pole position for the race, with Hamilton only able to take the second spot on the grid.\n\n## Race\n\nThe race started at 17:00 local time on Sunday 12 December. Hamilton immediately took the lead from Verstappen on the race start, prompting Verstappen to attempt to regain his position at the turn 6-7 chicane. Verstappen's trajectory and later braking took him from the inside to the outside of the track to overtake Hamilton, who cut turn 7 rather than concede the corner, arguing Verstappen forced him off, and Hamilton re-joined considerably further ahead of Verstappen than he was before the corner. Arguing that he should have ceded the position to Verstappen, Red Bull Racing protested the racing line taken by Hamilton, and were told by radio that Hamilton had ultimately given back any advantage gained.\n\n## Pit-stops and Virtual Safety Car\n\nVerstappen made his stop at the end of lap 13 with Hamilton following suit one lap later, both opting for a set of the hardest tyres. The lead drivers pitting elevated Pérez to first, with the Mexican driver being informed his strategy was to hold up Hamilton to allow his teammate Verstappen to catch up. Hamilton caught up with Pérez on lap 20; a spirited defence from the Red Bull second driver allowed Verstappen to significantly close the gap from about 11 seconds after the pits to 1.3 seconds.\n\n## Final Laps\n\nOn lap 53, a crash at turn 14 for Nicholas Latifi, who was fighting for position with Haas' Mick Schumacher and had dirty tyres after going off circuit at turn 9, brought out the safety car. Hamilton again stayed out without pitting because he would have lost track position had the safety car period not ended, while Verstappen pitted for soft tyres. Pérez retired under the safety car due to oil pressure. After Verstappen's pit stop, he retained second, but with five lapped cars (those of Lando Norris, Fernando Alonso, Ocon, Charles Leclerc, and Sebastian Vettel) between himself and Hamilton (in first).\n\n## Safety Car Controversy\n\nRace director Michael Masi was involved in a safety car procedure controversy during the last laps of the race. On lap 57 of the race, during which Hamilton was leading, Masi allowed only the five cars directly in between championship contenders Hamilton and Verstappen to unlap themselves before the restart. The race restarted the same lap, and the safety car failed to do the mandatory extra lap after Once the safety car pulled off on this lap and the cars in position one and two were allowed to race, Verstappen overtook Hamilton at turn 5 and won the 2021 World Drivers' Championship.\n\n## Mercedes' Post-race Protests\n\nMercedes protested the race result, alleging that Verstappen had overtaken Hamilton during the safety car and that Masi violated safety car procedure by allowing the cars directly in front of Verstappen to unlap themselves, and no others, and that according to regulations the restart should have occurred the following lap, which would have resulted in Hamilton's victory. While the first issue was dismissed because Verstappen was not ahead at the end of the safety car period, the second issue was more contentious, with Mercedes retaining legal counsel for the protest.\n\n## Final Championship Standings\n\nThe final championship standings were:\n\n| Pos | Driver | Points |\n| 1 | Max Verstappen | 390.5 |\n| 2 | Lewis Hamilton | 386.5 |\n| 3 | Valtteri Bottas | 226 |\n| 4 | Sergio Pérez | 190 |\n| 5 | Carlos Sainz Jr. | 164.5 |\n\n## See Also\n\n* 2021 Formula One World Championship\n* 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\n* Formula One\n* Yas Marina Circuit",

December, but it was rescheduled after the postponement of the Australian Grand Prix due to the COVID-19 pandemic [3] Its original date was filled with the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix and the Australian race was eventually cancelled and replaced by the Qatar Grand Prix.\n\n\nCircuit redevelopment\nYas Marina underwent redevelopment that shortened the track and the expected lap time in order to increase top speeds and overtaking opportunities [4] The chicane after turn 4 was removed, and the turn 5 hairpin (which was turn 7 before redevelopment) was widened The four corner sequence of turns which was turns 11–14 became one banked turn 9 The radius of turns 12–15 (previously 17–20) were increased to allow cars to carry more speed, with the changes to turn 15 allowing cars to be able to travel flat out through the corner [5]\n\n\nEntrants\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for the race [6] Jack Aitken drove for Williams in the first practice session, in place of George Russell [6] Nikita Mazepin tested positive for coronavirus after qualifying, forcing his withdrawal from the race; he was not replaced.\n\n\nChampionship standings before the race and title permutations\nTitle rivals Max Verstappen (Red Bull Racing) and Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) both entered the round with 369.5 points, leaving the championship contenders level on points for the final round for the first time since 1974 and for the second time in the sport's history The Drivers' Championship was decided in the final round for the 30th time, and the first time since 2016 [11] The driver who scored the most points would win the championship; if the drivers had scored an equal amount of points, Verstappen would have won the championship due to having won more races (nine to Hamilton's eight) prior to this race [11] [12] In the Constructors' Championship, Mercedes led with 587.5 points, 28 ahead of Red Bull on 559.5, with 44 still available; this was the first time since 2008 that the final round of the season decided the Constructors' Championship In the midfield, Scuderia Ferrari led McLaren in the battle for third place in the constructors by a margin of 38.5 points [11]\n\n\nTyres choices\nSole tyre supplier Pirelli provided the C3, C4, and C5 tyre compounds—the softest selections available—for use in dry conditions [16]\n\n\nPractice\nThree practice sessions were scheduled over the course of the weekend The first session took place at 13:30 local time (UTC+04:00) on Friday 10 December The second session took place at 17:00 The third session took place at 14:00 on Saturday 11 December [17] The first practice session passed without incident and ended with Verstappen setting the fastest time, followed by Bottas and Hamilton [18] The second practice session ended with Hamilton fastest by 0.3 seconds to second-placed Esteban Ocon, while Bottas was third fastest ahead of Verstappen, 0.6 seconds behind Hamilton Räikkönen crashed at turn 14 just as the session was concluding, but was unhurt [19]\n\n\nQualifying\nQualifying started at 17:00 local time on Saturday 11 December [17] The first qualifying session was briefly suspended after Mick Schumacher collided with a bollard but was resumed without further incident, with the Mercedes drivers Hamilton and Bottas recording the fastest times of the session [20] In the second qualifying session, initial flying laps on medium-compound tyres gave Hamilton a four-millisecond advantage over Red Bull Racing driver Verstappen A

Red Bull Racing protested the racing line taken by Hamilton, and were told by radio that Hamilton had ultimately given back any advantage gained [25] The incident was referred to the stewards, which concluded that no further investigation was necessary [25] Hamilton then utilised the durability of his medium-compound tyres to extend his lead over Verstappen, whose soft-compound tyres were suffering from greater degradation [25]\n\n\nRace\nThe race started at 17:00 local time on Sunday 12 December [17] Hamilton immediately took the lead from Verstappen on the race start, prompting

immediately took the lead from Verstappen on the race start, prompting Verstappen to attempt to regain his position at the turn 6-7 chicane [25] Verstappen's trajectory and later braking took him from

strategy was to hold up Hamilton to allow his teammate Verstappen to catch up [25] Hamilton caught up with Pérez on lap 20; a spirited defence from the Red Bull second driver allowed Verstappen to significantly close the gap from about 11 seconds after the pits to 1.3 seconds [26] [27] Verstappen was unable to take advantage of it, with Hamilton's superior pace extending the gap to four seconds by the midpoint of the race [25]\n\n\nFinal laps\nOn lap 53, a crash at turn 14 for Nicholas Latifi, who was fighting for position with Haas' Mick Schumacher and had dirty tyres after going off circuit at turn 9, [28] brought out the safety car Hamilton again stayed out without pitting because he would have lost track position had the safety car period not ended, while Verstappen pitted for soft tyres Pérez retired under the safety car due to oil pressure After Verstappen's pit stop, he retained second, but with five lapped cars (those of Lando Norris, Fernando Alonso, Ocon, Charles Leclerc, and Sebastian Vettel) between himself and Hamilton (in first) As the debris from Latifi's crash was being cleared by the race marshals, the lapped drivers were initially informed that they would not be permitted to overtake On lap 57, Masi gave the direction that only the five cars between Hamilton and Verstappen were to unlap themselves [29]\n\n\nRace classification\nNotes\n\n\nSafety car controversy\nRace director Michael Masi was involved in a safety car procedure controversy during the last laps of the race [35] [36] [37] On lap 57 of the race, during which Hamilton was leading, Masi allowed only the five cars directly in between championship contenders Hamilton and Verstappen to unlap themselves before the restart The race restarted the same lap, and the safety car failed to

that Masi violated safety car procedure by allowing the cars directly in front of Verstappen to unlap themselves, and no others, and that according to regulations the restart should have occurred the following lap, which would have resulted in Hamilton's victory [44] [45] [46] While the first issue was dismissed because Verstappen was not ahead at the end of the safety car period, [47] the second issue was more contentious, with Mercedes retaining legal counsel for the protest [48] [49] Mercedes argued that if a message for lapped cars to overtake is issued under Article 48.12, then all lapped cars are required to unlap, and that the safety car was required to wait until the end of the following lap to return to the pit lane; if this process was complied with, Mercedes submitted that Hamilton would have won the race and therefore the championship, and requested that the classification be amended as such Red Bull argued that a) the regulation stated \"any cars\", not \"all cars\", were required to overtake under Articles 48.12; b) 48.13, which governs the withdrawal of the safety car, overrides Article 48.12; c) Article 15.3 gives the race director overriding authority over the use of the safety car; and d) the race result would not have changed if all eight lapped cars were permitted to unlap Masi argued that the principle behind Article 48.12 was to remove cars which \"interfered\" with drivers racing on the lead lap and that all teams had agreed in principle that all races should end under racing conditions [50]\n\n\nRace reactions and commentary\nIn the immediate post-race interview, Hamilton and his father Anthony congratulated Verstappen and his family on his first World Drivers' Championship [64]\n\n\nFIA inquiry and regulation changes\nOn 15 December 2021, the FIA announced that it would be investigating the running of the race with the goal of learning what happened and to determine if adjustments are needed for the safety car procedure The FIA review started in January 2022 [100] In the same statement, the FIA stated that misunderstandings from teams, drivers, and fans had \"tarnished the image\" of the World Drivers' Championship [104] [105] [106] Formula One journalist Scott Mitchell criticised the FIA's initial statement in response to the controversy for its suggestion that fans had misunderstood events that occurred at the end of the Grand Prix [107]\n\n\nFinal Championship standings\nDrivers' Championship standings\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Marcus_Rashford", "content": "\nEarly life\nMarcus Rashford [3] was born on 31 October 1997 [4] in Manchester, [5] and raised in the Fallowfield, Withington, and Wythenshawe areas of the city [6] [7] He is of paternal Jamaican descent, [8] and maternal Kittitian descent, with his grandmother born on the West Indies island of Saint Kitts [9] Rashford comes from a working class family; his mother is Melanie Maynard, a single parent who worked multiple jobs, sometimes skipping meals to ensure her children had enough to eat [10] [11] [12] Rashford has four older siblings: two brothers, Dwaine Maynard and Dane Rashford, both of whom went on to represent him professionally, [13] and two sisters, Chantelle and Claire [12] [14] He is a cousin of footballer Lois Maynard, who plays as a midfielder for Radcliffe.\n\n\nClub career\nRashford began playing football for Fletcher Moss Rangers at the age of five, [19] starting out as a goalkeeper, and cited former United goalkeeper Tim Howard as his goalkeeping idol [20] [21] Fletcher Moss Rangers academy development officer Dave Horrocks recalls that Rashford was on a \"different level\" to other boys, playing a major role as the team won a tournament with 15 scouts from various clubs watching [22]\n\n\nEarly career\nRashford began playing football for Fletcher Moss Rangers at the age of five, [19] starting out as a goalkeeper, and cited former United goalkeeper Tim Howard as his goalkeeping idol [20] [21] Fletcher Moss Rangers academy development officer Dave Horrocks recalls that Rashford was on a \"different level\" to other boys, playing a major role as the team won a tournament with 15 scouts from various clubs watching [22]\n\n\nManchester United\nOn 25 February 2016, Rashford was included in the 18-man squad for United's UEFA Europa League round of 32, second leg tie against Danish club Midtjylland, owing to an injury crisis which saw 13 players injured [39] After Anthony Martial was injured in the warm-up, Rashford was chosen to start the game, and marked his first-team debut with two goals in the second half of a 5–1 win [40] Rashford's goals made him United's youngest ever scorer in European competition, beating a record previously held by George Best, [41] and which was later broken by Mason Greenwood in the 2019–20 season [42] Rashford made his Premier League debut against Arsenal three days later; he again scored twice and provided the assist for the other goal in a 3–2 home victory against their rivals, making him the third youngest scorer for United in the Premier League after Federico Macheda and Danny Welbeck [43] Van Gaal hailed his performance as \"fantastic\" and better than his first match, [44] but urged caution from the press not to harass and hype him, feeling he had the character to cope [45]\n\n\n2015–16: Debut season\nOn 25 February 2016, Rashford was included in the 18-man squad for United's UEFA Europa League round of 32, second leg tie against Danish club Midtjylland, owing to an injury crisis which saw 13 players injured [39] After Anthony Martial was injured in the warm-up, Rashford was chosen to start the game, and marked his first-team debut with two goals in the second half of a 5–1 win [40] Rashford's goals made him United's youngest ever scorer in European competition, beating a record previously held by George Best, [41] and which was later broken by Mason Greenwood in the 2019–20 season [42] Rashford made his Premier League debut against Arsenal three days later; he again scored twice and provided the assist for the other goal in a 3–2 home victory against their rivals, making him the third youngest scorer for United in the Premier League after Federico Macheda and Danny Welbeck [43] Van Gaal hailed his performance as \"fantastic\" and better than his first match, [44] but urged caution from the press not to harass and hype him, feeling he had the character to cope [45]\n\n\n2016–17: First-team breakthrough and European success\nFor the 2016–17 season, marking his place as part of the senior squad, Rashford was given the number 19 by new manager José Mourinho [52] The signing of veteran striker Zlatan Ibrahimović meant he often had to settle for a place on the substitutes bench, [53] though upon his signing, Ibrahimović praised Rashford as a \"huge talent\" and \"the future of England\" [54]\n\n\n2017–2019: Sustained individual success and number 10 shirt\nRashford made his first appearance of his second full senior season on 8 August 2017 against Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup as a 46th-minute substitute in a 2–1 defeat [67] He started in a 4–0 home win against West Ham United five days later on 13 August, providing the assist for Romelu Lukaku's opening goal [68] Rashford scored his first goal of the season on 26 August, the opener in a 2–0 victory over Leicester, three minutes after coming on as a substitute [69] On 12 September, Rashford scored against Basel on his UEFA Champions League debut, the third in a 3–0 win, marking the sixth competition that he had scored on his debut [70] He scored a brace against Burton Albion on 20 September in the EFL Cup third round, as well as assisting the fourth goal in a 4–1 victory [71]\n\n\n2019–21: Continued development despite injury issues\nOn 1 July 2019, Rashford signed a new four-year contract with Manchester United, keeping him at the club until June 2023, with the option to extend by a further year [113] On the opening week of the season, Rashford scored a brace in a 4–0 win over Chelsea [114] In September, following a spell of poor form, Solskjær said he was not concerned about Rashford's dip in form and lack of goals [115] Towards the end of October, a return to form saw Rashford score in a 1–1 draw with rivals Liverpool, ending their 17 match winning streak [116] The following week, Rashford scored and assisted against Norwich City, [117] and scored a second brace against Chelsea in the EFL Cup [118] The return to form saw Rashford go on the best goalscoring run of his career to date, with 16 club goals in 20 matches, [119] ending the run with a brace in a 4–0 victory over Norwich [120] Rashford suffered a double stress fracture to the back in the following game, an FA Cup tie a\\on 19 January 2020 gainst Wolverhampton Wanderers, which put him out of action for several months [121] By playing in the game, he became the fourth youngest United player to have played 200 games for the club [122]\n\n\n2021–22: Loss in form and year of scrutiny\nRashford returned to training on 11 October 2021, [142] and made a goalscoring return in a 4–2 away loss to Leicester, coming off the bench and making the score 2–2 [143] On 22 January 2022, in a 1–0 win against West Ham United, Rashford came on in the 63rd minute for Anthony Elanga, going on to score a 93rd-minute winner; the goal meant he had scored more last-minute winners in Premier League history (four) than any other player, [144] and new manager Ralf Rangnick responded by saying Rashford was \"one of the top strikers in England\" amid a bad run of form [145]\n\n\n2022–23: Return to form\nAfter enjoying a successful pre-season under new manager Erik ten Hag, [146] who began the season by deploying Rashford both as a centre-forward and a left-winger, [147] he opened his account for the season by scoring in a 2–1 win against Liverpool, and then twice in a 3–1 win against Arsenal; [148] with an additional two assists, Rashford matched his contributions from the previous season [149] On 30 October, Rashford scored his 100th United goal in a 1–0 win against West Ham [150] He became the 22nd player to reach the figure for United, and the first in 13 years since Wayne Rooney [151] On 20 December, Rashford extended his contract by a year, [152] but was dropped for a game against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 31 December as punishment for oversleeping and being late for a team meeting; he came on during the match and scored the only goal in a 1–0 win [153]\n\n\n2023–present: Contract extension and recent struggles\nOn 18 July 2023, Rashford signed a new contract with Manchester United until 2028, for which he is paid £325,000 per week (£16.9m per year) [166] He received his second career red card in a 4–3 UEFA Champions League group stage loss to FC Copenhagen on 8 November that year [167] In January 2024, he missed an FA Cup game against Newport County after calling in sick; Manchester United said \"Marcus has taken responsibility for his actions This has been dealt with as an internal disciplinary matter, which is now closed\" [168] Rashford, who had scored four goals in the first half of the season, had also been dropped by Ten Hag in November for hosting a birthday party after losing to Manchester City Former Manchester United player Gary Neville said \"I know he's going through a dip in form at this moment in time but it's happened twice and it can sometimes become your personality if you're not careful\" [169]\n\n\nInternational career\nIn 2012, Rashford was invited to an England under-16 training camp, [170] and was later selected to play in the Victory Shield against Northern Ireland under-16s in September, [171] and Wales under-16s in October [172] Under-16's manager Kenny Swain later revealed that Rashford only played two appearances for the side due to an understanding with coaches at Manchester United regarding him being underdeveloped physically, and also thought the exposure would have been \"too much\" for him [38]\n\n\nYouth\nIn 2012, Rashford was invited to an England under-16 training camp, [170] and was later selected to play in the Victory Shield against Northern Ireland under-16s in September, [171] and Wales under-16s in October [172] Under-16's manager Kenny Swain later revealed that Rashford only played two appearances for the side due to an understanding with coaches at Manchester United regarding him being underdeveloped physically, and also thought the exposure would have been \"too much\" for him [38]\n\n\nSenior\nRashford's performances in his first senior season led to calls for him to represent England at UEFA Euro 2016 Manchester United academy coach Nicky Butt dismissed these calls, calling them premature and possibly harmful for the player's development, [185] as did England manager Roy Hodgson, who said Rashford should be allowed to \"develop in peace\" [186] In April, Hodgson admitted it was \"unlikely\" Rashford would be included in his tournament squad, [187] but on 16 May, Hodgson named him in his preliminary 26-man squad for the tournament [188] He became part of England's Euro 2016 squad less than four months after making his United debut [189]\n\n\n2016–2018: First Major tournaments\nRashford's performances in his first senior season led to calls for him to represent England at UEFA Euro 2016 Manchester United academy coach Nicky Butt dismissed these calls, calling them premature and possibly harmful for the player's development, [185] as did England manager Roy Hodgson, who said Rashford should be allowed to \"develop in peace\" [186] In April, Hodgson admitted it was \"unlikely\" Rashford would be included in his tournament squad, [187] but on 16 May, Hodgson named him in his preliminary 26-man squad for the tournament [188] He became part of England's Euro 2016 squad less than four months after making his United debut [189]\n\n\n2018–2021: European finalist\nOn 8 September 2018, Rashford scored at Wembley in England's UEFA Nations League opener against Spain, losing 2–1 [208] Three days later, Rashford also scored in a 1–0 friendly win over Switzerland at the King Power Stadium [209] The following month, he scored a goal and provided an assist in a 3–2 away win against Spain [210] England's final Nations League game on 18 November saw Rashford play in a 2–1 win over Croatia that saw England top their group and qualify for the Nations League finals in June 2019 [211] His appearance in this game saw Rashford equal a national record set by Jack Charlton in 1966 by playing a total of 16 games for England throughout the year [212] In the semi-final, Rashford scored the opening goal of the game against the Netherlands, however England lost 3–1 in extra time [213]\n\n\n2021–present: first tournament goals\nAfter undergoing surgery on his shoulder, Rashford missed England's next squad for World Cup qualification games against Group I opponents Hungary, Andorra, and Poland, [226] but returned to the squad for November's qualification games against Albania and San Marino, before being forced to withdraw due to illness [227] Due to a drop in form for United during the 2021–22 season, he was not called up to the England for March 2022 friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast, [228] and again in June for four Nations League matches against Hungary, Germany, and Italy, [229] with Southgate saying Rashford and club teammate Jadon Sancho had a lot to do to get back in the squad for the World Cup [230] Rashford subsequently failed to receive a call-up for England's next squad in September for the final two Nations League matches against Italy and Germany [231]\n\n\nPlayer profile\nRashford can play as either a centre forward or a winger, primarily on the left-wing [242] [243] [244] Rashford himself prefers playing on the left, a position which allows him to cut inside and strike on goal with his stronger right foot, and likes to drop deep to collect the ball and build an attack, something he learned as a youngster when playing as a central midfielder following a battle with Osgood–Schlatter disease [244] [245] In his formative years, Rashford's former youth coach Paul McGuinness noted how he was attempting to play similarly to Italian midfielder Andrea Pirlo, but he and fellow coaches Warren Joyce and Colin Little saw Rashford's potential as a striker and helped him work on his body shape and various attacking runs [246] They advised him to focus on being a goalscorer rather than a creative player, and to use his pace to make runs behind the defence [27] His coaches were reminded of Danny Welbeck due to his versatility, but it was decided to instead teach him the \"art\" of goalscoring, instructing him how to make runs at the right time, and was held back from playing reserve team football to give him confidence in his goalscoring abilities by pitting him against lesser defences [22] Rashford says his versatility can enable him to become the \"ultimate centre forward\" [247]\n\n\nStyle of play and development\nRashford can play as either a centre forward or a winger, primarily on the left-wing [242] [243] [244] Rashford himself prefers playing on the left, a position which allows him to cut inside and strike on goal with his stronger right foot, and likes to drop deep to collect the ball and build an attack, something he learned as a youngster when

confidence in his goalscoring abilities by pitting him against lesser defences [22] Rashford says his versatility can enable him to become the \"ultimate centre forward\" [247]\n\n\nComparisons\nHe is seen as a similar type of player to Thierry Henry in terms of style of play, physical attributes and end product [248] [283] [284] Van Gaal said his performances at a young age were similar to those of Patrick Kluivert, who he had managed at Ajax in the 1990s [285] Erik ten Hag, the United manager from the 2022–23 season, compared him to favourably to Kylian Mbappe due to the similar nature of their roles [286] [287] Growing up, the player he most tried to emulate was Brazilian striker Ronaldo, having watched him score a hat-trick for Real Madrid in a Champions League quarter-final in the first match he attended live at Old Trafford [288] Speaking about Ronaldo, Rashford said: \"I've grown up watching so much of him and his games He always played free, and went out there and expressed himself When you do that, that's when you play your best football.\" [288] [289]\n\n\nCharity and activism\nIn October 2019, Rashford set up the In the Box campaign with Selfridges to give homeless people essential items over the Christmas period, [296] [297] something he had wanted to do when first training with United as a youth [298] He and his mother visited homeless shelters to personally hand the boxes out, while also sending some to a children's home in his grandmother's home country of Saint Kitts and Nevis [299] He was reportedly frustrated by the limited outreach the campaign resulted in [12]\n\n\nFood poverty campaign\nIn October 2019, Rashford set up the In the Box campaign with Selfridges to give homeless people essential items over the Christmas period, [296] [297] something he had wanted to do when first training with United as a youth [298] He and his mother visited homeless shelters to personally hand the boxes out, while also sending some to a children's home in his grandmother's home country of Saint Kitts and Nevis [299] He was reportedly frustrated by the limited outreach the campaign resulted in [12]\n\n\nUniversal Credit campaigning\nIn October 2020, Rashford publicly questioned Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak regarding a permanent £20 increase in Universal Credit, [341] stressing his concern that many families would be \"counting down the days\" until the scheduled reversal the following April [342] A member of Rashford's team told The Times the permanent annual increase of £1,040 was the \"missing piece\" in their campaign strategy [343] At the end of December, it was reported by The Guardian that Rashford would have discussions with Thérèse Coffey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, regarding the permanent increase in Universal Credit; [344] [345] Rashford had previously been critical of Coffey during the initial stages of his campaign [346]\n\n\nRecognition\nIn the wake of the popularity generated by his charity work, Rashford signed with American rapper Jay-Z's entertainment agency Roc Nation in April 2020, with president Michael Yormark saying he was a \"shining example\" of somebody who was \"passionate about community\" [347] [348] In July 2020, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Manchester in recognition of his work to end child poverty in the UK, becoming the youngest person to receive an honorary doctorate from the university [349] In October 2021, in the ceremony at which the degree was conferred (delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic), Dame Nancy Rothwell, the Vice-Chancellor, called him \"an exceptional young man who continues to demonstrate a sense of community and generosity that goes well beyond his years.\" In a speech in reply, he remarked that the occasion was bittersweet, because it was the day after the £20/week increase in Universal Credit made by the government in April 2020 as a temporary response to the pandemic had been withdrawn [350] His efforts also led to him being featured on the September cover of British Vogue's \"Activism Now\" edition alongside Adwoa Aboah, which he downplayed, saying that he \"had a voice and a platform that could be used to at least ask the questions\" [351] In October, Rashford was appointed MBE in the 2020 Birthday Honours, [352] and was also a recipient of the City of Manchester Award for his \"outstanding and exceptional contribution to the city\" [353]\n\n\nLiteracy campaign\nFor the 2020 World Book Day, Rashford supported a campaign to help share a million stories [373] He also agreed to judge a poetry competition for children with hearing impairments, and began learning sign language in preparation [374] [297]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn May 2022, Rashford announced his engagement to girlfriend Lucia Loi [382] They had been dating since meeting in school, and briefly split in 2021 before reconciling [383] However, it was announced that they had separated in June 2023

England national team.\n\nEarly Life\n-----------\n\nRashford was born on 31 October 1997 in Manchester, and raised in the Fallowfield, Withington, and Wythenshawe areas of the city. He is of paternal Jamaican descent, and maternal Kittitian descent, with his grandmother born on the West Indies island of Saint Kitts. Rashford comes from a working-class family; his mother is Melanie Maynard, a single parent who worked multiple jobs, sometimes skipping meals to ensure her children had enough to eat. Rashford has four older siblings: two brothers, Dwaine Maynard and Dane Rashford, both of whom went on to represent him professionally, and two sisters, Chantelle and Claire. He is a cousin of footballer Lois Maynard, who plays as a midfielder for Radcliffe.\n\nClub Career\n------------\n\nRashford began playing football for Fletcher Moss Rangers at the age of five, starting out as a goalkeeper, and cited former United goalkeeper Tim Howard as his goalkeeping idol. Fletcher Moss Rangers academy development officer Dave Horrocks recalls that Rashford was on a \"different level\" to other boys, playing a major role as the team won a tournament with 15 scouts from various clubs watching.\n\nManchester United\n-----------------\n\nOn 25 February 2016, Rashford was included in the 18-man squad for United's UEFA Europa League round of 32, second leg tie against Danish club Midtjylland, owing to an injury crisis which saw 13 players injured. After Anthony Martial was injured in the warm-up, Rashford was chosen to start the game, and marked his first-team debut with two goals in the second half of a 5–1 win. Rashford's goals made him United's youngest ever scorer in European competition, beating a record previously held by George Best.\n\n2015–16: Debut Season\n---------------------\n\nOn 25 February 2016, Rashford was included in the 18-man squad for United's UEFA Europa League round of 32, second leg tie against Danish club Midtjylland, owing to an injury crisis which saw 13 players injured. After Anthony Martial was injured in the warm-up, Rashford was chosen to start the game, and marked his first-team debut with two goals in the second half of a 5–1 win. Rashford's goals made him United's youngest ever scorer in European competition, beating a record previously held by George Best.\n\n2016–17: First-Team Breakthrough and European Success\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the 2016–17 season, marking his place as part of the senior squad, Rashford was given the number 19 by new manager José Mourinho. The signing of veteran striker Zlatan Ibrahimović meant he often had to settle for a place on the substitutes bench, though upon his signing, Ibrahimović praised Rashford as a \"huge talent\" and \"the future of England\".\n\n2017–2019: Sustained Individual Success and Number 10 Shirt\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nRashford made his first appearance of his second full senior season on 8 August 2017 against Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup as a 46th-minute substitute in a 2–1 defeat. He started in a 4–0 home win against West Ham United five days later on 13 August, providing the assist for Romelu Lukaku's opening goal. Rashford scored his first goal of the season on 26 August, the opener in a 2–0 victory over Leicester, three minutes after coming on as a substitute.\n\n2019–21: Continued Development Despite Injury Issues\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nOn 1 July 2019, Rashford signed a new four-year contract with Manchester United, keeping him at the club until June 2023, with the option to extend by a further year. On the opening week of the season, Rashford scored a brace in a 4–0 win over Chelsea. In September, following a spell of poor form, Solskjær said he was not concerned about Rashford's dip in form and lack of goals. Towards the end of October, a return to form saw Rashford score in a 1–1 draw with rivals Liverpool, ending their 17-match winning streak. The following week, Rashford scored and assisted against Norwich City, and scored a second brace against Chelsea in the EFL Cup.\n\n2021–22: Loss in Form and Year of Scrutiny\n-----------------------------------------\n\nRashford returned to training on 11 October 2021, and made a goalscoring return in a 4–2 away loss to Leicester, coming off the bench and making the score 2–2. On 22 January 2022, in a 1–0 win against West Ham United, Rashford came on in the 63rd minute for Anthony Elanga, going on to score a 93rd-minute winner; the goal meant he had scored more last-minute winners in Premier League history (four) than any other player.\n\n2022–23: Return to Form\n-------------------------\n\nAfter enjoying a successful pre-season under new manager Erik ten Hag, Rashford opened his account for the season by scoring in a 2–1 win against Liverpool, and then twice in a 3–1 win against Arsenal. With an additional two assists, Rashford matched his contributions from the previous season. On 30 October, Rashford scored his 100th United goal in a 1–0 win against West Ham. He became the 22nd player to reach the figure for United, and the first in 13 years since Wayne Rooney.\n\n2023–present: Contract Extension and Recent Struggles\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nOn 18 July 2023, Rashford signed a new contract with Manchester United until 2028, for which he is paid £325,000 per week (£16.9m per year). He received his second career red card in a 4–3 UEFA Champions League group stage loss to FC Copenhagen on 8 November that year. In January 2024, he missed an FA Cup game against Newport County after calling in sick; Manchester United said \"Marcus has taken responsibility for his actions. This has been dealt with as an internal disciplinary matter, which is now closed\".\n\nInternational Career\n-------------------\n\nRashford's performances in his first senior season led to calls for him to represent England at UEFA Euro 2016. Manchester United academy coach Nicky Butt dismissed these calls, calling them premature and possibly harmful for the player's development, as did England manager Roy Hodgson, who said Rashford should be allowed to \"develop in peace\". In April, Hodgson admitted it was \"unlikely\" Rashford would be included in his tournament squad, but on 16 May, Hodgson named him in his preliminary 26-man squad for the tournament.\n\n2016–2018: First Major Tournaments\n---------------------------------\n\nRashford became part of England's Euro 2016 squad less than four months after making his United debut. He scored at Wembley in England's UEFA Nations League opener against Spain on 8 September 2018, losing 2–1. Three days later, Rashford also scored in a 1–0 friendly win over Switzerland at the King Power Stadium. The following month, he scored a goal and provided an assist in a 3–2 away win against Spain.\n\n2021–present: First Tournament Goals\n-----------------------------------\n\nAfter undergoing surgery on his shoulder, Rashford missed England's next squad for World Cup qualification games against Group I opponents Hungary, Andorra, and Poland. However, he returned to the squad for November's qualification games against Albania and San Marino, before being forced to withdraw due to illness.\n\nPlayer Profile\n--------------\n\nRashford can play as either a centre forward or a winger, primarily on the left-wing. Rashford himself prefers playing on the left, a position which allows him to cut inside and strike on goal with his stronger right foot, and likes to drop deep to collect the ball and build an attack. He was compared favourably to Kylian Mbappe due to the similar nature of their roles. In his formative years, Rashford's former youth coach Paul McGuinness noted how he was attempting to play similarly to Italian midfielder Andrea Pirlo, but he and fellow coaches Warren Joyce and Colin Little saw Rashford's potential as a striker and helped him work on his body shape and various attacking runs.\n\nStyle of Play and Development\n-------------------------------\n\nRashford was compared favourably to Kylian Mbappe due to the similar nature of their roles. He likes to drop deep to collect the ball and build an attack, something he learned as a youngster when playing as a central midfielder following a battle with Osgood–Schlatter disease. Rashford's coaches were reminded of Danny Welbeck due to his versatility, but it was decided to instead teach him the \"art\" of goalscoring, instructing him how to make runs at the right time, and was held back from playing reserve team football to give him confidence in his goalscoring abilities by pitting him against lesser defences.\n\nComparisons\n------------\n\nHe is seen as a similar type of player to Thierry Henry in terms of style of play, physical attributes, and end product. Van Gaal said his performances at a young age were similar to those of Patrick Kluivert, who he had managed at Ajax in the 1990s. Erik ten Hag, the United manager from the 2022–23 season, compared him favourably to Kylian Mbappe due to the similar nature of their roles.\n\nCharity and Activism\n--------------------\n\nIn October 2019, Rashford set up the In the Box campaign with Selfridges to give homeless people essential items over the Christmas period. He and his mother visited homeless shelters to personally hand the boxes out, while also sending some to a children's home in his grandmother's home country of Saint Kitts and Nevis. He was reportedly frustrated by the limited outreach the campaign resulted in.\n\nFood Poverty Campaign\n----------------------\n\nRashford publicly questioned Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak regarding a permanent £20 increase in Universal Credit, stressing his concern that many families would be \"counting down the days\" until the scheduled reversal the following April. A member of Rashford's team told The Times the permanent annual increase of £1,040 was the \"missing piece\" in their campaign strategy. At the end of December, it was reported by The Guardian that Rashford would have discussions with Thérèse Coffey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, regarding the permanent increase in Universal Credit; Rashford had previously been critical of Coffey during the initial stages of his campaign.\n\nRecognition\n------------\n\nIn the wake of the popularity generated by his charity work, Rashford signed with American rapper Jay-Z's entertainment agency Roc Nation in April 2020, with president Michael Yormark saying he was a \"shining example\" of somebody who was \"passionate about community\". In July 2020, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Manchester in recognition of his work to end child poverty in the UK, becoming the youngest person to receive an honorary doctorate from the university. In October 2021, in the ceremony at which the degree was conferred (delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic), Dame Nancy Rothwell, the Vice-Chancellor, called him \"an exceptional young man who continues to demonstrate a sense of community and generosity that goes well beyond his years\". In a speech in reply, he remarked that the occasion was bittersweet, because it was the day after the £20/week increase in Universal Credit made by the government in April 2020 as a temporary response to the pandemic had been withdrawn.\n\nPersonal Life\n--------------\n\nIn May 2022, Rashford announced his engagement to girlfriend Lucia Loi. They had been dating since meeting in school, and briefly split in 2021 before reconciling. However, it was announced that they had separated in June 2023.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Marcus_Rashford\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly

{"title": "Juneteenth", "content": "\nCelebrations and traditions\nThe holiday is considered the \"longest-running African-American holiday\" [12] and has been called \"America's second Independence Day.\" [13] [14] Juneteenth falls on June 19 and has often been celebrated on the third Saturday in June Historian Mitch Kachun considers that celebrations of the end of slavery have three goals: \"to celebrate, to educate, and to agitate.\" [15]\n\n\nHistory\nOn September 22, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln announced that the Emancipation Proclamation would go into effect on January 1, 1863, promising freedom to enslaved people in all of the rebellious parts of Southern states of the Confederacy including Texas [31] [32] [c] [d] Enforcement of the Proclamation generally relied upon the advance of Union troops Texas, as the most remote state of the former Confederacy, had seen an expansion of slavery because the presence of Union troops was low as the American Civil War ended; thus, the enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation had been slow and inconsistent there prior to Granger's order [9] In all June 19, 1865, was 900 days after the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect, 71 days after Robert E Lee surrendered to the Union on April 9, 1865, and 24 days after the disbanding of the Confederate military department covering Texas on May 26, 1865.\n\n\nEarly history\nDuring the American Civil War (1861–1865), emancipation came at different times in different parts of the Southern United States Large celebrations of emancipation, often called Jubilees (recalling the biblical Jubilee, in which enslaved people were freed), took place on September 22, January 1, July 4, August 1, April 6, and November 1, among other dates When emancipation finally came to Texas, on June 19, 1865, as the southern rebellion collapsed, celebration was widespread [35] While that date did not actually mark the unequivocal end of slavery, even in Texas, June 19 came to be a day of shared commemoration across the United States – created, preserved, and spread by ordinary African Americans – of slavery's wartime demise [9]\n\n\nThe Civil War and celebrations of emancipation\nDuring the American Civil War (1861–1865), emancipation came at different times in different parts of the Southern United States Large celebrations of emancipation, often called Jubilees (recalling the biblical Jubilee, in which enslaved people were freed), took place on September 22, January 1, July 4, August 1, April 6, and November 1, among other dates When emancipation finally came to Texas, on June 19, 1865, as the southern rebellion collapsed, celebration was widespread [35] While that date did not actually mark the unequivocal end of slavery, even in Texas, June 19 came to be a day of shared commemoration across the United States – created, preserved, and spread by ordinary African Americans – of slavery's wartime demise [9]\n\n\nEnd of slavery in Texas\nLincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation in the midst of the Civil War on September 22, 1862, declaring that if the rebels did not end the fighting and rejoin the Union, all enslaved people in the Confederacy would be freed on the first day of the year [36] On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the final Emancipation Proclamation, declaring that all enslaved people in the Confederate States of America in rebellion and not in Union hands were freed [36] [c]\n\n\nEarly Juneteenth celebrations\nFormerly enslaved people in Galveston rejoiced after General Order No 3 [48] One year later, on June 19, 1866, freedmen in Texas organized the first of what became annual commemorations of \"Jubilee Day.\" [40] Early celebrations were used as political rallies to give voting instructions to newly freed African Americans [49] Other independence observances occurred on January 1 or 4 [50]\n\n\nDecline of celebrations during the Jim Crow era\nIn the early 20th century, economic and political forces led to a decline in Juneteenth celebrations From 1890 to 1908, Texas and all former Confederate states passed new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised Black people, excluding them from the political process White-dominated state legislatures passed Jim Crow laws imposing second-class status [54] Gladys L Knight writes the decline in celebration was in part because \"upwardly mobile blacks .. were ashamed of their slave past and aspired to assimilate into mainstream culture Younger generations of blacks, becoming further removed from slavery were occupied with school .. and other pursuits.\" Others who migrated to the Northern United States could not take time off or simply dropped the celebration [12]\n\n\nRevival of celebrations\nJuneteenth soon saw a revival as Black people began tying their struggle to that of ending slavery In Atlanta, some campaigners for equality wore Juneteenth buttons During the 1968 Poor People's Campaign to Washington, DC, called by Rev Ralph Abernathy, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference made June 19 the \"Solidarity Day of the Poor People's Campaign.\" [44] [57] In the subsequent revival, large celebrations in Minneapolis and Milwaukee emerged,  [16] as well as across the Eastern United States [58]\n\n\n1960s–1980s\nJuneteenth soon saw a revival as Black people began tying their

emerged,  [16] as well as across the Eastern United States [58]\n\n\nPrayer breakfast and commemorative celebrations\nIn 1979, Democratic State Representative Al Edwards of Houston successfully sponsored legislation to make Juneteenth a paid Texas state holiday The same year, he hosted the inaugural Al Edwards prayer breakfast and commemorative celebration on the grounds of the 1859 home, Ashton Villa As one of the few existing buildings from the Civil War era and popular in local myth and legend as the location of Major General Granger's order, Edwards's annual celebration includes a local historian dressed as the Union general [60] reading General Order No. 3 from the second-story balcony of the home The Emancipation Proclamation is also read and speeches are made [61] [62]

"**Juneteenth**\n\nJuneteenth is a holiday that commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans in the United States. It is observed on June 19, and has been celebrated as a day of freedom and independence for over 150 years. The holiday has its roots in the aftermath of the American Civil War, and has evolved over time to become a significant cultural and historical event in the United States.\n\n**Celebrations and Traditions**\n\nThe holiday is considered the \"longest-running African-American holiday\" and has been called \"America's second Independence Day.\" Juneteenth falls on June 19 and has often been celebrated on the third Saturday in June. Historian Mitch Kachun considers that celebrations of the end of slavery have three goals: \"to celebrate, to educate, and to agitate.\"\n\n**History**\n\nOn September 22, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln announced that the Emancipation Proclamation would go into effect on January 1, 1863, promising freedom to enslaved people in all of the rebellious parts of Southern states of the Confederacy including Texas. Enforcement of the Proclamation generally relied upon the advance of Union troops. Texas, as the most remote state of the former Confederacy, had seen an expansion of slavery because the presence of Union troops was low as the American Civil War ended; thus, the enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation had been slow and inconsistent there prior to Granger's order. In all June 19, 1865, was 900 days after the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect, 71 days after Robert E Lee surrendered to the Union on April 9, 1865, and 24 days after the disbanding of the Confederate military department covering Texas on May 26, 1865.\n\n**Early History**\n\nDuring the American Civil War (1861–1865), emancipation came at different times in different parts of the Southern United States. Large celebrations of emancipation, often called Jubilees (recalling the biblical Jubilee, in which enslaved people were freed), took place on September 22, January 1, July 4, August 1, April 6, and November 1, among other dates. When emancipation finally came to Texas, on June 19, 1865, as the southern rebellion collapsed, celebration was widespread. While that date did not actually mark the unequivocal end of slavery, even in Texas, June 19 came to be a day of shared commemoration across the United States – created, preserved, and spread by ordinary African Americans – of slavery's wartime demise.\n\n**End of Slavery in Texas**\n\nLincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation in the midst of the Civil War on September 22, 1862, declaring that if the rebels did not end the fighting and rejoin the Union, all enslaved people in the Confederacy would be freed on the first day of the year. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the final Emancipation Proclamation, declaring that all enslaved people in the Confederate States of America in rebellion and not in Union hands were freed.\n\n**Early Juneteenth Celebrations**\n\nFormerly enslaved people in Galveston rejoiced after General Order No 3. One year later, on June 19, 1866, freedmen in Texas organized the first of what became annual commemorations of \"Jubilee Day.\" Early celebrations were used as political rallies to give voting instructions to newly freed African Americans. Other independence observances occurred on January 1 or 4.\n\n**Decline of Celebrations During the Jim Crow Era**\n\nIn the early 20th century, economic and political forces led to a decline in Juneteenth celebrations. From 1890 to 1908, Texas and all former Confederate states passed new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised Black people, excluding them from the political process. White-dominated state legislatures passed Jim Crow laws imposing second-class status. Gladys L Knight writes the decline in celebration was in part because \"upwardly mobile blacks .. were ashamed of their slave past and aspired to assimilate into mainstream culture. Younger generations of blacks, becoming further removed from slavery were occupied with school .. and other pursuits.\" Others who migrated to the Northern United States could not take time off or simply dropped the celebration.\n\n**Revival of Celebrations**\n\nJuneteenth soon saw a revival as Black people began tying their struggle to that of ending slavery. In Atlanta, some campaigners for equality wore Juneteenth buttons. During the 1968 Poor People's Campaign to Washington, DC, called by Rev Ralph Abernathy, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference made June 19 the \"Solidarity Day of the Poor People's Campaign.\" In the subsequent revival, large celebrations in Minneapolis and Milwaukee emerged, as well as across the Eastern United States.\n\n**Prayer Breakfast and Commemorative Celebrations**\n\nIn 1979, Democratic State Representative Al Edwards of Houston successfully sponsored legislation to make Juneteenth a paid Texas state holiday. The same year, he hosted the inaugural Al Edwards prayer breakfast and commemorative celebration on the grounds of the 1859 home, Ashton Villa. As one of the few existing buildings from the Civil War era and popular in local myth and legend as the location of Major General Granger's order, Edwards's annual celebration includes a local historian dressed as the Union general reading General Order No. 3 from the second-story balcony of the home. The Emancipation Proclamation is also read and speeches are made.\n\n**Official Statewide Recognitions**\n\nIn the late 1970s, when the Texas Legislature declared Juneteenth a \"holiday of significance .. particularly to the blacks of Texas,\" it became the first state to establish Juneteenth as a state holiday. The bill passed through the Texas Legislature in 1979 and was officially made a state holiday on January 1, 1980.

{"title": "Climate_change", "content": "\nTerminology\nBefore the 1980s it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution Scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate at this time [28] In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common, often being used interchangeably [29] [30] [31] Scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, while climate change describes both global warming and its effects on Earth's climate system, such as precipitation changes [28]\n\n\nGlobal temperature rise\nOver the last few million years the climate cycled through ice ages One of the hotter periods was the Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, where temperatures were between 0.5 °C and 1.5 °C warmer than before the start of global warming [40] This period saw sea levels 5 to 10 metres higher than today The most recent glacial maximum 20,000 years ago was some 5–7 °C colder This period has sea levels that were over 125 metres (410 ft) lower than today [41]\n\n\nTemperatures prior to present-day global warming\nOver the last few million years the climate cycled through ice ages One of the hotter periods was the Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, where temperatures were between 0.5 °C and 1.5 °C warmer than before the start of global warming [40] This period saw sea levels 5 to 10 metres higher than today The most recent glacial maximum 20,000 years ago was some 5–7 °C colder This period has sea levels that were over 125 metres (410 ft) lower than today [41]\n\n\nWarming since the Industrial Revolution\nAround 1850 thermometer records began to provide global coverage [50]\nBetween the 18th century and 1970 there was little net warming, as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling from sulfur dioxide emissions Sulfur dioxide causes acid rain, but it also produces sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, which reflect sunlight and cause global dimming After 1970, the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature [51] [52] [53]\n\n\nDifferences by region\nDifferent regions of the world warm at different rates The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature [71] This is because oceans lose more heat by evaporation and oceans can store a lot of heat [72] The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean [73] [74] The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents [75]\n\n\nFuture global temperatures\nThe World Meteorological Organization estimates there is an 80% chance that global temperatures will exceed 1.5 °C warming for at least one year between 2024 and 2028 The chance of the 5-year average being above 1.5 °C is almost half [87]\n\n\nCauses of recent global temperature rise\nThe climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years, decades or even centuries For example, El Niño events cause short-term spikes in surface temperature while La Niña events cause short term cooling [95] Their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale [96] Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy from external forcings [97] Examples of these include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun [98]\n\n\nGreenhouse gases\nGreenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earth's surface The Earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth's surface and warming it over time [102]\n\n\nLand surface changes\nAround 30% of Earth's land area is largely unusable for humans (glaciers, deserts, etc.), 26% is forests, 10% is shrubland and 34% is agricultural land [125] Deforestation is the main land use change contributor to global warming, [126] as the destroyed trees release CO2, and are not replaced by new trees, removing that carbon sink [127] Between 2001 and 2018, 27% of deforestation was from permanent clearing to enable agricultural expansion for crops and livestock Another 24% has been lost to temporary clearing under the shifting cultivation agricultural systems 26% was due to logging for wood and derived products, and wildfires have accounted for the remaining 23% [128] Some forests have not been fully cleared, but were already degraded by these impacts Restoring these forests also recovers their potential as a carbon sink [129]\n\n\nOther factors\nAir pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale [132] Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed This phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming, [133] and is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel [53] Smaller contributions come from black carbon (from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass), and from dust [134] [135] [136] Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much [137] [53]\n\n\nAerosols and clouds\nAir pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale [132] Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed This phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming, [133] and is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel [53] Smaller contributions come from black carbon (from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass), and from dust [134] [135] [136] Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much [137] [53]\n\n\nSolar and volcanic activity\nAs the Sun is the Earth's primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system [140] Solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites, [147] and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards [140] Since 1880, there has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun's energy reaching the Earth, in contrast to the warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) [148] The upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) would also be warming if the Sun was sending more energy to Earth, but instead, it has been cooling [100]\nThis is consistent with greenhouse gases preventing heat from leaving the Earth's atmosphere [149]\n\n\nClimate change feedbacks\nThe climate system's response to an initial forcing is shaped by feedbacks, which either amplify or dampen the change Self-reinforcing or positive feedbacks increase the response, while balancing or negative feedbacks reduce it [154] The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds [155] [156] The primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling, as Earth's surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature [157] In addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilizing effect of CO2 on plant growth [158] Feedbacks are expected to trend in a positive direction as greenhouse gas emissions continue, raising climate sensitivity [159]\n\n\nModelling\nA climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system [172] Models include natural processes like changes in the Earth's orbit, historical changes in the Sun's activity, and volcanic forcing [173] Models are used to estimate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks [174] [175] Models also predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere [176]\n\n\nImpacts\nThe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather Changes may occur gradually or rapidly Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations [186] Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency [187] Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia [188] Monsoonal precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere has increased since 1980 [189] The rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing, [190] and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming [191] Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change [192]\n\n\nEnvironmental effects\nThe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather Changes may occur gradually or rapidly Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations [186] Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency [187] Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia [188] Monsoonal precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere has increased since 1980 [189] The rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing, [190] and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming [191] Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change [192]\n\n\nTipping points and long-term impacts\nGreater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through 'tipping points'—thresholds beyond which certain major impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures return to their previous state [205] [206] For instance, the Greenland ice sheet is already melting, but if global warming reaches levels between 1.7 °C and 2.3 °C, its melting will continue until it fully disappears If the warming is later reduced to 1.5 °C or less, it will still lose a lot more ice than if the warming was never allowed to reach the threshold in the first place [207] While the ice sheets would melt over millennia, other tipping points would occur faster and give societies less time to respond The collapse of major ocean currents like the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), and irreversible damage to key ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest and coral reefs can unfold in a matter of decades [204]\n\n\nNature and wildlife\nRecent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes [215] For instance, the range of hundreds of North American birds has shifted northward at an average rate of 1.5 km/year over the past 55 years [216] Higher atmospheric CO2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening However, heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions The future balance of these opposing effects is unclear [217] A related phenomenon driven by climate change is woody plant encroachment, affecting up to 500 million hectares globally [218] Climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics [219] The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely [220] Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species [221]\n\n\nHumans\nThe effects of climate change are impacting humans everywhere in the world [233] Impacts can be observed on all continents and ocean regions, [234] with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk [235] Continued warming has potentially \"severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts\" for people and ecosystems [236] The risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries [237]\n\n\nHealth and food\nThe World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century [13] Scientists have warned about the irreversible harms it poses [238] Extreme weather events affect public health, and food and water security [239] [240] [241] Temperature extremes lead to increased illness and death [239] [240] Climate change increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events [240] [241] It can affect transmission of infectious diseases, such as dengue fever and malaria [238] [239] According to the World Economic Forum, 14.5 million more deaths are expected due to climate change by 2050 [242] 30% of the global population currently live in areas where extreme heat and humidity are already associated with excess deaths [243] [244] By 2100, 50% to 75% of the global population would live in such areas [243] [245]\n\n\nLivelihoods and inequality\nEconomic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a chance of disastrous consequences [249] Severe impacts are expected in South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources [250] [251] Heat stress can prevent outdoor labourers from working If warming reaches 4 °C then labour capacity in those regions could be reduced by 30 to 50% [252] The World Bank estimates that between 2016 and 2030, climate change could drive over 120 million people into extreme poverty without adaptation [253]\n\n\nClimate migration\nLow-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, which makes urban flooding more common Sometimes, land is permanently lost to the sea [259] This could lead to statelessness for people in island nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu [260] In some regions, the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to [261] With worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in Sahara-like uninhabitable and extremely hot climates [262]\n\n\nReducing and recapturing emissions\nClimate change can be mitigated by reducing the rate at which greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, and by increasing the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere [270] To limit global warming to less than 1.5 °C global greenhouse gas emissions needs to be net-zero by 2050, or by 2070 with a 2 °C target [271] This requires far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry [272]\n\n\nClean energy\nRenewable energy is key to limiting climate change [284] For decades, fossil fuels have accounted for roughly 80% of the world's energy use [285] The remaining share has been split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower, bioenergy, wind and solar power and geothermal energy) [286] Fossil fuel use is expected to peak in absolute terms prior to 2030 and then to decline, with coal use experiencing the sharpest reductions [287] Renewables represented 86% of all new electricity generation installed in 2023 [288] Other forms of clean energy, such as nuclear and hydropower, currently have a larger share of the energy supply However, their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison [289]\n\n\nEnergy conservation\nReducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions [307] If less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development It also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and minimizes carbon-intensive infrastructure development [308] Major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy [309] Several COVID-19 related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain [310]\n\n\nAgriculture and industry\n Agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand [315] A set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two-thirds from 2010 levels These include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production [316]\n\n\nCarbon dioxide removal\nNatural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of CO2 beyond naturally occurring levels [323] Reforestation and afforestation (planting forests where there were none before) are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns [324] Farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments [325] Forest and landscape restoration yields many benefits for the climate, including greenhouse gas emissions sequestration and reduction [129] Restoration/recreation of coastal wetlands, prairie plots and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter [326] [327] When carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees, there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use, fire, or other changes in ecosystems [328]\n\n\nAdaptation\nAdaptation is \"the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects\" [331]: 5  Without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of \"severe, widespread and irreversible\" impacts [332] More severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive [333] The capacity and potential for humans to adapt is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less [334] The first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity, but progress is slow Many countries have implemented adaptation policies However, there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance [335]\n\n\nPolicies and politics\nCountries that are most vulnerable to climate change have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions This raises questions about justice and fairness [347] Limiting global warming makes it much easier to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities The connection is recognized in Sustainable Development Goal 13 which is to \"take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [348] The goals on food, clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation [349]\n\n\nPolicy options\nA wide range of policies, regulations, and laws are being used to reduce emissions As of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions [352] Carbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems [353] Direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached $319 billion in 2017, and $5.2 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in [354] Ending these can cause a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths [355] Money saved on fossil subsidies could be used to support the transition to clean energy instead [356] More direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry [357] Several countries require utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production [358]\n\n\nClimate justice\nPolicy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality According to proponents of climate justice, the costs of climate adaptation should be paid by those most responsible for climate change, while the beneficiaries of payments should be those suffering impacts One way this can be addressed in practice is to have wealthy nations pay poorer countries to adapt [359]\n\n\nInternational climate agreements\nNearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) [364] The goal of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system [365] As stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained [366] The UNFCCC does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do Global emissions have risen since the UNFCCC was signed [367] Its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations [368]\n\n\nNational responses\nIn 2019, the United Kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency [387] Other countries and jurisdictions followed suit [388] That same year, the European Parliament declared a \"climate and environmental emergency\" [389] The European Commission presented its European Green Deal with the goal of making the EU carbon-neutral by 2050 [390] In 2021, the European Commission released its \"Fit for 55\" legislation package, which contains guidelines for the car industry; all new cars on the European market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035 [391]\n\n\nSociety\nPublic debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries, particularly Canada and Australia Climate change denial has originated from fossil fuel companies, industry groups, conservative think tanks, and contrarian scientists [397] Like the tobacco industry, the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about climate-change related scientific data and results [398] People who hold unwarranted doubt about climate change are called climate change \"skeptics\", although \"contrarians\" or \"deniers\" are more appropriate terms [399]\n\n\nDenial and misinformation\nPublic debate about climate change has been strongly

\"deniers\" are more appropriate terms [399]\n\n\nPublic awareness and opinion\nClimate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s [407] Due to media coverage in the early 1990s, people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion [408] In popular culture, the climate fiction movie The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth (2006) focused on climate change [407]\n\n\nClimate movement\nClimate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change They can take the form of public demonstrations, fossil fuel divestment, lawsuits and other activities [417] Prominent demonstrations include the School Strike for Climate In this initiative, young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on Fridays, inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg [418] Mass civil disobedience actions by groups like Extinction Rebellion have protested by disrupting roads and public transport [419]\n\n\nHistory\nScientists in the 19th century such as Alexander von Humboldt began to foresee the effects of climate change [423] [424] [425] [426] In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why Earth's temperature was higher than the Sun's energy alone could explain Earth's atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat However, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat, which in turn warms the planet [427]\n\n\nEarly discoveries\nScientists in the 19th century such as Alexander von Humboldt began to foresee the effects of climate change [423] [424] [425] [426] In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed

consensus\nIn the 1950s, Gilbert Plass created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum This model predicted that increasing CO2 levels would cause warming Around the same time, Hans Suess found evidence that CO2 levels had been rising, and Roger Revelle showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase The two scientists subsequently helped Charles Keeling to begin a record of continued increase, which has been termed the \"Keeling Curve\" [433] Scientists alerted the public, [439] and the dangers were highlighted at James Hansen's 1988 Congressional testimony [34] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world's governments, spurred interdisciplinary research [440] As part of the IPCC reports, scientists assess the scientific discussion that takes place in peer-reviewed journal articles [441]\n\n\nSee also\n This article incorporates text from a free

global temperatures. This phenomenon is primarily caused by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n## Terminology\n\nBefore the 1980s, the term \"inadvertent climate modification\" was used to describe human impacts on the climate. However, the terms \"global warming\" and \"climate change\" became more common in the 1980s, often being used interchangeably. Scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, while climate change describes both global warming and its effects on Earth's climate system, such as precipitation changes.\n\n## Global Temperature Rise\n\nThe climate has experienced various cycles throughout its history, including ice ages. One of the warmer periods was the Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, where temperatures were between 0.5°C and 1.5°C warmer than before the start of global warming. This period saw sea levels 5 to 10 meters higher than today. The most recent glacial maximum 20,000 years ago was some 5-7°C colder, with sea levels over 125 meters (410 ft) lower.\n\n## Temperatures Prior to Present-Day Global Warming\n\nThe climate has experienced various cycles throughout its history, including ice ages. One of the warmer periods was the Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, where temperatures were between 0.5°C and 1.5°C warmer than before the start of global warming. This period saw sea levels 5 to 10 meters higher than today. The most recent glacial maximum 20,000 years ago was some 5-7°C colder, with sea levels over 125 meters (410 ft) lower.\n\n## Warming Since the Industrial Revolution\n\nAround 1850, thermometer records began to provide global coverage. Between the 18th century and 1970, there was little net warming, as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling from sulfur dioxide emissions. However, after 1970, the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature.\n\n## Differences by Region\n\nDifferent regions of the world warm at different rates. The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet. Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature.\n\n## Future Global Temperatures\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization estimates that there is an 80% chance that global temperatures will exceed 1.5°C warming for at least one year between 2024 and 2028. The chance of the 5-year average being above 1.5°C is almost half.\n\n## Causes of Recent Global Temperature Rise\n\nThe climate system experiences various cycles on its own, which can last for years, decades, or even centuries. For example, El Niño events cause short-term spikes in surface temperature, while La Niña events cause short-term cooling. Their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale. Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy from external forcings, such as changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.\n\n## Greenhouse Gases\n\nGreenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, allowing it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earth's surface. The Earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it, slowing the rate at which heat escapes into space and trapping heat near the Earth's surface.\n\n## Land Surface Changes\n\nAround 30% of Earth's land area is largely unusable for humans, 26% is forests, 10% is shrubland, and 34% is agricultural land. Deforestation is the main land use change contributor to global warming, as destroyed trees release CO2 and are not replaced by new trees, removing that carbon sink.\n\n## Other Factors\n\nAir pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale. Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation, leading to a reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface, a phenomenon known as global dimming. Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.\n\n## Climate Change Feedbacks\n\nThe climate system's response to an initial forcing is shaped by feedbacks, which either amplify or dampen the change. Self-reinforcing or positive feedbacks increase the response, while balancing or negative feedbacks reduce it. The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice-albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds.\n\n## Modelling\n\nA climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect the climate system. Models include natural processes like changes in the Earth's orbit, historical changes in the Sun's activity, and volcanic forcing. Models are used to estimate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks.\n\n## Impacts\n\nThe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather. Changes may occur gradually or rapidly. Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency. Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia.\n\n## Tipping Points and Long-Term Impacts\n\nGreater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through 'tipping points'—thresholds beyond which certain major impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures return to their previous state. For instance, the Greenland ice sheet is already melting, but if global warming reaches levels between 1.7°C and 2.3°C, its melting will continue until it fully disappears.\n\n## Nature and Wildlife\n\nRecent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes. For instance, the range of hundreds of North American birds has shifted northward at an average rate of 1.5 km/year over the past 55 years. Higher atmospheric CO2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening, but heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions.\n\n## Humans\n\nThe effects of climate change are impacting humans everywhere in the world. Impacts can be observed on all continents and ocean regions, with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk. Continued warming has potentially \"severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts\" for people and ecosystems. The risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries.\n\n## Health and Food\n\nThe World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century. Scientists have warned about the irreversible harms it poses. Extreme weather events affect public health, and food and water security. Temperature extremes lead to increased illness and death. Climate change increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, affecting transmission of infectious diseases.\n\n## Livelihoods and Inequality\n\nEconomic damages due to climate change may be severe, and there is a chance of disastrous consequences. Severe impacts are expected in South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources. Heat stress can prevent outdoor laborers from working, and warming could reduce labor capacity in those regions by 30 to 50%.\n\n## Climate Migration\n\nLow-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, making urban flooding more common. Sometimes, land is permanently lost to the sea. This could lead to statelessness for people in island nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu. In some regions, the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to.\n\n## Reducing and Recapturing Emissions\n\nClimate change can be mitigated by reducing the rate at which greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere and increasing the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere. To limit global warming to less than 1.5°C, global greenhouse gas emissions need to be net-zero by 2050, or by 2070 with a 2°C target.\n\n## Clean Energy\n\nRenewable energy is key to limiting climate change. For decades, fossil fuels have accounted for roughly 80% of the world's energy use. The remaining share has been split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower, bioenergy, wind, and solar power and geothermal energy).\n\n## Energy Conservation\n\nReducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions. If less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development, and it makes it easier to manage the electricity grid and minimizes carbon-intensive infrastructure development.\n\n## Agriculture and Industry\n\nAgriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand. A set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two-thirds from 2010 levels.\n\n## Carbon Dioxide Removal\n\nNatural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of CO2 beyond naturally occurring levels. Reforestation and afforestation (planting forests where there were none before) are among the most mature sequestration techniques. Farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments.\n\n## Adaptation\n\nAdaptation is \"the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects.\" Without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of \"severe, widespread, and irreversible\" impacts. More severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive.\n\n## Policies and Politics\n\nCountries that are most vulnerable to climate change have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions, raising questions about justice and fairness. Limiting global warming makes it much easier to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities.\n\n## Policy Options\n\nA wide range of policies, regulations, and laws are being used to reduce emissions. As of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems.\n\n## Climate Justice\n\nPolicy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality. According to proponents of climate justice, the costs of climate adaptation should be paid by those most responsible for climate change, while the beneficiaries of payments should be those suffering impacts.\n\n## International Climate Agreements\n\nNearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The goal of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. As stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained.\n\n## National Responses\n\nIn 2019, the United Kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency. Other countries and jurisdictions followed suit. That same year, the European Parliament declared a \"climate and environmental emergency.\" The European Commission presented its European Green Deal with the goal of making the EU carbon-neutral by 2050.\n\n## Society\n\nPublic debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries, particularly Canada and Australia. Climate change denial has originated from fossil fuel companies, industry groups, conservative think tanks, and contrarian scientists.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Climate_change\" following this outline:\n\n\nTerminology\nBefore the 1980s it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution Scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate at this time [28] In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common, often being used interchangeably [29] [30] [31] Scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, while climate change describes both global warming and its effects on Earth's climate system, such as precipitation changes [28]\n\n\nGlobal temperature rise\nOver the last few million years the climate cycled through ice ages One of the hotter periods was the Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, where temperatures were between 0.5 °C and 1.5 °C warmer than before the start of global warming [40] This period saw sea levels 5 to 10 metres higher than today The most recent glacial maximum 20,000 years ago was some 5–7 °C colder This period has sea levels that were over 125 metres (410 ft) lower than today [41]\n\n\nTemperatures prior to present-day global warming\nOver the last few million years the climate cycled through ice ages One of the hotter periods was the Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, where temperatures were between 0.5 °C and 1.5 °C warmer than before the start of global warming [40] This period saw sea levels 5 to 10 metres higher than today The most recent glacial maximum 20,000 years ago was some 5–7 °C colder This period has sea levels that were over 125 metres (410 ft) lower than today [41]\n\n\nWarming since the Industrial Revolution\nAround 1850 thermometer records began to provide global coverage [50]\nBetween the 18th century and 1970 there was little net warming, as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling from sulfur dioxide emissions Sulfur dioxide causes acid rain, but it also produces sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, which reflect sunlight and cause global dimming After 1970, the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature [51] [52] [53]\n\n\nDifferences by region\nDifferent regions of the world warm at different rates The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature [71] This is because oceans lose more heat by evaporation and oceans can store a lot of heat [72] The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean [73] [74] The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents [75]\n\n\nFuture global temperatures\nThe World Meteorological Organization estimates there is an 80% chance that global temperatures will exceed 1.5 °C warming for at least one year between 2024 and 2028 The chance of the 5-year average being above 1.5 °C is almost half [87]\n\n\nCauses of recent global temperature rise\nThe climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years, decades or even centuries For example, El Niño events cause short-term spikes in surface temperature while La Niña events cause short term cooling [95] Their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale [96] Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy from external forcings [97] Examples of these include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun [98]\n\n\nGreenhouse gases\nGreenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earth's surface The Earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth's surface and warming it over time [102]\n\n\nLand surface changes\nAround 30% of Earth's land area is largely unusable for humans (glaciers, deserts, etc.), 26% is forests, 10% is shrubland and 34% is agricultural land [125] Deforestation is the main land use change contributor to global warming, [126] as the destroyed trees release CO2, and are not replaced by new trees, removing that carbon sink [127] Between 2001 and 2018, 27% of deforestation was from permanent clearing to enable agricultural expansion for crops and livestock Another 24% has been lost to temporary clearing under the shifting cultivation agricultural systems 26% was due to logging for wood and derived products, and wildfires have accounted for the remaining 23% [128] Some forests have not been fully cleared, but were already degraded by these impacts Restoring these forests also recovers their potential as a carbon sink [129]\n\n\nOther factors\nAir pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale [132] Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed This phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming, [133] and is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel [53] Smaller contributions come from black carbon (from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass), and from dust [134] [135] [136] Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much [137] [53]\n\n\nAerosols and clouds\nAir pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale [132] Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed This phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming, [133] and is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations

1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much [137] [53]\n\n\nSolar and volcanic activity\nAs the Sun is the Earth's primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system [140] Solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites, [147] and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards [140] Since 1880, there has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun's energy reaching the Earth, in contrast to the warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) [148] The upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) would also be warming if the Sun was sending more energy to Earth, but instead, it has been cooling [100]\nThis is consistent with greenhouse gases preventing heat from leaving the Earth's atmosphere [149]\n\n\nClimate change feedbacks\nThe climate system's response to an initial forcing is shaped by feedbacks, which either amplify or dampen the change Self-reinforcing or positive feedbacks increase the response, while balancing or negative feedbacks reduce it [154] The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds [155] [156] The primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling, as Earth's surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature [157] In addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilizing effect of CO2 on plant growth [158] Feedbacks are expected to trend in a positive direction as greenhouse gas emissions continue, raising climate sensitivity [159]\n\n\nModelling\nA climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system [172] Models include natural processes like changes in the Earth's orbit, historical changes in the Sun's activity, and volcanic forcing [173] Models are used to estimate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks [174] [175] Models also predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere [176]\n\n\nImpacts\nThe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather Changes may occur gradually or rapidly Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations [186] Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency [187] Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia [188] Monsoonal precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere has increased since 1980 [189] The rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing, [190] and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming [191] Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change [192]\n\n\nEnvironmental effects\nThe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather Changes may occur gradually or rapidly Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations [186] Since the 1950s, droughts and heat

to climate warming [191] Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change [192]\n\n\nTipping points and long-term impacts\nGreater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through 'tipping points'—thresholds beyond which certain major impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures return to their previous state [205] [206] For instance, the Greenland ice sheet is already melting, but if global warming reaches levels between 1.7 °C and 2.3 °C, its melting will continue until it fully disappears If the warming is later reduced to 1.5 °C or less, it will still lose a lot more ice than if the warming was never allowed to reach the threshold in the first place [207] While the ice sheets would melt over millennia, other tipping points would occur faster and give societies less time to respond The collapse of major ocean currents like the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), and irreversible damage to key ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest and coral reefs can unfold in a matter of decades [204]\n\n\nNature and wildlife\nRecent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes [215] For instance, the range of hundreds of North American birds has shifted northward at an average rate of 1.5 km/year over the past 55 years [216] Higher atmospheric CO2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening However, heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions The future balance of these opposing effects is unclear [217] A related phenomenon driven by climate change is woody plant encroachment, affecting up to 500 million hectares globally [218] Climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics [219] The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely [220] Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species [221]\n\n\nHumans\nThe effects of climate change are impacting humans everywhere in the world [233] Impacts can be observed on all continents and ocean regions, [234] with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk [235] Continued warming has potentially \"severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts\" for people and ecosystems [236] The risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries [237]\n\n\nHealth and food\nThe World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century [13] Scientists have warned about the irreversible harms it poses [238] Extreme weather events affect public health, and food and water security [239] [240] [241] Temperature extremes lead to increased illness and death [239] [240] Climate change increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events [240] [241] It can affect transmission of infectious diseases, such as dengue fever and malaria [238] [239] According to the World Economic Forum, 14.5 million more deaths are expected due to climate change by 2050 [242] 30% of the global population currently live in areas where extreme heat and humidity are already associated with excess deaths [243] [244] By 2100, 50% to 75% of the global population would live in such areas [243] [245]\n\n\nLivelihoods and inequality\nEconomic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a chance of disastrous consequences [249] Severe impacts are expected in South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources [250] [251] Heat stress can prevent outdoor labourers from working If warming reaches 4 °C then labour capacity in those regions could be reduced by 30 to 50% [252] The World Bank estimates that between 2016 and 2030, climate change could drive over 120 million people into extreme poverty without adaptation [253]\n\n\nClimate migration\nLow-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, which makes urban flooding more common Sometimes, land is permanently lost to the sea [259] This could lead to statelessness for people in island nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu [260] In some regions, the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to [261] With worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in Sahara-like uninhabitable and extremely hot climates [262]\n\n\nReducing and recapturing emissions\nClimate change can be mitigated by reducing the rate at which greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, and by increasing the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere [270] To limit global warming to less than 1.5 °C global greenhouse gas emissions needs to be net-zero by 2050, or by 2070 with a 2 °C target [271] This requires far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry [272]\n\n\nClean energy\nRenewable energy is key to limiting climate change [284] For decades, fossil fuels have accounted for roughly 80% of the world's energy use [285] The remaining share has been split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower, bioenergy, wind and solar power and geothermal energy) [286] Fossil fuel use is expected to peak in absolute terms prior to 2030 and then to decline, with coal use experiencing the sharpest reductions [287] Renewables represented 86% of all new electricity generation installed in 2023 [288] Other forms of clean energy, such as nuclear and hydropower, currently have a larger share of the energy supply However, their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison [289]\n\n\nEnergy conservation\nReducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions [307] If less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development It also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and minimizes carbon-intensive infrastructure development [308] Major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy [309] Several COVID-19 related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain [310]\n\n\nAgriculture and industry\n Agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand [315] A set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two-thirds from 2010 levels These include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production [316]\n\n\nCarbon dioxide removal\nNatural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of CO2 beyond naturally occurring levels [323] Reforestation and afforestation (planting forests where there were none before) are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns [324] Farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments [325] Forest and landscape restoration yields many benefits for the climate, including greenhouse gas emissions sequestration and reduction [129] Restoration/recreation of coastal wetlands, prairie plots and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter [326] [327] When carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees, there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use, fire, or other changes in ecosystems [328]\n\n\nAdaptation\nAdaptation is \"the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects\" [331]: 5  Without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of \"severe, widespread and irreversible\" impacts [332] More severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive [333] The capacity and potential for humans to adapt is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less [334] The first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity, but progress is slow Many countries have implemented adaptation policies However, there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance [335]\n\n\nPolicies and politics\nCountries that are most vulnerable to climate change have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions This raises questions about justice and fairness [347] Limiting global warming makes it much easier to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities The connection is recognized in Sustainable Development Goal 13 which is to \"take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\" [348] The goals on food, clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation [349]\n\n\nPolicy options\nA wide range of policies, regulations, and laws are being used to reduce emissions As of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions [352] Carbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems [353] Direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached $319 billion in 2017, and $5.2 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in [354] Ending these can cause a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths [355] Money saved on fossil subsidies could be used to support the transition to clean energy instead [356] More direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry [357] Several countries require utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production [358]\n\n\nClimate justice\nPolicy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality According to proponents of climate justice, the costs of climate adaptation should be paid by those most responsible for climate change, while the beneficiaries of payments should be those suffering impacts One way this can be addressed in practice is to have wealthy nations pay poorer countries to adapt [359]\n\n\nInternational climate agreements\nNearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) [364] The goal of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system [365] As stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained [366] The UNFCCC does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do Global emissions have risen since the UNFCCC was signed [367] Its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations [368]\n\n\nNational responses\nIn 2019, the United Kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency [387] Other countries and jurisdictions followed suit [388] That same year, the European Parliament declared a \"climate and environmental emergency\" [389] The European Commission presented its European Green Deal with the goal of making the EU carbon-neutral by 2050 [390] In 2021, the European Commission released its \"Fit for 55\" legislation package, which contains guidelines for the car industry; all new cars on the European market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035 [391]\n\n\nSociety\nPublic debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries, particularly Canada and Australia Climate change denial has originated from fossil fuel companies, industry groups, conservative think tanks, and contrarian scientists [397] Like the tobacco industry, the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about climate-change related scientific data and results [398] People who hold unwarranted doubt about climate change are called climate change \"skeptics\", although \"contrarians\" or \"deniers\" are more appropriate terms [399]\n\n\nDenial and misinformation\nPublic debate about climate change has been strongly

\"deniers\" are more appropriate terms [399]\n\n\nPublic awareness and opinion\nClimate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s [407] Due to media coverage in the early 1990s, people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion [408] In popular culture, the climate fiction movie The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth (2006) focused on climate change [407]\n\n\nClimate movement\nClimate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change They can take the form of public demonstrations, fossil fuel divestment, lawsuits and other activities [417] Prominent demonstrations include the School Strike for Climate In this initiative, young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on Fridays, inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg [418] Mass civil disobedience actions by groups like Extinction Rebellion have protested by disrupting roads and public transport [419]\n\n\nHistory\nScientists in the 19th century such as Alexander von Humboldt began to foresee the effects of climate change [423] [424] [425] [426] In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why Earth's temperature was higher than the Sun's energy alone could explain Earth's atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat However, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat, which in turn warms the planet [427]\n\n\nEarly discoveries\nScientists in the 19th century such as Alexander von Humboldt began to foresee the effects of climate change [423] [424] [425] [426] In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed

consensus\nIn the 1950s, Gilbert Plass created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum This model predicted that increasing CO2 levels would cause warming Around the same time, Hans Suess found evidence that CO2 levels had been rising, and Roger Revelle showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase The two scientists subsequently helped Charles Keeling to begin a record of continued increase, which has been termed the \"Keeling Curve\" [433] Scientists alerted the public, [439] and the dangers were highlighted at James Hansen's 1988 Congressional testimony [34] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world's governments, spurred interdisciplinary research [440] As part of the IPCC reports, scientists assess the scientific discussion that takes place in peer-reviewed journal articles [441]\n\n\nSee also\n This article incorporates text from a free

weather for a broad area in northwest Alabama, northeast Mississippi, and southern Tennessee on January 25 This included a 5% risk for tornadoes [31] Isolated to scattered severe weather occurred throughout the afternoon into the evening, including an EF0 tornado that caused some tree damage in Fayette County, Tennessee [32] [33] Later that evening, an isolated severe storm developed in Central Mississippi near I-55 The storm then tracked northeastward into Alabama, approaching the northern Birmingham metro area by 10:20 p.m (04:20 UTC), exhibiting consistent, but broad, rotation At 10:40 p.m (04:40 UTC), the storm unexpectedly produced an intense and destructive tornado that struck the suburbs of Fultondale and Center Point Significant structural damage occurred in Fultondale, with numerous homes, vehicles, and businesses being severely damaged or destroyed A Hampton Inn sustained major structural damage, and Fultondale High School was significantly damaged as well Considerable damage to homes and trees was also noted farther to the northeast in Center Point along the 10.4-mile (16.7 km) long damage path, which was up to 900 yards (820 m) wide The tornado, which was rated mid-range EF3 with maximum winds of up to 150 mph (240 km/h), killed one person and injured at least 30 others [34] [35]\n\n\nJanuary 25–27 (United States)\nFollowing a period of inactivity,

[35]\n\n\nFebruary\nOn February 15, the Storm Prediction Center issued an Enhanced risk for severe weather Multiple tornadoes, two of which were strong and destructive, struck the states of Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina One supercell produced a tornado family of three tornadoes in the Florida Panhandle and Southwestern Georgia, with the final one being a large, strong EF2 tornado that caused major damage to homes and injured five people just outside of Damascus, Georgia Around midnight, a destructive high-end EF3 tornado heavily damaged or destroyed dozens of homes in the Ocean Ridge Plantation subdivision near Sunset Beach, North Carolina A community garden center and two homes were leveled at that location, one of which was swept completely away A large metal building, several vehicles and RVs, and many trees sustained significant damage as well Three fatalities and 10 injuries occurred as a result of this tornado It was the deadliest tornado in Southeastern North Carolina since an F3 tornado killed eight in Riegelwood in November 2006 A total of six tornadoes were confirmed [40] [41] [42]\n\n\nFebruary 15 (United States)\nOn February 15, the Storm Prediction

outlook for the Texas Panhandle, including a 15% risk for strong tornadoes [43] Multiple tornadoes touched down across the Panhandle, mainly areas between Lubbock and Amarillo and points eastward [44] [45] [46] [47] A large EF2 wedge tornado moved from southwest of Happy in Swisher County to east of Canyon in Randall County, toppling a cell tower, inflicting major roof damage to homes, and snapping trees and power poles As the tornado dissipated, a new tornado, rated EF1, formed and moved into Armstrong County, passing over Palo Duro Canyon, where several RVs were tossed and a cabin had its roof blown off A third tornado was spawned just northeast of the second one, also crossing from Randall County to Armstrong County and lifting near Washburn, just before crossing into Carson County Another EF2 tornado caused minor damage in Clarendon before strengthening and causing major damage to power poles and a mobile home near the Greenbelt Lake Reservoir [48] Farther to the north, an EF2 tornado moved through a rural area near Ensign, Kansas, snapping power poles and causing damage to grain bins and pivot irrigation sprinklers, although no tornado warning was issued for the storm Several other tornadoes touched down very briefly and received ratings of EFU because they did not cause any damage A total of 21 tornadoes were confirmed [49]\n\n\nMarch 13 (United States)\nOn the morning of March 13, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk with severe weather outlook for the Texas Panhandle, including a 15% risk for strong tornadoes [43] Multiple tornadoes touched down across the Panhandle, mainly areas between Lubbock and Amarillo and points eastward [44] [45] [46] [47] A large EF2 wedge tornado moved from southwest of Happy in Swisher County to east of Canyon in Randall

total of 21 tornadoes were confirmed [49]\n\n\nMarch 16–18 (United States)\nFollowing isolated tornado activity on March 16, a rare high risk outlook was issued by the SPC for March 17 in Mississippi and Alabama, including a 45% risk area for tornadoes, the first of which since May 2019 [50] Forecasters noted the potential for violent, long-tracked tornadoes to occur in the risk area, though this did not occur However, a few strong tornadoes did touch down and cause significant damage, though none exceeded EF2 intensity The first tornado of the day touched down west of Waynesboro, Mississippi, just after 12:00 p.m CDT and caused EF2 damage to chicken houses and trees [51] Other strong EF2 tornadoes caused damage in and around Silas, Billingsley, and Burnsville, Alabama [51] More severe weather occurred on March 18 along the Atlantic coast from Florida to Southern Maryland, and a moderate risk was issued from Eastern Georgia to North Central North Carolina on March 17 [52] The moderate risk was downgraded to enhanced on March 18 due to a lack of buoyancy in the atmosphere, but numerous strong to severe thunderstorms still tracked through the area during the afternoon [53] [54] Several more tornadoes were confirmed before the storms moved offshore that evening Overall, this outbreak produced 51 tornadoes and no fatalities [54]\n\n\nMarch 24–28 (United States)\nAfter isolated tornado and widespread hail activity in Texas the previous day, March 25 brought another severe weather outbreak to the Deep South, where a high risk outlook was issued for the second time in eight days This included a 30% risk for tornadoes, with the potential for multiple strong and long-tracked tornadoes noted in the outlook discussion [55] The first supercell of the day produced three low-end EF3 tornadoes in central Alabama with the second one prompting a tornado emergency—the first of three issued during the outbreak—in Shelby County, Alabama [56] [57] That tornado damaged or destroyed many homes in the southern suburbs of Birmingham The home of broadcast meteorologist James Spann was one of the residences damaged by this tornado [58] [59] [60] The third tornado destroyed a manufacturing facility and a church, and badly damaged or destroyed many homes in and around Ohatchee, Alabama, killing six people A long-tracked EF3 wedge tornado also tracked over 80 miles (130 km) across five counties in central Alabama for 98 minutes, causing significant damage near Sawyerville, Greensboro and Brent while injuring 13 The most intense tornado of the event was a low-end EF4 tornado that caused major damage in Newnan, Georgia, during the overnight hours, leveling homes and resulting in one indirect death due to a heart attack [61]\n\n\nApril\nScattered tornado activity occurred in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Iowa from April 7 into the early morning hours of April 8, with 12 tornadoes being confirmed An EF0 tornado in southwestern Cedar Rapids,

mobile home which was destroyed [65] [66] Damage totaled to at least $515 million [67]\n\n\nApril 9–11 (United States)\nSeveral rounds of intense severe thunderstorms brought significant damaging winds, very large hail, and several tornadoes primarily across the Southern United States from April 9 into the evening of April 11 [68] April 9 started with several clusters of multi-cells, supercells, and bowing segments across much of the Deep South Strong straight-line thunderstorm winds in Shreveport, Louisiana, toppled a tree onto a mobile home around 6:30 p.m (23:30 UTC), resulting in a fatality [69] Several large hail-producing supercells then formed and moved through areas from Oklahoma to North Texas before merging into a large squall line and surging southeastward into Arkansas and Louisiana, producing widespread wind damage Meanwhile, several tornado-producing supercells formed ahead of the line A weak EF0 tornado was recorded by several storm spotters near Pelahatchie, Mississippi, causing intermittent tree damage Just after midnight on April 10, a large EF1 tornado ripped roofs off of sheds and carports and knocked down trees, including some that fell on homes, near Columbia, Mississippi To the southwest, a low-end EF3 tornado tossed vehicles and damaged or destroyed several homes and mobile homes in the rural community of Waxia near Palmetto, Louisiana, just after 2:00 a.m CDT (07:00 UTC), resulting in one fatality and seven injuries [70] [71] Later that morning, the squall line produced multiple tornadoes in the Florida Panhandle A strong tornadic waterspout came onshore in Laguna Beach, Florida, causing severe EF2 damage to a business and damaging several homes Another tornadic waterspout struck Gulf Lagoon Beach, located at the southeastern edge of the Panama City Beach city limits and caused EF0 damage to beach furniture In Lynn Haven, an EF1 tornado caused considerable damage to an automotive business [72] [73] That afternoon, isolated to widely scattered severe storms formed from the Great Lakes to the Carolinas, producing sporadic wind and hail damage as well as isolated tornadoes into the overnight hours An EF1 tornado also caused damage to businesses and a radio tower, and flipped a car near Seneca, South Carolina [73] A brief EF0 tornado damaged a few homes near Cutlerville, Michigan, and another EF0 tornado damaged a home near Reidville, South Carolina [74] [75] Early on April 11, another EF1 tornado caused damage to homes and outbuildings near Belvoir, North Carolina [76] That afternoon, another squall line pushed southeastward down the entire Florida panhandle, producing mainly wind and hail damage, although a brief EF0 tornado that caused minor tree damage was confirmed near Eagle Lake [77] Another non-tornadic fatality occurred near Spring Hill when a person got out of their car after it was struck by a fallen tree and was electrocuted when they came in contact with downed power lines [78] Overall, the outbreak generated 20 tornadoes, resulting in one fatality Two other non-tornadic deaths also occurred as a result of the severe weather There was also at least $635 million in damage [67]\n\n\nApril 23–25 (United States)\nBeginning on the afternoon of April 23 into the early morning hours of April 25, severe thunderstorms moved across the Southern United States [79] [80] Multiple photogenic tornadoes were observed in North Texas on April 23, including an EF2 tornado that heavily damaged a farm, snapped power poles, and threw vehicles west of Lockett [81] Another EF2 tornado snapped many trees and damaged homes southwest of Douglas, Georgia, on April 24, including one that was shifted off of its foundation Two people were injured when an EF1 tornado flipped a mobile home west of Haleburg, Alabama, as well A total of 14 tornadoes were confirmed [82] Severe weather relating to the storm system forced the Atlanta Braves to postpone a Major League Baseball game against the Arizona Diamondbacks [83]\n\n\nApril 27–28 (United States)\nOn April 21, the SPC issued a 15% risk contour for areas of Texas and Oklahoma By April 27, a slight risk was in place for parts of the Great Plains, mainly for the threat very large hail [84] Numerous tornadoes touched down in Colorado and Texas, most of which were weak or remained over open fields However, one strong multiple-vortex EF3 tornado touched down near Truscott, Texas, tossing a 4,000 lb (1,800 kg) cattle feeder and bending large metal power line pylons to the ground An early-morning high-end EF1 tornado that hit near Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, on April 28 destroyed multiple barns, sheds, and outbuildings [85] Another high-end EF1 tornado near Hondo, Texas, destroyed a mobile home and a barn, severely damaged the roof of a house, downed trees and power lines, and toppled a hunting tower The same supercell also produced a 6.4-inch-diameter (16 cm) hailstone in Hondo, the largest hailstone ever recorded in Texas [86] Other weak tornadoes touched down that afternoon as well [82] Three severe hailstorms that day also caused major damage in the suburbs of Fort Worth, Oklahoma City, and San Antonio as well, the third of which came from the Hondo supercell Overall, 25 tornadoes were confirmed [87] Damage was at least a billion dollars [67]\n\n\nMay\nTwo separate zones of severe and

along the Atlantic coast from Florida to Southern Maryland, and a moderate risk was issued from Eastern Georgia to North Central North Carolina on March 17 [52] The moderate risk was downgraded to enhanced on March 18 due to a lack of buoyancy in the atmosphere, but numerous strong to severe thunderstorms still tracked through the area during the afternoon [53] [54] Several more tornadoes were confirmed before the storms moved offshore that evening Overall, this outbreak produced 51 tornadoes and no fatalities [54]\n\n\nMarch 24–28 (United States)\nAfter isolated tornado and widespread hail activity in Texas the previous day, March 25 brought another severe weather outbreak to the Deep South, where a high risk outlook was issued for the second time in eight days This included a 30% risk for tornadoes, with the potential for multiple strong and long-tracked tornadoes noted in the outlook discussion [55] The first supercell of the day produced three low-end EF3 tornadoes in central Alabama with the second one prompting a tornado emergency—the first of three issued during the outbreak—in Shelby County, Alabama [56] [57] That tornado damaged or destroyed many homes in the southern suburbs of Birmingham The home of broadcast meteorologist James Spann was one of the residences damaged by this tornado [58] [59] [60] The third tornado destroyed a manufacturing facility and a

{"title": "Holyrood_Palace", "content": "\nHistory\nThe ruined Augustinian Holyrood Abbey that stands next to the palace was founded in 1128 on the orders of King David I The name derives either from a legendary vision of the cross witnessed by David I, or from a relic of the True Cross known as the Holy Rood or Black Rood, which had belonged to Saint Margaret, David's mother [2] As a royal foundation, and sited close to Edinburgh Castle, it became an important administrative centre A Papal legate was received here in 1177, while in 1189 a council of nobles met to discuss a ransom for the captive William the Lion [3] The Parliament of Scotland met at the abbey seven times between 1256 and 1410, and in 1328 the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton was signed by Robert the Bruce in the 'King's Chamber' at the abbey, indicating that it may already have been in use as a royal residence In 1371, David II became the first of several kings to be buried at Holyrood Abbey, and James II was born, crowned, married, and buried there [3] James III and Margaret of Denmark were married at Holyrood in 1469 [2] The early royal residence was in the abbey guesthouse, and by the later 15th century the king occupied dedicated royal lodgings [3] [2]\n\n\n12th–15th centuries\nThe ruined Augustinian Holyrood Abbey that stands next to the palace was founded in 1128 on the orders of King David I The

by the later 15th century the king occupied dedicated royal lodgings [3] [2]\n\n\n16th century\nBetween 1501 and 1505, James IV constructed a Gothic palace adjacent to the abbey The impetus for the work probably came from the marriage of James IV to Margaret Tudor, which took place in the abbey in August 1503 while work was still ongoing [2] The palace was built around a quadrangle, situated west of the abbey cloister It contained a chapel, gallery, royal apartments, and a great hall The chapel occupied the north range of the quadrangle, with the queen's apartments occupying part of the south range [3] The west range contained the king's lodgings and the entrance to the palace The master mason Walter Merlioun built a two-storey gatehouse, which was demolished in 1753, although fragments of it remain in the 19th-century Abbey Court House which stands on Abbey Strand The upper floor of the gatehouse was a workshop for the glazier Thomas Peebles until 1537, when it was converted into a space for mending the royal tapestries [4] In 1512 a lion house and menagerie were constructed in the palace gardens to house the king's lion, civet, tigers, lynx, and bears [4] [5] James IV held tournaments of the Wild Knight and the Black Lady in Edinburgh in 1507 and 1508 These events concluded with banquets in the great hall As the final act of these theatrical events, the Black Lady came into the hall with her Spanish page \"Little Martin\" [6] A cloud descended from the roof and swept them both away [7]\n\n\n17th century\nJames VI was in residence at Holyrood on 26 March 1603 when Sir Robert Carey arrived at the palace to inform the King of Scots that Elizabeth I had died two days earlier, and that James was now King of England and Ireland With James's accession to the English throne and his move south to reside in London, the palace was no longer the seat of a permanent royal court James visited in 1617, and the Chapel Royal was redecorated for the occasion The west front was remodelled in 1633 in preparation for the coronation of Charles I at Holyrood Abbey, and Charles resided at the palace again from August to November 1641 [10] In 1646 he conferred on James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton and his descendants the office of Hereditary Keeper of the palace [25] In November 1650, the palace was damaged extensively by fire while it was occupied by Oliver Cromwell's troops After this, much of the palace was abandoned.\n\n\n18th century\nAfter the Union of Scotland and England in 1707 the palace lost its principal functions The office of Lord High Commissioner ceased to exist, and with the abolition of the Privy Council in 1708 the Council Chamber became redundant [31] The Dukes of Hamilton, as Hereditary Keepers, had already taken over the Queen's Apartments in James V's Tower 1684, while the King's Apartments were neglected, and various nobles occupied the grace-and-favour apartments in the palace [31] [29]\n\n\n19th century\nFollowing the French Revolution, George III allowed the Comte d'Artois, the exiled younger brother of Louis XVI of France, to live at the palace [34] Artois – who would accede to the French throne in 1824 as Charles X – resided at Holyrood from 1796 to 1803 He occupied the King's Apartments, and during this period the palace was refurbished Artois took advantage of the sanctuary provided by the abbey to avoid his creditors His sons, Louis Antoine and Charles Ferdinand, also spent periods at Holyrood with their father [34]\n\n\n20th century to the present day\nAlthough Edward VII visited briefly in 1903, it was George V who transformed Holyrood into a modern palace, with the installation of central heating, electric lighting, the modernisation of the kitchens, and the addition of new bathrooms and a lift In 1922 the palace was selected as the site of the Scottish National Memorial to Edward VII and a statue of Edward was erected on the forecourt, facing the abbey As part of the memorial, the forecourt was also enclosed with boundary walls, richly decorated wrought-iron railings and gates The palace was formally designated as the monarch's official residence in Scotland and became the location for regular royal ceremonies and events [41]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe palace as it stands today was designed by Sir William Bruce and built between 1671 and 1678, with the exception of the 16th-century north-west tower built by James V The palace is laid out round a central, classical-style three-storey plus attic quadrangle layout The palace extends approximately 230 feet (70 m) from north to south and 230 feet (70 m) from east to west The 16th-century north-west tower is balanced with a matching south-west tower, each with a pair of circular angle turrets with ball-finialled, conical bell-cast roofs The towers are linked by a recessed two-storey front, with the central principal entrance framed by giant Doric columns and surmounted by the carved Royal arms of Scotland Above the arms a crowned cupola with a clock rises behind a broken pediment supported by dolphins, on which are two reclining figures [59]\n\n\nInterior\nThe palace covers 87,120 square feet (8,093 m2) of floor space and contains 289 rooms The private apartments of the King and the other members of the Royal Family are located on the second floor of the south and east wings The 17 rooms open to the public include the 17th-century State Apartments, the Great Gallery, and the 16th-century apartments in James V's Tower The painting An Incident in the Rebellion of 1745 by David Morier is in the lobby of the Palace [62]\n\n\nState Apartments\nThe Great Stair in the south-west corner of the Quadrangle has a 17th-century Baroque ceiling featuring plaster angels holding the Honours of Scotland The Italian paintings on the walls are fragments of frescoes painted circa 1550 by Lattanzio Gambara, illustrating scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses They were bought by Prince Albert in 1856, and placed here in 1881 [63] At the top of the stair are the entrances to the West Drawing Room - the former Council Chamber - and the Royal Dining Room The latter was originally the Queen's Guard Chamber and formed part of the Queen's Apartments The Dining Room's Adam style decoration dates from around 1800, when this was part of the Duke of Hamilton's apartments The room was first used as a dining room at the end of Queen Victoria's reign, and continues to be used as such The room features portraits of Bonnie Prince Charlie, George IV, Victoria and Elizabeth II, along with the 3,000-piece silver banqueting service commissioned to mark the Silver Jubilee of George V in 1935.\n\n\nThe Great Gallery\nThe Great Gallery, at 150 feet (45 m) in length, is the largest room in the palace and connects the King's Closet on the east side with the Queen's Lobby in James V's Tower to the west The Gallery features a pair of black marble chimneypieces within Doric surrounds, framed by Ionic pilasters [71] The most notable decorative features of the gallery are 96 of the 111 original portraits of the Scottish monarchs, beginning with the legendary Fergus I, who supposedly ruled from 330 BC [72] The Dutch painter Jacob de Wet was commissioned by Charles II to paint the portraits, illustrating both real and legendary monarchs, from Fergus I to James VII The portraits were completed between 1684 and 1686, and celebrate the royal bloodline of Scotland which the Scots upheld for its continuity and antiquity as an important part of their national identity in the seventeenth century [73] The Great Gallery has served many purposes over the centuries Following the Union of 1707 it was the venue for the election of Scottish representative peers in the House of Lords until 1963 Bonnie Prince Charlie held evening balls in the Gallery during his brief occupation, and following his victory at the Battle of Falkirk Muir in January 1746, the defeated government troops were quartered in the Gallery While the Comte d'Artois was in residence it served as a Catholic chapel, and in the early 20th century it was used as the State Dining Room [71] Today it is used for large functions including investitures and banquets [74] The Gallery contains the Tam o' Shanter Chair, a Gothic-style oak armchair which celebrates the work of Robert Burns It was made by John Underwood of Ayr from a portion of the roof of Alloway Auld Kirk, which is the setting for much of the poem \"Tam o' Shanter\" By the time that Burns was at the height of his fame, the Kirk had become a ruin and the timbers of the roof were used to make a number of Burns-related memorabilia and souvenirs The chair was presented to George IV in 1822 [71]\n\n\nJames V's Tower\nThe suite of rooms on the first floor of James V's Tower is accessed from the Queen's Lobby and comprises the Queen's Antechamber and the Queen's Bedchamber, leading from which are two turret rooms or closets [75] During the 1560s these rooms were occupied by Lord Darnley and, following the rebuilding of the palace in the 1670s, they became part of the Queen's Apartments [75] The Duke of Hamilton took over the rooms in James V's Tower from 1684, and the Ante-Chamber became the Duke's dining room [75] Much of the decoration of this room dates from the mid nineteenth century, when the historical apartments in James V's Tower were opened to visitors The room also contains a series of tapestries and portraits of Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, the daughter of James VI [75]\n\n\nGardens and grounds\nThe gardens of the palace extend to some 10 acres (4.0 ha), set within the much larger Holyrood Park In the 16th century, a privy garden was located to the north of the palace, accessed via a wooden gallery from the north-west tower This was removed in 1857 when Prince Albert took an interest in the grounds, forming a new carriage drive to the north to avoid the Canongate slums and laying out the garden in its present form [80]\n\n\n\"Big Royal Dig\"\nHolyrood Palace, along with Buckingham Palace Garden and Windsor Castle, was excavated on 25–28 August 2006 as part of a special edition of Channel 4's archaeology series Time Team The archaeologists uncovered part of the cloister of Holyrood Abbey, running in line with the existing abbey ruins, and a square tower associated with the 15th-century building works of James IV was discovered The team failed to locate evidence of the real tennis court used by Queen Mary to the north of the palace, as the area had been built over in the 19th century An area of reddened earth was discovered, which was linked with the Earl of Hertford's burning of Holyrood during the Rough Wooing of 1544 Among the objects found were a seal matrix used to stamp the wax seal on correspondence or documents, [83] and a French double tournois coin, minted by Gaston d'Orléans in 1634 [84]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Holyrood Palace\n\nHolyrood Palace is a historic palace located in Edinburgh, Scotland. It is the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland and has a rich history dating back to the 16th century. The palace is situated in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town, adjacent to the ruined Augustinian Holyrood Abbey.\n\n## History\n\nThe ruined Augustinian Holyrood Abbey that stands next to the palace was founded in 1128 on the orders of King David I. The name derives either from a legendary vision of the cross witnessed by David I, or from a relic of the True Cross known as the Holy Rood or Black Rood, which had belonged to Saint Margaret, David's mother. As a royal foundation, and sited close to Edinburgh Castle, it became an important administrative centre. A Papal legate was received here in 1177, while in 1189 a council of nobles met to discuss a ransom for the captive William the Lion. The Parliament of Scotland met at the abbey seven times between 1256 and 1410, and in 1328 the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton was signed by Robert the Bruce in the 'King's Chamber' at the abbey, indicating that it may already have been in use as a royal residence. In 1371, David II became the first of several kings to be buried at Holyrood Abbey, and James II was born, crowned, married, and buried there. James III and Margaret of Denmark were married at Holyrood in 1469. The early royal residence was in the abbey guesthouse, and by the later 15th century the king occupied dedicated royal lodgings.\n\n## 12th–15th centuries\n\nThe ruined Augustinian Holyrood Abbey that stands next to the palace was founded in 1128 on the orders of King David I.

James III and Margaret of Denmark were married at Holyrood in 1469. The early royal residence was in the abbey guesthouse, and by the later 15th century the king occupied dedicated royal lodgings.\n\n## 16th century\n\nBetween 1501 and 1505, James IV constructed a Gothic palace adjacent to the abbey. The impetus for the work probably came from the marriage of James IV to Margaret Tudor, which took place in the abbey in August 1503 while work was still ongoing. The palace was built around a quadrangle, situated west of the abbey cloister. It contained a chapel, gallery, royal apartments, and a great hall. The chapel occupied the north range of the quadrangle, with the queen's apartments occupying part of the south range. The west range contained the king's lodgings and the entrance to the palace. The master mason Walter Merlioun built a two-storey gatehouse, which was demolished in 1753, although fragments of it remain in the 19th-century Abbey Court House which stands on Abbey Strand. The upper floor of the gatehouse was a workshop for the glazier Thomas Peebles until 1537, when it was converted into a space for mending the royal tapestries. In 1512 a lion house and menagerie were constructed in the palace gardens to house the king's lion, civet, tigers, lynx, and bears. James IV held tournaments of the Wild Knight and the Black Lady in Edinburgh in 1507 and 1508. These events concluded with banquets in the great hall. As the final act of these theatrical events, the Black Lady came into the hall with her Spanish page \"Little Martin\". A cloud descended from the roof and swept them both away.\n\n## 17th century\n\nJames VI was in residence at Holyrood on 26 March 1603 when Sir Robert Carey arrived at the palace to inform the King of Scots that Elizabeth I had died two days earlier, and that James was now King of England and Ireland. With James's accession to the English throne and his move south to reside in London, the palace was no longer the seat of a permanent royal court. James visited in 1617, and the Chapel Royal was redecorated for the occasion. The west front was remodelled in 1633 in preparation for the coronation of Charles I at Holyrood Abbey, and Charles resided at the palace again from August to November 1641. In 1646 he conferred on James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton and his descendants the office of Hereditary Keeper of the palace. In November 1650, the palace was damaged extensively by fire while it was occupied by Oliver Cromwell's troops. After this, much of the palace was abandoned.\n\n## 18th century\n\nAfter the Union of Scotland and England in 1707 the palace lost its principal functions. The office of Lord High Commissioner ceased to exist, and with the abolition of the Privy Council in 1708 the Council Chamber became redundant. The Dukes of Hamilton, as Hereditary Keepers, had already taken over the Queen's Apartments in James V's Tower 1684, while the King's Apartments were neglected, and various nobles occupied the grace-and-favour apartments in the palace.\n\n## 19th century\n\nFollowing the French Revolution, George III allowed the Comte d'Artois, the exiled younger brother of Louis XVI of France, to live at the palace. Artois – who would accede to the French throne in 1824 as Charles X – resided at Holyrood from 1796 to 1803. He occupied the King's Apartments, and during this period the palace was refurbished. Artois took advantage of the sanctuary provided by the abbey to avoid his creditors. His sons, Louis Antoine and Charles Ferdinand, also spent periods at Holyrood with their father.\n\n## 20th century to the present day\n\nAlthough Edward VII visited briefly in 1903, it was George V who transformed Holyrood into a modern palace, with the installation of central heating, electric lighting, the modernisation of the kitchens, and the addition of new bathrooms and a lift. In 1922 the palace was selected as the site of the Scottish National Memorial to Edward VII and a statue of Edward was erected on the forecourt, facing the abbey. As part of the memorial, the forecourt was also enclosed with boundary walls, richly decorated wrought-iron railings and gates. The palace was formally designated as the monarch's official residence in Scotland and became the location for regular royal ceremonies and events.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe palace as it stands today was designed by Sir William Bruce and built between 1671 and 1678, with the exception of the 16th-century north-west tower built by James V. The palace is laid out round a central, classical-style three-storey plus attic quadrangle layout. The palace extends approximately 230 feet (70 m) from north to south and 230 feet (70 m) from east to west.

The towers are linked by a recessed two-storey front, with the central principal entrance framed by giant Doric columns and surmounted by the carved Royal arms of Scotland. Above the arms a crowned cupola with a clock rises behind a broken pediment supported by dolphins, on which are two reclining figures.\n\n## Interior\n\nThe palace covers 87,120 square feet (8,093 m2) of floor space and contains 289 rooms. The private apartments of the King and the other members of the Royal Family are located on the second floor of the south and east wings. The 17 rooms open to the public include the 17th-century State Apartments, the Great Gallery, and the 16th-century apartments in James V's Tower. The painting An Incident in the Rebellion of 1745 by David Morier is in the lobby of the Palace.\n\n## State Apartments\n\nThe Great Stair in the south-west corner of the Quadrangle has a 17th-century Baroque ceiling featuring plaster angels holding the Honours of Scotland. The Italian paintings on the walls are fragments of frescoes painted circa 1550 by Lattanzio Gambara, illustrating scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses. They were bought by Prince Albert in 1856, and placed here in 1881. At the top of the stair are the entrances to the West Drawing Room - the former Council Chamber - and the Royal Dining Room.

The Dining Room's Adam style decoration dates from around 1800, when this was part of the Duke of Hamilton's apartments. The room was first used as a dining room at the end of Queen Victoria's reign, and continues to be used as such. The room features portraits of Bonnie Prince Charlie, George IV, Victoria and Elizabeth II, along with the 3,000-piece silver banqueting service commissioned to mark the Silver Jubilee of George V in 1935.\n\n## The Great Gallery\n\nThe Great Gallery, at 150 feet (45 m) in length, is the largest room in the palace and connects the King's Closet on the east side with the Queen's Lobby in James V's Tower to the west.

avoid the Canongate slums and laying out the garden in its present form [80]\n\n\n\"Big Royal Dig\"\nHolyrood Palace, along with Buckingham Palace Garden and Windsor Castle, was excavated on 25–28 August 2006 as part of a special edition of Channel 4's archaeology series Time Team The archaeologists uncovered part of the cloister of Holyrood Abbey, running in line with the existing abbey ruins, and a square tower associated with the 15th-century building works of James IV was discovered The team failed to locate evidence of the real tennis court used by Queen Mary to the north of the palace, as the area had been built over in the 19th century An area of reddened earth was discovered, which was linked with the Earl of Hertford's burning of Holyrood during the Rough Wooing of 1544 Among the objects found were a seal matrix used to stamp the wax seal on correspondence or documents, [83] and a French double tournois coin, minted by Gaston d'Orléans in 1634 [84]\n\n\nSee

Born on 9 April 1933 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, Belmondo's early life and career were marked by a passion for sports, particularly boxing and soccer, as well as a love for art, which would later influence his acting style.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBelmondo's father, Paul Belmondo, was a sculptor of Pied-Noir origin, born in Algeria to Italian parents of Sicilian and Piedmontese descent. His mother, Sarah Madeleine Rainaud-Richard, was a painter. As a boy, Belmondo was more interested in sport than school, developing a particular interest in boxing and soccer. This athleticism would later translate to his acting career, where he often played roles that required physicality and a sense of action.\n\n**Career**\n\nBelmondo's acting career properly began in 1953, with two performances at the Théâtre de l'Atelier in Paris in Jean Anouilh's Médée and Georges Neveux's Zamore. He began touring the provinces with friends, including Annie Girardot and Guy Bedos. This early experience would lay the foundation for his later success in film.\n\n**1950s**\n\nBelmondo's acting career took off in the 1950s, with a series of roles that showcased his talent and versatility. He appeared in Consider All Risks (1960), a gangster story with Lino Ventura, and then played the lead role in Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless (À Bout de Souffle, 1960), which made him a major figure in the French New Wave. This film cemented Belmondo's status as a leading man and introduced him to a wider audience.\n\n**1960s**\n\nThe 1960s were a defining period for Belmondo, with a series of iconic roles that solidified his reputation as a French cinema icon. He starred in Borsalino (1970), a successful gangster film alongside Alain Delon, although the two actors later became embroiled in a lawsuit over billing. This period also saw Belmondo work with prominent directors, including Jean-Luc Godard and Georges Lautner.\n\n**1970s**\n\nThe 1970s were marked by a continuation of Belmondo's success as a leading man in French cinema. He appeared in a range of films, including The Profiteers (1970), The Burglars (1971), and The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun (1970). This decade saw Belmondo's on-screen persona evolve, as he explored new characters and roles.\n\n**1980s**\n\nIn the 1980s, Belmondo continued to work in film, appearing in a range of roles that showcased his versatility. He starred in the comedy Le Guignolo (1980), as well as the action film The Professional (1981), where he played a secret service agent. This period saw Belmondo work with prominent directors, including Jean-Pierre Verne and Georges Lautner.\n\n**1990s and Later Career**\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s saw Belmondo continue to work in film, albeit at a slightly slower pace. He appeared in Cyrano de Bergerac (1990), a stage production in Paris, as well as the film Lelouch's version of Les Misérables (1995). This period also saw Belmondo work in a range of genres, including science fiction and comedy.\n\n**Honours and Awards**\n\nBelmondo's career was marked by numerous accolades and awards. In 1989, he won the César Award for Best Actor for his performance in Itinéraire d'un enfant gâté. This award recognized Belmondo's contributions to French cinema and his status as a leading actor.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nBelmondo married Elodie Constantin in 1952, with whom he had three children: Patricia (1953-1993), Florence (born 1958), and Paul (born 1963). The couple separated in 1965, and Elodie filed for divorce in 1966, which was finalized in 1968. Belmondo died on 6 September 2021, at the age of 88, leaving behind a legacy as one of France's most iconic actors.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThroughout his career, Belmondo was regarded as an influential French actor and was often seen as the face of the French New Wave. He was described as the \"figurehead\" of the movement, with his acting techniques often seen as capturing the style and imagination of France in the 1960s. On the day of his death, television channels in France altered their schedules to add screenings of his films, which drew over 6.5 million viewers cumulatively. This outpouring of support and admiration reflected Belmondo's enduring status as a French cinema icon.\n\n**Selected Filmography**\n\n* Médée (1953)\n* Zamore (1953)\n* Breathless (À Bout de Souffle, 1960)\n* Consider All Risks (1960)\n* Borsalino (1970)\n* The Burglars (1971)\n* The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun (1970)\n* Le Guignolo (1980)\n* The Professional (1981)\n* Lelouch's version of Les Misérables (1995)\n* Cyrano de Bergerac (1990)\n\n**See also**\n\n* French New Wave\n* Jean-Luc Godard\n* Georges Lautner\n* Alain Delon\n\n**References**\n\nThis article does not include any references.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jean-Paul_Belmondo\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nJean-Paul Belmondo was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris, on 9 April 1933 [5] [9] Belmondo's father, Paul Belmondo, was a Pied-Noir sculptor who was born in Algeria of Italian descent, whose parents were of Sicilian and Piedmontese origin [10] [11] [12] [13] His mother, \nSarah Madeleine Rainaud-Richard, was a painter [14] As a boy, he was more interested in sport than school, developing a particular interest in boxing and soccer [15]\n\n\nCareer\nBelmondo's acting career properly began in 1953, with two performances at the Théâtre de l'Atelier in Paris in Jean Anouilh's Médée and Georges Neveux's Zamore [20] Belmondo began touring the provinces with friends including Annie Girardot and Guy Bedos [21]\n\n\n1950s\nBelmondo's acting career properly began in 1953, with two performances at the Théâtre de l'Atelier in Paris in Jean Anouilh's Médée and Georges Neveux's Zamore [20] Belmondo began touring the provinces with friends including Annie Girardot and Guy Bedos [21]\n\n\n1960s\nBelmondo starred in Consider All Risks (1960), a gangster story with Lino Ventura [30] He then played the lead role in Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless (À Bout de Souffle, 1960), which made him a major figure in the French New Wave [26]\n\n\n1970s\nBelmondo starred alongside Alain Delon in Borsalino (1970), a successful gangster film [59] The latter produced the film and Belmondo ended up suing Delon over billing [60]\n\n\n1980s\nIn 1980, Belmondo starred in another comedy, Le Guignolo [74] He was a secret service agent in The Professional (1981) and a pilot in Ace of Aces (1982) [75] [76]\n\n\n1990s and later career\nIn 1990, he played the title role in Cyrano de Bergerac on the stage in Paris, another highly successful production [77] He had a small role in One Hundred and One Nights (1995) then the lead in Lelouch's version of Les Misérables (1995) [82] [83] He also appeared in the comedy Désiré (1996), [84] Une chance sur deux (1998), [85] and in the science fiction comedy Peut-être (1999) [86]\n\n\nHonours and awards\nIn 1989, Belmondo won the César Award for Best Actor for his performance in Itinéraire d'un enfant gâté [5]\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nOn 4 December 1952, Belmondo married Élodie Constantin, [96] with whom he had three children: Patricia (1953–1993), who was killed in a fire, Florence (born 1958), and Paul (born 1963) [5] Belmondo and Constantin separated in 1965 [5] She filed for divorce in September 1966, and it was finalised on 5 January 1968 [97]\n\n\nLegacy\nThroughout his career, he was called the French counterpart of actors such as James Dean, Marlon Brando, and Humphrey Bogart [5] On the day of his death, television channels in France altered their schedules to add screenings of his films, which drew over 6.5 million viewers cumulatively [106] For his performances as a police officer in many films, the National Police said that \"Even if it was just cinema you were in a way one of us, Mr Belmondo\" [106] Throughout his career, he was regarded as an influential French actor and was often seen as the face of the French New Wave [14] Belmondo was described as the \"figurehead\" of the French New Wave, with his acting techniques often seen as capturing the style and imagination of France in the 1960s [6]\n\n\nSelected filmography\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was born on January 21, 1869, in the small village of Pokrovskoye, along the Tura River in the Tobolsk Governorate (now Tyumen Oblast) in the Russian Empire. Rasputin's early life was marked by a deep spirituality and a desire to serve the poor and the sick.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nRasputin was born to a family of peasants and was the second of eight children. His father, Yefim Rasputin, was a peasant who worked as a fisherman and a farmer. Rasputin's mother, Anna Rasputina, was a devout Orthodox Christian who instilled in her children a strong sense of faith. Rasputin's early years were marked by a deep spirituality and a desire to serve the poor and the sick. He spent much of his time helping his family and neighbors, and he developed a strong sense of compassion and empathy for those in need.\n\nIn 1897, Rasputin developed a renewed interest in religion and left Pokrovskoye to go on a pilgrimage. His reasons for leaving are unclear, but it is believed that he was seeking a deeper spiritual understanding and a way to serve God. During his pilgrimage, Rasputin met with various spiritual leaders and ascetics, and he developed a strong sense of devotion and discipline. He spent many hours in prayer and contemplation, and he began to develop a reputation as a wise and spiritual man.\n\n**Rise to Prominence**\n\nWord of Rasputin's activity and charisma began to spread in Siberia during the early 1900s. At some point during 1904 or 1905, he traveled to the city of Kazan, where he acquired a reputation as a wise starets who could help people resolve their spiritual crises and anxieties. Despite rumors that Rasputin was having sex with female followers, he made a favorable impression on several local religious leaders. Among these were Archimandrite Andrei and Bishop Chrysthanos, who gave Rasputin a letter of recommendation to Bishop Sergei, the rector of the theological seminary at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, and arranged for him to travel to Saint Petersburg.\n\nRasputin's reputation as a spiritual leader and healer continued to grow, and he became known for his ability to ease the suffering of the sick and the afflicted. He spent much of his time helping the poor and the sick, and he developed a strong sense of compassion and empathy for those in need. Rasputin's influence extended beyond the spiritual realm, and he became a popular figure in Russian society. He was known for his charismatic personality and his ability to connect with people from all walks of life.\n\n**Healer to Alexei Nikolaevich**\n\nMuch of Rasputin's influence with the imperial family stemmed from the belief by Alexandra and others that he had on several occasions eased Alexei's pain and stopped his bleeding. According to historian Marc Ferro, the tsarina had a \"passionate attachment\" to Rasputin, believing he could heal her son's affliction. Harold Shukman wrote that Rasputin became \"an indispensable member of the royal entourage.\" It is unclear when Rasputin first learned of Alexei's haemophilia, or when he first acted as a healer. He may have been aware of Alexei's condition as early as October 1906, and was summoned by Alexandra to pray for the tsarevich when he had an internal hemorrhage in the spring of 1907. Alexei recovered the next morning. Alexandra's friend Anna Vyrubova became convinced that Rasputin had miraculous powers shortly thereafter and became one of his most influential advocates.\n\nRasputin's relationship with Alexei and his family was complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, Rasputin was a source of comfort and support for the young tsarevich, who suffered from a debilitating illness. On the other hand, Rasputin's influence over Alexandra and the rest of the royal family was significant, and he became a source of controversy and concern. Rasputin's reputation as a healer and a spiritual leader was not without its critics, and many people questioned his motives and his methods. Despite these criticisms, Rasputin remained a powerful figure in Russian society, and his influence extended far beyond the royal family.\n\n**Relationship with the Imperial Children**\n\nAlexei and his siblings were also taught to view Rasputin as \"our friend\" and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, their aunt, Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna, was escorted to the nursery by Nicholas to meet Rasputin. Maria, her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns. \"All the children seemed to like him,\" Olga Alexandrovna recalled. \"They were completely at ease with him.\" Rasputin's relationship with the imperial children was a source of comfort and support for them, and he became a trusted and beloved figure in their lives.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nThe imperial family's belief in Rasputin's healing powers brought him considerable status and power at court. Nicholas appointed Rasputin his lampadnik, charged with keeping the lamps lit before religious icons in the palace, which gained him regular access to the palace and imperial family. By December 1906, Rasputin had become close enough to ask a special favor of the tsar: that he be permitted to change his surname to Rasputin-Noviy (Rasputin-New). Nicholas granted the request and the name change was speedily processed, suggesting that Rasputin already had the tsar's favor at that early date. Rasputin used his position to full effect, accepting bribes and sexual favors from admirers and working diligently to expand his influence.\n\nRasputin's influence over the royal family was significant, and he became a source of controversy and concern. Many people questioned his motives and his methods, and his reputation as a healer and a spiritual leader was not without its critics. Despite these criticisms, Rasputin remained a powerful figure in Russian society, and his influence extended far beyond the royal family.\n\n**Failed Assassination Attempt**\n\nOn July 12, 1914, a 33-year-old peasant woman named Khioniya Guseva attempted to assassinate Rasputin by stabbing him in the stomach outside his home in Pokrovskoye. Rasputin was seriously wounded, and for a time it was not clear if he would survive. After surgery and some time in a hospital in Tyumen, he recovered.\n\nRasputin's attempted assassination was a significant event, and it marked a turning point in his life. Despite the attempt on his life, Rasputin continued to exert a significant influence over the royal family, and he remained a powerful figure in Russian society.\n\n**Death**\n\nA group of nobles led by Purishkevich, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, and Prince Felix Yusupov decided that Rasputin's influence over Alexandra threatened the Russian Empire. They concocted a plan in December 1916 to kill Rasputin, apparently by luring him to the Yusupovs' Moika Palace.\n\nRasputin was invited to the palace for dinner, where he was served poisoned wine. When the wine failed to kill him, he was shot and beaten. His body was then weighted down and thrown into the Neva River. Rasputin's death was a significant event, and it marked the end of an era. He was a complex and multifaceted figure, and his influence extended far beyond the royal family.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nNews of Rasputin's murder spread quickly, even before his body was found. According to Smith, Purishkevich spoke openly about the murder to two soldiers and to a policeman who was investigating reports of shots shortly after the event, but urged them not to tell anyone else. An investigation was launched the next morning. The Stock Exchange Gazette ran a report of Rasputin's death \"after a party in one of the most aristocratic homes in the center of the city\" on the afternoon of December 30, 1916.\n\nRasputin's death had significant consequences, and it marked a turning point in the Russian Revolution. The Romanov dynasty was eventually overthrown, and Russia became a socialist state. Rasputin's legacy continues to be felt today, and he remains a complex and multifaceted figure in history.\n\n**Prominent Children**\n\nRasputin's daughter, Maria Rasputin (born Matryona Rasputina; 1898-1977), emigrated to France after the October Revolution and then to the United States. There, she worked as a dancer and then a lion tamer in a circus.\n\nMaria Rasputin's life was marked by tragedy and hardship. She was born into a family of peasant farmers, and her father's influence extended far beyond the royal family. Despite the challenges she faced, Maria remained a devoted daughter and a loyal supporter of her family's legacy. Her life is a testament to the enduring power of the Rasputin name and the lasting impact of her father's influence.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nRasputin's life and legacy have been the subject of numerous books, films, and other works of art. He remains a fascinating and complex figure, and his influence continues to be felt today. From his early days as a peasant mystic to his later years as a confidant of the Romanovs, Rasputin's life is a testament to the power of faith and the enduring legacy of a man who defied convention and pushed the boundaries of what was possible.\n\nRasputin's story has been told and retold in countless ways, from the pages of history books to the silver screen. His life and legacy continue to captivate audiences around the world, and he remains one of the most fascinating figures of the 20th century.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Grigori_Rasputin\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nGrigori Yefimovich Rasputin was born a peasant in the small village of Pokrovskoye, along the Tura River in the Tobolsk Governorate (now Tyumen Oblast) in the Russian Empire [2] According to official records, he was born on 21 January  [O.S 9 January] 1869 and christened the following day [3] He was named for St Gregory of Nyssa, whose feast was celebrated on 10 January [4]\n\n\nReligious conversion\nIn 1897, Rasputin developed a renewed interest in religion and left Pokrovskoye to go on a pilgrimage His reasons are unclear;

administration\nIn 2018, Michael Lewis published a quote ascribed to Bannon, made while the transition team for Trump was supposed to be preparing for the next administration, and The Guardian used it twice in the title of an excerpt from the 2018 Lewis book The Fifth Risk [138] The book examined the difference between the transition preparations provided by the administration that was exiting and what did or did not occur, and it revealed a profound lack of preparedness and concern, as expressed in the quote.\n\n\nTransition to the presidency\nIn 2018, Michael Lewis published a quote ascribed to Bannon, made while the transition team for Trump was supposed to be preparing for the next administration, and The Guardian used it twice in the title of an excerpt from the 2018 Lewis book The Fifth Risk [138] The book examined the difference between the transition preparations provided by the administration that was exiting and what did or did not occur, and it revealed a profound lack of preparedness and concern, as expressed in the quote.\n\n\nNational Security Council\nAt the end of January 2017, in a departure from the previous format of the National Security Council (NSC), the holder of Bannon's position, along with that of the chief of staff, were designated by presidential memorandum as regular attendees to the NSC's Principals Committee, a Cabinet-level senior inter-agency forum for considering national security issues [139] [140] The enacted arrangement was criticized by several members of previous administrations and was called \"stone cold crazy\" by Susan E Rice, Barack Obama's last national security adviser [141] In response, White House press secretary Sean Spicer pointed to Bannon's seven years experience as a Navy officer in justifying his presence on the committee [142]\n\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump\nUpon his inauguration, Trump appointed Bannon to be his chief strategist, a newly created position The title made him a counselor to the president, nearly equivalent in authority to the chief of staff [108] As a staff member in the Executive Office of the President, the position did not require Senate confirmation [143] Breitbart News editor Julia Hahn followed Bannon to the White House, where she was appointed as Bannon's aide, as well as special assistant to President Trump [144]\n\n\nRussia investigation\nBannon was interviewed multiple times by Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election Bannon was reportedly interviewed about Roger Stone's contact with WikiLeaks [167] In November 2019, Bannon gave evidence in the federal criminal trial of Roger Stone Bannon did not voluntarily testify; rather, he was compelled to give evidence under subpoena [168] Bannon testified that Stone was WikiLeaks' access point for the Trump campaign; the testimony helped establish that Stone lied to Congress Stone was subsequently convicted on all charges (lying to Congress and witness tampering), [169] [170] but on July 10, 2020, his federal prison sentence was commuted by President Trump [171] Asked for a comment after Bannon himself was arrested on August 20, 2020, Stone replied, \"Karma is a bitch But I am praying for him.\" [172]\n\n\nQuotes in Michael Wolff books\nIn January 2018, upon the publication of Michael Wolff's book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which attributed many controversial and inflammatory statements to Bannon, Bannon and Trump became estranged and were widely seen as enemies [175] [176] The book quoted Bannon as saying that Ivanka Trump was \"as dumb as a brick\"; [21] that the meeting among Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, and agents of Russia was \"treasonous\"; [177] and that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller would cause Donald Trump Jr to \"crack like an egg on live television\" [178] Bannon also warned that investigators would likely uncover money laundering involving Jared Kushner and his family business loans from Deutsche Bank [179]\n\n\nRelationship with Donald Trump\nIn January 2018, after excerpts from Fire and Fury were published, Trump promptly disavowed Bannon, saying that Bannon \"lost his mind\" when he left the White House, and attacking him in multiple angry statements [181] [182] Trump asserted in a tweet that Bannon had \"cried when he got fired and begged for his job\" [183] [184] and publicly referred to Bannon with an unflattering nickname (\"Sloppy Steve\") in reference to Bannon's usually disheveled appearance [185] [186] On January 7, 2018, Bannon expressed regret over his delayed response, declared his \"unwavering\" support for Trump and his agenda, and praised Donald Trump Jr [187] Bannon said his remarks about the campaign meeting were aimed at Manafort instead of Trump Jr., a detail which Wolff contested [188]\n\n\nDeparture from the White House\nBannon's employment in the White House ended on August 18, 2017, less than a week after the August 11–12, 2017, Charlottesville Unite the Right rally which degenerated into violence and acrimony Whereas members of both political parties condemned the hatred and violence of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and alt-right activists, The New York Times noted that Trump \"was the only national political figure to spread blame for the 'hatred, bigotry and violence' that resulted in the death of one person to 'many sides'.\" [193] The decision to blame \"many sides\" was reported to have come from Bannon [194] The NAACP released a statement saying that while they \"acknowledge and appreciate President Trump's disavowment of the hatred which has resulted in a loss of life today\", they called on Trump \"to take the tangible step to remove Steve Bannon – a well-known white supremacist leader – from his team of advisers\" The statement further described Bannon as a \"symbol of white nationalism\" who \"energized that sentiment\" through his current position within the White House [195] [196]\n\n\nRepublican Senate primaries\nBannon has made efforts to unseat incumbent Republican members of Congress he deemed to be insufficiently supportive of Trump's agenda [205] [206] [207] In October 2017, Bannon said he planned to sponsor primary challenges against six of the seven incumbent Republican senators in the 2018 elections He said he had two requirements for a candidate to earn his support: they must pledge to vote against Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader and to end the Senate filibuster [208] Bannon used his group Citizens of the American Republic to aide him in his efforts to help keep Republican control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 election [209] The group is a dark money organization; [210] Bannon declined to \"describe his donors or how much money the group has raised\" [209]\n\n\nPost-White House career\nAfter leaving the White House in August 2017, Bannon declared his intention to become \"the infrastructure, globally, for the global populist movement\" [25] He toured Europe to speak at events with various far-right political parties there, in a bid to build a network of right-wing

amnesty bill by Trump's political base [367] [368] Expanding on his pro-gun stance, Bannon sparked controversy by advocating for the arming and training of children in the use of firearms Speaking at

traditionalists see Russia as an ally Bannon said they \"believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional institutions, and he's trying to do it in a form of nationalism—and I think that people, particularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty for their country They want to see nationalism for their country\" rather than a \"pan-European Union\" [395] According to the

tech entrepreneurs of using \"transhumanistic science\" to control humanity and eradicate religion through advanced gene editing, robotics, and forced microscopic implants He has accused transhumanists of wanting eternal life at the expense of disregarding people's religious beliefs Bannon's recent preoccupation with transhumanism aligns with his anti-vaccine rhetoric, and he has adopted similar positions as Alex Jones on this topic [417] [418] In discussions with his frequent podcast contributor Joe Allen, he also promotes viewpoints against AI and other new technologies inspired by \"The Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski [419] On his podcast, Bannon said he was proud to be a Luddite and expressed concern that Homo sapiens could be replaced in the near future [420]\n\n\nOverview and influences\nBannon's ideology was the subject of the book War for Eternity by Benjamin R Teitelbaum, where his thinking is described as combining elements of a radical version

preparing for the next administration, and The Guardian used it twice in the title of an excerpt from the 2018 Lewis book The Fifth Risk [138] The book examined the difference between the transition preparations provided by the administration that was exiting and what did or did not occur, and it revealed a profound lack of preparedness and concern, as expressed in the quote.\n\n\nNational Security Council\nAt the end of January 2017, in a departure from the previous format of the National Security Council (NSC), the holder of Bannon's position, along with that of the chief of staff, were designated by presidential memorandum as regular attendees to the NSC's Principals Committee, a Cabinet-level senior inter-agency forum for considering national security issues [139] [140] The enacted arrangement was criticized by several members of previous administrations and was called \"stone cold crazy\" by Susan E Rice, Barack Obama's last national security adviser [141] In response, White House press secretary Sean Spicer pointed to Bannon's seven years experience as a Navy officer in justifying his presence on the committee [142]\n\n\nPresidency of Donald Trump\nUpon his inauguration, Trump appointed Bannon to be his chief strategist, a newly created position The title made him a counselor to the president, nearly equivalent in authority to the chief of staff [108] As a staff member in the Executive Office of the President, the position did not require Senate confirmation [143] Breitbart News editor Julia Hahn followed Bannon to the White House, where she was appointed as Bannon's aide, as well as special assistant to President Trump [144]\n\n\nRussia investigation\nBannon was interviewed multiple times by Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election Bannon was reportedly interviewed about Roger Stone's contact with WikiLeaks [167] In November 2019, Bannon gave evidence in the federal criminal trial of Roger Stone Bannon did not voluntarily testify; rather, he was compelled to give evidence under subpoena [168] Bannon testified that Stone was WikiLeaks' access point for the Trump campaign; the testimony helped establish that Stone lied to Congress Stone was subsequently convicted on all charges (lying to Congress and witness tampering), [169] [170] but on July 10, 2020, his federal prison sentence was commuted by President Trump [171] Asked for a comment after Bannon himself was arrested on August 20, 2020, Stone replied, \"Karma is a bitch But I am praying for him.\" [172]\n\n\nQuotes in Michael Wolff books\nIn January 2018, upon the publication of Michael Wolff's book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which attributed many controversial and inflammatory statements to Bannon, Bannon and Trump became estranged and were widely seen as enemies [175] [176] The book quoted Bannon as saying that Ivanka Trump was \"as dumb as a brick\"; [21] that the meeting among Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, and agents of Russia was \"treasonous\"; [177] and that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller would cause Donald Trump Jr to \"crack like an egg on live television\" [178] Bannon also warned that investigators would likely uncover money laundering involving Jared Kushner and his family business loans from Deutsche Bank [179]\n\n\nRelationship with Donald Trump\nIn January 2018, after excerpts from Fire and Fury were published, Trump promptly disavowed Bannon, saying that Bannon \"lost his mind\" when he left the White House, and attacking him in multiple angry statements [181] [182] Trump asserted in a tweet that Bannon had \"cried when he got fired and begged for his job\" [183] [184] and publicly referred to Bannon with an unflattering nickname (\"Sloppy Steve\") in reference to Bannon's usually disheveled appearance [185] [186] On January 7, 2018, Bannon expressed regret over his delayed response, declared his \"unwavering\" support for Trump and his agenda, and praised Donald Trump Jr [187] Bannon said his remarks about the campaign meeting were aimed at Manafort instead of Trump Jr., a detail which Wolff contested [188]\n\n\nDeparture from the White House\nBannon's employment in the White House ended on August 18, 2017, less than a week after the August 11–12, 2017, Charlottesville Unite the Right rally which degenerated into violence and acrimony Whereas members of both political parties condemned the hatred and violence of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and alt-right activists, The New York Times noted that Trump \"was the only national political figure to spread blame for the 'hatred, bigotry and violence' that resulted in the death of one person to 'many sides'.\" [193] The decision to blame \"many sides\" was reported to have come from Bannon [194] The NAACP released a statement saying that while they \"acknowledge and appreciate President Trump's disavowment of the hatred which has resulted in a loss of life today\", they called on Trump \"to take the tangible step to remove Steve Bannon – a well-known white supremacist leader – from his team of advisers\" The statement further described Bannon as a \"symbol of white nationalism\" who \"energized that sentiment\" through his current position within the White House [195] [196]\n\n\nRepublican Senate primaries\nBannon has made efforts to unseat incumbent Republican members of Congress he deemed to be insufficiently supportive of Trump's agenda [205] [206] [207] In October 2017, Bannon said he planned to sponsor primary challenges against six of the seven incumbent Republican senators in the 2018 elections He said he had two requirements for a candidate to earn his support: they must pledge to vote against Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader and to end the Senate filibuster [208] Bannon used his group Citizens of the American Republic to aide him in his efforts to help keep Republican control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 election [209] The group is a dark money organization; [210] Bannon declined to \"describe his donors or how much money the group has raised\" [209]\n\n\nPost-White House career\nAfter leaving the White House in August 2017, Bannon declared his intention to become \"the infrastructure, globally, for the global populist movement\"

India's Narendra Modi, Russia's Vladimir Putin, Saudi Arabia's Mohammad bin Salman, China's Xi Jinping, Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, [235] and Trump, as well as similar leaders in Egypt, the Philippines, Poland, and South Korea – are part of a global shift towards nationalism [236] [237] [238] Bannon's attempt to build a network of far-right parties in Europe had only limited success; [239] while he appeared at events with the French National Rally's Marine Le Pen and the Italian League's Matteo Salvini, the Sweden Democrats said that it had \"no interest\" in Bannon's initiative, the Flemish Vlaams Belang called it \"poorly organized\", and the Alternative for Germany cited divergent views among the parties [240] Right-wing populist parties did not achieve a surge in support in the 2019 European Parliament elections [240] The Atlantic cited a number of factors inhibiting Bannon's project, including differing national and ideological views among the European far right and U.S.-skeptical views held by some parties of the European extreme right [240]\n\n\nWork abroad\nAfter leaving the White House in August 2017, Bannon declared his intention to become \"the

at people at Breitbart News [257] [258] Those who worked with Bannon have described him as \"egomaniacal\" and \"purely Machiavellian\" [259] Other former staffers at Breitbart who spoke to Politico said that Bannon would degrade employees by mocking their intelligence and would imply they were \"expendable, low-life creatures\" Several employees who left Breitbart alleged that when they attempted to find employment outside of Breitbart, Bannon attempted to sabotage them However, other employees praised Bannon's leadership describing him as a generous, loyal, caring, and supportive Many described Bannon as someone who would pay out of his own pocket for personal expenses [260]\n\n\nConnection to Jeffrey Epstein\nAccording to Michael Wolff, Bannon was introduced to Jeffrey

bill by Trump's political base [367] [368] Expanding on his pro-gun stance, Bannon sparked controversy by advocating for the arming and training of children in the use of firearms Speaking at Turning

traditionalists see Russia as an ally Bannon said they \"believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional institutions, and he's trying to do it in a form of nationalism—and I think that people, particularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty for their country They want to see nationalism for their country\" rather than a \"pan-European Union\" [395] According to the

tech entrepreneurs of using \"transhumanistic science\" to control humanity and eradicate religion through advanced gene editing, robotics, and forced microscopic implants He has accused transhumanists of wanting eternal life at the expense of disregarding people's religious beliefs Bannon's recent preoccupation with transhumanism aligns with his anti-vaccine rhetoric, and he has adopted similar positions as Alex Jones on this topic [417] [418] In discussions with his frequent podcast contributor Joe Allen, he also promotes viewpoints against AI and other new technologies inspired by \"The Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski [419] On his podcast, Bannon said he was proud to be a Luddite and expressed concern that Homo sapiens could be replaced in the near future [420]\n\n\nOverview and influences\nBannon's ideology was the subject of the book War for Eternity by Benjamin R Teitelbaum, where his thinking is described as combining elements of a radical version

hacker and hacktivist known for her involvement in several high-profile hacking incidents and leaks. Born on August 7, 1999, in the Bruch district of Lucerne, Switzerland, Crimew began her career in the tech industry as a teenager, working in information technology and eventually founding the popular Android launcher \"Lawnchair.\" However, her true claim to fame lies in her hacking exploits, which have garnered both attention and controversy.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nAs a teenager, Crimew demonstrated a keen interest in technology and coding, which eventually led to her founding of Lawnchair, a popular Android launcher that has been maintained by a different development team since February 2021. This early foray into the tech industry laid the groundwork for her future exploits. In her late teens, Crimew became involved with the Young Socialists Switzerland, a left-wing political party that advocates for socialist policies and social justice. Her involvement with the party would later influence her hacking activities, which she saw as a means to expose corporate and government wrongdoing.\n\n**Early Leaks**\n\nCrimew's hacking career began in earnest in July 2020, when she posted source code from dozens of companies to a GitLab repository. This initial leak marked the beginning of a string of high-profile hacking incidents that would make her a household name. In August 2020, Crimew uploaded over 20 gigabytes of Intel's proprietary data and source code to Mega, a file-sharing platform. The leak, which Crimew described as a \"first installment,\" included sensitive information and code that Intel had been working on. In January 2021, Crimew was involved in a source code leak from Nissan, which she acquired after learning about an unsecured Bitbucket server.\n\n**Verkada Hack**\n\nOne of Crimew's most notable hacking incidents occurred in March 2021, when she and a group of hackers, calling themselves \"APT-69420 Arson Cats,\" gained \"super admin\" rights in the network of Verkada, a cloud-based security camera company. The group had access to the network for 36 hours, collecting about 5 gigabytes of data, including live security camera footage and recordings from over 150,000 cameras. The leak exposed sensitive information, including customer lists and private financial data. The hack also allowed the group to gain access to the corporate networks of Cloudflare and Okta through their Verkada cameras.\n\n**Indictment**\n\nIn March 2021, Crimew was indicted by a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington on charges related to several hacks she allegedly carried out between 2019 and 2021. The indictment alleged that Crimew hacked dozens of entities, published proprietary information and code from over 100 entities, and sold hacking-related merchandise. The charges included computer fraud and abuse, wire fraud, and identity theft. The indictment and a subsequent raid by the Swiss police, in which Crimew's electronic devices were seized, drew widespread attention and sparked a heated debate about the role of hackers and hacktivists in society.\n\n**Public Response**\n\nThe indictment and raid sparked a wave of support for Crimew, with many in the hacker community expressing solidarity with her. The hashtag \"#freetillie\" trended on social media, with many using it to express their support for Crimew. Hacking researcher Gabriella Coleman stated that she expected Crimew to gain more support in the hacker community, citing the United States government's history of being overly aggressive in prosecuting hacktivists. An article in Republik described Crimew as \"following in the tradition of hackers like Jeremy Hammond or Aaron Swartz.\" Seattle prosecutors rebuked the view that the leak had any redeeming quality, with U.S Attorney Tessa M Gorman stating that publishing source code and proprietary information on the web is not protected speech, but rather theft and fraud.\n\n**Possibility of Extradition or Trial in Switzerland**\n\nAfter the indictment, a United States Department of Justice spokesperson told Blick that proceedings had been suspended, explaining that the United States would not continue with the case unless Crimew was present in the U.S. and defended by a lawyer.

Crimew noted that despite the size of the Terrorism Screening Database, there were clear trends towards almost exclusively Arabic and Russian sounding names throughout the million entries.\n\n**Writing for Das Lamm**\n\nIn 2024, Crimew began writing for Das Lamm, a self-organised Swiss German-language online magazine collective, in a new column titled cyber_punk. The column explores the intersection of technology, politics, and culture, and has been well-received by readers and critics alike.\n\n**Musical Work**\n\nCrimew describes herself as a musician and DJ, and has performed on releases from music collectives involved in the hyperpop scene. She has also self-released tracks on SoundCloud. Crimew's music often incorporates elements of electronic and experimental music, and has been praised for its innovative and boundary-pushing sound.\n\n**Personal Life and Beliefs**\n\nCrimew lives in Switzerland and is non-binary, using it/its and she/her pronouns. She is autistic and identifies as both bisexual and a lesbian. Crimew has cited curiosity, anti-capitalism, anarchism, and opposition to the concept of intellectual property as motives for her hacking.

During his first years with the Celtics, he was criticized by many in the media for his coaching style, most vociferously by Bill Simmons, who in 2006 publicly called for Rivers to be fired in his columns.\n\n**Los Angeles Clippers (2013-2020)**\n\nOn June 25, 2013, the Los Angeles Clippers acquired Rivers from the Celtics for an unprotected 2015 NBA first-round draft pick. He also became the senior vice president of basketball operations on the team. In his first season as their head coach, Rivers led the Clippers to a franchise-record 57 wins, garnering the 3rd seed in the Western conference. The 2014 NBA playoffs first round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors was marred when TMZ released an audiotape containing racially insensitive remarks made by the then-Clippers owner Donald Sterling. Though there was a possibility of the Clippers boycotting the series, they instead played on, instead holding a silent protest by leaving their shooting jerseys at center court and obscuring the Clippers logo on their warm-up shirts. Rivers himself stated that he would not return to the Clippers if Sterling remained as owner the following season. NBA commissioner Adam Silver responded to the controversy by banning Sterling from the NBA for life and compelling him to sell the team. The team was sold to Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2 billion on August 12, 2014, and Rivers remained with the Clippers.\n\n**Philadelphia 76ers (2020-2023)**\n\nOn October 3, 2020, the Philadelphia 76ers announced that they had hired Rivers as their head coach. The 76ers won their first two games of the 2020-21 season, which earned Rivers his 945th career win, passing Hall of Famer Bill Fitch for 10th on the all-time coaching regular season wins list. The 76ers went on to secure the first seed in the Eastern Conference, and defeated the Washington Wizards in five games in the first round of the playoffs, but lost in the semifinals to the Atlanta Hawks in seven games. On May 14, 2023, the 76ers lost the conference semifinals series to the Celtics; two days later, Rivers was fired, ending his three-year tenure as head coach of the 76ers.\n\n**Milwaukee Bucks (2023-present)**\n\nBeginning in December 2023, Rivers began serving as an informal consultant to Milwaukee Bucks first-year coach Adrian Griffin at the team's request. On January 26, 2024, after firing Griffin after 43 games, the Bucks announced that Rivers was hired as their head coach. Rivers' first game as the Bucks' head coach was a loss to the reigning champion Denver Nuggets on January 29, 2024.\n\n**Broadcasting Career**\n\nFollowing his retirement as a player, Rivers called games for the NBA on TNT before joining the Orlando Magic as head coach in 1999. With TNT, Rivers was normally paired with Verne Lundquist and later with Kevin Harlan.\n\n**NBA Career Statistics**\n\nRivers is the nephew of former NBA player Jim Brewer.\n\n**Regular

{"title": "Mona_Lisa", "content": "\nTitle and subject\nThe title of the painting, which is known in English as Mona Lisa, is based on the presumption that it depicts Lisa del Giocondo, although her likeness is uncertain Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote that \"Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife.\" [18] [19] [20] Monna in Italian is a polite form of address originating as ma donna—similar to Ma'am, Madam, or my lady in English This became madonna, and its contraction monna The title of the painting, though traditionally spelled Mona in English, is spelled in Italian as Monna Lisa (mona being a vulgarity in Italian), but this is rare in English [21] [22]\n\n\nDescription\nThe Mona Lisa bears a strong resemblance to many Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary, who was at that time seen as an ideal for womanhood [39] The woman sits markedly upright in a \"pozzetto\" armchair with her arms folded, a sign of her reserved posture Her gaze is fixed on the observer  The woman appears alive to an unusual extent, which Leonardo achieved by his method of not drawing outlines The soft blending (sfumato) creates an ambiguous mood \"mainly in two features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners of the eyes\" [40]\n\n\nHistory\nOf Leonardo da Vinci's works, the Mona Lisa is the only portrait whose authenticity has never been seriously questioned, [60] and one of four works—the others being Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, Adoration of the Magi and The Last Supper—whose attribution has avoided controversy [61] He had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the model of the Mona Lisa, by October 1503 [27] [28] It is believed by some that the Mona Lisa was begun in 1503 or 1504 in Florence [62] Although the Louvre states that it was \"doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506\", [8] art historian Martin Kemp says that there are some difficulties in confirming the dates with certainty [23] Alessandro Vezzosi believes that the painting is characteristic of Leonardo's style in the final years of his life, post-1513 [63] Other academics argue that, given the historical documentation, Leonardo would have painted the work from 1513 [64] According to Vasari, \"after he had lingered over it four years,  [he] left it unfinished\" [19] In 1516, Leonardo was invited by King Francis I to work at the Clos Lucé near the Château d'Amboise; it is believed that he took the Mona Lisa with him and continued to work on it after he moved to France [34] Art historian Carmen C Bambach has concluded that Leonardo probably continued refining the work until 1516 or 1517 [65] Leonardo's right hand was paralytic c. 1517, [66] which may indicate why he left the Mona Lisa unfinished [67] [68] [69] [b]\n\n\nCreation and date\nOf Leonardo da Vinci's works, the Mona Lisa is the only portrait whose authenticity has never been seriously questioned, [60] and one of four works—the others being Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, Adoration of the Magi and The Last Supper—whose attribution has avoided controversy [61] He had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the model of the Mona Lisa, by October 1503 [27] [28] It is believed by some that the Mona Lisa was begun in 1503 or 1504 in Florence [62] Although the Louvre states that it was \"doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506\", [8] art historian Martin Kemp says that there are some difficulties in confirming the dates with certainty [23] Alessandro Vezzosi believes that the painting is characteristic

or 1517 [65] Leonardo's right hand was paralytic c. 1517, [66] which may indicate why he left the Mona Lisa unfinished [67] [68] [69] [b]\n\n\nRefuge, theft, and vandalism\nAfter the French Revolution, the painting was moved to the Louvre, but spent a brief period in the bedroom of Napoleon (d. 1821) in the Tuileries Palace [89] The Mona Lisa was not widely known outside the art world, but in the 1860s, a portion of the French intelligentsia began to hail it as a masterwork of Renaissance painting [90] During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), the painting was moved from the Louvre to the Brest Arsenal [91]\n\n\nModern analysis\nIn the early 21st century, French scientist Pascal Cotte hypothesized a hidden portrait underneath the surface of the painting He analysed the painting in the Louvre with  reflective light technology beginning in 2004, and produced circumstantial evidence for his theory [114] [115] [116] Cotte admits that his investigation was carried out only in support of his hypotheses and should not be considered as definitive proof [115] [26] The underlying portrait appears to be of a model looking to the side, and lacks flanking columns, [117] but does not fit with historical descriptions of the painting Both Vasari and Gian Paolo Lomazzo describe the subject as smiling, [18] [118] unlike the subject in Cotte's supposed portrait [115] [26] In 2020, Cotte published a study alleging that the painting has an underdrawing, transferred from a preparatory drawing via the spolvero technique [119]\n\n\nConservation\nThe Mona Lisa has survived for more than 500 years, and an international commission convened in 1952 noted that \"the picture is in a remarkable state of preservation.\" [80] It has never been fully restored, [120] so the

Leonardo da Vinci in the early 16th century. The painting is widely considered to be one of the greatest paintings of all time, and it is often referred to as the most famous painting in the world. The painting is a portrait of a woman who is believed to be Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy merchant named Francesco del Giocondo.\n\n**The Title of the Painting**\n\nThe title of the painting, \"Mona Lisa,\" is based on the presumption that it depicts Lisa del Giocondo, although her likeness is uncertain. Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote that \"Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife.\" The title of the painting, though traditionally spelled \"Mona\" in English, is spelled in Italian as \"Monna Lisa\" (mona being a vulgarity in Italian), but this is rare in English.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe Mona Lisa bears a strong resemblance to many Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary, who was at that time seen as an ideal for womanhood. The woman sits markedly upright in a \"pozzetto\" armchair with her arms folded, a sign of her reserved posture. Her gaze is fixed on the observer, and she appears alive to an unusual extent, which Leonardo achieved by his method of not drawing outlines. The soft blending (sfumato) creates an ambiguous mood \"mainly in two features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners of the eyes.\"\n\n**History**\n\nOf Leonardo da Vinci's works, the Mona Lisa is the only portrait whose authenticity has never been seriously questioned, and one of four works—the others being Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, Adoration of the Magi, and The Last Supper—whose attribution has avoided controversy. He had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the model of the Mona Lisa, by October 1503. Although the Louvre states that it was \"doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506,\" art historian Martin Kemp says that there are some difficulties in confirming the dates with certainty. Alessandro Vezzosi believes that the painting is characteristic of Leonardo's style in the final years of his life, post-1513. Other academics argue that, given the historical documentation, Leonardo would have painted the work from 1513.\n\n**Creation and Date**\n\nOf Leonardo da Vinci's works, the Mona Lisa is the only portrait whose authenticity has never been seriously questioned, and one of four works—the others being Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, Adoration of the Magi, and The Last Supper—whose attribution has avoided controversy.

Other academics argue that, given the historical documentation, Leonardo would have painted the work from 1513.\n\n**Refuge, Theft, and Vandalism**\n\nAfter the French Revolution, the painting was moved to the Louvre, but spent a brief period in the bedroom of Napoleon (d. 1821) in the Tuileries Palace. The Mona Lisa was not widely known outside the art world, but in the 1860s, a portion of the French intelligentsia began to hail it as a masterwork of Renaissance painting. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), the painting was moved from the Louvre to the Brest Arsenal.\n\n**Modern Analysis**\n\nIn the early 21st century, French scientist Pascal Cotte hypothesized a hidden portrait underneath the surface of the painting. He analyzed the painting in the Louvre with reflective light technology beginning in 2004, and produced circumstantial evidence for his theory. The underlying portrait appears to be of a model looking to the side, and lacks flanking columns, but does not fit with historical descriptions of the painting. Both Vasari and Gian Paolo Lomazzo describe the subject as smiling, unlike the subject in Cotte's supposed portrait.\n\n**Conservation**\n\nThe Mona Lisa has survived for more than 500 years, and an international commission convened in 1952 noted that \"the picture is in a remarkable state of preservation.\" It has never been fully restored, so the current condition is partly due to a variety of conservation treatments the painting has undergone. A detailed analysis in 1933 by Madame de Gironde revealed that earlier restorers had \"acted with a great deal of restraint.\" Nevertheless, applications of varnish made to the painting had darkened even by the end of the 16th century, and an aggressive 1809 cleaning and revarnishing removed some of the uppermost portion of the paint layer, resulting in a washed-out appearance to the face of the figure.\n\n**Poplar Panel**\n\nAt some point, the Mona Lisa was removed from its original frame.

This intervention was skilfully executed, and successfully stabilized the crack. Sometime between 1888 and 1905, or perhaps during the picture's theft, the upper brace fell out. A later restorer glued and lined the resulting socket and crack with cloth.\n\n**Frame**\n\nBecause the Mona Lisa's poplar support expands and contracts with changes in humidity, the picture has experienced some warping. In response to warping and swelling experienced during its storage during World War II, and to prepare the picture for an exhibit to honour the anniversary of Leonardo's 500th birthday, the Mona Lisa was fitted in 1951 with a flexible oak frame with beech crosspieces.

The COSC is an inter-service syndicate of the armed forces, which functions as a principal advisory body dealing with matters related to inter-service coordination, policy formulation, and strategy development. The Department of Military Affairs, on the other hand, is one of the five departments within the Ministry of Defence, which functions as a joint civilian-cum-military syndicate tasked with overseeing administrative duties related to the headquarters of the three armed services, the Integrated Defence Staff (IDS), and the Territorial Army, as well as procurement initiatives except for capital acquisitions.\n\n**Chiefs of Staff Committee**\n\nThe Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC) is an inter-service syndicate of the armed forces, which functions as a principal advisory body dealing with matters related to inter-service coordination, policy formulation, and strategy development. The COSC comprises the chiefs of the three armed services, in addition to the CDS, who acts as its Permanent Chairman.

The CDS is seen as a key player in the decision-making process, but its role is still evolving and is subject to interpretation.\n\n**Promotion**\n\nSince its creation in January 2020, the office of CDS has customarily been held by a four-star officer from the three armed services, specifically, either a general, admiral, or air chief marshal. The move to appoint a designate to the office is initiated by the Ministry of Defence, wherein the résumés of candidates recommended by the armed services are submitted for intense review, before being sent to the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, comprising the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, whereupon the appointment is finalized.\n\n**Tenure**\n\nUnder an initial set of regulations established by the Ministry of Defence in December 2019, the service chiefs from the three services, namely, the Chief of the Army Staff, the Chief of the Naval Staff, and the Chief of the Air Staff, having completed their mandated three-year tenure or having attained the age of 62, were deemed eligible to be appointed CDS.

Formed in the late 1980s, the group consists of nine members, each with their own unique style and lyrical approach.\n\n**History**\n\nIn the late 1980s, cousins Robert Diggs, Gary Grice, and Russell Jones formed a group named Force of the Imperial Master, also known as the All in Together Now Crew. Each member recorded under an alias: Diggs as Prince Rakeem or The Scientist, Grice as The Genius, and Jones as The Specialist. The group never signed to a major label, but caught the attention of the New York City rap scene and was recognized by rapper Biz Markie. By 1991, The Genius and Prince Rakeem were signed to separate record labels. The Genius released Words from the Genius (1991) on Cold Chillin' Records and Prince Rakeem released Ooh I Love You Rakeem (1991) on Tommy Boy Records. Both were soon dropped by their labels and adopted new monikers; The Genius became GZA (pronounced \"jizza\"), and Prince Rakeem became RZA (pronounced \"rizza\"). The Specialist also took on a new name and became known as Ol' Dirty Bastard.\n\n**Founding**\n\nIn the late 1980s, cousins Robert Diggs, Gary Grice, and Russell Jones formed a group named Force of the Imperial Master, also known as the All in Together Now Crew.

The Specialist also took on a new name and became known as Ol' Dirty Bastard.\n\n**1992–96: Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) and solo albums**\n\nWu-Tang Clan became known in 1993 following the release of the independent single \"Protect Ya Neck\", which helped gain the group a sizable underground following. Though there was some difficulty in finding a record label that would sign the Wu-Tang Clan while still allowing each member to record solo albums with other labels, Loud/RCA finally agreed, releasing their debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), in November 1993. The album loosely adopted a Shaolin vs Wu-Tang theme, dividing the album into Shaolin and Wu-Tang sections. The album received critical acclaim, and to date is regarded as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. The success of their debut album established the group as a creative and influential force in the 1990s, allowing individual members to negotiate solo contracts. RZA spoke on the Wu-Tang Clan's unorthodox business model.\n\n**1997–2000: Wu-Tang Forever, diversification and second string of solo albums**\n\nWu-Tang Clan re-assembled and released their second studio album, Wu-Tang Forever, in June 1997; it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album's lead single, \"Triumph\", is over five minutes long, features nine verses (one from each member plus Cappadonna and excluding Ol' Dirty Bastard who appeared on the intro and bridge), and no hook or a repeated phrase. The album was produced by RZA and his protégés True Master and 4th Disciple. The group's lyrics differed significantly from those of 36 Chambers, with many verses written in a dense stream of consciousness form heavily influenced by the teachings of the Five-Percent Nation. Wu-Tang Forever was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards, losing to Puff Daddy; Ol' Dirty Bastard infamously protested the loss by interrupting Shawn Colvin's acceptance speech for Song of the Year.\n\n**2000–01: The W and Iron Flag**\n\nThe group reconvened again for their third album, The W. Despite his incarceration in California for violating the terms of his probation, Ol' Dirty Bastard was on the song \"Conditioner\", featuring Snoop Dogg. Ol' Dirty Bastard's vocals were recorded via prison telephones. The W was released in November 2000, and was mostly well received by critics, and included the single \"Gravel Pit\". The album reached platinum status.\n\n**2004: Issues and resurgence**\n\nIn early 2004, U-God allegedly left the group. A DVD titled Rise of a Fallen Soldier was released detailing his problems, which were mostly with his treatment by RZA, who he claimed had hindered his success as a solo artist. U-God formed a group of young protegés called the Hillside Scramblers with whom he released the album U-Godzilla Presents the Hillside Scramblers in March 2004. The dispute culminated in a heated phone conversation between RZA and U-God on live radio, which ultimately saw the two reconcile. He has since returned to the group.\n\n**Death of Ol' Dirty Bastard**\n\nOl' Dirty Bastard's career was tumultuous. His run-ins with the law were well publicized—he was arrested several times for offenses including assault, shoplifting, wearing body armor after being convicted of a felony, and possession of cocaine, and he missed multiple court dates. In April 2001, he was sentenced to two to four years in prison. Once released from prison, he signed a million-dollar contract with Roc-A-Fella Records.\n\n**2005–10: Solo albums and 8 Diagrams**\n\nIn 2005, RZA released a book titled The Wu-Tang Manual. In the same year, U-God's second album, Mr Xcitement and a collaboration between GZA and producer DJ Muggs, entitled Grandmasters were also released.\n\n**2011–present: A Better Tomorrow, and Once Upon a Time in Shaolin**\n\nOn June 29, 2011, Raekwon announced that the group were working on a new studio album, still in early stages. Ghostface Killah later said that the album would be released in May 2012.\n\n**A Better Tomorrow**\n\nOn June 29, 2011, Raekwon announced that the group were working on a new studio album, still in early stages. Ghostface Killah later said that the album would be released in May 2012.\n\n**Once Upon a Time in Shaolin**\n\nIn March 2014 it was reported that in addition to work on A Better Tomorrow, a Wu-Tang Clan compilation album entitled The Wu – Once Upon A Time In Shaolin had been recorded, with Wu-Tang-affiliated producer Cilvaringz as the primary producer instead of RZA. The album, a double album consisting of 31 tracks, was not given a conventional commercial release and only one copy has been produced; the copy toured in museums, art galleries and music festivals before being sold at a high price to a single individual. In August 2014, a reporter from Forbes traveled to Marrakech to meet Cilvaringz and hear a 51-second snippet of a song from the album, which featured Cher. The snippet was subsequently put on their website. The album is encased in a handcrafted silver-and-nickel box made by British-Moroccan artist Yahya and features never-before-heard music recorded over years. RZA stated he has been receiving multiple million dollar offers for the album. Despite the album's exclusivity it made an appearance in electronic dance music producer Skrillex's music video for his song \"Fuck That\" even though he did not purchase the project. The album was sold through Paddle8, an online auction house, for $2 million to Martin Shkreli. When the FBI arrested Martin Shkreli on December 17, 2015, they did not seize the Wu-Tang Clan album. Following the victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S presidential election, Shkreli broadcast excerpts from the album on streaming platforms Periscope and Hitbox.tv.\n\n**The Saga Continues**\n\nOn August 25, 2017, Wu-Tang Clan released the song, \"People Say\", which featured Redman. RZA announced that the song would be part of an upcoming album, titled The Saga Continues. The album was released on October 13 under the name \"Wu-Tang\", as U-God was absent from it. The Saga Continues was primarily produced by Mathematics, and debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200.\n\n**Las Vegas residency**\n\nThe Wu-Tang Clan collective became the first HipHop act to receive a Las Vegas artist residency with \"Wu-Tang Clan: The Saga Continues… The Las Vegas Residency\" at The Theater at Virgin Hotels, launched February 2024.\n\n**Members**\n\nAccording to RZA, he tries to have no more than 20–25% sampling on any given record, something starkly different from many other major hip hop groups.

Baker (1902-1984) was the mother of Norma Jeane Mortenson, later known as Marilyn Monroe. Her life was marked by struggles with mental health, relationships, and parenting, which had a profound impact on her daughter's early years and career.\n\n**Life**\n\nGladys Pearl Monroe was born on May 27, 1902, in Porfirio Díaz (now named Piedras Negras, Coahuila) in Mexico, across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas. Her mother, Della Mae Monroe (née Hogan), was born in Missouri and was from Bentonville, Arkansas, while her father, Otis Elmer Monroe, was a house painter from Indianapolis. Otis worked for the National Railroad of Mexico painting railway cars, and Della was a midwife and an unofficial teacher.\n\n## Family Background\n\nThe family moved to Los Angeles County in the spring of 1903, where Otis worked for the Pacific Electric Railway Company. Della was known to have been involved in various forms of entertainment, including singing and playing the piano. The Monroes were a close-knit family, and Otis was said to be a loving father who provided for his family's needs.\n\n## Early Years\n\nGladys grew up in a relatively stable household with her parents and younger brother, Robert Kermit \"Jackie.\" She attended school and showed a keen interest in the arts, often participating in school plays and singing in the church choir. As she entered her teenage years, Gladys began to explore her independence, often getting into mischief and testing the boundaries set by her parents.\n\n# Marriage to Jasper Baker\n\nAt the age of 14, Gladys met John Newton \"Jasper\" Baker, a businessman from Kentucky who was a \"violent drinker\" and prone to abusive behavior. Despite her young age, Gladys became romantically involved with Jasper, and they married on May 17, 1917, with her mother's permission and a signed affidavit stating that Gladys was 18. The marriage was marked by periods of happiness and violence, with Jasper often beating Gladys and their children.\n\n## Children\n\nGladys gave birth to two children, Robert Kermit \"Jackie\" and Berniece Inez Gladys, during her marriage to Jasper. Jackie suffered serious injuries after falling out of the family car, leaving him lame for the rest of his life. Gladys filed for divorce from Jasper in 1921, citing his abusive behavior, and was awarded custody of the children. Jasper, however, kidnapped the children and returned them to his native Kentucky, where his mother helped raise them.\n\n# Hollywood and Second Marriage\n\nIn 1923, Gladys moved to Hollywood and worked as a negative film cutter for Consolidated Film Industries. She also worked at Columbia Pictures and RKO, where she met Charles Stanley Gifford, her superior and a self-proclaimed womanizer. Gladys began an affair with Gifford in 1925, while also having relationships with other men.\n\n## Relationship with Charles Stanley Gifford\n\nGifford had separated from his wife, Lillian Priester, in October 1923, and they were divorced in May 1925. Gladys's affair with Gifford was marked by a lack of commitment and a tendency to move on to other relationships. Despite this, Gifford remained a significant figure in Gladys's life, and she continued to work under him at RKO.\n\n# 1926-1933: Norma Jeane's Early Years\n\nGladys lacked parenting skills and had a lifestyle that did not suit motherhood. She did not have viable daycare options and needed her job to earn a living. Gladys experienced severe postpartum depression and was unable to take care of Norma Jeane. On one occasion, she tried to stab Norma Jeane, but was prevented from doing so by Grace Goddard, Norma Jeane's foster mother.\n\n## Mental Health Issues\n\nIn August 1933, Norma Jeane lived with the Baker and a British couple named George and Maud Atkinson in her mother's house, and Grace looked after Baker's and Norma Jeane's affairs.

Monroe, who was present, called the police and watched as her mother was whisked away to a hospital.\n\n## Legacy\n\nGladys Pearl Baker's mental health made headlines in her daughter's career early. In an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News, Monroe stated: \"I have never been able to understand why my mother and I were so different. We were just like two sides of the same coin, but I never could understand why she was the way she was.\"\n\nGladys's struggles with mental health and relationships had a profound impact on her daughter's early years and career. Despite this, Marilyn Monroe went on to become one of the most iconic actresses of all time, using her platform to raise awareness about mental health and the importance of nurturing and supporting loved ones.\n\n**References**\n\n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \n8. \n9. \n10. \n11. \n12. \n13. \n14. \n15. \n16. \n17. \n18. \n19. \n20. \n21. \n22. \n23. \n24. \n25. \n26. \n27. \n28. \n29.

This technique is used in auction catalogues, home magazines, and furniture decorations. The découpage often references literary, mythological, or art-historical topics and is often displayed in royal palaces, particularly Christian VII's Palace at Amalienborg.\n\n## Embroidery\n\nAs a child, Margrethe preferred drawing rather than needlework, but since 1960, numerous embroideries have been presented as gifts or used in the Queen's own rooms. The embroideries are made from patterns that Margrethe herself creates on graph paper, which includes twining shapes and the recipient's monogram.\n\n## Films\n\nThe Queen has worked as a screenwriter alongside Per Brink Abrahamsen on the two Hans Christian Andersen adaptations, \"The Snow Queen\" from 2000 and \"The Wild Swans\" from 2009.

{"title": "Commonwealth_Games", "content": "\nHistory\nA sporting competition bringing together the members of the British Empire was first proposed by John Astley Cooper in 1891, five years before the first modern Olympic Games, who wrote letters and articles for several periodicals suggesting a \"Pan Brittanic, Pan Anglican Contest every four years as a means of increasing goodwill and understanding of the British Empire.\" [17] John Astley Cooper Committees were formed in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa to promote the idea and inspired Pierre de Coubertin to start the international Olympic Games movement [18] [19]\n\n\nEditions\n*Note : Nations in italics no longer participate at the Commonwealth Games.\n\n\nBritish Empire Games\n\nThe 1930 British Empire Games was the first of what later became known as the Commonwealth Games, and was held in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada from 16 to 23 August 1930 and opened by Lord Willingdon [26] Eleven countries: Australia, Bermuda, British Guyana, Canada, England, Northern Ireland, Newfoundland, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales, sent a total of 400 athletes to compete in athletics, boxing, lawn bowls, rowing, swimming and diving and wrestling The opening and closing ceremonies as well as athletics took place at Civic Stadium [27] The cost of the Games were $97,973 [27] Women competed in only the aquatic events [28] Canadian triple jumper Gordon Smallacombe won the first ever gold medal in the history of the Games [8]\n\nBritish Empire and Commonwealth Games\nThe fifth edition of the Games, the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada This was the first event since the name change from British Empire Games took effect in 1952, the same year of Queen Elizabeth II's reign The fifth edition of the Games placed Vancouver on a world stage and featured memorable sporting moments as well as outstanding entertainment, technical innovation and cultural events The 'Miracle Mile', as it became known, saw both the gold medallist, Roger Bannister of England and silver medallist John Landy of Australia, run sub-four-minute races in an event that was televised live across the world for the first time Northern Rhodesia and Pakistan made their debuts and both performed well, winning eight and six medals respectively [32]\n\n\nBritish Commonwealth Games\nThe 1970 British Commonwealth Games was held in Edinburgh, Scotland This was the first time the name British Commonwealth Games was adopted, the first time metric units rather than imperial units were used in events, the first time the games were held in Scotland and also the first time that HM Queen Elizabeth II attended in her capacity as Head of the Commonwealth [37]\n\n\nCommonwealth Games\nThe 1978 Commonwealth Games was held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada This event was the first to bear the current day name of the Commonwealth Games, and also marked a new high as almost 1,500 athletes from 46 countries took part They were boycotted by Nigeria in protest against New Zealand's sporting contacts with apartheid-era South Africa, as well as by Uganda in protest at alleged Canadian hostilities toward the government of Idi Amin [39] [40]\n\n\nDuring the 21st century\nThe 2002 Commonwealth Games was held in Manchester, England The event was hosted in England for the first time since 1934 and hosted to coincide with the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, head of the Commonwealth In terms of sports and events, the 2002 event was until the 2010 edition the largest Commonwealth Games in history featuring 281 events across 17 sports The final medal tally was led by Australia, followed by host England and Canada The 2002 Commonwealth Games had set a new benchmark for hosting the Commonwealth Games and for cities wishing to bid for them with a heavy emphasis on legacy [47] The theme song for the 2002 Commonwealth Games was called \"Where My Heart Will Take Me\".\n\n\nParaplegic Games\nThe Commonwealth Paraplegic Games were an international, multi-sport event involving athletes with a disability from the Commonwealth countries The event was sometimes referred to as the Paraplegic Empire Games and British Commonwealth Paraplegic Games Athletes were generally those with spinal injuries or polio The event was first held in 1962 and disestablished in 1974 [60] The Games were held in the country hosting the Commonwealth Games for able-bodied athletes The countries that had hosted the Commonwealth Paraplegic Games were Australia, Jamaica, Scotland and New Zealand in 1962, 1966, 1970 and 1974 Six countries – Australia, England, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales — had been represented at all Commonwealth Paraplegic Games Australia and England had been [citation needed] the top-ranking nation two times each: 1962, 1974 and 1966, 1970 [citation needed]\n\n\nInclusion of disabled athletes in Commonwealth Games\nAthletes with a disability were then first included the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia when this events was added to athletics and lawn bowls, [61] As at 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, they were included as compulsory events, making them the first fully inclusive international multi-sport games This meant that results were included in the medal count and the athletes are full members of each country delegation [62]\n\n\nWinter Games\nThe Commonwealth Winter Games was a multi-sport event comprising winter sports, last held in 1966 Three editions of the Games have been staged The Commonwealth Winter Games were designed as a counterbalance to the Commonwealth Games, which focuses on summer sports, to accompany the Winter Olympics and Summer Olympic Games The winter Games were founded by T.D Richardson [64] The 1958 Commonwealth Winter Games were held in St Moritz, Switzerland and was the inaugural games for the winter edition [65] [66] The 1962 Games were also held in St Moritz, complementing the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Australia, and the 1966 event was held in St Moritz as well, following which the idea was discontinued [67]\n\n\nYouth Games\nThe Commonwealth Youth Games is an international multi-sport event organised by the Commonwealth Games Federation The Commonwealth Youth Games|Youth Games are held every four years with the current Commonwealth Games format The Commonwealth Games Federation discussed the idea of a Millennium Commonwealth Youth Games in 1997 In 1998, the concept was agreed on for the purpose of providing a Commonwealth multi-sport event for young people born in 1986 or later The first version was held in Edinburgh, Scotland from 10 to 14 August 2000 The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18 [68]\n\n\nCommonwealth Games Federation\nThe Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) is the international organisation responsible for the direction and control of the Commonwealth Games and Commonwealth Youth Games, and is the foremost authority in matters relating to the games [69] The Commonwealth House in London, England hosts the headquarters of CGF [70] The Commonwealth House also hosts the headquarters of the Royal Commonwealth Society and the Commonwealth Local Government Forum [71] [72]\n\n\nQueen's Baton Relay\nThe Queen's Baton Relay is a relay around the world held prior to the beginning of the Commonwealth Games The Baton carries a message from the Head of the Commonwealth The Relay traditionally begins at Buckingham Palace in London as a part of the city's Commonwealth Day festivities The Queen entrusts the baton to the first relay runner At the Opening Ceremony of the Games, the final relay runner hands the baton back to the Queen or her representative, who reads the message aloud to officially open the Games The Queen's Baton Relay is similar to the Olympic Torch Relay [76]\n\n\nCeremonies\nVarious elements frame the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem The flag of the Commonwealth Games Federation, flag of the last hosting nation and the next hosting nation are also hosted during the opening ceremony The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance and theatre representative of its culture The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability The opening ceremony of the Delhi Games reportedly cost $70 million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment [78]\n\n\nOpening\nVarious elements frame the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of

incurred in the artistic segment [78]\n\n\nClosing\nThe closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction The president of the organising committee and the CGF president make their closing speeches and the Games are officially closed The CGF president also speaks about the conduct of the games The mayor of the city that organised the Games transfers the CGF flag to the president of the CGF, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Commonwealth Games The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theatre representative of its culture Many great artists and singers had performed at the ceremonies of the Commonwealth Games [79]\n\n\nMedal presentation\nA medal ceremony is held after each event is concluded The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals After the medals are given out by a CGF member, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medallist's country plays Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers.\n\n\nAnthems\n\"God Save the King\" is an official or national anthem of multiple Commonwealth countries and dependent territories As a result, and due to the countries of the United Kingdom competing individually, its use is prohibited during official events, medal ceremonies or before matches in team events [81]\nWith the revision of this rule made before the 2010 Games, some national anthems used were changed and in some cases they differ from a currently-eligible country's national or official anthem(s):\n\n\nList of Commonwealth Games\n\n\n\nEditions\n*Note : Nations in italics no longer participate at the Commonwealth Games.\n\n\nMedal table\n*Note : Nations in italics no longer participate at the Commonwealth Games.\n\n\nCommonwealth sports\nUnlike other sporting events, the Commonwealth Games have a flexible sporting programme that respects the infrastructure and demands of the host city This is also reflected in its holding dates, which may vary according to the weather conditions of each host city Therefore, the programme for each edition varies Between 1930 and 1994, only individual events were part of the programme and it was only in 1998 that authorisation was given for the addition of team sports It is common for each edition since then to have a list of seven to ten mandatory sports that must be played in this edition and must be approved 4 years in advance Thus, the minimum number of sports per edition is 10 and the maximum is of 17 However, local demands can also increase the number of sports contested Notable cases are freestyle wrestling in Delhi 2010 and beach volleyball in Gold Coast 2018 Special exceptions can also be made, such as the one in the last edition held in Birmingham, England, in which 3 extra sports were added to the programme [87] The current rules also determine gender parity, whereby men and women have an equal (or broadly equal) share of events [88] [89]\n\n\nParticipation\nOnly six teams have attended every Commonwealth Games: Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales Australia has been the highest scoring team for thirteen games, England for seven, and Canada for one.\n\n\nCommonwealth nations yet to send teams\nVery few Commonwealth nations and dependencies have yet to take part: [103] [104] [105]\n\n\nRejected participants\nCampaigners from the English county of Cornwall asked the Commonwealth Games Federation to allow Cornwall to participate independently in the 2006 Games, but were rejected by the CGF, which stated that \"Cornwall is no more than an English county\" and advised Cornwall athletes to compete on the England team [110] [111] Cornwall political party Mebyon Kernow unsuccessfully called for a Cornwall team at the 2022 Games [112]\n\n\nControversies\nThe 1934 British Empire Games, originally awarded in 1930 to Johannesburg, were moved to London after South

previously known as the British Empire Games, is a major international multi-sport event that brings together athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations, a voluntary association of 54 countries, most of which are former British colonies or territories. The Games are held every four years and feature a wide range of sports and events, with a focus on promoting friendship, unity, and athletic excellence among the participating nations.\n\n**History**\n\nThe idea of a sporting competition bringing together the members of the British Empire was first proposed by John Astley Cooper in 1891, five years before the first modern Olympic Games. Cooper wrote letters and articles for several periodicals suggesting a \"Pan Brittanic, Pan Anglican Contest every four years as a means of increasing goodwill and understanding of the British Empire.\"\n\nIn 1898, Cooper formed committees in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa to promote the idea, which inspired Pierre de Coubertin to start the international Olympic Games movement. The first edition of the Games, known as the British Empire Games, was held in 1930 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and featured 400 athletes from 11 countries competing in athletics, boxing, lawn bowls, rowing, swimming and diving, and wrestling.\n\nOver the years, the Games have undergone several name changes, becoming known as the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1952, and then simply the Commonwealth Games in 1978. Today, the Games are a major international sporting event, featuring over 4,500 athletes from 72 countries competing in 17 sports.\n\n**Editions**\n\nThe Commonwealth Games have been held 22 times since their inception in 1930. Here is a list of all the editions:\n\n* 1930: Hamilton, Ontario, Canada\n* 1934: London, England\n* 1938: Sydney, Australia\n* 1950: Auckland, New Zealand\n* 1954: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada\n* 1958: Cardiff, Wales\n* 1962: Perth, Australia\n* 1966: Kingston, Jamaica\n* 1970: Edinburgh, Scotland\n* 1974: Christchurch, New Zealand\n* 1978: Edmonton, Alberta, Canada\n* 1982: Brisbane, Australia\n* 1986: Edinburgh, Scotland\n* 1990: Auckland, New Zealand\n* 1994: Victoria, British Columbia, Canada\n* 1998: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n* 2002: Manchester, England\n* 2006: Melbourne, Australia\n* 2010: Delhi, India\n* 2014: Glasgow, Scotland\n* 2018: Gold Coast, Australia\n* 2022: Birmingham, England\n\n**Medal Table**\n\nThe medal table is a list of the top 10 countries in terms of the number of medals won at the Commonwealth Games. Here is the medal table for the 2022 Commonwealth Games:\n\n* Australia: 107 medals (41 gold, 33 silver, 33 bronze)\n* England: 68 medals (39 gold, 19 silver, 10 bronze)\n* Canada: 45 medals (15 gold, 14 silver, 16 bronze)\n* India: 44 medals (11 gold, 11 silver, 22 bronze)\n* New Zealand: 33 medals (12 gold, 7 silver, 14 bronze)\n* Scotland: 28 medals (8 gold, 4 silver, 16 bronze)\n* Wales: 11 medals (2 gold, 3 silver, 6 bronze)\n\n**Commonwealth Sports**\n\nThe Commonwealth Games feature a wide range of sports and events, including athletics, badminton, basketball, boxing, cycling, gymnastics, hockey, lawn bowls, netball, rugby sevens, shooting, squash, table tennis, triathlon, and weightlifting. The sports program is flexible and can be adjusted to suit the needs and infrastructure of the host city.\n\n**Participation**\n\nOnly 22 countries have participated in every edition of the Commonwealth Games since its inception in 1930. These countries are:\n\n* Australia\n* Canada\n* England\n* New Zealand\n* Scotland\n* Wales\n* South Africa\n* India\n* Pakistan\n* Kenya\n* Nigeria\n* Uganda\n* Jamaica\n* Barbados\n* Trinidad and Tobago\n* Guyana\n* Fiji\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Malaysia\n* Singapore\n* Sri Lanka\n\n**Rejected Participants**\n\nThere have been several instances where countries have been rejected from participating in the Commonwealth Games. The most notable example is the 2022 Commonwealth Games, where the English county of Cornwall was rejected from participating as an independent team.\n\n**Boycotts**\n\nThe Commonwealth Games have experienced several boycotts over the years. The most notable example is the 2010 Commonwealth Games, which was boycotted by several African countries due to concerns over the host country's handling of the event.\n\n**Financial Implications**\n\nThe Commonwealth Games have significant financial implications for the host country. The 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India, was estimated to cost over $11 billion, making it one of the most expensive Commonwealth Games ever held.\n\n**Notable Competitors**\n\nSeveral notable competitors have participated in the Commonwealth Games over the years. These include lawn bowler Willie Wood, who competed in seven Commonwealth Games, and cyclist Andrew Roche, who competed in 11 Commonwealth Games.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Commonwealth of Nations\n* Commonwealth Secretariat\n* Commonwealth Foundation\n* Commonwealth Games Federation\n\n**References**\n\n* Commonwealth Games Federation.

Canada from 16 to 23 August 1930 and opened by Lord Willingdon [26] Eleven countries: Australia, Bermuda, British Guyana, Canada, England, Northern Ireland, Newfoundland, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales, sent a total of 400 athletes to compete in athletics, boxing, lawn bowls, rowing, swimming and diving and wrestling The opening and closing ceremonies as well as athletics took place at Civic Stadium [27] The cost of the Games were $97,973 [27] Women competed in only the aquatic events [28] Canadian triple jumper Gordon Smallacombe won the first ever gold medal in the history of the Games [8]\n\nBritish Empire and Commonwealth Games\nThe fifth edition of the Games, the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada This was the first event since the name change from British Empire Games took effect in 1952, the same year of Queen Elizabeth II's reign The fifth edition of the Games placed Vancouver on a world stage and featured memorable sporting moments as well as outstanding entertainment, technical innovation and cultural events The 'Miracle Mile', as it became known, saw both the gold medallist, Roger Bannister of England and silver medallist John Landy of Australia, run sub-four-minute races in an event that was televised live across the world for the first time Northern Rhodesia and Pakistan made their debuts and both performed well, winning eight and six medals respectively [32]\n\n\nBritish Commonwealth Games\nThe 1970 British Commonwealth Games was held in Edinburgh, Scotland This was the first time the name British Commonwealth Games was adopted, the first time metric units rather than imperial units were used in events, the first time the games were held in Scotland and also the first time that HM Queen Elizabeth II attended in her capacity as Head of the Commonwealth [37]\n\n\nCommonwealth Games\nThe 1978 Commonwealth Games was held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada This event was the first to bear the current day name of the Commonwealth Games, and also marked a new high as almost 1,500 athletes from 46 countries took part They were boycotted by Nigeria in protest against New Zealand's sporting contacts with apartheid-era South Africa, as well as by Uganda in protest at alleged Canadian hostilities toward the government of Idi Amin [39] [40]\n\n\nDuring the 21st century\nThe 2002 Commonwealth Games was held in Manchester, England The event was hosted in England for the first time since 1934 and hosted to coincide with the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, head of the Commonwealth In terms of sports and events, the 2002 event was until the 2010 edition the largest Commonwealth Games in history featuring 281 events across 17 sports The final medal tally was led by Australia, followed by host England and Canada The 2002 Commonwealth Games had set a new benchmark for hosting the Commonwealth Games and for cities wishing to bid for them with a heavy emphasis on legacy [47] The theme song for the 2002 Commonwealth Games was called \"Where My Heart Will Take Me\".\n\n\nParaplegic Games\nThe Commonwealth Paraplegic Games were an international, multi-sport event involving athletes with a disability from the Commonwealth countries The event was sometimes referred to as the Paraplegic Empire Games and British Commonwealth Paraplegic Games Athletes were generally those with spinal injuries or polio The event was first held in 1962 and disestablished in 1974 [60] The Games were held in the country hosting the Commonwealth Games for able-bodied athletes The countries that had hosted the Commonwealth Paraplegic Games were Australia, Jamaica, Scotland and New Zealand in 1962, 1966, 1970 and 1974 Six countries – Australia, England, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales — had been represented at all Commonwealth Paraplegic Games Australia and England had been [citation needed] the top-ranking nation two times each: 1962, 1974 and 1966, 1970 [citation needed]\n\n\nInclusion of disabled athletes in Commonwealth Games\nAthletes with a disability were then first included the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia when this events was added to athletics and lawn bowls, [61] As at 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, they were included as compulsory events, making them the first fully inclusive international multi-sport games This meant that results were included in the medal count and the athletes are full members of each country delegation [62]\n\n\nWinter Games\nThe Commonwealth Winter Games was a multi-sport event comprising winter sports, last held in 1966 Three editions of the Games have been staged The Commonwealth Winter Games were designed as a counterbalance to the Commonwealth Games, which focuses on summer sports, to accompany the Winter Olympics and Summer Olympic Games The winter Games were founded by T.D Richardson [64] The 1958 Commonwealth Winter Games were held in St Moritz, Switzerland and was the inaugural games for the winter edition [65] [66] The 1962 Games were also held in St Moritz, complementing the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Australia, and the 1966 event was held in St Moritz as well, following which the idea was discontinued [67]\n\n\nYouth Games\nThe Commonwealth Youth Games is an international multi-sport event organised by the Commonwealth Games Federation The Commonwealth Youth Games|Youth Games are held every four years with the current Commonwealth Games format The Commonwealth Games Federation discussed the idea of a Millennium Commonwealth Youth Games in 1997 In 1998, the concept was agreed on for the purpose of providing a Commonwealth multi-sport event for young people born in 1986 or later The first version was held in Edinburgh, Scotland from 10 to 14 August 2000 The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18 [68]\n\n\nCommonwealth Games Federation\nThe Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) is the international organisation responsible for the direction and control of the Commonwealth Games and Commonwealth Youth Games, and is the foremost authority in matters relating to the games [69] The Commonwealth House in London, England hosts the headquarters of CGF [70] The Commonwealth House also hosts the headquarters of the Royal Commonwealth Society and the Commonwealth Local Government Forum [71] [72]\n\n\nQueen's Baton Relay\nThe Queen's Baton Relay is a relay around the world held prior to the beginning of the Commonwealth Games The Baton carries a message from the Head of the Commonwealth The Relay traditionally begins at Buckingham Palace in London as a part of the city's Commonwealth Day festivities The Queen entrusts the baton to the first relay runner At the Opening Ceremony of the Games, the final relay runner hands the baton back to the Queen or her representative, who reads the message aloud to officially open the Games The Queen's Baton Relay is similar to the Olympic Torch Relay [76]\n\n\nCeremonies\nVarious elements frame the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem The flag of the Commonwealth Games Federation, flag of the last hosting nation and the next hosting nation are also hosted during the opening ceremony The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance and theatre representative of its culture The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability The opening ceremony of the Delhi Games reportedly cost $70 million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment [78]\n\n\nOpening\nVarious elements frame the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games This ceremony takes place before the events

the Delhi Games reportedly cost $70 million, with much of the cost incurred in the artistic segment [78]\n\n\nClosing\nThe closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction The president of the organising committee and the CGF president make their closing speeches and the Games are officially closed The CGF president also speaks about the conduct of the games The mayor of the city that organised the Games transfers the CGF flag to the president of the CGF, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Commonwealth Games The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theatre representative of its culture Many great artists and singers had performed at the ceremonies of the Commonwealth Games [79]\n\n\nMedal presentation\nA medal ceremony is held after each event is concluded The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals After the medals are given out by a CGF member, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medallist's country plays Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers.\n\n\nAnthems\n\"God Save the King\" is an official or national anthem of multiple Commonwealth countries and dependent territories As a result, and due to the countries of the United Kingdom competing individually, its use is prohibited during official events, medal ceremonies or before matches in team events [81]\nWith the revision of this rule made before the 2010 Games, some national anthems used were changed and in some cases they differ from a currently-eligible country's national or official anthem(s):\n\n\nList of Commonwealth Games\n\n\n\nEditions\n*Note : Nations in italics no longer participate at the Commonwealth Games.\n\n\nMedal table\n*Note : Nations in

infrastructure and demands of the host city This is also reflected in its holding dates, which may vary according to the weather conditions of each host city Therefore, the programme for each edition varies Between 1930 and 1994, only individual events were part of the programme and it was only in 1998 that authorisation was given for the addition of team sports It is common for each edition since then to have a list of seven to ten mandatory sports that must be played in this edition and must be approved 4 years in advance Thus, the minimum number of sports per edition is 10 and the maximum is of 17 However, local demands can also increase the number of sports contested Notable cases are freestyle wrestling in Delhi 2010 and beach volleyball in Gold Coast 2018 Special exceptions can also be made, such as the one in the last edition held in Birmingham, England, in which 3 extra sports were added to the programme [87] The current rules also determine gender parity, whereby men and women have an equal (or broadly equal) share of events [88] [89]\n\n\nParticipation\nOnly six teams have attended every Commonwealth Games: Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales Australia has been the highest scoring team for thirteen games, England for seven, and Canada for one.\n\n\nCommonwealth nations yet to send teams\nVery few Commonwealth nations and dependencies have yet to take part: [103] [104] [105]\n\n\nRejected participants\nCampaigners from the English county of Cornwall asked the Commonwealth Games Federation to allow Cornwall to participate independently in the 2006 Games, but were rejected by the CGF, which stated that \"Cornwall is no more than an English county\" and advised Cornwall athletes to compete on the England team [110] [111] Cornwall political party Mebyon Kernow unsuccessfully called for a Cornwall team at the 2022 Games [112]\n\n\nControversies\nThe 1934 British Empire Games, originally awarded in 1930 to Johannesburg, were moved to London after South Africa's pre-apartheid government refused to allow participants of colour [113]\n\n\nHost city contract\nThe 1934 British Empire Games, originally awarded in 1930 to

California After moving near Crescent, Oklahoma, they bought a house with five acres of land, where they kept pigs and chickens [31] [32]\n\n\nParents' divorce, move to Wales\nAs a child, Manning was opinionated about the intersection of religion and politics [42] For example, she invariably remained silent during the part of the Pledge of Allegiance that makes reference to God [43] [44]\n\n\nReturn to the U.S.\nAfter completing high school in 2005 at age 17 [41] [58] and fearing her mother was becoming too ill to cope, Manning returned to the U.S [59] [60] She moved in with her father, then living in Oklahoma City with his second wife and her child Manning landed employment as a developer for the software company Zoto She was apparently happy there, but was let go after four months Her boss told The Washington Post that on a few occasions Manning had \"just locked up\" and would simply sit and stare, and in the end, communication became too difficult The boss told the newspaper that \"nobody's been taking care of this kid for a really long time\" [61] [62]\n\n\nMilitary service\nManning's father spent weeks in 2007 asking her to consider joining the Army Hoping to gain a college education through the G.I Bill, and perhaps to study for a PhD in physics, she enlisted in September that year [67] [68] [69] She told her Army supervisor later that she had also hoped joining such a masculine environment would resolve her gender dysphoria [70]\n\n\nEnlisting\nManning's father spent weeks in 2007 asking her to consider joining the Army Hoping to gain a college

masculine environment would resolve her gender dysphoria [70]\n\n\nMove to Fort Drum, deployment to Iraq\nIn August 2008, Manning was sent to Fort Drum in Jefferson County, New York, where she joined the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, and trained for deployment to Iraq [82] In late 2008, while stationed there, she met Tyler Watkins, who was studying neuroscience and psychology at Brandeis University, near Boston Watkins was her first serious relationship, and she posted happily on Facebook about it, regularly traveling 300 miles (480 km) to Boston for visits [83]\n\n\nContact with gender counselor\nIn November 2009, Manning wrote to a gender counselor in the U.S that she felt female and discussed having surgery The counselor told Steve Fishman of New York magazine in 2011 that it was clear Manning was in crisis, partly because of her gender concerns, but also because she opposed the kind of war in which she found herself involved [95]\n\n\nRelease of material to WikiLeaks\nManning said her first contact with WikiLeaks was in January 2010, when she began to interact with them on IRC and Jabber She had first noticed them toward the end of November 2009, when they posted 570,000 pager messages from the September 11 attacks [104] [105]\n\n\nEmail to supervisor, recommended discharge\nOn April 24, 2010, Manning sent an email to her supervisor, Master Sergeant Paul Adkins—with the subject line \"My Problem\"—saying she was suffering from gender identity disorder She attached a photograph of herself dressed as a woman and with the filename breanna.jpg [124] She wrote:\n\n\nPublication of leaked material\nWikiLeaks was set up in late 2006 as a disclosure portal, initially using the Wikipedia model, where volunteers would write up restricted or legally threatened material submitted by whistleblowers Julian Assange—an Australian Internet activist and journalist, and the de facto editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks—had the idea of creating what Ben Laurie called an \"open-source, democratic intelligence agency\" The open-editing aspect was soon abandoned, but the site remained open for anonymous submissions [135]\n\n\nBaghdad airstrike\nWikiLeaks named the Baghdad airstrike video \"Collateral Murder\", and Assange released it on April 5, 2010, during a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C [147] The video showed two U.S helicopters firing on a group of 10 men in the Amin District of Baghdad Among the people killed in the attack were two Reuters employees, who were there to photograph an American Humvee under attack by the Mahdi Army The U.S pilots mistook their cameras for weapons The helicopters also fired on a van, targeted earlier by one helicopter, that had stopped to help wounded members of the first group Two children in the van were wounded, and their father was killed The pilots also attacked a building where retreating insurgents were holed up The Washington Post wrote that the video, viewed by millions, put WikiLeaks on the map According to Nicks, Manning emailed a superior officer after the video aired and tried to persuade her that it was the same version as the one stored on SIPRNet Nicks writes that it seemed as though Manning wanted to be caught [147] [148]\n\n\nAfghan War logs, Iraq War logs\nOn July 25, 2010, WikiLeaks and three media partners—The New York Times, The Guardian, and Der Spiegel—began publishing the 91,731 documents that, in their entirety, became known as the Afghan War Logs (Around 77,000 of these had been published as of May 2012.) This was followed on October 22, 2010, by 391,832 classified military reports covering the period January 2004 to December 2009, which became known as the Iraq War Logs Nicks writes that the publication of the former was a watershed moment, the \"beginning of the information age exploding upon itself\" [149] [150]\n\n\nOther leaks\nManning was also responsible for the \"Cablegate\" leak of 251,287 State Department cables, written by 271 American embassies and consulates in 180 countries, dated December 1966 to February 2010 Assange passed the cables to his three media partners, plus El País and others, and they were published in stages from November 28, 2010, with the names of sources removed WikiLeaks said it was the largest set of confidential documents ever released into the public domain [12] [151] [152] WikiLeaks published the remaining cables, unredacted, on September 1, 2011, after David Leigh and Luke Harding of The Guardian inadvertently published the passphrase for a file that was still online; [153] [154] [155] Nicks writes that an Ethiopian journalist consequently had to leave his country, and the U.S government said it had to relocate several sources [156]\n\n\nManning and Adrian Lamo\nOn May 20, 2010, Manning contacted Adrian Lamo, a former \"grey hat\" hacker convicted in 2004 of having accessed The New York Times's computer network two years earlier without permission Lamo had been profiled that day by Kevin Poulsen in Wired magazine;

The Washington Post, Manning's attendance infuriated the far-left \"What followed,\" The Post reported, \"was an overheated Internet tug-of-war between opposite sides of the political spectrum, each

[44]\n\n\nReturn to the U.S.\nAfter completing high school in 2005 at age 17 [41] [58] and fearing her mother was becoming too ill to cope, Manning returned to the U.S [59] [60] She moved in with her father, then living in Oklahoma City with his second wife and her child Manning landed employment as a developer for the software company Zoto She was apparently happy there, but was let go after four months Her boss told The Washington Post that on a few occasions Manning had \"just locked up\" and would simply sit and stare, and in the end, communication became too difficult The boss told the newspaper that \"nobody's been taking care of this kid for a really long time\" [61] [62]\n\n\nMilitary service\nManning's father spent weeks in 2007 asking her to consider joining the Army Hoping to gain a college education through the G.I Bill, and perhaps to study for a PhD in physics, she enlisted in September that year [67] [68] [69] She told her Army supervisor later that she had also hoped joining such a masculine environment would resolve her gender dysphoria [70]\n\n\nEnlisting\nManning's father spent weeks in 2007 asking her to consider joining the Army Hoping to gain a college education through the G.I Bill, and perhaps to study for a PhD in physics, she enlisted in September that year [67] [68] [69] She told her Army supervisor later that she had also hoped joining such a

the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division, and trained for deployment to Iraq [82] In late 2008, while stationed there, she met Tyler Watkins, who was studying neuroscience and psychology at Brandeis University, near Boston Watkins was her first serious relationship, and she posted happily on Facebook about it, regularly traveling 300 miles (480 km) to Boston for visits [83]\n\n\nContact with gender counselor\nIn November 2009, Manning wrote to a gender counselor in the U.S that she felt female and discussed having surgery The counselor told Steve Fishman of New York magazine in 2011 that it was clear Manning was in crisis, partly because of her gender concerns, but also because she opposed the kind of war in which she found herself involved [95]\n\n\nRelease of material to WikiLeaks\nManning said her first contact with WikiLeaks was in January 2010, when she began to interact with them on IRC and Jabber She had first noticed them toward the end of November 2009, when they posted 570,000 pager messages from the September 11 attacks [104] [105]\n\n\nEmail to supervisor, recommended discharge\nOn April 24, 2010, Manning sent an email to her supervisor, Master Sergeant Paul Adkins—with the subject line \"My Problem\"—saying she was suffering from gender identity disorder She attached a photograph of herself dressed as a woman and with the filename breanna.jpg [124] She wrote:\n\n\nPublication of leaked material\nWikiLeaks was set up in late 2006 as a disclosure portal, initially using the Wikipedia model, where volunteers would write up restricted or legally threatened material submitted by whistleblowers Julian Assange—an Australian Internet activist and journalist, and the de facto editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks—had the idea of creating what Ben Laurie called an \"open-source, democratic intelligence agency\" The open-editing aspect was soon abandoned, but the site remained open for anonymous submissions [135]\n\n\nBaghdad airstrike\nWikiLeaks named the Baghdad airstrike video \"Collateral Murder\", and Assange released it on April 5, 2010, during a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C [147] The video showed two U.S helicopters firing on a group of 10 men in the Amin District of Baghdad Among the people killed in the attack were two Reuters employees, who were there to photograph an American Humvee under attack by the Mahdi Army The U.S pilots mistook their cameras for weapons The helicopters also fired on a van, targeted earlier by one helicopter, that had stopped to help wounded members of the first group Two children in the van were wounded, and their father was killed The pilots also attacked a building where retreating insurgents were holed up The Washington Post wrote that the video, viewed by millions, put WikiLeaks on the map According to Nicks, Manning emailed a superior officer after the video aired and tried to persuade her that it was the same version as the one stored on SIPRNet Nicks writes that it seemed as though Manning wanted to be caught [147] [148]\n\n\nAfghan War logs, Iraq War logs\nOn July 25, 2010, WikiLeaks and three media partners—The New York Times, The Guardian, and Der Spiegel—began publishing the 91,731 documents that, in their entirety, became known as the Afghan War Logs (Around 77,000 of these had been published as of May 2012.) This was followed on October 22, 2010, by 391,832 classified military reports covering the period January 2004 to December 2009, which became known as the Iraq War Logs Nicks writes that the publication of the former was a watershed moment, the \"beginning of the information age exploding upon itself\" [149] [150]\n\n\nOther leaks\nManning was also responsible for the \"Cablegate\" leak of 251,287 State Department cables, written by 271 American embassies and consulates in 180 countries, dated December 1966 to February 2010 Assange passed the cables to his three media partners, plus El País and others, and they were published in stages from November 28, 2010, with the names of sources removed WikiLeaks said it was the largest set of confidential documents ever released into the public domain [12] [151] [152] WikiLeaks published the remaining cables, unredacted, on September 1, 2011, after David Leigh and Luke Harding of The Guardian inadvertently published the passphrase for a file that was still online; [153] [154] [155] Nicks writes that an Ethiopian journalist consequently had to leave his country, and the U.S government said it had to relocate several sources [156]\n\n\nManning and Adrian Lamo\nOn May 20, 2010, Manning contacted Adrian Lamo, a former \"grey hat\" hacker convicted in 2004 of having accessed The New York Times's computer network two years earlier without permission Lamo had been profiled that day by Kevin Poulsen in Wired magazine; the story said Lamo had been involuntarily hospitalized and diagnosed with Asperger syndrome [162] Poulsen, by then a reporter, was himself a former hacker who had used Lamo as a source several times since 2000 [161] In 2002, Poulsen had told The New York Times that Lamo had gained unauthorized access to its network; he then wrote the story up for SecurityFocus Lamo would hack into a system, tell the organization, then offer to fix their security, often using Poulsen as a go-between [163]\n\n\nFirst contact\nOn May 20, 2010, Manning contacted Adrian Lamo, a former \"grey hat\" hacker convicted in 2004 of having accessed The New York Times's computer network two years earlier without permission Lamo had been profiled that day by Kevin Poulsen in Wired magazine; the story said Lamo had been involuntarily hospitalized and diagnosed with Asperger syndrome [162] Poulsen, by then a reporter, was himself a former hacker who had used Lamo as a source several times since 2000 [161] In 2002, Poulsen had told The New York Times that Lamo had gained unauthorized access to its network; he then wrote the story up for SecurityFocus Lamo would hack into a system, tell the organization, then offer to fix their security, often using Poulsen as a go-between [163]\n\n\nChats\nIn a series of chats between May 21 and 25, Manning—using the handle \"bradass87\"—told Lamo that she had leaked classified material She introduced herself as an Army intelligence analyst, and within 17 minutes, without waiting for a reply, alluded to the leaks [126]\n\n\nLamo approaches authorities, chat logs published\nShortly after the first chat with Manning, Lamo discussed the information with Chet Uber of the volunteer group Project Vigilant, which researches cybercrime, and Timothy Webster, a friend who had worked in Army counterintelligence [166] Both advised Lamo to go to the authorities His friend informed the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID), and Lamo was contacted by CID agents shortly thereafter [11] He told them he believed Manning was endangering lives [167] The hacker community largely ostracized him afterward, but Nicks argues that it was thanks to Lamo that the government had months to ameliorate any harm caused by the release of the diplomatic cables [168]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nThe Army's Criminal Investigation Command arrested Manning [171] on May 27, [128] 2010, and four days later transferred her to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait [172] She was charged with several offenses in July, replaced by 22 charges in March 2011, including violations of Articles 92 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and of the Espionage Act The most serious charge was \"aiding the enemy\", a capital offense, although prosecutors said they would not seek the death penalty [173] Another charge, which Manning's defense called a \"made-up offense\" [174] but of which she was found guilty, read that Manning \"wantonly  [caused] to be published on the internet intelligence belonging to the US government, having knowledge that intelligence published on the internet is accessible to the enemy\" [175]\n\n\nArrest and charges\nThe Army's Criminal Investigation Command arrested Manning [171] on May 27, [128] 2010, and four days later transferred her to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait [172] She was charged with several offenses in July, replaced by 22 charges in March 2011, including violations of Articles 92 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and of the Espionage Act The most serious charge was \"aiding the enemy\", a capital offense, although prosecutors said they would not seek the death penalty [173] Another charge, which Manning's defense called a \"made-up offense\" [174] but of which she was found guilty, read that Manning \"wantonly  [caused] to be published on the internet intelligence belonging to the US government, having knowledge that intelligence published on the internet is accessible to the enemy\" [175]\n\n\nDetention\nWhile in Kuwait, Manning was placed on suicide watch after her behavior caused concern [176] She was moved from Kuwait to the Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, on July 29, 2010, and classified as a maximum custody detainee with Prevention of Injury (POI) status POI status is a less extreme form of suicide watch, entailing checks by guards every five minutes Her lawyer, David Coombs, a former military attorney, said Manning was not allowed to sleep between 5 am (7 am on weekends) and 8 pm, and was made to stand or sit up if she tried to She was required to remain visible at all times, including at night, which entailed no access to sheets, no pillow except one built into her mattress, and a blanket designed not to be shredded [177] Manning complained that she regarded it as pretrial punishment [178]\n\n\nEvidence presented at Article 32 hearing\nIn April 2011, a panel of experts, having completed a medical and mental evaluation of Manning, ruled that she was fit to stand trial [189] An Article 32 hearing, presided over by Lieutenant Colonel Paul Almanza, was convened on December 16, 2011, at Fort Meade, Maryland; after the hearing, Almanza recommended that Manning be referred to a general court-martial She was arraigned on February 23, 2012, and declined to enter a plea [190]\n\n\nGuilty plea, trial, sentence\nThe judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, ruled in January 2013 that any sentence would be reduced by 112 days because of the treatment Manning received at Quantico [193] On February 28, Manning pleaded guilty to 10 of the 22 charges [18] Reading for over an hour from a 35-page statement, she said she had leaked the cables \"to show the true cost of war\" Prosecutors pursued a court-martial on the remaining charges [194]\n\n\nRequests for release\nOn September 3, 2013, Manning's lawyer filed a Petition for Commutation of Sentence to President Obama through the pardon attorney at the Department of Justice and Secretary of the Army John M McHugh [203] [204] The petition contended that Manning's disclosures did not cause any \"real damage\", and that the documents in question did not merit protection, as they were not sensitive The request included a supporting letter from Amnesty International which said that Manning's leaks had exposed violations of human rights David Coombs's cover letter touched on Manning's role as a whistleblower, asking that Manning be granted a full pardon or that her sentence be reduced to time served [205] [206]\n\n\nCommutation, release, and appeal\nIn January 2017, a Justice Department source said that Manning was on Obama's short list for a possible commutation [211] On January 17, Obama commuted all but four months of Manning's remaining sentence [8] [212] In a press conference held on January 18, he said that Manning's original 35-year prison sentence was \"very disproportionate relative to what other leakers have received\" and that \"it makes sense to commute—and not pardon—her sentence.\" [212] [213] In 2021, Forbes reported that Obama's commutation of Manning's sentence was \"unconditional\" [214] Notwithstanding her commutation, Manning's military appeal would continue, with her attorney saying, \"We fight in her appeal to clear her name.\" [215]\n\n\n2019 jailing for contempt\nIn February 2019, Manning received a subpoena to testify in a U.S government case proceeding under prosecutors in Virginia against Assange, the existence of which had been accidentally revealed in November 2018 [225] Manning objected to the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings and announced she would refuse to testify, [226] saying: \"we've seen this power abused countless times to target political speech I have nothing to contribute to this case and I resent being forced to endanger myself by participating in this predatory practice.\" [227] She added that she had provided all the information she had in 2013 during her court martial and that she stood by her previous answers [228]\n\n\nReaction to disclosures\nThe publication of the leaked material, particularly the diplomatic cables, attracted in-depth coverage worldwide, with several governments blocking websites that contained embarrassing details Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said: \"I can't think of a time when there was ever a story generated by a news organization where the White House, the Kremlin, Chávez, India, China, everyone in the world was talking about these things .. I've never known a story that created such mayhem that wasn't an event like a war or a terrorist attack.\" [250]\n\n\nAwards and tributes\nIn 2011, the German Section of the International Association of Lawyers against Nuclear Arms and the Federation of German Scientists awarded Manning a \"Whistleblowerpreis\" [262] While still in detention in 2011, Graham Nash of Crosby, Stills and Nash released

acknowledge the name change, the military would continue to regard Manning as a male [3] Manning sought hormone therapy and the right to live as a woman while confined, consistent with her gender dysphoria, which had been confirmed by two Army medical specialists Such treatment is provided in civilian federal prisons when it is found to be medically necessary, but it is not available in military prisons The Pentagon policy at the time considered transgender individuals ineligible to serve [293] [294]\n\n\n2015\nOn February 12, 2015, USA Today reported that the commandant of the USDB wrote in a February 5 memo, \"After carefully considering the recommendation that (hormone treatment) is medically appropriate and necessary, and weighing all associated safety and security risks presented, I approve adding (hormone treatment) to Inmate Manning's treatment plan.\" According to USA Today, Manning remained a soldier, and the decision to administer hormone therapy was a first for the Army [299] Manning was not allowed to grow her hair longer Her ACLU attorney, Chase Strangio, said that the delay in approving her hormone treatment \"came with a significant cost to Chelsea and her mental health\" [300]\n\n\n2016–2018\nOn September 13, 2016, the ACLU announced that the army would be granting Manning's request for gender transition surgery, a first for a transgender inmate

that Manning had joined The Guardian as a contributing opinion writer on war, gender, and freedom of information [320] In 2014, The Guardian had published two op-eds by Manning: \"How to make Isis fall on its own sword\" (September 16) [321] and, \"I am a transgender woman and the government is denying my civil rights\" (December 8) [322] Manning's debut under the new arrangement, \"The CIA's torturers and the leaders who approved their actions must face the law,\" appeared on March 9, 2015 [323]\n\n\nSuicide attempts\nOn July 5, 2016, Manning was taken to a hospital after a suicide attempt [326] [327] [328] On July 28, 2016, the ACLU announced that Manning was under investigation and facing several possible charges related to her suicide attempt [329] She was not allowed to have

indefinitely [331] Manning emerged from solitary confinement on October 12, after serving seven days; she said that she was not given the opportunity to appeal the ruling before being placed in solitary [332]\n\n\nHunger strike\nOn September 9, 2016, Manning began a hunger strike to protest what she described as her being bullied by prison authorities and the U.S government [335] On September 13, the ACLU announced that Manning had ended the five-day hunger strike after the Army agreed to provide gender transition surgery [303] The operation, however, was not performed before her release from prison in May 2017 [311]\n\n\n2017–present\nIn a June 9, 2017, appearance on Good Morning America, her first interview following her release, Manning said she \"accepted responsibility\" for her actions, and thanked former President Obama for giving her \"another chance\" [336] She now earns a living through speaking engagements [24]\n\n\nHarvard visiting fellowship and rescindment\nOn September 13, 2017, Manning was named a visiting fellow at Harvard University Bill Delahunt, acting director of the Harvard Institute of Politics, said: \"Broadening the range and depth of opportunity for students to hear from and engage with experts, leaders and policy-shapers is a cornerstone of the Institute of Politics We welcome the breadth of thought-provoking viewpoints on race, gender, politics and the media.\" [337] Harvard said Manning would visit for a limited number of events meant to spark campus discussion, [338] and in particular would engage students in discourse on \"issues of LGBTQ identity in the military\" [339] According to online newspaper PinkNews, this marked \"the only LGBT-related fellowship in Harvard history\" [340]\n\n\nDenied entry to Canada\nOn September 22, 2017, Manning was denied entry to Canada from the United States because of her criminal record [348] According to a letter from Canadian immigration officials, posted online by Manning, [349] she is inadmissible due to being convicted of offenses equivalent to treason in Canada [348] Manning told Reuters that she had planned to vacation in Montreal and Vancouver, but was stopped at a Quebec border crossing by the Canada Border Services Agency on the evening of September 21 and detained overnight She said she would retain a Canadian lawyer to challenge the inadmissibility finding before a Canadian tribunal [350] In October 2021, appearing virtually at an Immigration and Refugee Board hearing to determine her admissibility, Manning called the four-year process to visit Canada \"exhausting\" When questioned by the adjudicator, Manning did not go into detail about what she leaked because she is bound by a non-disclosure agreement with the U.S government [351] [b] The two-day hearing concluded with the adjudicator indicating a final written decision could be expected in 2022 [354]\n\n\nU.S. Senate candidacy\nOn January 11, 2018, Manning

Freedom\" hosted by far-right social media personality Mike Cernovich at the nightclub FREQ in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan The party was billed, in Cernovich's words, as a \"gathering of patriots and political dissidents who are bored with mainstream political events\", and included right-wing figures such as Gavin McInnes, James O'Keefe, Lucian Wintrich, [361] and Jack Posobiec [362] According to The Washington Post, Manning's attendance infuriated the far-left \"What followed,\" The Post reported, \"was an overheated Internet tug-of-war between opposite sides of the political spectrum, each accusing the other of co-opting Manning, while her intentions were relentlessly picked apart.\" [361] Manning afterward stated that she was acting as a double agent, infiltrating the alt-right to gather information and insight about alt-right rally plans It later emerged that Manning participated with Cassandra Fairbanks (an admirer and writer for the right-wing website The Gateway Pundit), Posobiec, Wintrich, and others in Escape the Room DC, and spent an evening drinking and playing Cards Against Humanity at Wintrich's apartment with him, Fairbanks, and others  Manning repeated her intentions to gain information about the alt-right, but apologised to her supporters who felt betrayed [363]\n\n\nTour of Australia and New Zealand\nIn August 2018, the Government of Australia refused to issue Manning a visa to enter the country, where she was scheduled to make a series of public appearances The company arranging Manning's speaking tour said it would appeal the decision, [364] taken under s501(1) of the Migration Act, which authorizes a minister to refuse a visa on character grounds [365] The Department of Home Affairs specified that Manning did not pass the character test because of her \"substantial criminal record\" [366] On September 2, Manning spoke as scheduled at the Sydney Opera House except that she appeared onscreen live via satellite from Los Angeles [367]\n\n\nREADME.txt Book\n\nIn May 2019, Manning announced that Farrar, Straus & Giroux would publish her memoir She said it would be primarily a personal narrative that would not relitigate the facts of her case [374] The book, titled README.txt, was published in 2022, [375] and it focuses on her early adulthood, career in the U.S Army, and her early gender transition [376] Writer P.E Moskowitz interviewed Manning about the book in which Manning says, \n\nDJ'ing\nPrior to her arrest in 2010, Manning was known to DJ on occasion She has returned to DJing as of August 2022 [378]

Later in the year, Rose burst to worldwide prominence at the 1998 Open Championship held at Royal Birkdale Golf Club. He holed a dramatic shot from the rough from about 50 yards for birdie on the 18th hole to finish in a tie for fourth. This impressive performance earned him the silver medal for the low amateur.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nThe day after his success at the 1998 Open Championship, Rose turned professional. However, he struggled badly in his early career, missing the cut in his first 21 consecutive events, including the European Tour qualifying school in 1998. Despite this, he earned his first European Tour card in 1999 when he finished fourth at the qualifying school. The following season, he failed to retain his card and had to revisit the qualifying school, where he finished ninth.\n\n**PGA Tour**\n\nRose's breakthrough on the PGA Tour came in 2010 when he finished third at the Honda Classic in Florida. However, it was his victory at the Memorial Tournament in Ohio that marked a significant turning point in his career. With a final-round 66, he won the tournament by three strokes over Rickie Fowler, securing his first win on American soil. This victory propelled Rose into the top 50 in the world rankings and marked the beginning of a successful period in his career.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRose married his long-time girlfriend, Kate Phillips, a former international gymnast, in December 2006. The couple has a house in Albany, New Providence, in The Bahamas, and a riverside flat in the London suburb of Putney. In February 2009, Kate gave birth to their first child, a son, and in January 2012, they had a daughter.\n\n**Awards and Honours**\n\nRose has won numerous awards and honors throughout his career. He has won 25 professional tournaments, including 11 PGA Tour events and 11 European Tour events. He has also won two World Golf Championships and has been a member of the European Ryder Cup team since 2006.\n\n**Major Championships**\n\nRose has enjoyed significant success in major championships. He won the U.S. Open in 2013, his first major victory, and has since finished in the top 10 on several occasions. He has also been a runner-up at the Masters and the Open Championship.\n\n**Results Timeline**\n\nRose has had a consistent career, with several notable performances throughout the years.

He was born on 13 August 1952 in Trivandrum, Kerala, into a family of modest means. His father, Pothan, was a businessman who owned a small business and was a member of the Kolathinkal house, a prominent family in the region. Pothen's early life and career were marked by tragedy when his father passed away in 1967, leaving him to care for his younger siblings.\n\n**Early Life and Career**\n\nPothen was born in Trivandrum, Kerala, on 13 August 1952. His family was of modest means, and his father worked as a businessman. Pothen had five siblings, including an elder brother, Hari Pothan, who would later work as a film producer. Pothen's early life was marked by tragedy when his father passed away in 1967, at the age of 15. This event had a profound impact on Pothen's life and career, as he was forced to take on the responsibility of caring for his younger siblings. Despite the challenges he faced, Pothen showed a keen interest in the arts and was particularly drawn to the world of theater.\n\nPothen's early exposure to theater came through his involvement with The Madras Players, a renowned theater group based in Chennai. He was part of the group for several years, honing his acting skills and learning the craft of theater. During this time, he also had the opportunity to work with some of the finest actors and directors in the industry. His experience with The Madras Players would later prove to be a valuable learning experience that would shape his approach to acting in film.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nPothen's personal life was marked by two marriages. His first marriage was to actress Radhika in 1985, but the couple's union was short-lived, and they separated in 1986. Pothen's second marriage was to Amala Sathyanath in 1990, with whom he had a daughter, Keya. Through his marriages and relationships, Pothen was able to find support and companionship, which played a crucial role in his personal and professional growth.\n\nPothen's relationship with his family was also an important aspect of his life. He was close to his siblings, particularly his elder brother, Hari, who worked as a film producer. The two brothers would often collaborate on film projects, sharing their expertise and experience. Pothen's family played a significant role in his life, and he was grateful for their love and support.\n\n**Film Career**\n\nPothen's film career began with his debut in the 1979 film \"Aaravam,\" directed by Bharathan. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Pothen's performance earned him recognition in the industry. He went on to work with some of the finest directors in Malayalam cinema, including Bharathan, Padmarajan, and Joshiy. Pothen's performances in films such as \"Aaravam,\" \"Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal,\" and \"Nakshathratharangam\" showcased his versatility and range as an actor.\n\nPothen's collaboration with Bharathan was particularly significant, as the two artists worked together on several films, including \"Aaravam\" and \"Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal.\" Their partnership resulted in some of the most memorable performances of Pothen's career. Pothen's work with Bharathan was marked by a deep understanding and respect for each other's craft, which resulted in some of the most nuanced and powerful performances of their careers.\n\n**Death**\n\nPothen was found dead in his apartment in Kilpauk, Chennai, on 15 July 2022. The cause of his death was believed to be natural causes. Pothen's passing was met with shock and sadness from the film industry and his fans. He was remembered as a talented actor, director, and producer who left an indelible mark on Malayalam cinema.\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\nPothen received numerous awards and nominations throughout his career. Some of his notable awards include:\n\n* Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor for his performance in \"Aaravam\"\n* Kerala State Film Award for Best Director for his work on \"Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal\"\n* Filmfare Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance in \"Nakshathratharangam\"\n\n**Filmography**\n\nAs Actor:\n\n* Aaravam (1979)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1981)\n* Nakshathratharangam (1982)\n* Ayalonde Aanakkal (1985)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1986)\n* Narmada (1990)\n* Namukku Parkkan Munthiri Thoppukal (1990)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1992)\n* Naranathu Thampuran (1993)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1995)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1997)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1999)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2001)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2003)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2005)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2007)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2009)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2011)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2013)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2015)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2017)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2019)\n\nAs Director:\n\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1981)\n* Nakshathratharangam (1982)\n* Ayalonde Aanakkal (1985)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1986)\n* Narmada (1990)\n* Namukku Parkkan Munthiri Thoppukal (1990)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1992)\n* Naranathu Thampuran (1993)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1995)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1997)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1999)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2001)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2003)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2005)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2007)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2009)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2011)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2013)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2015)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2017)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2019)\n\nAs Writer:\n\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1981)\n* Nakshathratharangam (1982)\n* Ayalonde Aanakkal (1985)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1986)\n* Narmada (1990)\n* Namukku Parkkan Munthiri Thoppukal (1990)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1992)\n* Naranathu Thampuran (1993)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1995)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1997)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1999)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2001)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2003)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2005)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2007)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2009)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2011)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2013)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2015)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2017)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2019)\n\n**Television**\n\nPothen appeared in several television serials and films, including:\n\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1990)\n* Nakshathratharangam (1992)\n* Ayalonde Aanakkal (1995)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1997)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (1999)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2001)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2003)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2005)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2007)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2009)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2011)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2013)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2015)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2017)\n* Oru Vadakkan Veeragadhakal (2019)\n\n**References**\n\n* Pothen, P.

{"title": "Surfside_condominium_collapse", "content": "\nBackground\nThe residential condominium building, Champlain Towers South, was located at 8777 Collins Avenue (Florida State Road A1A) in the town of Surfside, just north of Miami Beach, Florida [18] Champlain Towers South (completed in 1981) was part of a three-building complex along with Champlain Towers North (completed in 1982), and Champlain Towers East (built between the North and South buildings in 1994) [19] All three were L-shaped structures with 12 stories, but as of 2021, the South building contained the most units at 136 [8] including a rooftop penthouse, varying in size from 1,200 to 4,500 sq ft (110 to 420 m2) and from one to four bedrooms [20] The penthouse was a controversial part of Champlain Towers South's design, as an exemption was needed to exceed Surfside's height limit [21] The penthouses were also not part of the original building permits [22]\n\n\nCollapse\nThe pool deck of Champlain Towers South suddenly suffered a partial collapse at about 1:14 a.m, followed by the progressive collapse of the central section and eastern wing of the building at 1:22 a.m EDT [a] on June 24, 2021 [26] [27] [28] The collapse of the building lasted less than 12 seconds [29] Surveillance video footage indicates that a large north-central section of the building abruptly collapsed first This isolated and destabilized part of the northeast corner of the building, which also collapsed approximately nine seconds later [30] [31] Of the 136 units in the building, [32] at least half were destroyed [33]\n\n\nCasualties\nThe collapse killed 98 people, and an unborn baby [9]\n\n\nRescue and relief operations\nOn June 24, more than 80 rescue units responded to the collapse, according to the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department [51] Surfside mayor Charles Burkett said in a news conference that ten people were treated at the scene, one person was dead, and two people were hospitalized [52] Both hospitalized victims – a mother and her daughter – survived with serious injuries, having fallen from the ninth floor to the fifth floor They were pulled from the rubble by Miami Dade Fire-Rescue Aerial 19; it was originally erroneously reported by CBS 4 that the mother rescued herself [53] Her husband did not survive [54] Their family cat was later found wandering near the collapsed building [55] At least 35 people were rescued on June 24 [12] and up to 159 were unaccounted for [28] [56] A woman's voice was heard until around 11:00 a.m., but rescuers were unable to reach her [57] [58] [59] Miami-Dade County mayor Daniella Levine Cava signed a state of emergency declaration at 4:33 p.m on June 24 [60] and called on Florida governor Ron DeSantis to do so at the state level [61] Governor DeSantis viewed the site on the same day, [62] and issued a state of emergency [63] The White House and Federal Emergency Management Agency stated that they were in contact with local officials and providing assistance [64] President Joe Biden was briefed on the event, and spoke with Miami-Dade County mayor Levine Cava [65] [66]\n\n\nSubsequent recovery operation\nOn July 9, the death toll rose to 79 after workers found an additional 15 victims [134] Binx, a cat who lived with the Gonzalez family on the ninth floor, was found alive The survival of the cat gave relatives hope for additional human survivors [135] [55] Seven more victims were found the following day, bringing the death toll to 86 43 people remained missing [136]\n\n\nResponse\nOn June 25, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) assigned a team of scientists and engineers to investigate the collapse and, on June 30, it launched a full technical investigation that will take years to complete [148] [149] On the following day, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava ordered an immediate audit of all high-rise buildings in Miami-Dade County older than 40 years and taller than five stories, and all those built by the developer of the Champlain Towers condominium complex, to be completed within the next 30 days [84] The editorial board of the Miami Herald called for a grand jury investigation of the collapse Miami-Dade County state attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told the board, \"Historically, this is the sort of thing grand jurors look at.\" [150] The audit led to the immediate closure and evacuation of Crestview Towers, a 156-unit condominium building at North Miami Beach (7 mi (11 km) away from Champlain Towers South), following the submission of a report dated January 2021 but not received by the city until July 2, which determined the structure was unsafe electrically and structurally [151] [152] It also led to the closure of the historic Miami-Dade County Courthouse on July 9 after an engineer reported \"safety concerns with various floors\"; staff members were directed to work remotely [153] [154]\n\n\nAftermath\nIn what was termed a show of respect for victims and their families, the City of Miami Beach canceled its annual Fire on the Fourth festival, which was scheduled to be held blocks away at 72nd Street and Collins Avenue at the North Beach Bandshell Other Independence Day events were canceled in the metro Miami area, both to show respect to those affected by the collapse and to avoid worsening an already bad traffic situation because of road closures and detours associated with rescue efforts in Surfside [160]\n\n\nRemoval of debris\nSome of the structural elements from the rubble were transported to a warehouse at an undisclosed location for analysis and testing Additional debris, including concrete, personal belongings, and damaged cars from the parking garage, was transported to an empty field near the interchange of Interstate 95 and Florida's Turnpike (SR 91), approximately 10 miles (16 km) from the building collapse [161]\n\n\nRedevelopment\nBy July 7, with the emergency response only just transitioning from rescue to recovery, discussions were already underway about the future use of the site [162] Some called for it to become a memorial park rather than be redeveloped for housing [163] On July 14, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Michael Hanzman approved the sale of the property to developers, on the condition that proceeds be used to benefit the victims and their families [164]\n\n\nLegal action\nOn June 24, 2021, the same day as the accident, a lawsuit was filed in Miami Dade Circuit Court by a resident of the building against the Champlain Towers South Condominium Association, seeking $5 million in damages \"due to defendant's acts and omissions and their failure to properly protect the lives and property of plaintiff and class members\" [168]\n\n\nPossible causes\nA 2018 inspection performed by the engineering firm Morabito Consultants pointed out a \"major error\" in the construction of the pool deck, whereby the waterproofing layer was not sloped Rainwater that collected on the waterproofing therefore remained until it could evaporate Over the years, the concrete slabs below the pool deck had been severely damaged by this water The report noted the waterproofing below the pool deck was beyond its useful life and needed to be completely removed and replaced The firm wrote that \"failure to replace waterproofing in the near future will cause the extent of the concrete deterioration to expand exponentially\", and that the repair would be \"extremely expensive\" The ceiling slabs of the parking garage, which sat below the pool deck, showed several sizable cracks and cases of exposed reinforcing bar or rebar from spalling [23]\n\n\nSaltwater corrosion of rebar\nA 2018 inspection performed by the engineering firm Morabito Consultants pointed out a \"major error\" in the construction of the pool deck, whereby the waterproofing layer was not sloped Rainwater that collected on the waterproofing therefore remained until it could evaporate Over the

40-year-old Champlain Towers South building in Surfside, Florida, partially collapsed, resulting in the deaths of 98 people and injuring several others. The collapse was one of the deadliest building collapses in the United States in recent history.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Champlain Towers South condominium building was located at 8777 Collins Avenue in the town of Surfside, just north of Miami Beach, Florida. The building was part of a three-building complex along with Champlain Towers North and Champlain Towers East. The South building was the largest of the three, with 136 units, including a rooftop penthouse that was a subject of controversy due to its height and design.\n\nThe building was completed in 1981, and its design and construction had raised concerns over the years. In 2018, an engineering firm, Morabito Consultants, performed an inspection and noted a \"major error\" in the construction of the pool deck, which had caused significant damage to the concrete slabs below. The report warned that failure to replace the waterproofing in the near future would cause the extent of the concrete deterioration to expand exponentially.\n\n**Collapse**\n\nThe pool deck of the Champlain Towers South building suddenly suffered a partial collapse at about 1:14 a.m, followed by the progressive collapse of the central section and eastern wing of the building at 1:22 a.m EDT on June 24, 2021. The collapse of the building lasted less than 12 seconds. Surveillance video footage indicates that a large north-central section of the building abruptly collapsed first, isolating and destabilizing the part of the northeast corner of the building, which also collapsed approximately nine seconds later.\n\nOf the 136 units in the building, at least half were destroyed. The collapse killed 98 people, including an unborn baby.\n\n**Rescue and Relief Operations**\n\nOn June 24, more than 80 rescue units responded to the collapse, according to the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department. Surfside mayor Charles Burkett said in a news conference that ten people were treated at the scene, one person was dead, and two people were hospitalized. Both hospitalized victims – a mother and her daughter – survived with serious injuries, having fallen from the ninth floor to the fifth floor. They were pulled from the rubble by Miami Dade Fire-Rescue Aerial 19.\n\nAt least 35 people were rescued on June 24, and up to 159 were unaccounted for. A woman's voice was heard until around 11:00 a.m, but rescuers were unable to reach her. Miami-Dade County mayor Daniella Levine Cava signed a state of emergency declaration at 4:33 p.m on June 24, and called on Florida governor Ron DeSantis to do so at the state level. Governor DeSantis viewed the site on the same day and issued a state of emergency.\n\nThe White House and Federal Emergency Management Agency stated that they were in contact with local officials and providing assistance. President Joe Biden was briefed on the event, and spoke with Miami-Dade County mayor Levine Cava.\n\n**Subsequent Recovery Operation**\n\nOn July 9, the death toll rose to 79 after workers found an additional 15 victims. Binx, a cat who lived with the Gonzalez family on the ninth floor, was found alive. The survival of the cat gave relatives hope for additional human survivors.\n\nSeven more victims were found the following day, bringing the death toll to 86. 43 people remained missing.\n\n**Response**\n\nOn June 25, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) assigned a team of scientists and engineers to investigate the collapse and, on June 30, it launched a full technical investigation that will take years to complete. On the following day, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava ordered an immediate audit of all high-rise buildings in Miami-Dade County older than 40 years and taller than five stories, and all those built by the developer of the Champlain Towers condominium complex, to be completed within the next 30 days.\n\nThe audit led to the immediate closure and evacuation of Crestview Towers, a 156-unit condominium building at North Miami Beach, following the submission of a report dated January 2021 but not received by the city until July 2, which determined the structure was unsafe electrically and structurally.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nIn what was termed a show of respect for victims and their families, the City of Miami Beach canceled its annual Fire on the Fourth festival, which was scheduled to be held blocks away at 72nd Street and Collins Avenue at the North Beach Bandshell. Other Independence Day events were canceled in the metro Miami area, both to show respect to those affected by the collapse and to avoid worsening an already bad traffic situation because of road closures and detours associated with rescue efforts in Surfside.\n\nSome of the structural elements from the rubble were transported to a warehouse at an undisclosed location for analysis and testing. Additional debris, including concrete, personal belongings, and damaged cars from the parking garage, was transported to an empty field near the interchange of Interstate 95 and Florida's Turnpike (SR 91), approximately 10 miles from the building collapse.\n\n**Redevelopment**\n\nBy July 7, with the emergency response only just transitioning from rescue to recovery, discussions were already underway about the future use of the site. Some called for it to become a memorial park rather than be redeveloped for housing. On July 14, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Michael Hanzman approved the sale of the property to developers, on the condition that proceeds be used to benefit the victims and their families.\n\n**Legal Action**\n\nOn June 24, 2021, the same day as the accident, a lawsuit was filed in Miami Dade Circuit Court by a resident of the building against the Champlain Towers South Condominium Association, seeking $5 million in damages \"due to defendant's acts and omissions and their failure to properly protect the lives and property of plaintiff and class members.\"\n\n**Possible Causes**\n\nA 2018 inspection performed by the engineering firm Morabito Consultants pointed out a \"major error\" in the construction of the pool deck, whereby the waterproofing layer was not sloped. Rainwater that collected on the waterproofing therefore remained until it could evaporate. Over the years, the concrete slabs below the pool deck had been severely damaged by this water. The report noted the waterproofing below the pool deck was beyond its useful life and needed to be completely removed and replaced.\n\nThe firm wrote that \"failure to replace waterproofing in the near future will cause the extent of the concrete deterioration to expand exponentially,\" and that the repair would be \"extremely expensive.\" The ceiling slabs of the parking garage, which sat below the pool deck, showed several sizable cracks and cases of exposed reinforcing bar or rebar from spalling.\n\n**Subsidence**\n\nDistinct from possible construction defects, an analysis of European Remote-Sensing Satellite data by Florida International University indicates that the building had been sinking during the 1990s at a significant rate of about two mm per year.

It has led to a renewed focus on building safety and inspection. The collapse has also led to changes in building codes and regulations in Florida.\n\nThe Florida Legislature passed condo reform legislation in a May 2022 special session as Senate Bill 4-D, addressing issues highlighted in the aftermath of the Surfside collapse.

in 1982), and Champlain Towers East (built between the North and South buildings in 1994) [19] All three were L-shaped structures with 12 stories, but as of 2021, the South building contained the most units at 136 [8] including a rooftop penthouse, varying in size from 1,200 to 4,500 sq ft (110 to 420 m2) and from one to four bedrooms [20] The penthouse was a controversial part of Champlain Towers South's design, as an exemption was needed to exceed Surfside's height limit [21] The penthouses were also not part of the original building permits [22]\n\n\nCollapse\nThe pool deck of Champlain Towers South suddenly suffered a partial collapse at about 1:14 a.m, followed by the progressive collapse of the central section and eastern wing of the building at 1:22 a.m EDT [a] on June 24, 2021

[52] Both hospitalized victims – a mother and her daughter – survived with serious injuries, having fallen from the ninth floor to the fifth floor They were pulled from the rubble by Miami Dade Fire-Rescue Aerial 19; it was originally erroneously reported by CBS 4 that the mother rescued herself [53] Her husband did not survive [54] Their family cat was later found wandering near the collapsed building [55] At least 35 people were rescued on June 24 [12] and up to 159 were unaccounted for [28] [56] A woman's voice was heard until around 11:00 a.m., but rescuers were unable to

jury investigation of the collapse Miami-Dade County state attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told the board, \"Historically, this is the sort of thing grand jurors look at.\" [150] The audit led to the immediate closure and evacuation of Crestview Towers, a 156-unit condominium building at North Miami Beach (7 mi (11 km) away from Champlain Towers South), following the submission of a report dated January 2021 but not received by the city until July 2, which determined the structure was unsafe electrically and structurally [151] [152] It also led to the closure of the historic Miami-Dade

parents and her siblings settled in Saint-Cloud in 1923 [51] Settled in a house adjoining that of Princess Marie Bonaparte, [51] the family depended for seven years on her generosity, [52] [53] [54] and two other aunts of Sophie: first Princess Anastasia [55] [56] and then Lady Louis Mountbatten [57] [58] Marie Bonaparte financed the studies of her nieces and nephew, [59] while Lady Mountbatten gained the habit of offering her nieces her \"used\" clothes [60] In fact, Sophie's parents had little income and the children were the regular witnesses to their money problems and their difficulty in maintaining a household [61]\n\n\nYoung adulthood\nIn 1927, Sophie met one of her distant cousins, Prince Philipp of Hesse-Kassel Shortly after, she met two of his brothers, the twins Christoph and Richard of Hesse-Kassel [70] at the manor of Hemmelmark, the home of her great-aunt Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine [71] Despite her being 13 years their junior, the two German princes soon

1930, [92] Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia, son of Kaiser Wilhelm II, introduced his cousin Christoph to the politician Hermann Göring, [93] and it did not take long for the two to form a closer relationship [N 1] [92] Under the influence of Göring, the prince and his wife then met Adolf Hitler, who deceived them with his charm and his apparent modesty [94] Under these conditions, Christoph joined the Nazi Party, first secretly in 1931, and then publicly in 1933 [95] He also joined the SS in February 1932 [96] [97] However, in his family, Christoph was not an exceptional case His older brother Philipp had become a member of the Nazi Party in 1930 [98] Subsequently, their respective twins, Princes Wolfgang and Richard of Hesse-Kassel, joined the party in 1932 [99] Finally, their parents, Frederick Charles, Landgrave of Hesse and Princess Margaret, followed the example of their sons in May 1938 [100]\n\n\nSecond World War and the death of Prince Christoph\nAs a means of protection, Christoph warned Sophie about the need to beware of prying ears and never to speak politics with people other than her sisters and cousins [124] Even though he probably moved away from the SS from 1934, the prince nonetheless remained a staunch supporter of the Nazi regime [125] When Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, he spontaneously enlisted in the Luftwaffe, [126] while retaining his post as director of the Forschungsamt [127] Sophie and her four children then left Berlin to settle in Friedrichshof, near her husband's parents the Landgrave and the Landgravine of

Germany and its occupation by the Allies affected the lives of Sophie and those close to her The United States Army entered Kronberg on 29 March 1945 and Friedrichshof was then partially occupied [158] Before the arrival of the US Army, the Hesse-Kassels removed compromising documents, such as books of a political nature from their library [103] They also hid some of their belongings, especially family gems and jewels [159] This precaution was not unnecessary since the American troops engaged in numerous thefts in the castle Many objects were stolen there, [160] and its cellars were looted while the estate's peacocks were killed and roasted in front of their owners [103]\n\n\nOccupation of Friedrichshof\nThe defeat of Germany and its occupation by the Allies affected the

Brunswick, and brother of Frederica, Queen of the Hellenes Encouraged by Princess Margaret of Hesse and by Rhine, their romance ended in an engagement, which was celebrated in January 1946 [167] [169] As the House of Hanover was related to the British royal family, George William's father had previously sought permission from King George VI to proceed with the engagement However, with the UK and Germany still at war, the UK government banned the monarch from responding to it, except in an informal capacity [170]\n\n\nPhilip's marriage\nSince 1939, Sophie's brother Prince Philip had been linked to Princess Elizabeth of the United Kingdom [182] [183] [184] Already in love, the two were unofficially engaged at Balmoral in 1946, [185] [186] [187] and shortly after, Philip adopted British nationality [188] [189] [190] The couple's engagement was announced officially on 10 July 1947, and preparations for the wedding began immediately thereafter [191] [192] [193] However, the ties of Philip's family to Germany frightened the British court and government, who feared that the public could be reminded of the Germanic origins of the House of Windsor if the royal family were publicly associated with former Nazi Party members [194] [195] [196] [197]\n\n\nReturn to normal life\nWith George William having completed his law studies at the University of Göttingen in 1948, [166] [203] he was approached by his brother-in-law, Berthold, Margrave of Baden, to take over the management of the Salem Castle School, which had since been closed due to the Second World War [204] A former student of the institution, the prince then went to Scotland with his wife to meet with Kurt Hahn, the founder of the school, and to visit Gordonstoun, the establishment that the latter founded when he had to flee Nazi Germany because of his Jewish origins [205] For Sophie, who was very affected by the way she was treated at the time of her brother's wedding, this trip to the United Kingdom was

their brother-in-law, King Paul of Greece, and to his family Queen Frederica thus came to consider Sophie as her best friend [213] As a result, the princess and her husband were regularly welcomed at the Greek Court, [214] and the couple was among the many personalities invited by the Greek sovereign to the \"Cruise of the Kings\" in 1954 [215] Sophie and her family were also invited to Athens on the occasion of the wedding of Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark and Juan Carlos, Prince of Asturias in 1962 [216] They were also present at the wedding of King Constantine II of Greece and Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark in 1964 [217]\n\n\nFamily losses\nIn 1958, Sophie and George William bought a large chalet located in Schliersee, Bavaria Well integrated with the local population, the couple led a relatively simple and discreet life in the village When she was not taking care of her children, Sophie would devote herself to gardening, reading and listening to music while her husband went about his professional tasks [225] In the same years, the elder children of the princess formed their own families Princess Christina was the first of Sophie's eight children to marry, in 1956 [226] Princess Dorothea married Prince Friedrich of Windisch-Graetz at Schliersee in March 1959 [227]\n\n\nFinal years\nIn 1988, Sophie had the satisfaction of making her mother's last wishes come true by transferring her remains to the Church of Mary Magdalene, on the Mount of Olives, in Jerusalem [235] A few years later, in 1993, the Yad Vashem Memorial honored Princess Alice as \"Righteous Among the Nations\" for supporting a Jewish family during the Second World War [236] Sophie and Philip, her last surviving children since Margarita's death in 1981, [237] were invited to the Israeli capital in 1994, for a ceremony in honor of their mother [238] [239] [240] [241] As the Spanish historian Ricardo Mateos Sainz de Medrano pointed out, there was a certain irony here, considering Sophie's past links to the Nazi regime [240]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nPrince Karl of Hesse briefly discusses his mother's childhood and her ties to the Nazi regime in a documentary about his uncle, Prince Philip: The Plot to Make a King (2015) [94] In the same documentary, it is mentioned that Princess Sophie is the author of an as of yet unpublished memoir [94]\n\n\nDocumentaries\nPrince Karl
