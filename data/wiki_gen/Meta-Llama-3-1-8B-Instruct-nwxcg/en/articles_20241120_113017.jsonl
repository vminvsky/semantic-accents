{"title": "MIM-104_Patriot", "content": "\nIntroduction\nPrior to the Patriot, Raytheon was involved in a number of surface to air missile programs, including FABMDS (Field Army Ballistic Missile Defense System), AADS-70 (Army Air-Defense System – 1970) and SAM-D (Surface-to-Air Missile – Development) [11] In 1975, the SAM-D missile successfully engaged a drone at the White Sands Missile Range In 1976, it was renamed the PATRIOT Air Defense Missile System The MIM-104 (Mobile Interceptor Missile 104) Patriot combined several new technologies, including the MPQ-53 passive electronically scanned array radar and track-via-missile guidance.\n\n\nPatriot equipment\nThe Patriot system has four major operational functions: communications, command and control, radar surveillance, and missile guidance The four functions combine to provide a coordinated, secure, integrated, mobile air defense system.\n\n\nAN/MPQ-53, -65 and -65A Radar Set\nThe AN/MPQ-53/65 Radar Set is a passive electronically scanned array radar equipped with IFF, electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM), and track-via-missile (TVM) guidance subsystems.\nThe AN/MPQ-53 Radar Set supports PAC-2 units, while the AN/MPQ-65 Radar Set supports PAC-2 and PAC-3 units The main difference between these two radars is the addition of a second travelling wave tube (TWT), which gives the −65 radar increased search, detection, and tracking capability The radar antenna array consists of over 5,000 elements that \"deflect\" the radar beam many times per second.\n\n\nAN/MSQ-104 and -132 Engagement Control Station\nThe AN/MSQ-104 or AN/MSQ-132 Engagement Control Station (ECS) is the nerve center of the Patriot firing battery, costing approximately US$6 million per unit [19] [unreliable source?] The ECS consists of a shelter mounted on the bed of an M927 5-Ton Cargo Truck or on the bed of a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV) cargo truck The main subcomponents of the ECS are the Weapons Control Computer (WCC), the Data Link Terminal (DLT), the UHF communications array, the Routing Logic Radio Interface Unit (RLRIU), and the two-person stations that serve as the system's human machine interface The ECS is air conditioned, pressurized (to resist chemical/biological attack), and shielded against electromagnetic pulse (EMP) or other such electromagnetic interference The ECS also contains several SINCGARS radios to facilitate voice communications.\n\n\nOE-349 Antenna Mast Group\nThe OE-349 Antenna Mast Group (AMG) is mounted on an M927 5-Ton Cargo Truck It includes four 4 kW antennas in two pairs on remotely controlled masts Emplacement of the AMG can have no greater than a 0.5-degree roll and a 10-degree crossroll The antennas can be controlled in azimuth, and the masts can be elevated up to 100 feet 11 inches (30.76 m) above ground level Mounted at the base of each pair of antennas are two high-power amplifiers associated with the antennas and the radios in the co-located shelter.\n\n\nEPP-III Electric Power Plant\nThe EPP-III Diesel-Electric Power Plant (EPP) is the power source for the ECS and Radar The EPP consists of two 150 kilowatt diesel engines with 400 hertz, 3-phase generators that are interconnected through the power distribution unit The generators are mounted on a trailer or modified M977 HEMTT Each EPP has two 100-US-gallon (380 L) fuel

cables stored in reels alongside the generators It powers the AMG via a cable routed through the ECS.\n\n\nM901/902/903 Launching Station\nThe M90x Launching Stations are remotely operated, self-contained units The ECS controls operation of the launchers through each launcher's DLT, via fiber optic or VHF (SINCGARS) data link.\n\n\nPatriot guided missile\nThe first fielded variant was the MIM-104A \"Standard\" It was optimized solely for engagements against aircraft and had very limited capability against ballistic missiles It had a range of 70 km (43 mi), and a speed in excess of Mach 2 The MIM-104B \"anti-standoff jammer\" (ASOJ) is a missile designed to seek out and destroy ECM emitters.\n\n\nPatriot missile design\nThe PAC-2 family of missiles all have a fairly standard design, the only differences between the variants being certain internal components They consist of (from front to rear) the radome, guidance section, warhead section, propulsion section, and control actuator section.\n\n\nVariants\nPatriot was first introduced with a single missile type: the MIM-104A This was the initial \"Standard\" missile, still known as \"Standard\" today In Patriot's early days, the system was used exclusively as an anti-aircraft weapon, with no capability against ballistic missiles This was remedied during the late 1980s when Patriot received its first major system overhaul with the introduction of the Patriot Advanced Capability missile and concurrent system upgrades.\n\n\nMIM-104A\nPatriot was first introduced with a single missile type: the MIM-104A This was

This was remedied during the late 1980s when Patriot received its first major system overhaul with the introduction of the Patriot Advanced Capability missile and concurrent system upgrades.\n\n\nMIM-104B (PAC-1)\nPatriot Advanced Capability (PAC-1), known today as the PAC-1 upgrade, was a software-only upgrade The most significant aspects of this upgrade were changing the way the radar searched and the way the system defended its assets Instead of searching low to the horizon, the top of the radar's search angle was lifted to near vertical (89 degrees) from the previous angle of 25 degrees This was done as a counter to the steep parabolic trajectory of inbound ballistic missiles The search beams of the radar were tightened, and while in \"TBM search mode\" the \"flash,\" or the speed at which these beams were shot out, was increased significantly.\n\n\nMIM-104C (PAC-2)\nDuring the late 1980s, tests began to indicate that, although Patriot was certainly capable of intercepting inbound ballistic missiles, it was questionable whether the MIM-104A/B missile was capable of destroying them reliably This necessitated the introduction of the PAC-2 missile and system upgrade.\n\n\nMIM-104D (PAC-2/GEM)\nThere were more upgrades to PAC-2 systems throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, mostly centering on software The PAC-2 missiles were modified significantly—four separate variants became known collectively as guidance enhanced missiles (GEM).\n\n\nMIM-104E (PAC-2/GEM+)\nJust prior to OIF, it was decided to further upgrade the GEM and PAC-2 missiles This upgrade program produced missiles known as the GEM-T and the GEM-C, the \"T\" designator referring to tactical ballistic missiles, and the \"C\" designator referring to cruise missiles These missiles were both given a totally new nose section, which was designed specifically to be more effective against low altitude, low RCS targets like cruise missiles The GEM-T was given a new fuze which was further optimized against ballistic missiles and a new low noise oscillator which increases the seeker's sensitivity to low radar cross-section targets The GEM-C is the upgraded version of the GEM, and the GEM-T is the upgraded version of the PAC-2 The GEM+ entered service in November 2002 [28]\n\n\nMIM-104F (PAC-3)\nThe PAC-3 upgrade is a significant upgrade to nearly every aspect of the system It took place in three stages deployed in 1995, 1996 and 2000, and units were designated Configuration 1, 2, or 3.\n\n\nPAC-3 MSE\nLockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control is the prime contractor on the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement upgrade (MSE) to the Patriot air defense system which will make the missile more agile and extend its range by up to 50% [39] [40]\n\n\nSkyCeptor (PAAC-4)\nIn August 2013, Raytheon and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems announced plans for Patriot Advanced Affordable Capability-4 (PAAC-4), which would integrate the Stunner interceptor from the jointly-funded David's Sling program with Patriot PAC-3 radars, launchers, and engagement control stations The two-stage, multimode seeking Stunner would replace single-stage, radar-guided PAC-3 missiles produced by Lockheed Martin, providing improved operational performance at 20 percent of the $2 million unit cost of PAC-3 missiles [57] Israeli program officials have said that a previous teaming agreement between Raytheon and Rafael would allow the U.S company to assume prime contractor status, and produce at least 60 percent of the Stunner missile in the United States [57]\n\n\nUpgrades\nPAC-3 system upgrades continue under the International Engineering Services Program (IESP) which includes all countries that rely on the Patriot for integrated air and missile defense - as of 2022, the United States of America, The Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Taiwan, Greece, Spain, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Romania, Sweden, Poland, Bahrain, and Switzerland [62]\n\n\nPatriot battalion\nIn the U.S Army, the Patriot System is designed around the battalion echelon A Patriot battalion consists of a headquarters battery, which includes the Patriot ICC and its operators, a maintenance company, and between four and six \"line batteries,\" which are the actual launching batteries that employ the Patriot systems Each line battery consists of (nominally) six launchers [citation needed] and three or four platoons: Fire Control platoon, Launcher platoon, and a Headquarters/Maintenance platoon - either a single platoon or separated into two separate units, at the battery commander's discretion.\n\n\nOperation\nFollowing is the process a PAC-2 firing battery uses to engage a single target (an aircraft) with a single

Patriot was assigned to shoot down incoming Iraqi Scud or Al Hussein short range ballistic missiles launched at Israel and Saudi Arabia The first combat use of Patriot occurred January 18, 1991, when it engaged what was later found to be a computer glitch [81] There were actually no Scuds fired at Saudi Arabia on January 18 [82] This incident was widely misreported as the first successful interception of an enemy ballistic missile in history.\n\n\nPersian Gulf War (1991)\nPrior to the First Gulf War, ballistic missile defense was an unproven concept in war During Operation Desert Storm, in addition to its anti-aircraft mission, the Patriot was assigned to shoot down incoming Iraqi Scud or Al Hussein short range ballistic missiles launched at Israel and Saudi Arabia The first combat use of Patriot occurred January 18, 1991, when it engaged what was later found to be a computer glitch [81] There were actually no Scuds fired at Saudi Arabia on January 18 [82] This incident was widely misreported as the first successful interception of an enemy ballistic missile in history.\n\n\nTrial by fire\nPrior to the First Gulf War, ballistic missile defense was an unproven concept in war During Operation Desert Storm, in addition to its anti-aircraft mission, the Patriot was assigned to shoot down incoming Iraqi Scud or Al Hussein short range ballistic missiles launched at Israel and Saudi Arabia The first combat use of Patriot occurred January 18, 1991, when it engaged what was later found to be a computer glitch [81] There were actually no Scuds fired at Saudi Arabia on January 18 [82] This incident was widely misreported as the first successful interception of an enemy ballistic missile in history.\n\n\nFailure at Dhahran\nOn February 25, 1991, an Iraqi Al Hussein Scud missile hit the barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 28 soldiers from the U.S Army's 14th Quartermaster Detachment [86]\n\n\nSuccess rate vs. accuracy\nOn February 15, 1991, President George H W Bush traveled to Raytheon's Patriot manufacturing plant in Andover, Massachusetts, during the Gulf War He declared, the \"Patriot is 41 for 42: 42 Scuds engaged, 41 intercepted!\" [92] The President's claimed success rate was over 97% at that point in the war.\n\n\nUS-led invasion of Iraq (2003)\nPatriot was deployed to Iraq a second time in 2003, this time to provide air and missile defense for the forces conducting Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) Patriot PAC-3, GEM, and GEM+ missiles both had a very high success rate, intercepting Al-Samoud 2 and Ababil-100 tactical ballistic missiles [44] No longer-range ballistic missiles were fired during that conflict The systems were stationed in Kuwait and Iraq, and successfully destroyed a number of hostile surface-to-surface missiles using the new PAC-3 and guidance enhanced missiles [98] [99]\n\n\nPost-2003 service in Iraq\nA US Army Patriot battery in Erbil, Iraq shot down at least one Iranian ballistic missile during the 2024 Iranian strikes in Israel [103]\n\n\nService with Israel\nThe Israeli Air Defense Command operates MIM-104D Patriot (PAC-2/GEM+) batteries with Israeli upgrades The Israel Defense Forces' designation for the Patriot weapon system is \"Yahalom\" (Hebrew: יהלום, diamond) Israel plans to mothball all systems by mid 2024 [104]\n\n\nOperation Protective Edge (2014)\nDuring Operation Protective Edge, Patriot batteries of the Israeli Air Defense Command intercepted and destroyed two unmanned aerial vehicles launched by Hamas [106] [107] The interception of a Hamas drone in July 2014, was the first time in the history of the Patriot system's use that it successfully intercepted an enemy aircraft [108]\n\n\nSyrian civil war (2014–)\nIn Israeli service in the Syrian civil war, Patriot has primarily been active in drone and air defense, rather than a missile defense capacity In August 2014, a Syrian unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down by an Israeli Air Defense Command MIM-104D Patriot missile near Quneitra, after it had penetrated the airspace over the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights [10] In September 2014, a Syrian Air Force Sukhoi Su-24 was shot down in similar circumstances [10] [109] Since 2014, Israeli Patriots have missed several Syrian drones, including two misses in July 2016 [110] and another in June 2018; [111] as well as several successful shootdowns against Syrian drones in April 2017 [112] July 11 and July 13, 2018, [113] [114] as well as against a Hezbollah intelligence drone attempting to infiltrate Israel in September 2017 through the Golan [115] On July 24, 2018, an Israeli Patriot missile shot down a Syrian Sukhoi Su-22 fighter which had crossed into Israeli airspace [116]\n\n\nService with Saudi Arabia\nPatriot has continued to see usage in Saudi Arabia against Houthi missile attacks In June 2015, a Patriot battery was used to shoot down a Scud missile, fired at Saudi Arabia by Houthi rebels in response to the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen [117] Another Scud was fired at an electricity station in Jizan Province and intercepted by a Saudi Patriot in August 2015 [118] Saudi Arabia claims that another long-range ballistic missile was fired toward Mecca and intercepted by a Saudi Patriot in October 2016 [119] Houthi sources said that the missile's intended target was the air force base in King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, 65 km (40 miles) north-west of Mecca [120] In March 2018, another missile, apparently fired from Yemen, was intercepted by a Patriot missile over Riyadh [121] Videos showed one interceptor exploded just after launch and another did a \"U turn\" midair toward Riyadh [122] [123] During the Abqaiq–Khurais attack in September 2019, the six battalions of Patriot missile defense systems owned by Saudi Arabia failed to protect its oil facilities from attacks by multiple drones and suspected cruise missiles [124] The United States removed two of its four Patriot antimissile batteries securing oil fields in Saudi Arabia in May 2020, following an easing of tensions with Iran They were to be replaced by Saudi's own Patriot batteries [125] In February 2021, a Patriot battery intercepted a ballistic missile over Riyadh that was fired by Houthis as a Formula E race was held on the outskirts of the city in Diriyah, attended by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman [126]\n\n\nService with the United Arab Emirates\nAccording to Brigadier General Murad Turaiq, the commander of some of the Yemeni forces allied to the Saudi-led coalition currently fighting in Yemen, Patriot air defense systems deployed to Yemen by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have successfully intercepted two ballistic missiles fired by Houthi forces General Turaiq told the Abu Dhabi-based The National newspaper on November 14, 2015, that the first missile was shot down late the previous day in the Al-Gofainah area and a second was intercepted before it hit the building hosting the control centre for forces operating in Marib and Al-Baydah provinces Airbus Defence and Space satellite imagery obtained by IHS Jane's showed two Patriot fire units, each with two launchers, deployed at the Safir airstrip in Marib province on October 1 [127]\n\n\nTalisman Sabre Exercise\nIn July 2021, the US Army used a battery of Patriot missiles in the Exercise Talisman Saber in the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in Queensland, Australia [128] The US Army test fired Patriot PAC-2 interceptor missiles and successfully intercepted target drones [129]\n\n\nService with Eastern Europe\nRussia's 2014 invasion of Crimea led to a \"sales burst\" for the Patriot system, with Romania, Poland, and Sweden signing onto the system between the start of the invasion and the wider invasion of Ukraine in 2022 [5] In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, on 9 March 2022, the U.S European Command announced that it would send two Patriot air defense systems to Poland to \"proactively counter any potential threat to U.S and Allied forces and NATO territory\" [130] Poland asked Germany to transfer the Patriots to Ukraine Germany declined [131] On 19 December, Ukraine President Zelenskyy talked about negotiating personally with US President Biden over a potential transfer of Patriot missile systems He said they offer \"a (better) distance, radius of reflection, protection\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that this was the most difficult diplomatic issue they had faced [132] One day later, the Biden administration announced it would be delivering another $1.85 billion in aid to Ukraine that would include a Patriot battery [133] During a meeting with Zelenskyy in front of the press at the White House on December 21, Biden confirmed that the United States would send a Patriot battery to Ukraine, noting that it would take \"months\" to train the \"dozens\" of soldiers needed to operate the system, probably in Germany [134] [135] [136] Providing a Patriot missile system is seen as a symbol of Western engagement in the conflict, although its range is only local [135] [137]\n\n\nPatriot sales and contributions to Poland and Ukraine\nRussia's 2014 invasion of Crimea led to a \"sales burst\" for the Patriot system, with Romania, Poland, and Sweden signing onto the system between the start of the invasion and the wider invasion of Ukraine in 2022 [5] In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, on 9 March 2022, the U.S European Command announced that it would send two Patriot air defense systems to Poland to

[136] Providing a Patriot missile system is seen as a symbol of Western engagement in the conflict, although its range is only local [135] [137]\n\n\nPatriot operations in the Russo-Ukrainian War\nPatriot has had a successful track record in Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War, successfully intercepting a wide range of Russian weaponry and aircraft [5] It has shot down Russian aircraft like Su-34 fighters flying nearly 100 miles away, and intercepted missiles as far as 130 miles away, according to defense NGO reports [5] During October 2023, under a program called \"FrankenSAM\" Western and Soviet air defence technologies are being combined in Ukraine One of three programs involves a Ukrainian radar guiding a Patriot missile It has been tested and is expected to be operational by winter [146]\n\n\nAircraft interceptions - May 2023\nOn May 13, 2023, a Patriot battery was allegedly used to destroy at least four (possibly five) aircraft belonging to a Russian strike package over Bryansk Oblast, Russia [147] Visually confirmed losses included a Su-34, Su-35, and two Mil Mi-8 helicopters [148] On 19 May, U.S defense officials and congressional staffers told CNN that a Patriot system had been used by the Ukrainian army to shoot down at least one Russian jet a few weeks before [149] The spokesman of the Ukrainian Air Force later confirmed the shoot down of a Russian Su-34, Su-35, two Mi-8MTPR EW helicopters, and an Mi-8 transport helicopter by the Patriot system [150]\n\n\nMissile defense\nDuring a night time attack on the Kyiv region on May 4, 2023, Ukraine air defense claimed a hypersonic Kh-47M2 Kinzhal ballistic missile was shot down by a Patriot missile defence system [5] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] Yurii Ihnat, the spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, initially denied the claim of interception, [157] but on May 6 it was finally confirmed by Commander of the UAF Mykola Oleschuk [153] [154] Prior to this interception, intercepting a Kinzhal missile was only a \"theoretical\" capability [158] Unnamed US officials claimed the missile was aimed at the Patriot system which intercepted it, and that the Ukrainians fired multiple Patriot missiles at different angles to intercept the Kinzhal missile [159] A Pentagon spokesman later confirmed that Ukraine downed the Kinzhal missile [160]\n\n\nLosses\nOn March 9, 2024, video footage emerged showing the destruction of an Armed Forces of Ukraine convoy that allegedly contained at least two M901 Patriot missile launchers near the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast The convoy was reportedly struck by a Russian Iskander-M ballistic missile The Armed Forces of Ukraine has not commented on the video [174] [175] [176] [177] [178]\n\n\nDemands on Patriot systems\nIncluding the United States, 18 countries operate Patriot missile systems Outside the US, only Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries appears to build Patriot missiles, under licence from various US companies This has led to a demand on the US Army Patriot batteries are the most deployed units in the US Army by early 2021 Some units have had a 6-month deployment extended up to 15 months [5] [180] [181] [182] The missile is currently being used in active service in Saudi Arabia [183] In active use by the IDF in the \"southern Negev desert\" [184] The Patriot missile batteries are also seeing active service in Ukraine, where there are three batteries in service [185] To refill US stockpiles, Japan has modified its export rules to allow export of missiles to the United States Previously only specific components could be exported now entire missiles can be exported They cannot be sent directly to Ukraine, however they can backfill US stockpiles [181] Recent withdrawal of the missiles from the Middle East were done to help deal with a potential crisis in the Pacific [182] Likewise Germany has withdrawn its three Patriot units from Poland

surface-to-air missile system that has been in service with various countries since the 1980s. Developed by Raytheon, the Patriot system is designed to provide a mobile and integrated air defense system that can engage a variety of targets, including aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. The Patriot system has undergone several upgrades and modifications over the years, including the introduction of new radar and missile technologies.\n\n**Patriot Equipment**\n\nThe Patriot system has four major operational functions: communications, command and control, radar surveillance, and missile guidance. The four functions combine to provide a coordinated, secure, integrated, mobile air defense system.\n\n### AN/MPQ-53, -65 and -65A Radar Set\n\nThe AN/MPQ-53/65 Radar Set is a passive electronically scanned array radar equipped with IFF, electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM), and track-via-missile (TVM) guidance subsystems. The AN/MPQ-53 Radar Set supports PAC-2 units, while the AN/MPQ-65 Radar Set supports PAC-2 and PAC-3 units. The main difference between these two radars is the addition of a second traveling wave tube (TWT), which gives the −65 radar increased search, detection, and tracking capability. The radar antenna array consists of over 5,000 elements that \"deflect\" the radar beam many times per second.\n\n### AN/MSQ-104 and -132 Engagement Control Station\n\nThe AN/MSQ-104 or AN/MSQ-132 Engagement Control Station (ECS) is the nerve center of the Patriot firing battery, costing approximately US$6 million per unit. The ECS consists of a shelter mounted on the bed of an M927 5-Ton Cargo Truck or on the bed of a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV) cargo truck. The main subcomponents of the ECS are the Weapons Control Computer (WCC), the Data Link Terminal (DLT), the UHF communications array, the Routing Logic Radio Interface Unit (RLRIU), and the two-person stations that serve as the system's human machine interface. The ECS is air conditioned, pressurized (to resist chemical/biological attack), and shielded against electromagnetic pulse (EMP) or other such electromagnetic interference. The ECS also contains several SINCGARS radios to facilitate voice communications.\n\n### OE-349 Antenna Mast Group\n\nThe OE-349 Antenna Mast Group (AMG) is mounted on an M927 5-Ton Cargo Truck. It includes four 4 kW antennas in two pairs on remotely controlled masts. Emplacement of the AMG can have no greater than a 0.5-degree roll and a 10-degree crossroll. The antennas can be controlled in azimuth, and the masts can be elevated up to 100 feet 11 inches (30.76 m) above ground level. Mounted at the base of each pair of antennas are two high-power amplifiers associated with the antennas and the radios in the co-located shelter.\n\n### EPP-III Electric Power Plant\n\nThe EPP-III Diesel-Electric Power Plant (EPP) is the power source for the ECS and Radar. The EPP consists of two 150 kilowatt diesel engines with 400 hertz, 3-phase generators that are interconnected through the power distribution unit. The generators are mounted on a trailer or modified M977 HEMTT. Each EPP has two 100-US-gallon (380 L) fuel tanks and a fuel distribution assembly with grounding equipment. Each diesel engine can operate for more than eight hours with a full fuel tank. The EPP delivers its power to the Radar and ECS through cables stored in reels alongside the generators. It powers the AMG via a cable routed through the ECS.\n\n### M901/902/903 Launching Station\n\nThe M90x Launching Stations are remotely operated, self-contained units. The ECS controls operation of the launchers through each launcher's DLT, via fiber optic or VHF (SINCGARS) data link.\n\n**Patriot Guided Missile**\n\nThe first fielded variant was the MIM-104A \"Standard\" It was optimized solely for engagements against aircraft and had very limited capability against ballistic missiles. It had a range of 70 km (43 mi), and a speed in excess of Mach 2.

It took place in three stages deployed in 1995, 1996, and 2000, and units were designated Configuration 1, 2, or 3.\n\n**PAC-3 MSE**\n\nLockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control is the prime contractor on the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement upgrade (MSE) to the Patriot air defense system. This upgrade will make the missile more agile and extend its range by up to 50%.\n\n**SkyCeptor (PAAC-4)**\n\nIn August 2013, Raytheon and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems announced plans for Patriot Advanced Affordable Capability-4 (PAAC-4), which would integrate the Stunner interceptor from the jointly-funded David's Sling program with Patriot PAC-3 radars, launchers, and engagement control stations.

As of 2022, the United States of America, The Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Taiwan, Greece, Spain, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Romania, Sweden, Poland, Bahrain, and Switzerland have all contributed to the program.\n\n**Patriot Battalion**\n\nIn the U.S Army, the Patriot System is designed around the battalion echelon. A Patriot battalion consists of a headquarters battery, which includes the Patriot ICC and its operators, a maintenance company, and between four and six \"line batteries,\" which are the actual launching batteries that employ the Patriot systems. Each line battery consists of (nominally) six launchers and three or four platoons: Fire Control platoon, Launcher platoon, and a Headquarters/Maintenance platoon - either a single platoon or separated into two separate units, at the battery commander's discretion.\n\n**Operation**\n\nFollowing is the process a PAC-2 firing battery uses to engage a single target (an aircraft) with a single missile:\n\n### Engaging a Single Aircraft\n\n1. The ECS receives a target designation from the UHF communications array, via the Routing Logic Radio Interface Unit (RLRIU).\n2. The Weapons Control Computer (WCC) processes the target designation and generates a firing solution.\n3. The Data Link Terminal (DLT) transmits the firing solution to the Launcher.\n4. The Launcher receives the firing solution and positions the missile in the launcher.\n5. The Launcher releases the missile, and the missile begins its ascent.\n6. The missile reaches its maximum altitude and begins its descent towards the target.\n7. The missile impacts the target, destroying it.\n\n### Engaging a Ballistic Missile\n\nFollowing is the process a PAC-3 firing battery uses to engage a single tactical ballistic missile with two PAC-3 missiles:\n\n1. The ECS receives a target designation from the UHF communications array, via the Routing Logic Radio Interface Unit (RLRIU).\n2. The Weapons Control Computer (WCC) processes the target designation and generates a firing solution.\n3. The Data Link Terminal (DLT) transmits the firing solution to the Launcher.\n4. The Launcher receives the firing solution and positions the first missile in the launcher.\n5. The Launcher releases the first missile, and the missile begins its ascent.\n6. The missile reaches its maximum altitude and begins its descent towards the target.\n7. The first missile destroys the warhead of the ballistic missile.\n8. The second missile is released and follows the first missile into the target.\n9. The second missile destroys the remaining components of the ballistic missile.\n\n**Operational History**\n\nPrior to the First Gulf War, ballistic missile defense was an unproven concept in war. During Operation Desert Storm, in addition to its anti-aircraft mission, the Patriot was assigned to shoot down incoming Iraqi Scud or Al Hussein short range ballistic missiles launched at Israel and Saudi Arabia. The first combat use of Patriot occurred January 18, 1991, when it engaged what was later found to be a computer glitch. There were actually no Scuds fired at Saudi Arabia on January 18. This incident was widely misreported as the first successful interception of an enemy ballistic missile in history.\n\n### Persian Gulf War (1991)\n\nPrior to the First Gulf War, ballistic missile defense was an unproven concept in war.

This incident was widely misreported as the first successful interception of an enemy ballistic missile in history.\n\n### Failure at Dhahran\n\nOn February 25, 1991, an Iraqi Al Hussein Scud missile hit the barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 28 soldiers from the U.S Army's 14th Quartermaster Detachment.\n\n### Success Rate vs. Accuracy\n\nOn February 15, 1991, President George H W Bush traveled to Raytheon's Patriot manufacturing plant in Andover, Massachusetts, during the Gulf War. He declared, the \"Patriot is 41 for 42: 42 Scuds engaged, 41 intercepted!\" The President's claimed success rate was over 97% at that point in the war.\n\n**US-led Invasion of Iraq (2003)**\n\nPatriot was deployed to Iraq a second time in 2003, this time to provide air and missile defense for the forces conducting Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Patriot PAC-3, GEM, and GEM+ missiles both had a very high success rate, intercepting Al-Samoud 2 and Ababil-100 tactical ballistic missiles. No longer-range ballistic missiles were fired during that conflict. The systems were stationed in Kuwait and Iraq, and successfully destroyed a number of hostile surface-to-surface missiles using the new PAC-3 and guidance enhanced missiles.\n\n**Post-2003 Service in Iraq**\n\nA US Army Patriot battery in Erbil, Iraq shot down at least one Iranian ballistic missile during the 2024 Iranian strikes in Israel.\n\n**Service with Israel**\n\nThe Israeli Air Defense Command operates MIM-104D Patriot (PAC-2/GEM+) batteries with Israeli upgrades. Israel plans to mothball all systems by mid 2024.\n\n**Operation Protective Edge (2014)**\n\nDuring Operation Protective Edge, Patriot batteries of the Israeli Air Defense Command intercepted and destroyed two unmanned aerial vehicles launched by Hamas. The interception of a Hamas drone in July 2014, was the first time in the history of the Patriot system's use that it successfully intercepted an enemy aircraft.\n\n**Syrian Civil War (2014–)**\n\nIn Israeli service in the Syrian civil war, Patriot has primarily been active in drone and air defense, rather than a missile defense capacity. In August 2014, a Syrian unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down by an Israeli Air Defense Command MIM-104D Patriot missile near Quneitra, after it had penetrated the airspace over the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. In September 2014, a Syrian Air Force Sukhoi Su-24 was shot down in similar circumstances.\n\n**Service with Saudi Arabia**\n\nPatriot has continued to see usage in Saudi Arabia against Houthi missile attacks. In June 2015, a Patriot battery was used to shoot down a Scud missile, fired at Saudi Arabia by Houthi rebels in response to the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. Another Scud was fired at an electricity station in Jizan Province and intercepted by a Saudi Patriot in August 2015. Saudi Arabia claims that another long-range ballistic missile was fired toward Mecca and intercepted by a Saudi Patriot in October 2016.\n\n**Service with the United Arab Emirates**\n\nAccording to Brigadier General Murad Turaiq, the commander of some of the Yemeni forces allied to the Saudi-led coalition currently fighting in Yemen, Patriot air defense systems deployed to Yemen by the UAE have successfully intercepted two ballistic missiles fired by Houthi forces.\n\n**Talisman Sabre Exercise**\n\nIn July 2021, the US Army used a battery of Patriot missiles in the Exercise Talisman Saber in the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in Queensland, Australia. The US Army test fired Patriot PAC-2 interceptor missiles and successfully intercepted target drones.\n\n**Service with Eastern Europe**\n\nRussia's 2014 invasion of Crimea led to a \"sales burst\" for the Patriot system, with Romania, Poland, and Sweden signing onto the system between the start of the invasion and the wider invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, on 9 March 2022, the US European Command announced that it would send two Patriot air defense systems to Poland to \"proactively counter any potential threat to US and Allied forces and NATO territory.\" Poland asked Germany to transfer the Patriots to Ukraine, but Germany declined. On 19 December, Ukraine President Zelenskyy talked about negotiating personally with US President Biden over a potential transfer of Patriot missile systems. One day later, the Biden administration announced it would be delivering another $1.85 billion in aid to Ukraine that would include a Patriot battery. During a meeting with Zelenskyy in front of the press at the White House on December 21, Biden confirmed that the United States would send a Patriot battery to Ukraine, noting that it would take \"months\" to train the \"dozens\" of soldiers needed to operate the system.\n\n**Patriot Operations in the Russo-Ukrainian War**\n\nPatriot has had a successful track record in Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War, successfully intercepting a wide range of Russian weaponry and aircraft. It has shot down Russian aircraft like Su-34 fighters flying nearly 100 miles away, and intercepted missiles as far as 130 miles away, according to defense NGO reports. During October 2023, under a program called \"FrankenSAM\" Western and Soviet air defence technologies are being combined in Ukraine. One of three programs involves a Ukrainian radar guiding a Patriot missile. It has been tested and is expected to be operational by winter.\n\n**Aircraft Interceptions - May 2023**\n\nOn May 13, 2023, a Patriot battery was allegedly used to destroy at least four (possibly five) aircraft belonging to a Russian strike package over Bryansk Oblast, Russia. Visually confirmed losses included a Su-34, Su-35, and two Mil Mi-8 helicopters. On 19 May, US defense officials and congressional staffers told CNN that a Patriot system had been used by the Ukrainian army to shoot down at least one Russian jet a few weeks before. The spokesman of the Ukrainian Air Force later confirmed the shoot down of a Russian Su-34, Su-35, two Mi-8MTPR EW helicopters, and an Mi-8 transport helicopter by the Patriot system.\n\n**Missile Defense**\n\nDuring a night time attack on the Kyiv region on May 4, 2023, Ukraine air defense claimed a hypersonic Kh", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"MIM-104_Patriot\" following this outline:\n\n\nIntroduction\nPrior to the Patriot, Raytheon was involved in a number of surface to air missile programs, including FABMDS (Field Army Ballistic Missile Defense System), AADS-70 (Army Air-Defense System – 1970) and SAM-D (Surface-to-Air Missile – Development) [11] In 1975, the SAM-D missile successfully engaged a drone at the White Sands Missile Range In 1976, it was renamed the PATRIOT Air Defense Missile System The MIM-104 (Mobile Interceptor Missile 104) Patriot combined several new technologies, including the MPQ-53 passive electronically scanned array radar and track-via-missile guidance.\n\n\nPatriot equipment\nThe Patriot system has four major operational functions: communications, command and control, radar surveillance, and missile guidance The four functions combine to provide a coordinated, secure, integrated, mobile air defense system.\n\n\nAN/MPQ-53, -65 and -65A Radar Set\nThe AN/MPQ-53/65 Radar Set is a passive electronically scanned array radar equipped with IFF, electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM), and track-via-missile (TVM) guidance subsystems.\nThe AN/MPQ-53 Radar Set supports PAC-2 units, while the AN/MPQ-65 Radar Set supports PAC-2 and PAC-3 units The main difference between these two radars is the addition of a second travelling wave tube (TWT), which gives the −65 radar increased search, detection, and tracking capability The radar antenna array consists of over 5,000 elements that \"deflect\" the radar beam many times per second.\n\n\nAN/MSQ-104 and -132 Engagement Control Station\nThe AN/MSQ-104 or AN/MSQ-132 Engagement Control Station (ECS) is the nerve center of the Patriot firing battery, costing approximately US$6 million per unit [19] [unreliable source?] The ECS consists of a shelter mounted on the bed of an M927 5-Ton Cargo Truck or on the bed of a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV) cargo truck The main subcomponents of the ECS are the Weapons Control Computer (WCC), the Data Link Terminal (DLT), the UHF communications array, the Routing Logic Radio Interface Unit (RLRIU), and the two-person stations that serve as the system's human machine interface The ECS is air conditioned, pressurized (to resist chemical/biological attack), and shielded against electromagnetic pulse (EMP) or other such electromagnetic interference The ECS also contains several SINCGARS radios to facilitate voice communications.\n\n\nOE-349 Antenna Mast Group\nThe OE-349 Antenna Mast Group (AMG) is mounted on an M927 5-Ton Cargo Truck It includes four 4 kW antennas in two pairs on remotely controlled masts Emplacement of the AMG can have no greater than a 0.5-degree roll and a 10-degree crossroll The antennas can be controlled in azimuth, and the masts can be elevated up to 100 feet 11 inches (30.76 m) above ground level Mounted at the base of each pair of antennas are two high-power amplifiers associated with the antennas and the radios in the co-located shelter.\n\n\nEPP-III Electric Power Plant\nThe EPP-III Diesel-Electric Power Plant (EPP) is the power source for the ECS and Radar The EPP consists of two 150 kilowatt diesel engines with 400 hertz, 3-phase generators that are interconnected through the power distribution unit The generators are mounted on a trailer or modified M977 HEMTT Each EPP has two 100-US-gallon (380 L) fuel tanks and a fuel distribution assembly with grounding equipment Each diesel engine can operate for more than eight hours with a full fuel tank The EPP delivers its power to the Radar and ECS through cables stored in reels alongside the generators It powers the AMG via a cable routed through the ECS.\n\n\nM901/902/903 Launching Station\nThe M90x Launching Stations are remotely operated, self-contained units The ECS controls operation of the launchers through each launcher's DLT, via fiber optic or VHF (SINCGARS) data link.\n\n\nPatriot guided missile\nThe first fielded variant was the MIM-104A \"Standard\" It was optimized solely for engagements against aircraft and had very limited capability against ballistic missiles It had a range of 70 km (43 mi), and a speed in excess of Mach 2 The MIM-104B \"anti-standoff jammer\" (ASOJ) is a missile designed to seek out and destroy ECM emitters.\n\n\nPatriot missile design\nThe PAC-2 family of missiles all have a fairly standard design, the only differences between the variants being certain internal components They consist of (from front to rear) the radome, guidance section, warhead section, propulsion section, and control actuator section.\n\n\nVariants\nPatriot was first introduced with a single missile type: the MIM-104A This was the initial \"Standard\" missile, still known as \"Standard\" today In Patriot's early days, the system was used exclusively as an anti-aircraft weapon, with no capability against ballistic missiles This was remedied during the late 1980s when Patriot received its first major system overhaul with the introduction of the Patriot Advanced Capability missile and concurrent system upgrades.\n\n\nMIM-104A\nPatriot was first introduced with a single missile type: the MIM-104A This was the initial \"Standard\" missile, still known as \"Standard\" today In Patriot's early days, the system was used exclusively as an anti-aircraft weapon, with no capability against ballistic missiles This was remedied during the late 1980s when Patriot received its first major system overhaul with the introduction of the Patriot Advanced Capability missile and concurrent system upgrades.\n\n\nMIM-104B (PAC-1)\nPatriot Advanced Capability (PAC-1), known today as the PAC-1 upgrade, was a software-only upgrade The most significant aspects of this upgrade were changing the way the radar searched and the way the system defended its assets Instead of searching low to the horizon, the top of the radar's search angle was lifted to near vertical (89 degrees) from the previous angle of 25 degrees This was done as a counter to the steep parabolic trajectory of inbound ballistic missiles The search beams of the radar were tightened, and while in \"TBM search mode\" the \"flash,\" or the speed at which these beams were shot out, was increased significantly.\n\n\nMIM-104C (PAC-2)\nDuring the late 1980s, tests began to indicate that, although Patriot was certainly capable of intercepting inbound ballistic missiles, it was questionable whether the MIM-104A/B missile was capable of destroying them reliably This necessitated the introduction of the PAC-2 missile and system upgrade.\n\n\nMIM-104D (PAC-2/GEM)\nThere were more upgrades to PAC-2 systems throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, mostly centering on software The PAC-2 missiles were modified significantly—four separate variants became known collectively as guidance enhanced missiles (GEM).\n\n\nMIM-104E (PAC-2/GEM+)\nJust prior to OIF, it was decided to further upgrade the GEM and PAC-2 missiles This upgrade program produced missiles known as the GEM-T and the GEM-C, the \"T\" designator referring to tactical ballistic missiles, and the \"C\" designator referring to cruise missiles These missiles were both given a totally new nose section, which was designed specifically to be more effective against low altitude, low RCS targets like cruise missiles The GEM-T was given a new fuze which was further optimized against ballistic missiles and a new low noise oscillator which increases the seeker's sensitivity to low radar cross-section targets The GEM-C is the upgraded version of the GEM, and the GEM-T is the upgraded version of the PAC-2 The GEM+ entered service in November 2002 [28]\n\n\nMIM-104F (PAC-3)\nThe PAC-3 upgrade is a significant upgrade to nearly every aspect of the system It took place in three stages deployed in 1995, 1996 and 2000, and units were designated Configuration 1, 2, or 3.\n\n\nPAC-3 MSE\nLockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control is the prime contractor on the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement upgrade (MSE) to the Patriot air defense system which will make the missile more agile and extend its range by up to 50% [39] [40]\n\n\nSkyCeptor (PAAC-4)\nIn August 2013, Raytheon and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems announced plans for Patriot Advanced Affordable Capability-4 (PAAC-4), which would integrate the Stunner interceptor from the jointly-funded David's Sling program with Patriot PAC-3 radars, launchers, and engagement control stations The two-stage, multimode seeking Stunner would replace single-stage, radar-guided PAC-3 missiles produced by Lockheed Martin, providing improved operational performance at 20 percent of the $2 million unit cost of PAC-3 missiles [57] Israeli program officials have said that a previous teaming agreement between Raytheon and Rafael would allow the U.S company to assume prime contractor status, and produce at least 60 percent of the Stunner missile in the United States [57]\n\n\nUpgrades\nPAC-3 system upgrades continue under the International Engineering Services Program (IESP) which includes all countries that rely on the Patriot for integrated air and missile defense - as of 2022, the United States of America, The Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Taiwan, Greece, Spain, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Romania, Sweden, Poland, Bahrain, and Switzerland [62]\n\n\nPatriot battalion\nIn the U.S Army, the Patriot System is designed around the battalion echelon A Patriot battalion consists of a headquarters battery, which includes the Patriot ICC and its operators, a maintenance company, and between four and six \"line batteries,\" which are the actual launching batteries that employ the Patriot systems Each line battery consists of (nominally) six launchers [citation needed] and three or four platoons: Fire Control platoon, Launcher platoon, and a Headquarters/Maintenance platoon - either a single platoon or separated into two separate units, at the battery commander's discretion.\n\n\nOperation\nFollowing is the process a PAC-2 firing battery uses to engage a single target (an aircraft) with a single

Israel and Saudi Arabia The first combat use of Patriot occurred January 18, 1991, when it engaged what was later found to be a computer glitch [81] There were actually no Scuds fired at Saudi Arabia on January 18 [82] This incident was widely misreported as the first successful interception of an enemy ballistic missile in history.\n\n\nFailure at Dhahran\nOn February 25, 1991, an Iraqi Al Hussein Scud missile hit the barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 28 soldiers from the U.S Army's 14th Quartermaster Detachment [86]\n\n\nSuccess rate vs. accuracy\nOn February 15, 1991, President George H W Bush traveled to Raytheon's Patriot manufacturing plant in Andover, Massachusetts, during the Gulf War He declared, the \"Patriot is 41 for 42: 42 Scuds engaged, 41 intercepted!\" [92] The President's claimed success rate was over 97% at that point in the war.\n\n\nUS-led invasion of Iraq (2003)\nPatriot was deployed to Iraq a second time in 2003, this time to provide air and missile defense for the forces conducting Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) Patriot PAC-3, GEM, and GEM+ missiles both had a very high success rate, intercepting Al-Samoud 2 and Ababil-100 tactical ballistic missiles [44] No longer-range ballistic missiles were fired during that conflict The systems were stationed in Kuwait and Iraq, and successfully destroyed a number of hostile surface-to-surface missiles using the new PAC-3 and guidance enhanced missiles [98] [99]\n\n\nPost-2003 service in Iraq\nA US Army Patriot battery in Erbil, Iraq shot down at least one Iranian ballistic missile during the 2024 Iranian strikes in Israel [103]\n\n\nService with Israel\nThe Israeli Air Defense Command operates MIM-104D Patriot (PAC-2/GEM+) batteries with Israeli upgrades The Israel Defense Forces' designation for the Patriot weapon system is \"Yahalom\" (Hebrew: יהלום, diamond) Israel plans to mothball all systems by mid 2024 [104]\n\n\nOperation Protective Edge (2014)\nDuring Operation Protective Edge, Patriot batteries of the Israeli Air Defense Command intercepted and destroyed two unmanned aerial vehicles launched by Hamas [106] [107] The interception of a Hamas drone in July 2014, was the first time in the history of the Patriot system's use that it successfully intercepted an enemy aircraft [108]\n\n\nSyrian civil war (2014–)\nIn Israeli service in the Syrian civil war, Patriot has primarily been active in drone and air defense, rather than a missile defense capacity In August 2014, a Syrian unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down by an Israeli Air Defense Command MIM-104D Patriot missile near Quneitra, after it had penetrated the airspace over the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights [10] In September 2014, a Syrian Air Force Sukhoi Su-24 was shot down in similar circumstances [10] [109] Since 2014, Israeli Patriots have missed several Syrian drones, including two misses in July 2016 [110] and another in June 2018; [111] as well as several successful shootdowns against Syrian drones in April 2017 [112] July 11 and July 13, 2018, [113] [114] as well as against a Hezbollah intelligence drone attempting to infiltrate Israel in September 2017 through the Golan [115] On July 24, 2018, an Israeli Patriot missile shot down a Syrian Sukhoi Su-22 fighter which had crossed into Israeli airspace [116]\n\n\nService with Saudi Arabia\nPatriot has continued to see usage in Saudi Arabia against Houthi missile attacks In June 2015, a Patriot battery was used to shoot down a Scud missile, fired at Saudi Arabia by Houthi rebels in response to the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen [117] Another Scud was fired at an electricity station in Jizan Province and intercepted by a Saudi Patriot in August 2015 [118] Saudi Arabia claims that another long-range ballistic missile was fired toward Mecca and intercepted by a Saudi Patriot in October 2016 [119] Houthi sources said that the missile's intended target was the air force base in King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, 65 km (40 miles) north-west of Mecca [120] In March 2018, another missile, apparently fired from Yemen, was intercepted by a Patriot missile over Riyadh [121] Videos showed one interceptor exploded just after launch and another did a \"U turn\" midair toward Riyadh [122] [123] During the Abqaiq–Khurais attack in September 2019, the six battalions of Patriot missile defense systems owned by Saudi Arabia failed to protect its oil facilities from attacks by multiple drones and suspected cruise missiles [124] The United States removed two of its four Patriot antimissile batteries securing oil fields in Saudi Arabia in May 2020, following an easing of tensions with Iran They were to be replaced by Saudi's own Patriot batteries [125] In February 2021, a Patriot battery intercepted a ballistic missile over Riyadh that was fired by Houthis as a Formula E race was held on the outskirts of the city in Diriyah, attended by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman [126]\n\n\nService with the United Arab Emirates\nAccording to Brigadier General Murad Turaiq, the commander of some of the Yemeni forces allied to the Saudi-led coalition currently fighting in Yemen, Patriot air defense systems deployed to Yemen by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have successfully intercepted two ballistic missiles fired by Houthi forces General Turaiq told the Abu Dhabi-based The National newspaper on November 14, 2015, that the first missile was shot down late the previous day in the Al-Gofainah area and a second was intercepted before it hit the building hosting the control centre for forces operating in Marib and Al-Baydah provinces Airbus Defence and Space satellite imagery obtained by IHS Jane's showed two Patriot fire units, each with two launchers, deployed at the Safir airstrip in Marib province on October 1 [127]\n\n\nTalisman Sabre Exercise\nIn July 2021, the US Army used a battery of Patriot missiles in the Exercise Talisman Saber in the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in Queensland, Australia [128] The US Army test fired Patriot PAC-2 interceptor missiles and successfully intercepted target drones [129]\n\n\nService with Eastern Europe\nRussia's 2014 invasion of Crimea led to a \"sales burst\" for the Patriot system, with Romania, Poland, and Sweden signing onto the system between the start of the invasion and the wider invasion of Ukraine in 2022 [5] In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, on 9 March 2022, the U.S European Command announced that it would send two Patriot air defense systems to Poland to \"proactively counter any potential threat to U.S and Allied forces and NATO territory\" [130] Poland asked Germany to transfer the Patriots to Ukraine Germany declined [131] On 19 December, Ukraine President Zelenskyy talked about negotiating personally with US President Biden over a potential transfer of Patriot missile systems He said they offer \"a (better) distance, radius of reflection, protection\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that this was the most difficult diplomatic issue they had faced [132] One day later, the Biden administration announced it would be delivering another $1.85 billion in aid to Ukraine that would include a Patriot battery [133] During a meeting with Zelenskyy in front of the press at the White House on December 21, Biden confirmed that the United States would send a Patriot battery to Ukraine, noting that it would take \"months\" to train the \"dozens\" of soldiers needed to operate the system, probably in Germany [134] [135] [136] Providing a Patriot missile system is seen as a symbol of Western engagement in the conflict, although its range is only local [135] [137]\n\n\nPatriot sales and contributions to Poland and Ukraine\nRussia's 2014 invasion of Crimea led to a \"sales burst\" for the Patriot system, with Romania, Poland, and Sweden signing onto the system between the start of the invasion and the wider invasion of Ukraine in 2022 [5] In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, on 9 March 2022, the U.S European Command announced that it would send two Patriot air defense systems to Poland to

strike package over Bryansk Oblast, Russia [147] Visually confirmed losses included a Su-34, Su-35, and two Mil Mi-8 helicopters [148] On 19 May, U.S defense officials and congressional staffers told CNN that a Patriot system had been used by the Ukrainian army to shoot down at least one Russian jet a few weeks before [149] The spokesman of the Ukrainian Air Force later confirmed the shoot down of a Russian Su-34, Su-35, two Mi-8MTPR EW helicopters, and an Mi-8 transport helicopter by the Patriot system [150]\n\n\nMissile defense\nDuring a night time attack on the Kyiv region on May 4, 2023, Ukraine air defense claimed a hypersonic Kh-47M2 Kinzhal ballistic missile was shot down by a Patriot missile defence system [5] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] Yurii Ihnat, the spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, initially denied the claim of interception, [157] but on May 6 it was finally confirmed by Commander of the UAF Mykola Oleschuk [153] [154] Prior to this interception, intercepting a Kinzhal missile was only a \"theoretical\" capability [158] Unnamed US officials claimed the missile was aimed at the Patriot system which intercepted it, and that the Ukrainians fired multiple Patriot missiles at different angles to intercept the Kinzhal missile [159] A Pentagon spokesman later confirmed that Ukraine downed the Kinzhal missile [160]\n\n\nLosses\nOn March 9, 2024, video footage emerged showing the destruction of an Armed Forces of Ukraine convoy that allegedly contained at least two M901 Patriot missile launchers near the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast The convoy was reportedly struck by a Russian Iskander-M ballistic missile The Armed Forces of Ukraine has not commented on the video [174] [175] [176] [177] [178]\n\n\nDemands on Patriot systems\nIncluding the United States, 18 countries operate Patriot missile systems Outside the US, only Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries appears to build Patriot missiles, under licence from various US companies This has led to a demand on the US Army Patriot batteries are the most deployed units in the US Army by early 2021 Some units have had a 6-month deployment extended up to 15 months [5] [180] [181] [182] The missile is currently being used in active service in Saudi Arabia [183] In active use by the IDF in the \"southern Negev desert\" [184] The Patriot missile batteries

book, as DC's parent company, Warner Communications, owned the rights to the series DC Comics, however, was not interested in their pitch, believing the show's and the martial arts genre popularity would fade quickly The duo then approached Marvel Comics with the idea to create a kung fu-focused original comic Editor-in-chief Roy Thomas agreed, but only if they would include the Sax Rohmer's pulp villain Dr Fu Manchu, as Marvel had previously acquired the comic book rights to the character, and made their protagonist half-white Englehart and Starlin agreed [1] [2] They developed Shang-Chi, a master of kung fu, who was introduced as a previously unknown son of Dr Fu Manchu [3] [4] Though an original character himself, many of Shang-Chi's supporting characters (most notably Dr Fu Manchu, Sir Denis Nayland Smith, Dr James Petrie and Fah Lo Suee) were Rohmer creations Starlin left the series after #17 (replaced by Paul Gulacy) and Englehart after #19 (replaced by Doug Moench)

confronted by the Jade Emperor's guards for trespassing, with the Emperor himself arriving to capture them with his Ten Rings While imprisoned in the Jade Palace dungeon, Zheng Zu's spirit visits Shang-Chi to convince him to take the Ten Rings to stop Xin from destroying their family Xin, empowered by a taotie mask created from Shang-Chi's blood and Shi-Hua's severed hand, arrives at the dungeon to destroy the Zheng bloodline once and for all Shang-Chi reluctantly allows his father to guide him to the Jade Emperor's vault containing the Ten Rings, donning them to save his siblings from his grandfather [127] When Shang-Chi tries resisting Zheng Zu's influence, Xin is able to take six of the Rings from him and defeats the Champions before heading to the House of the Deadly Hand to join the Qilin Riders in destroying the Society Shang-Chi and his siblings are protected by the four remaining Rings, which is witnessed by the Jade Emperor, who allows Shang-Chi and the others to leave Ta-Lo to stop Xin on the condition that he returns the Ten Rings At the House of the Deadly Hand, Shang-Chi fights Xin again but loses the remaining Ten Rings to his grandfather, who then orders the Riders to destroy New York City With no other option, Shang-Chi gives in to Zu's influence, allowing him to reclaim all of the Rings from Xin, unlocking their full power and taking on his father's appearance and personality Shang-Chi then uses the Rings to defeat Xin and all the Qilin Riders Before a corrupted Shang-Chi can execute Xin, he is talked down by Jiang Li and his siblings, freeing him from Zu's influence Shang-Chi has the Five Weapons Society repair the damage done to the city and tend to wounded civilians, revealing the Society's existence and his leadership to the public but restores his superhero allies' faith in him Afterwards, Shang-Chi hands Xin and the Ten Rings to the Jade Emperor, who appoints Jiang Li as the new Chieftain of the Qilin Riders, forcing her to stay in Ta-Lo Shang-Chi's siblings go their separate ways but leave on good terms with him  One month after the ordeal, Shang-Chi discovers that the Ten Rings have left Ta-Lo and arrived at the House of the Deadly Hand [128]\n\n\nSecrets and Fool Me Twice\nSometime before the Ten Rings return to him, Shang-Chi reunites with Jimmy Woo to take down illegal fighting rings organized by Crossfire, where unwilling participants, particularly those of color, are mentally coerced in fighting each other by Crossfire's brainwashing technology After Crossfire and his brokers apprehended by the two with help from the Agents of Atlas, Five Weapons Society, Champions and Leiko, Shang-Chi and Jimmy reflect on their similar backgrounds and different upbringings before reconciling with each other  Shang-Chi later discovers that the Eyes of the Dragon survived their destruction and were stolen by the Inhuman criminal Kamran Shang-Chi, Sister Dagger and Sister Staff track down the Eyes to Jersey City, New Jersey, where they prevent Kamran from using the Eyes on Ms Marvel to sacrifice her life to prolong that of his boss, the Inhuman crimelord Lineage [129]\n\n\nShang-Chi and the Ten Rings\nUnable to access the gateways to Ta-Lo, Shang-Chi has the Ten Rings sealed in a vault within the House of the Deadly Hand Due to the final battle between Shang-Chi and Xin being televised all over the world, the Ten Rings have become public knowledge, prompting several criminal organizations into attacking the House of the Deadly Hand to claim the Rings, forcing Shang-Chi to don them again to fight them off [130] Shang-Chi leaves the Rings in another vault while accompanying Leiko in rescuing Clive Reston; Shang-Chi discovers the rescue mission is a ruse orchestrated by MI6 to keep him preoccupied while the Ten Rings are stolen by Black Jack Tarr and his men [131]  When MI6 and MI13 accidentally summon an eldritch parasite called the Wyrm of Desolation with the Ten Rings, Shang-Chi saves them and reacquires the Rings, but not before admonishing his former friends for betraying him  These events are witnessed by the Xian Jinzha and Muzha, who question Shang-Chi's worthiness of wielding the Ten Rings, prompting them to host a Game of Rings to find a true Ring Keeper [132]\n\n\nGang War\nDuring the events of \"Gang War\", Shang-Chi attends a meeting held by the heads of New York's criminal families following the attempted assassination of Tombstone, claiming that he acting in the best interests of the Five Weapons Society  As Tombstone's coma has left a power vacuum within the criminal underworld, tensions between rival superpowered gangs escalates to a city-wide gang war; due to the close proximities of their organizations' territories, Shang-Chi is forced to intervene during a destructive turf war between Mister Negative and Lady Yulan [137]  Struggling between his commitment to New York's superheroes, maintaining the loyalty of the Society's battle hungry warriors and prioritizing Chinatown's safety, Shang-Chi minimalizes Society's activities as much as possible in the Gang War  Spider-Man confronts Shang-Chi for his involvement with the other crime lords, but Shang-Chi explains that he is only doing so to protect Chinatown's citizens and reassures Spider-Man that he would keep the Society confined to Chinatown  Believing that Shang-Chi's actions are weakening the Society, several members led by Captain Feng stage a coup against him, which Shang-Chi easily fights off  However, several of Feng's sorcerers trap the Ten Rings within a magic prison, robbing Shang-Chi of his weapons [138]  Hoping to find a way to keep Chinatown safe without the Rings, Shang-Chi sends a message to Mr Negative, Yulan and Diamondback, requesting they each send their best champion to challenge him in a duel for control of Chinatown  The three crimelords accept the challenge but attend the duel themselves  Shang-Chi easily defeats them but discovers they each had sent decoys in their places while focusing their attention on having their forces destroy each other, which Shang-Chi had planned to happen  While Shang-Chi's gambit to pit his biggest rivals against each other while keeping them out of Chinatown succeeds, it creates further destruction throughout the rest of city, prompting Mayor Luke Cage into gathering Spider-Man, Danny Rand, She-Hulk and Tombstone to confront him [139]  Having anticipated this as well that his rivals would eventually team up against him after fighting each other, Shang-Chi manipulates the arriving heroes and villains into fighting each other at the House of the Deadly Hand while tricking Captain Feng and his sorcerers into releasing the Ten Rings, which he then uses to defeat the traitors and villains  With Chinatown safe and the Ten Rings back in his possession, Shang-Chi joins the other heroes in ending the Gang War [140]\n\n\nThunderbolts\nShang-Chi is recruited by Bucky Barnes into his new Thunderbolts team to eliminate the Red Skull and his enterprises  Using the codename Gamemaster, Shang-Chi and Barnes travel to Hong Kong to intercept U.S Agent and American Kaiju, who were tricked by the Red Skull's spies within the United States Army into destroying the Skull's remaining secret base to cover his escape  When Red Skull remotely forces American Kaiju to go on a rampage in the city, Shang-Chi orders the Five Weapons Society to protect citizens and provides Barnes with the mystical Ring of Kuafu, allowing Barnes to grow into the size of a giant to subdue American Kaiju [141]

superhuman opponents Shang-Chi is classed as an athlete but he is one of the best non-superhumans in martial arts and has dedicated much of his life to the art, being referred to by some as the greatest empty-hand fighter and practitioner of kung fu alive, with even Ares acknowledging him as one of the few mortals who can hold their own against a god without the use of magic [144] In

{"title": "Hurricane_Helene", "content": "\nMeteorological history\nOn September 17, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) highlighted the potential for tropical cyclogenesis in the western Caribbean Sea [6] Conditions conducive for development of a tropical cyclone resulted from the interaction of the Central American gyre—a broad monsoon low pressure system—and the Madden–Julian Oscillation, which reinforced the large-scale cyclonic flow extending from the eastern Pacific Ocean to the western Caribbean Sea [7] Several days later, on September 22, a broad low-pressure area developed within the western Caribbean [5] As the system traversed an environment conducive for tropical cyclone development, [8] showers and thunderstorms associated with the disturbance gradually consolidated [9] Due to the system's imminent threat to land, it was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine on September 23 [10] The next day, Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters aircraft found that the system was producing flight-level winds of 52 mph (84 km/h) and had developed a better-defined center; the NHC accordingly upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Helene at 15:00 UTC [11] The system continued strengthening, with NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters finding that Helene's maximum winds had increased to 80 mph (130 km/h) As a result, NHC upgraded the system to a hurricane by 15:00 UTC on September 25, as it entered the Gulf of Mexico while turning north An upper-level trough to its west and a ridge of high pressure located off the Southeastern United States both served to steer the cyclone towards the U.S Gulf Coast [12] Helene was a very large system, [13] with the NHC noting in multiple forecast discussions that the forecast storm radii were \"at the 90th percentile of hurricane size at similar latitudes\" [14]\n\n\nPreparations\nTropical storm warnings were issued on September 24 for the eastern Yucatán Peninsula [25] Parts of Quintana Roo and Yucatán were placed under a blue alert, indicating indirect impacts [26] It was later raised to red alert, maximum danger [27] Cruise ship arrivals in the former state's ports were canceled for September 24 and 25 [28] Tren Maya was also closed [29] On Isla Mujeres, two shelters were opened [30] Evacuations were carried out in vulnerable areas [31] Visitors of Isla Holbox were offered a ferry ride off the island at

Cayman Islands on September 24 [111] Roads in George Town were flooded as rainfall produced by the storm caused 14 power outages, affecting 118 customers across Grand Cayman [35] The government began planning to buy land to aid in storm water management [112] After Helene had passed, Grand Cayman was impacted by 5–7 foot (1.5–2.1 m) waves on September 26 [113]\n\n\nCayman Islands\nOver 10 inches

Helene [114] Helene's winds caused a failure in the power lines that feed the Guanito transmitter, causing most of the territory, especially San Juan and Martínez, Guane, Mantua, and Minas de Matahambre, to suffer blackouts [116] Gale-force winds were recorded in the provinces of Isla de la Juventud and Pinar del Río [117] In total, around 70,000 customers experienced power outages in

"lang": "en", "article": "**Hurricane Helene**\n\nHurricane Helene was a powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that affected several countries in the Caribbean and the southeastern United States in September 2024. The storm formed in the western Caribbean Sea and intensified rapidly, causing widespread damage and loss of life.\n\n**Meteorological History**\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) highlighted the potential for tropical cyclogenesis in the western Caribbean Sea on September 17, 2024. Conditions conducive for development of a tropical cyclone resulted from the interaction of the Central American gyre—a broad monsoon low pressure system—and the Madden–Julian Oscillation, which reinforced the large-scale cyclonic flow extending from the eastern Pacific Ocean to the western Caribbean Sea.\n\nSeveral days later, on September 22, a broad low-pressure area developed within the western Caribbean. As the system traversed an environment conducive for tropical cyclone development, showers and thunderstorms associated with the disturbance gradually consolidated.\n\nDue to the system's imminent threat to land, it was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine on September 23. The next day, Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters aircraft found that the system was producing flight-level winds of 52 mph (84 km/h) and had developed a better-defined center; the NHC accordingly upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Helene at 15:00 UTC.\n\nThe system continued strengthening, with NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters finding that Helene's maximum winds had increased to 80 mph (130 km/h). As a result, NHC upgraded the system to a hurricane by 15:00 UTC on September 25, as it entered the Gulf of Mexico while turning north.\n\nAn upper-level trough to its west and a ridge of high pressure located off the Southeastern United States both served to steer the cyclone towards the U.S Gulf Coast. Helene was a very large system, with the NHC noting in multiple forecast discussions that the forecast storm radii were \"at the 90th percentile of hurricane size at similar latitudes.\"\n\n**Preparations**\n\nTropical storm warnings were issued on September 24 for the eastern Yucatán Peninsula. Parts of Quintana Roo and Yucatán were placed under a blue alert, indicating indirect impacts. It was later raised to red alert, maximum danger. Cruise ship arrivals in the former state's ports were canceled for September 24 and 25. Tren Maya was also closed. On Isla Mujeres, two shelters were opened. Evacuations were carried out in vulnerable areas. Visitors of Isla Holbox were offered a ferry ride off the island at no cost. Classes were suspended in Quintana Roo.\n\n**Mexico**\n\nThe region around Cancún received 240 millimeters (9.4 in) of rain. Over 120,000 customers, 14% of all Comisión Federal de Electricidad customers, lost power in Quintana Roo. Extreme flooding covering much of Isla Mujeres occurred. The island also experienced wind gusts up to 69 miles per hour (111 km/h). Cancún and Cozumel saw very rough surf, breaking the seawall in Cozumel and increasing beach erosion in Cancún. Flights at Cozumel International Airport were delayed while Cancún International Airport saw nearly 100 cancellations or delays. Only minor delays occurred at Mérida Airport. The companies most affected by Helene were Viva Aerobus, Volaris, and Aeromexico. Trees fell and roofs were damaged across the Yucatán Peninsula.\n\n**Caribbean**\n\nOver 10 inches (250 mm) of rain fell onto the Cayman Islands. Heavy rainfall and large waves began affecting the Cayman Islands on September 24. Roads in George Town were flooded as rainfall produced by the storm caused 14 power outages, affecting 118 customers across Grand Cayman. The government began planning to buy land to aid in storm water management. After Helene had passed, Grand Cayman was impacted by 5–7 foot (1.5–2.1 m) waves on September 26.\n\n**Cayman Islands**\n\nOver 10 inches (250 mm) of rain fell onto the Cayman Islands. Heavy rainfall and large waves began affecting the Cayman Islands on September 24. Roads in George Town were flooded as rainfall produced by the storm caused 14 power outages, affecting 118 customers across Grand Cayman. The government began planning to buy land to aid in storm water management. After Helene had passed, Grand Cayman was impacted by 5–7 foot (1.5–2.1 m) waves on September 26.\n\n**Cuba**\n\nIn Cuba, heavy rainfall occurred, with peak accumulations of 218.4 mm (8.60 in) recorded in Presa Herradura and 186.8 mm (7.35 in) in Palacios. Elsewhere, Punta del Este and Isla de la Juventud received 101 mm (4.0 in), Paso Real de San Diego received 78 mm (3.1 in), Pinar del Río received 72 mm (2.8 in), and Isabel Rubio received 70 mm (2.8 in). In Pinar del Río Province, 17 of the province's 24 reservoirs overflowed. Elsewhere, in El Palenque, road access was cut off due to flooding caused by Helene. Helene's winds caused a failure in the power lines that feed the Guanito transmitter, causing most of the territory, especially San Juan and Martínez, Guane, Mantua, and Minas de Matahambre, to suffer blackouts. Gale-force winds were recorded in the provinces of Isla de la Juventud and Pinar del Río. In total, around 70,000 customers experienced power outages in Pinar del Rio, with another 160,000 residents affected in Artemisa.\n\n**United States**\n\n(27)\n\n**Florida**\n\nBy the morning of September 26, 2024, thousands in the Tampa Bay area were experiencing power outages. Wind gusts reached 64 mph (103 km/h) in Fort Lauderdale and 67 mph (108 km/h) in Naples. Storm surges in Steinhatchee reached 9.63 feet (2.94 m). Key West experienced storm surge of 1 to 3 feet (0.30 to 0.91 m). Storm surges reached 7.18 feet (2.19 m) in Tampa. Preliminary storm surge modeling has found that areas of the Big Bend experienced inundation of more than 15 feet. About 1.3 million people lost power in the state. The Stan Gober Memorial Bridge shut down due to flooding, and all sporting events in Collier County on September 27 were canceled.\n\n**Georgia**\n\nIn Atlanta, the National Weather Service in Peachtree City issued the city's first-ever flash flood emergency due to Atlanta having its heaviest 3-day rainfall totals in 104 years. Rainfall totals over 48 hours in the city reached 11.12 in (282 mm), the most the city has seen in 48 hours since recordkeeping began in 1878. About 25 people had to be rescued from floods in Atlanta. Localized urban flooding was also reported on multiple interstates like I-285, I-85, I-75, and many other interstate systems encompassing Atlanta. More significant flooding occurred in Buckhead due to overflowing of the Peachtree Creek, which flooded multiple surrounding apartment complexes. Other flooding occurred in areas around Metro Atlanta. The Chattahoochee River overflowed its banks in multiple areas around Fulton County, Georgia, and in downstream counties, which prompted a water rescue in Coweta County. Three tornadoes were spawned by Helene in the state, including one that killed two people in Wheeler County when it overturned their mobile home. The Wheeler County tornado was rated an EF1, while the other two have been rated EF0.\n\n**North Carolina**\n\nAt least 115 people were confirmed to have been killed by Helene in North Carolina, including at least 40 in Buncombe County alone, while about 200 more were left unaccounted for in the state. Two people, a 4-year-old girl in Claremont and a 58-year-old man in Gastonia, were killed in traffic collisions during rains caused by Helene. At least 879,000 customers in the state lost power. In Charlotte, high winds from Helene caused a tree to fall onto a residence, killing one person and seriously injuring another. In Winston-Salem, heavy rains and high winds caused a large tree to fall on a gas station, damaging two vehicles. Residents living downstream of Lake Lure were ordered to evacuate as its dam was overtopped by water and imminent failure was expected. Lake Lure Dam was later evaluated, and no imminent failure was expected, although erosion on both sides of the dam and compromise of the structural supports were reported. One woman in the town of Lake Lure was rescued with her dog after being stranded inside a collapsed house along a riverbank. Eight tornadoes were spawned by Helene in the state, including a brief but intense low-end EF3 tornado that impacted the north side of Rocky Mount, damaging 14 buildings and injuring 15 people, including four critically. Five of the other tornadoes were rated EF1, while the remaining two were rated EF0.\n\n**South Carolina**\n\nThirty-six people were killed in South Carolina, including six in Spartanburg County and Greenville County, four in Aiken County, and Anderson County, three in Laurens County, two in Newberry County, one in Chesterfield County, three in Saluda County, and one in Greenwood County. Over 1.3 million customers were without power in South Carolina, the most of any state impacted by Helene, with several counties experiencing a near-complete loss of power. Wind gusts reached 72 mph (116 km/h) in Aiken and Anderson, and 75 mph (121 km/h) in Beaufort. Rainfall totals in the state peaked at 21.66 in (550 mm) in Rocky Bottom. Helene spawned 21 weak tornadoes in the state; five of them were rated EF1, another was rated EFU, and the remaining 15 were rated EF0.\n\n**Tennessee**\n\nHelicopter crews rescued 58 people, with units from the Virginia State Police assisting, from Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin after the hospital was almost submerged entirely. Part of a set of bridges on US 23/I-26/US 19W spanning the Nolichucky River in Erwin were completely washed away. The Nashville Predators postponed a preseason game against the Tampa Bay Lightning to October 7 due to severe weather in the area. Nashville broke a daily rainfall record on September 27. In Morristown, several trees fell, causing power lines to be snapped throughout the city. Wind gusts in Sparta reached 44 mph (71 km/h). In Newport, the Pigeon River rose to over three times the flood stage and set a new record at 26 feet (7.9 m), flooding portions of the town and nearby I-40. As of October 1, 2024, across northeastern Tennessee, 85 people were still missing.\n\n**Virginia**\n\nOne person was killed in Craig County after a tree fell onto a building. Another person was killed in Tazewell County when a falling tree struck them as they were cleaning debris. Rainfall reached 12.2 in (310 mm) in the Grayson Highlands, while Galax saw around 8.6 in (220 mm) of rain over a 72-hour period. In the New River Valley, high waters from Helene were seen as far north as Radford University Damascus saw flooding of 19.5 ft (5.9 m).\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nOn September 28, 2024, the Omaha Public Power District sent Mutual Aid crews to West Virginia to help with power restoration after Helene, their third in a disaster in 2024. California sent 151 search and rescue members to affected areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent in search-and-rescue teams, bottled water, and Starlink terminals. Additionally, an eastern Kentucky storm chaser contributed 30 Starlink terminals to storm victims in western North Carolina. In total, SpaceX stated that they had donated approximately 500 terminals through various channels. The American Red Cross and The Salvation Army, among other nonprofit organizations, began deploying emergency disaster services teams in many affected areas. A unit from the 1st Battalion of the 169th Aviation Regiment, part of the Connecticut Army National Guard, was deployed to North Carolina to help assist disaster relief efforts.\n\n**Relief efforts**\n\nOn September 28, 2024, the Omaha Public Power District sent Mutual Aid crews to West Virginia to help with power restoration after Helene, their third in a disaster in 2024.

neighboring county of Jeongseon The indoor ice events were held in the nearby city of Gangneung.\n\n\nPyeongchang (mountain cluster)\nThe Alpensia Sports Park in Daegwallyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang, was the focus of the 2018 Winter Olympics [19] [20] It was home to the Olympic Stadium, [21] the Olympic Village and most of the outdoor sports venues.\n\n\nGangneung (coastal cluster)\nThe Gangneung

closing ceremonies ranged from ₩220,000 (~US$192) to ₩1.5 million (~US$1311) The exact prices were determined through market research; around 50% of the tickets were expected to cost about ₩80,000 (~US$70) or less, and tickets in sports that are relatively unknown in the region, such as biathlon and luge, were made cheaper in order to encourage attendance By contrast, figure skating and the men's ice hockey gold-medal game carried the most expensive tickets of the Games [22]\n\n\nThe Games\nThe opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 9 February 2018 The US$100 million facility was only intended to be used for the opening and closing ceremonies of these Olympics and the subsequent Paralympics; it was demolished following their

National Olympic Committees\nA record total of 93 [A] teams qualified at least one athlete to compete in the Games The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses) Six nations made their Winter Olympics debuts: Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore [31] Athletes from three further countries – the Cayman

National Olympic Committee\na  Apart from the respective delegations, North Korea and South Korea formed a unified Korean women's ice hockey team.\nb  Russian athletes were entitled to participate as Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) if individually cleared by the IOC.\n\n\nEvent scheduling\nThe IOC has allowed NBC to influence the Olympic event scheduling to maximize U.S television ratings when possible, due to the substantial fees paid by NBC for rights to the Olympics (which have been extended through 2032 with a nearly $8 billion agreement), the company being one of IOC's major sources of revenue [46] [47] As figure skating is one of the most popular Winter Olympic sports among U.S viewers, the figure skating events were scheduled with morning start times to accommodate primetime broadcasts in the Americas This scheduling practice affected the events themselves, including skaters having to adjust to the modified schedule, as well as attendance levels at the sessions [48]\n\n\nCalendar\n  *   Host nation (South Korea)\n\nMedal table\n  *   Host nation (South Korea)\n\nPodium sweeps\nThree podium sweeps were recorded during the Games.\n\n\nRecords\nThe closing

which in July 2011 had extended its rights to the Olympics through 2024 [71] SBS sub-licensed its rights to MBC and KBS [72] NHK and Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) once again filmed portions of the Games in high-dynamic-range 8K resolution video, including 90 hours of footage of selected events and the opening ceremonies [73] [74] ATSC 3.0 digital terrestrial television, using 4K resolution, was introduced in South Korea in 2017 in time for the Olympics [75] [76] This footage was delivered in 4K in the U.S by NBCUniversal parent Comcast to participating television providers, including its own Xfinity, as well as DirecTV and Dish Network NBC's Raleigh-based affiliate WRAL-TV also held demonstration viewings as part of its ATSC 3.0 test broadcasts [77] [78] [79]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe official emblem, reflecting ice crystals and derived from the hangul letters ㅍ and ㅊ—the initial sounds of \"Pyeong\" and \"Chang\"—was unveiled on 3 May 2013 [92] In all official materials, the name of the host city was stylised in CamelCase as \"PyeongChang\", in order to alleviate potential confusion with Pyongyang, the similarly named capital of neighboring North Korea [93]\n\n\nConcerns and controversies\nDue to the state of relations between North and South Korea, concerns were raised over the security of the 2018 Winter Olympics, especially in the wake of tensions over North Korean missile and nuclear tests On 20 September 2017, South Korean president Moon Jae-in stated that the country would ensure the security of the Games [101] The next day, Laura Flessel-Colovic, the French Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, stated that France would pull out of the Games if the safety of its delegation could not be guaranteed [102]\n\n\nNorth–South Korean relations\nDue to the state

Sports, stated that France would pull out of the Games if the safety of its delegation could not be guaranteed [102]\n\n\nRussian doping\nRussia's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics was affected by the aftermath of its state-sponsored doping program As a result, the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in December 2017, although Russian athletes whitelisted by the IOC were allowed to compete neutrally under the OAR (Olympic Athletes from Russia) designation [118] The official sanctions imposed by the IOC included: the exclusion of Russian government officials from the Games; the use of the Olympic flag and Olympic Anthem in place of the Russian flag and anthem; and the submission of a replacement logo for the OAR uniforms [119]\n\n\nSee

The exact prices were determined through market research; around 50% of the tickets were expected to cost about ₩80,000 (~US$70) or less, and tickets in sports that are relatively unknown in the region, such as biathlon and luge, were made cheaper in order to encourage attendance.\n\n# The Games\n\nThe opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 9 February 2018. The US$100 million facility was only intended to be used for the opening and closing ceremonies of these Olympics and the subsequent Paralympics; it was demolished following their conclusion. The event was attended by over 35,000 people, including dignitaries from around the world. The ceremony featured performances by Korean artists, such as Lee Hyori and Red Velvet, as well as a display of fireworks and a light show.\n\n# Sports\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics featured 102 events over 15 disciplines in 7 sports, making it the first Winter Olympics to surpass 100 medal events. Six new events in existing sports were introduced to the Winter Olympic program in Pyeongchang: men's and ladies' big air snowboarding, mixed doubles curling, men's and ladies' mass start speed skating, and mixed team alpine skiing.\n\n# Participating National Olympic Committees\n\nA record total of 93 teams qualified at least one athlete to compete in the Games. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Six nations made their Winter Olympics debuts: Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Singapore. Athletes from three further countries – the Cayman Islands, Dominica, and Peru – qualified to compete, but all three National Olympic Committees returned the quota spots back to the International Ski Federation (FIS).\n\n# Event Scheduling\n\nThe IOC has allowed NBC to influence the Olympic event scheduling to maximize U.S television ratings when possible, due to the substantial fees paid by NBC for rights to the Olympics (which have been extended through 2032 with a nearly $8 billion agreement), the company being one of IOC's major sources of revenue. As figure skating is one of the most popular Winter Olympic sports among U.S viewers, the figure skating events were scheduled with morning start times to accommodate primetime broadcasts in the Americas.\n\n# Calendar\n\n  *   Host nation (South Korea)\n\n# Medal Table\n\n  *   Host nation (South Korea)\n\n# Podium Sweeps\n\nThree podium sweeps were recorded during the Games.\n\n# Records\n\nThe closing ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 25 February 2018. IOC president Thomas Bach declared the Games closed, and the cauldron was extinguished. The Olympic flag was handed to Beijing, the next host city of the Winter Olympics.\n\n# Broadcasting\n\nBroadcast rights to the 2018 Winter Olympics were already sold in some countries as part of long-term broadcast rights deals, including the Games' local rightsholder SBS, which in July 2011 had extended its rights to the Olympics through 2024. SBS sub-licensed its rights to MBC and KBS. NHK and Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) once again filmed portions of the Games in high-dynamic-range 8K resolution video, including 90 hours of footage of selected events and the opening ceremonies. ATSC 3.0 digital terrestrial television, using 4K resolution, was introduced in South Korea in 2017 in time for the Olympics. This footage was delivered in 4K in the U.S by NBCUniversal parent Comcast to participating television providers, including its own Xfinity, as well as DirecTV and Dish Network.\n\n# Marketing\n\nThe official emblem, reflecting ice crystals and derived from the hangul letters ㅍ and ㅊ—the initial sounds of \"Pyeong\" and \"Chang\"—was unveiled on 3 May 2013. In all official materials, the name of the host city was stylised in CamelCase as \"PyeongChang\", in order to alleviate potential confusion with Pyongyang, the similarly named capital of neighboring North Korea.\n\n# Concerns and Controversies\n\nDue to the state of relations between North and South Korea, concerns were raised over the security of the 2018 Winter Olympics, especially in the wake of tensions over North Korean missile and nuclear tests. On 20 September 2017, South Korean president Moon Jae-in stated that the country would ensure the security of the Games. The next day, Laura Flessel-Colovic, the French Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, stated that France would pull out of the Games if the safety of its delegation could not be guaranteed.\n\n# North–South Korean Relations\n\nDue to the state of relations between North and South Korea, concerns were raised over the security of the 2018 Winter Olympics, especially in the wake of tensions over North Korean missile and nuclear tests.

Kao**\n\nCharles Kao (1933-2018) was a Chinese-born British electrical engineer and physicist who made significant contributions to the development of modern telecommunications. He is best known for his pioneering work on fibre optics, which led to the invention of low-loss optical fibres and paved the way for high-speed internet and modern telecommunications.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nCharles Kao was born in Shanghai, China, in 1933. He grew up in a family of intellectuals and was educated at the Shanghai World School, where he studied Chinese classics, English, and French. After completing his education, Kao moved to the United Kingdom to pursue a career in engineering.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nKao's early life and education played a significant role in shaping his future career. He was born in Shanghai's French Concession, a district known for its cosmopolitan culture and intellectual community. His parents, both educators, encouraged his interest in science and mathematics from an early age. Kao's father, Kao Chun-Hsiang, was a judge and a professor at Soochow University, and his mother was a teacher.\n\nKao studied Chinese classics at home with his brother, under the guidance of a tutor. He also studied English and French at the Shanghai World School, which was founded by a group of progressive Chinese educators, including Cai Yuanpei. The school's emphasis on modern education and international exchange had a profound impact on Kao's worldview and shaped his future career.\n\n**Academic Career**\n\nIn the 1960s, Kao joined Standard Telecommunication Laboratories (STL) in Harlow, Essex, England, where he worked alongside his colleagues to develop fibre optics as a telecommunications medium. At STL, Kao and his team discovered that the high-loss of existing fibre optics arose from impurities in the glass, rather than from an underlying problem with the technology itself. This breakthrough led to the development of low-loss optical fibres, which paved the way for high-speed internet and modern telecommunications.\n\nKao's work at STL was a significant departure from the conventional wisdom of the time, which held that fibre optics were impractical due to the high loss of signal. Kao's discovery of the impurities in the glass led to the development of new materials and techniques for fibre optics, which ultimately made fibre-optic communications a reality.\n\n**Fibre Optics and Communications**\n\nKao's work on fibre optics led to the invention of low-loss optical fibres, which revolutionized telecommunications. The development of fibre-optic communications enabled the transmission of data over long distances at high speeds, paving the way for modern telecommunications and the internet.\n\nKao's fibre-optic communications technology has had a profound impact on modern society, enabling global communication and commerce. The widespread adoption of fibre-optic communications has transformed the way people live, work, and communicate, and has had a profound impact on the global economy.\n\n**Later Work**\n\nAfter leaving STL, Kao joined the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 1970 to found the Department of Electronics, which later became the Department of Electronic Engineering. During his time at CUHK, Kao was the reader and then the chair Professor of Electronics, and he built up both undergraduate and graduate study programs of electronics.\n\nUnder Kao's leadership, the School of Education and other new research institutes were established. He also oversaw the graduation of his first students, many of whom went on to become prominent figures in the field of telecommunications.\n\n**Awards and Honours**\n\nKao received numerous awards and honours for his contributions to telecommunications and fibre optics. He was awarded the Gold Medal from the American Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association in 1980, and he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1990.\n\nKao was also awarded the National Medal of Science from the People's Republic of China in 2009, and he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Hong Kong in 2004.\n\n**Society and Academy Recognition**\n\nKao's contributions to telecommunications and fibre optics have been recognized by the scientific community and the general public.

The castle's creator, Edward Leedskalnin, was a Latvian-born American immigrant who built the structure as a testament to his engineering skills and his enduring love for his fiancée, Agnes Skuvst.\n\n## History\n\nEdward Leedskalnin was born in 1887 in Latvia, a country located in the eastern part of Europe. At the age of 26, he was engaged to be married to a 16-year-old girl named Agnes Skuvst. However, just one day before the wedding, Agnes suddenly rejected Leedskalnin, leaving him heartbroken and alone. This rejection would have a profound impact on Leedskalnin's life, leading him to immigrate to the United States in search of a fresh start.\n\nUpon arriving in the United States, Leedskalnin was diagnosed with tuberculosis, a disease that was often fatal at the time. However, in a miraculous turn of events, Leedskalnin spontaneously healed from the disease, crediting the healing power of magnets. This event would mark a turning point in Leedskalnin's life, as he began to focus on his engineering skills and his passion for building.\n\n## The Castle\n\nCoral Castle is a sprawling structure that covers an area of approximately 1.3 acres. The castle's grounds consist of over 1,100 tons of stones, which were carefully selected and arranged to create a series of walls, carvings, furniture, and a majestic castle tower. The stones used to build the castle are not coral, as the name might suggest, but rather oolite, also known as oolitic limestone.\n\nOolite is a type of sedimentary rock that is composed of small spherical grains of concentrically layered carbonate. These grains may include localized concentrations of fossil shells and coral, giving the rock its characteristic oolitic texture. Miami Oolite, the type of oolite used to build Coral Castle, is found throughout southeastern Florida, from Palm Beach County to the Florida Keys. This type of oolite is often found beneath only several inches of topsoil, which is why it was readily available for Leedskalnin to use in his construction project.\n\nThe castle's design is a testament to Leedskalnin's engineering skills and his attention to detail. The structure is built using a series of interlocking stones, which are held together by a combination of gravity and carefully crafted joints. The castle's walls and towers are designed to withstand strong winds and seismic activity, making it a remarkably stable structure.\n\n## Architecture and Design\n\nCoral Castle's architecture is a unique blend of medieval and Art Deco styles. The castle's walls are designed to resemble a medieval fortress, with towers and battlements that evoke a sense of grandeur and majesty. However, the castle's design also incorporates elements of Art Deco, with its use of geometric shapes and bold colors.\n\nThe castle's interior is just as impressive as its exterior, with beautifully crafted furniture and carvings that are made from the same oolite stone used in the castle's construction. The furniture is designed to be both functional and decorative, with intricate carvings and patterns that add to the castle's sense of elegance and sophistication.\n\n## Popular Culture\n\nCoral Castle has been the subject of numerous books, articles, and documentaries over the years. The castle's unique architecture and design have captivated the imagination of artists, writers, and filmmakers, who have been inspired by its beauty and grandeur.\n\nIn recent years, Coral Castle has become a popular tourist destination, attracting visitors from all over the world who come to marvel at its beauty and learn about its history and design. The castle has also been the subject of numerous paranormal and ghost-hunting expeditions, with many people claiming to have experienced strange occurrences and sightings within the castle's walls.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Oolite\n* Miami Oolite\n* Sedimentary rock\n* Art Deco architecture\n* Medieval architecture\n\n## References\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.\n\n## Bibliography\n\n* Leedskalnin, E.

the \"Fontaine Belle-Eau\", a natural fresh water spring located in the English garden not far from the château The name means \"Spring of beautiful water\" In the 19th century the spring was rebuilt with an octagonal stone basin, as it appears today [5]\n\n\nHunting Lodge and castle (12th century)\nThe earliest reference to a royal residence at Fontainebleau dates to 1137 under King Louis VII the Younger,  but it had probably been built  earlier, during the reign of Philip I of France (1060 to 1108), when the Gâtinais region was annexed from the Duchy of Burgundy  It became a favorite summer residence and hunting lodge of the kings of France because of the abundant game and many springs in the surrounding forest [6]\n\n\nFrancis I and The first School of Fontainbleau (1528–1547)\nThe modest medieval castle remained  until the reign of Francis I of France (1494–1547) The King commissioned the architect Gilles Le Breton to build a new palace in the Renaissance style Le Breton created the Cour Ovale, or oval courtyard, He preserved the original medieval keep on one side, but added a monumental new building, the Porte Dorée or Golden Gate, in the Italian Renaissance style, as the main entry of the palace, On the north side he built another building with a Renaissance stairway, the Portique de Serlio, which gave access the royal apartments [9]\n\n\nHenry II and Catherine de' Medici (1547–1570)\nFollowing the death of Francis I, King Henry II continued to expand the chateau The King and his wife, Catherine de' Medici,  chose the architects Philibert de l'Orme and Jean Bullant to do the work They extended the east wing of the lower court and decorated it with  a horseshoe-shaped staircase, which was later enlarged, and became a symbol of the château.\n\n\nHenry IV (1570–1610)\nKing Henry IV made more additions to the château than any king since Francis I He extended the oval court toward the west by building two pavilions, called Tiber and Luxembourg Between 1601 and 1606, he remade all the façades around the courtyard, including that of the chapel of Saint-Saturnin, to give the architecture greater harmony On the east side, he built a new monumental domed gateway, the Porte du Baptistère Between 1606 and 1609, he built a new courtyard, the Cour des Offices or Quartier Henry IV, to provide a place for the kitchens and residences for court officials Two new galleries, the Gallery of Diana and the Gallery of Deer, were built to enclose the old garden of Diana He also added a large jeu de paume, or indoor tennis court, the largest such court existing in the world [13] [14] [15]\n\n\nLouis XIII to Louis XVI (17th-18th century)\nKing Louis XIII, who had been born and baptized in the château, continued the works begun by his father He completed the decoration of the chapel of the Trinity, and assigned the court architect Jean Androuet du Cerceau to reconstruct the horseshoe stairway earlier designed by Philibert Delorme on the courtyard that had become known as the Cour de Cheval Blanc After his death, his widow, Anne of Austria, redecorated the apartments within the Wing of the Queen Mothers (Aile des Reines Mères) next to the Court of the Fountain, designed by Primatrice [16]\n\n\nThe Revolution and the First Empire\nDuring the French Revolution the château was far from the turbulence of Paris, and did not suffer any significant damage, but all the furniture was later sold at auction The buildings were occupied by the Central School of the Department of Seine-et-Marne, until 1803, when Napoleon installed a military school there He chose Fontainebleau as the site of his historic 1804 meeting with Pope Pius VII, who had travelled from Rome to crown Napoleon emperor Apartments were refurnished and decorated for the Emperor and Empress in the new Empire style The Cour du Cheval Blanc was renamed the Cour d'Honneur, or Courtyard of Honor One wing facing the courtyard, the Aile de Ferrare, was torn down and replaced with an ornamental iron fence and gate, making the façade of the palace visible The gardens of Diane and the gardens of the Pines were replanted and turned into an English landscape garden by the landscape designer Maximilien Joseph Hurtault.\n\n\nRestoration and the reign of Louis-Philippe (1815–1848)\nFollowing the restoration of the monarchy, Kings Louis XVIII and Charles X each stayed at Fontainebleau, but neither made any major changes to the palace Louis-Philippe I was more active, both restoring some rooms and redecorating others in the style of his period The Hall of the Guards and Gallery of Plates were redecorated in a Neo-Renaissance style, while the Hall of Columns, under the ballroom, was remade in a neoclassical style He added new stained glass windows, made by the Royal Manufactory of Sèvres.\n\n\nThe Second Empire of Napoleon III\nEmperor Napoleon III, who had been baptized at Fontainebleau, resumed the custom of long stays at Fontainebleau, particularly during the summer Many of the historic rooms, such as the Gallery of Deer, were restored to something like their original appearance, while the private apartments were redecorated to suit the tastes of the Emperor and Empress Numerous guest apartments were squeezed into unused spaces of the buildings The old theater of the palace, built in the 18th century, was destroyed by a fire in the wing of the Belle Cheminée 1856 Between 1854 and 1857 the architect Hector Lefuel built a new theater in the Louis XVI style, where famous actors from the theatres of Paris performed portions of plays for the guests of the Emperor \n\n\nThird Republic to the present day\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War, the palace was occupied by the Prussian Army on 17 September 1870, and briefly used as an army headquarters by Frederick Charles of Prussia from March 1871 Following the war, two of the buildings became the home of the School of Applied Artillery, which had been forced to leave Alsace when the province was annexed by Germany  [23] It was occasionally used as a residence by the presidents of the Third Republic, and to welcome state guests including King Alexander I of Serbia (1891), King George I of Greece (1892) Leopold II of Belgium (1895) and King Alfonso XIII of Spain (1913) It also received a visit by the last survivor of its royal residents, the Empress Eugénie, on 26 June 1920.\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe Gallery of Francis I is one of the first and finest examples of Renaissance decoration in France It was begun in 1528 as a passageway between the apartments of the King with the oval courtyard and the great chapel of the Trinitarian monastery, but in 1531 Francis I made it a part of his royal apartments, and between 1533 and 1539 it was decorated by artists and craftsmen from Italy, under the direction of the painter Rosso Fiorentino, or Primaticcio, in the new Renaissance style The lower walls of the passage were the work of the master Italian furniture maker Francesco Scibec da Carpi; they are decorated with the coat of arms of France and the salamander, the emblem of the King The upper walls are covered by frescoes framed in richly sculpted stucco The frescoes depicted mythological scenes to illustrate the virtues of the King.\n\n\nPalace Interior\nThe Gallery of Francis I is one of the first and finest examples of

King Henry II closed it with high windows and an ornate coffered ceiling, and transformed it into a room for celebrations and balls The 'H', the initial of the King, is prominent in the decor, as well as figures of the crescent moon, the symbol of Henry's mistress Diane de Poitiers [27]  In the 19th century King Louis Philippe added the elaborate wooden floor, which copies the original designs in the coffers of the ceiling [28]\n\n\nChapel of Saint Saturnin\nBehind the ballroom is St Saturnin's Chapel The lower chapel was originally built in the 12th century, but was completely rebuilt under Francis I with a richly coffered ceiling and dome It was largely completed in 1546 The emblem of Henry II, the salamander, marks the keystones [32]\n\n\nThe King's Staircase\nThe stairway of the King was installed in 1748 and 1749, in the space occupied during the reign of Francis I by the bedroom of Anne de Pisseleu, the Duchess of Étampes, a favorite of the King It was designed by the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel, who used many decorative elements from the earlier room, which had originally been decorated by Primaticcio The upper portion of the walls is divided into panels, oval and rectangular, with scenes representing the love life of Alexander the Great The paintings are framed by large statues of women by Primaticcio The eastern wall of the room was destroyed during the

wainscotting from the reign of Louis XV of France, along with a Louis XVI style fireplace, an Empire style chimney, and armchairs by Jacob-Freres and Jacob Desmalter and other prominent designers of the early 19th century [39]\n\n\nBed chamber of the Kings of France and Throne Room of Napoleon\nIn 1808 Napoleon decided to install his throne in the former bedroom of the kings of France from Henry

echoing the design of the ceiling, and a monumental fireplace (1836), which incorporates pieces of ornament from demolished rooms from 15th and early 16th century The bust of Henry IV, attributed to Mathieu Jacquet, is from that period, as are the two figures on either side of the fireplace The sculpted frame around the bust, by Pierre Bontemps, was originally in the bedchamber of Henry II The

dining room [57] [58]\n\n\nGallery of Diana\nThe Gallery of Diana, an eighty-meter (242.4 feet) long corridor now lined with bookcases, was created by Henry IV at the beginning of the 17th century as a place for the Queen to promenade The paintings on the vaulted ceiling, painted beginning in 1605 by Ambroise Dubois and his workshop, represented scenes from the myth of Diana, goddess of the Hunt [59] At the beginning of the 19th century, the gallery was in ruins In 1810 Napoleon decided to turn it into a gallery devoted to the achievements of his Empire A few of the paintings still in good condition were removed and put in the Gallery of Plates The architect Hurtault designed a new plan for the gallery, inspired by the Grande Galerie of the Louvre, featuring paintings on the ceiling

1860 [61] [62]\n\n\nTheatre\nConcerts, plays and other theatrical productions were a regular part of court life at Fontainebleau Prior to the reign of Louis XV these took place in different rooms of the palace, but during his reign a theatre was built in the Belle-Cheminée wing It was rebuilt by the architect Gabriel, but was destroyed by a fire in 1856 It had already been judged too small for the court of Napoleon III, and a new theatre had been begun in 1854 at the far eastern end of the wing of Louis XIV It was designed by architect Hector Lefuel in the Louis XVI style, and was inspired by the Royal Opera of Versailles and the Théâtre de la Reine at the Petit Trianon The new theatre, with four hundred seats arranged in a parterre, two balconies and boxes in a horseshoe shape, was finished in 1856 It has the original stage machinery, and many of the original sets, including many transferred from the old theatre before the fire of 1856 [64] [65]\n\n\nPark and gardens\nThe

The palace has a rich history, dating back to the 12th century, and has been the residence of many French monarchs, including Francis I, Henry II, and Napoleon I.\n\n**History**\n\nThe earliest reference to a royal residence at Fontainebleau dates to 1137 under King Louis VII the Younger. However, it is believed that the château was built earlier, during the reign of Philip I of France (1060-1108), when the Gâtinais region was annexed from the Duchy of Burgundy. The château became a favorite summer residence and hunting lodge of the kings of France due to the abundant game and many springs in the surrounding forest.\n\n**Francis I and The First School of Fontainbleau (1528-1547)**\n\nThe modest medieval castle remained until the reign of Francis I of France (1494-1547). The King commissioned the architect Gilles Le Breton to build a new palace in the Renaissance style. Le Breton created the Cour Ovale, or oval courtyard, and preserved the original medieval keep on one side. He added a monumental new building, the Porte Dorée or Golden Gate, in the Italian Renaissance style, as the main entry of the palace. On the north side, he built another building with a Renaissance stairway, the Portique de Serlio, which gave access to the royal apartments.\n\n**Henry II and Catherine de' Medici (1547-1570)**\n\nFollowing the death of Francis I, King Henry II continued to expand the château. The King and his wife, Catherine de' Medici, chose the architects Philibert de l'Orme and Jean Bullant to do the work. They extended the east wing of the lower court and decorated it with a horseshoe-shaped staircase, which was later enlarged, and became a symbol of the château.\n\n**Henry IV (1570-1610)**\n\nKing Henry IV made more additions to the château than any king since Francis I. He extended the oval court toward the west by building two pavilions, called Tiber and Luxembourg. Between 1601 and 1606, he remade all the façades around the courtyard, including that of the chapel of Saint-Saturnin, to give the architecture greater harmony. On the east side, he built a new monumental domed gateway, the Porte du Baptistère. Between 1606 and 1609, he built a new courtyard, the Cour des Offices or Quartier Henry IV, to provide a place for the kitchens and residences for court officials.\n\n**Louis XIII to Louis XVI (17th-18th century)**\n\nKing Louis XIII, who had been born and baptized in the château, continued the works begun by his father. He completed the decoration of the chapel of the Trinity, and assigned the court architect Jean Androuet du Cerceau to reconstruct the horseshoe stairway earlier designed by Philibert Delorme on the courtyard that had become known as the Cour de Cheval Blanc.\n\n**The Revolution and the First Empire**\n\nDuring the French Revolution, the château was far from the turbulence of Paris, and did not suffer any significant damage. However, all the furniture was later sold at auction. The buildings were occupied by the Central School of the Department of Seine-et-Marne, until 1803, when Napoleon installed a military school there. He chose Fontainebleau as the site of his historic 1804 meeting with Pope Pius VII, who had travelled from Rome to crown Napoleon emperor. Apartments were refurnished and decorated for the Emperor and Empress in the new Empire style.\n\n**Restoration and the Reign of Louis-Philippe (1815-1848)**\n\nFollowing the restoration of the monarchy, Kings Louis XVIII and Charles X each stayed at Fontainebleau, but neither made any major changes to the palace. Louis-Philippe I was more active, both restoring some rooms and redecorating others in the style of his period. He added new stained glass windows, made by the Royal Manufactory of Sèvres.\n\n**The Second Empire of Napoleon III**\n\nEmperor Napoleon III resumed the custom of long stays at Fontainebleau, particularly during the summer. Many of the historic rooms, such as the Gallery of Deer, were restored to something like their original appearance, while the private apartments were redecorated to suit the tastes of the Emperor and Empress. Numerous guest apartments were squeezed into unused spaces of the buildings.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nThe Gallery of Francis I is one of the first and finest examples of Renaissance decoration in France. It was begun in 1528 as a passageway between the apartments of the King with the oval courtyard and the great chapel of the Trinitarian monastery, but in 1531 Francis I made it a part of his royal apartments, and between 1533 and 1539 it was decorated by artists and craftsmen from Italy, under the direction of the painter Rosso Fiorentino, or Primaticcio.\n\n**Palace Interior**\n\nThe Gallery of Francis I is one of the first and finest examples of Renaissance decoration in France.

The lower chapel was originally built in the 12th century, but was completely rebuilt under Francis I with a richly coffered ceiling and dome. It was largely completed in 1546.\n\n**The King's Staircase**\n\nThe stairway of the King was installed in 1748 and 1749, in the space occupied during the reign of Francis I by the bedroom of Anne de Pisseleu, the Duchess of Étampes. It was designed by the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel, who used many decorative elements from the earlier room, which had originally been decorated by Primaticcio.\n\n**The Queen's Bedchamber**\n\nAll of the queens and empresses of France, from Marie de' Medici to the Empress Eugènie, slept in the bedchamber of the Queen.

in richly sculpted stucco The frescoes depicted mythological scenes to illustrate the virtues of the King.\n\n\nBallroom (1552)\nThe ballroom was originally begun as an open passageway, or loggia, by Francis I In about 1552 King Henry II closed it with high windows and an ornate coffered ceiling, and transformed it into a room for celebrations and balls The 'H', the initial of the King, is prominent in the decor, as well as figures of the crescent moon, the symbol of Henry's mistress Diane de Poitiers [27]  In the 19th century King Louis Philippe added the elaborate wooden floor, which copies the original designs in the coffers of the ceiling [28]\n\n\nChapel of Saint Saturnin\nBehind the ballroom is St Saturnin's Chapel The lower chapel was originally built in the 12th century, but was completely rebuilt under Francis I with a richly coffered ceiling and dome It was largely completed in 1546 The emblem of Henry II, the salamander, marks the keystones [32]\n\n\nThe King's Staircase\nThe stairway of the King was installed in 1748 and 1749, in the space occupied during the reign of Francis I by the bedroom of Anne de Pisseleu, the Duchess of Étampes, a favorite of the King It was designed by the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel, who used many decorative elements from the earlier room, which had originally been decorated by Primaticcio The upper portion of the walls is divided into panels, oval and rectangular, with scenes representing the love life of Alexander the Great The paintings are framed by large statues of women by Primaticcio The eastern wall of the room was destroyed during the reconstruction, and was replaced during the reign of Louis Philippe in the 19th century with paintings by Abel de Pujol [34]\n\n\nThe Queen's bedchamber\nAll of the queens and empresses of France, from Marie de' Medici to the Empress Eugènie, slept in the bedchamber of the Queen The ornate ceiling over the bed was made in 1644 by the furniture-maker Guillaume Noyers for the Dowager Queen Anne of Austria, the mother of Louis XIV, and bears her initials The room was redecorated by Marie Leszczynska, the Queen of Louis XV in 1746–1747 The ceiling of the alcove, the decoration around the windows and the wood panelling were made by Jacques Vererckt and Antoine Magnonais in the rocaille style of the day The decoration of the fireplace dates to the same period [35]\n\n\nBoudoir of Marie-Antoinette (1786)\nThe boudoir next to the queen's bedroom was created for Queen Marie Antoinette in 1786, and permitted the queen to have a measure of privacy The room is the best surviving example of the decorative style just before the French Revolution, inspired by ancient Roman models, with delicately painted arabesques, cameos, vases, antique figures and garlands of flowers against a silver background, framed by gilded and sculpted woodwork [37]\n\n\nGames Room of Marie-Antoinette and Grand Salon of the Empress Eugenie (1786)\nThe Games Room was created for Marie Antoinette in 1786, and is a notable example of the Arabesque style popular in the First French Empire in the 18th century The walls are filled with large wall panels, with grisaille and monochrome depictions twining plants, women in flowing robes, dancers, mermaids, torches and vases The same designs appear in gilding on the mahogany doors [39]\n\n\nThe Queen's Small Salon or the White Salon (1835)\nThe White Salon was created in 1835 as a salon for Queen Marie-Amelie, the wife of King Louis Philippe to replace the Queen's Study of Marie de Medici Just one element of the 17th century salon, remains; paintings by Amboise Dubois depicting the legend of Tancred and Clorinda  It is one of the best examples of the 19th century style of Louis-Philippe, which blended together earlier styles; it combined wainscotting from the reign of Louis XV of France, along with a Louis XVI style fireplace, an Empire style chimney, and armchairs by Jacob-Freres and Jacob Desmalter and other prominent designers of the early 19th century [39]\n\n\nBed chamber of the Kings of France and Throne Room of Napoleon\nIn 1808 Napoleon decided to install his throne in the former bedroom of the kings of France from Henry IV to Louis XVI, on the place where the royal bed had been Under the Ancien régime, the King's bed was a symbol of royal authority in France and was saluted by courtiers who passed by it Napoleon wanted to show the continuity of his Empire with the past monarchies of France [40] The majority of the carved wood ceiling, the lower part of the wood panelling, and the doors date to the reign of Louis XIII The ceiling directly over the throne was made at the end of the reign of Louis XIV Louis XV created the portion of the ceiling directly over the throne, a new chimney, sculpted wooden medallions near the fireplace, the designs over the doors, and the fine carved woodwork facing the throne (1752–54) He also had the ceiling painted white and gilded and decorated with mosaics, to match the ceiling of the bedroom of the Queen [40]\n\n\nCouncil Chamber\nThe Council Chamber, where French Kings and later the Emperors Napoleon I and Napoleon III  met their closest advisors, was close to the Throne Room It was originally the office of Francis I, and was decorated with painted wooden panels with illustrations by Primaticcio depicting the virtues and the heroes of antiquity The room was enlarged under Louis XIV, and the decorator, Claude Audran, followed the same theme [42]\n\n\nApartment of Napoleon\nIn 1804 Napoleon decided that he wanted his own apartments within the palace, separate from the old royal apartments He took over a suite of six rooms which had been created in 1786 for Louis XVI, next to the Gallery of Francis I, and had them redecorated in the Empire style.\nThe old apartment included a dressing room (cabinet de toilette), study, library, and bath [45]\n\n\nEmperor's bedchamber\nBeginning in 1808, Napoleon had his bedchamber  relocated the former dressing room of the King From this room, using a door hidden behind the drapery to the right of the bed, Napoleon could go directly to his private library or to the offices on the ground floor [46] [45]\n\n\nOther rooms in the Emperor's apartment\nThe small bedchamber often served as Napoleon's work room In 1811 he added the camp bed, similar to the bed he used on his military campaigns He could rest briefly, then take a back stairway to continue working in the library or map room on the floor below.\n\n\nApartment of the Pope and the Queen-Mothers\nThe apartment of the Pope, located on the first floor of the wing of the Queen Mothers and of the Gros Pavillon, takes its name from the 1804 visit of Pope Pius VII, who stayed there on his way to Paris to crown Napoleon the Emperor of France He stayed there again, involuntarily, under the close supervision of Napoleon from 1812 to 1814 [49]\n\n\nChapel of the Trinity (17th century)\nThe Chapel of the Trinity was begun at the end of the reign of Francis I to replace the old chapel of the convent of the Trinitarians It was finished under Henry II, but was without decoration until 1608, when the painter Martin Freminet was commissioned to design frescoes for the ceiling and walls The sculptor Barthèlemy Tremblay created the vaults of the ceiling out of stucco and sculpture [52] The paintings of Freminet in the central vaults depict the redemption of Man, from the appearance of God to Noah at the launching of the Ark (Over the tribune) to the Annunciation They surrounded these with smaller paintings depicting the ancestors of the Virgin Mary, the kings of Judah, the Patriarchs announcing the coming of Christ, and the Virtues Between 1613 and 1619 Freminet and Tremblay added paintings in stucco frames between the windows on the sides of the chapel, depicting the life of Christ [53] Freminet died in 1619 and work did not resume until 1628 [52]\n\n\nRoom of the Guards (begun 1570s, redone in 19th century)\nA room for the guards was always located next to the royal bedchambers The Salle des Gardes was built during the reign of Charles IX Some traces of the original decor remain from the 1570s, including the vaulted ceiling and a frieze of military trophies attributed to Ruggiero d'Ruggieri In the 19th century Louis Philippe turned the room into a salon and redecorated it with a new parquet floor of exotic woods echoing the design of the ceiling, and a monumental fireplace (1836), which incorporates pieces of ornament from demolished rooms from 15th and early 16th century The bust of Henry IV, attributed to Mathieu Jacquet, is from that period, as are the two figures on either side of the fireplace The sculpted frame around the bust, by Pierre Bontemps, was originally in the bedchamber of Henry II The decorations added by Louis Philippe include a large vase decorated with Renaissance themes, made by the Sèvres porcelain manufactory in 1832 During the reign of Napoleon III, the hall was used as a dining room [57] [58]\n\n\nGallery of Diana\nThe Gallery of Diana, an eighty-meter (242.4 feet) long corridor now lined with bookcases, was created by Henry IV at the beginning of the 17th century as a place for the Queen to promenade The paintings on the vaulted ceiling, painted beginning in 1605 by Ambroise Dubois and his workshop, represented scenes from the myth of Diana, goddess of the Hunt [59] At the beginning of the 19th century, the gallery was in ruins In 1810 Napoleon decided to turn it into a gallery devoted to the achievements of his Empire A few of the paintings still in good condition were removed and put in the Gallery of Plates The architect Hurtault designed a new plan for the gallery, inspired by the Grande Galerie of the Louvre, featuring paintings on the ceiling illustrating the great events of Napoleon's reign By 1814 the corridor had been rebuilt and the decorative painted frames painted by Moench and Redouté, but the cycle of paintings on the Empire had not been started, when Napoleon fell from power [60]\n\n\nChinese Museum\nThe Chinese Museum, on the ground floor of the Gros Pavillon close to the pond, was among the last rooms decorated within the château while it was still an imperial residence In 1867, the Empress Eugénie had the rooms remade to display her personal collection of Asian art, which included gifts given to the Emperor by a delegation sent by the King of Siam in 1861, and other objects taken during the destruction and looting of the Old Summer Palace near Beijing by a joint British-French military expedition to China in 1860 [61] [62]\n\n\nTheatre\nConcerts, plays and other theatrical productions were a regular part of court life at Fontainebleau Prior to the reign of Louis XV these took place in different rooms of the palace, but during his reign a theatre was built in the Belle-Cheminée wing It was rebuilt by the architect Gabriel, but was destroyed by a fire in 1856 It had already been judged too small for the court of Napoleon III, and a new theatre had been begun in 1854 at the far eastern end of the wing of Louis XIV It was designed by architect Hector Lefuel in the Louis XVI style, and was inspired by the Royal Opera of Versailles and the Théâtre de la Reine at the Petit Trianon The new theatre, with four hundred seats arranged in a parterre, two balconies and boxes in a horseshoe shape, was finished in 1856 It has the original stage machinery, and many of the original sets, including many transferred from the old theatre before the fire of 1856 [64] [65]\n\n\nPark and gardens\nThe gardens of Fontainebleau illustrate three centuries of French landscape gardening When Francis I began building the château, he surrounded it with formal gardens In the 16th century Catherine de' Medici created a French Renaissance garden, inspired by the Italian Renaissance garden, filled with statuary Henry IV greatly expanded the gardens Between 1606 and 1609, Henry built a grand canal that extended for 1200 meters in length, similar to one at the nearby château of Fleury-en-Bière Louis XIV commissioned André Le Nôtre to create a distinctly classical French formal garden at the end of the 18th century During the First Empire of Napoleon I, the royal landscape architect, Maximilien Joseph Hurtault, created an English landscape garden with winding paths and picturesque groves of trees [66]\n\n\nGarden of Diana\nThe Garden of Diana, the goddess of the hunt,  was created during the reign of Henry IV; it was the private garden of the King and Queen, and was visible from the windows of their rooms The fountain of Diana was originally in the center of garden, which at that time was enclosed by another wing, containing offices and later, under, Louis XIV, an orangerie That building, and another, the former chancellery, were demolished in the 19th century, doubling the size of the garden \n [69]\n\n\nCarp pond and the pavilion\nThe large pond next to the palace, with a surface of four hectares, was first stocked with carp during the reign of Henry IV, and was used for boating parties by members of the Court, and as a source of fish for the table and for amusement [72] Descriptions of the palace in the 17th century tell of guests feeding the carp, some of which reached enormous size, and were said to be a hundred years old The small octagonal house on an island in the center of the lake, Pavillon de l'Ètang, was added during the reign of Louis XIV, then rebuilt under Napoleon I, and is decorated with his initial [67] [69]\n\n\nEnglish garden\nThe garden was originally created by Francis I as the Pine Garden At the far corner of the English garden close to the palace is the only remaining element of the original gardens of Francis I; the first Renaissance-style grotto to be built in a French garden, decorated with four statues of Atlas [72]\n\n\nArt and decoration – the School of Fontainebleau\nDuring the late French Renaissance, the decoration of the Palace of Fontainebleau engaged some of the finest artists and craftsmen from Italy and France The style of painting and decoration they created became known as the School of Fontainebleau, and covered a period from about 1530 until about 1610 It helped form the French version of Northern Mannerism [75]\n\n\nMuseum of Napoleon I\nThe Museum of Napoleon I was created in 1986 in the wing on the right side of the Court of Honor, where the apartments of the princes of the First Empire had been located It includes a gallery of portraits of members of Napoleon's family, medals and decorations, several costumes worn during Napoleon's coronation as Emperor, and a gold leaf from the crown he wore during the coronation; a large collection of porcelain and decorative objectives from the Imperial dining table, and a cradle, toys, and other souvenirs from the Emperor's son, the King of Rome It also has a collection of souvenirs from his military campaigns, including a recreation of his tent and its furnishings and practical items which he took with him on his campaigns [76]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNotes and

Following the release of \"Karma\", Smith's song was released as a single after gaining traction online. Siwa's version of \"Karma\" was a significant departure from her previous work, showcasing a more mature and edgy sound.\n\n**Reception**\n-------------\n\n\"Karma\" was panned by music critics, criticizing the song and Siwa's reinvention of her brand and aesthetic. Ivan Guzman, writing for a prominent music publication, called the song \"raucous\" and \"early 2010s-esque\", while drag queen Aquaria compared the song to \"early-2010s Jeffree Star\". For Exclaim!, Sydney Brasil labelled the song as \"poorly produced\" with \"no real hook\" and wrote that Siwa did not seem fully committed to her \"new ['bad girl'] persona\".

She also said that she \" [doesn't] know who Brit Smith is\". Smith expressed her amazement at her version going viral, stating she was shocked that her song has now \"got a new life, which is amazing\". Smith later defended Siwa on her TikTok account, stating that Siwa \"did not steal\" the song, and \"was totally in the right\" in regards to recording her version, adding that Siwa had \"done nothing wrong\".\n\n**Music Video**\n----------------\n\nThe music video for \"Karma\", filmed in March 2024, was directed by Siwa and Marc Klasfeld, with choreography by Richy Jackson.

of businessmen decided to create a major team in the French capital [1] [2] Guy Crescent and Pierre-Étienne Guyot chose to merge their virtual side, Paris FC, created in 1969, with Stade Saint-Germain of Henri Patrelle after the team from Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 15 km west of Paris and founded in 1904, won promotion to Division 2 [1] [2] [3] However, the three men were stuck with the financial

fans had financially contributed in the making of a club [8] The merger was made official following the creation of the club's association on 12 August 1970 [6] PSG retains this day as their foundation date [1]\n\n\nTop-flight return and Parc des Princes move (1973–1978)\nParis Saint-Germain really took flight with the arrival of fashion designer Daniel Hechter as chairman of the management committee in June 1973 [1] [17] Besides offering his financial support to the club, he also designed the team's classic home outfit [13] [18] Hechter then shocked the national game ahead of 1973–74 by appointing French legend Just Fontaine as sporting director [9] [10]\n\n\nFirst major honours and decline (1978–1991)\nFollowing the arrival of manager Georges Peyroche in November 1979, [24] the club established itself as a top-half team and then welcomed its first major honour when the Parisians reached their first French Cup final in 1982 [13] [25] [26] [27] Up against the great Saint-Étienne of Michel Platini at the Parc des Princes, Nambatingue Toko opened the scoring for PSG following a good cross from Ivica Šurjak Saint-Étienne reacted and Platini equalized to send the game to extra-time Platini then doubled his personal account, giving the Greens the lead [20] [21] [28] The Parc des Princes faithful no longer believed in their team when Dominique Rocheteau, after yet another assist from Šurjak, scored an unexpected equalizer in the last seconds of the match [20] [21] PSG fans invaded the field in joy, while club president Francis Borelli kneeled and kissed the lawn of the Parc [20] [28] Following an interruption of 30 minutes, the penalty shootout sealed PSG's coronation [21] [28] Dominique Baratelli stopped Saint-Étienne's last attempt and Jean-Marc Pilorget scored the winning penalty for the capital side [20] [28] This success opened the doors to Europe, where PSG made an impressive continental debut in reaching the quarterfinals of the 1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup [12] [29]\n\n\nCanal+ takeover and golden era (1991–1998)\nThe takeover by television giants Canal+ in 1991 revitalised Paris Saint-Germain as they became one of the richest clubs in France [1] [18] Canal+ wiped out PSG's huge debt and appointed Michel Denisot, journalist on the channel, as club president in place of Francis Borelli [18] [38] Now enjoying serious investment, the Red and Blues were able to set their sights steadily higher: they had to qualify for European competitions in their first season and become French champions within three years [9] [38] In consequence, Canal+ increased the club's budget from 90 to 120 million francs in order to build a strong squad for the 1991–92 season [9] [38] The revolution began with the appointment of renowned coach Artur Jorge, famous for leading Porto to the 1986–87 European Cup trophy The club then embarked on a spending spree, signing Brazilian stars Ricardo and Valdo as well as proven French players Paul Le Guen, Laurent Fournier, Patrick Colleter and prolific Liberian striker George Weah [38]\n\n\nCrisis mode and relegation battles (1998–2011)\nPSG then went into decline following years of mismanagement [12] In the summer 2000, PSG spent heavily on new players signing Nicolas Anelka, Peter Luccin and Stéphane Dalmat as part of the \"PSG Banlieue\" project of its shareholder Canal+, with the goal of winning Ligue 1 and performing a solid UEFA Champions League campaign but it was a failure [12] In 2003, the club faced a massive financial loss with a deficit of €65 million, leading Canal+ to fire Luis Fernandez as coach and Laurent Perpère as president and replacing them with Vahid Halilhodžić, who became the new coach and Francis Graille the new president [12] The club's form dwindled as they slipped further down the table and eventually, a split from owners Canal+ became inevitable [9] [12]\n\n\nQSI ownership and domestic dominance (2011–present)\nAfter two years of solid progress and stability under the stewardship of manager Antoine Kombouaré and president Robin Leproux, the fortunes of Paris Saint-Germain changed dramatically when Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) purchased the club in 2011 [12] The takeover made PSG not only the richest club in France but one of the wealthiest in the world [51] Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi pledged to form a team capable of winning the UEFA Champions League and making the club France's biggest name [12] [52]\n\n\nIdentity\nSince their foundation, Paris Saint-Germain have represented both the city of Paris and the nearby royal town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye [12] As a result, red, blue and white are the club's traditional colours [97] The red and blue are Parisian colours, a nod to revolutionary figures Lafayette and Jean Sylvain Bailly, and the white is a symbol of French royalty and Saint-Germain-en-Laye [97] [98]\n\n\nColours and mascot\nSince their foundation, Paris Saint-Germain have represented both the city of Paris and the nearby royal town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye [12] As a result, red, blue and white are the club's traditional colours [97] The red and blue are Parisian colours, a nod to

Saint-Germain Football Club, commonly referred to as Paris Saint-Germain or PSG, is a French professional football club based in Paris. The club was founded in 1970 through the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain, and has since become one of the most successful and popular clubs in French football.\n\nHistory\n\n## Creation and Split (1970-1973)\n\nIn the summer of 1970, an ambitious group of businessmen decided to create a major team in the French capital. Guy Crescent and Pierre-Étienne Guyot chose to merge their virtual side, Paris FC, created in 1969, with Stade Saint-Germain of Henri Patrelle after the team from Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 15 km west of Paris and founded in 1904, won promotion to Division 2. However, the three men were stuck with the financial feasibility of the project until they met Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabéu. He told them that starting a crowdfunding campaign was the best solution to establish a new team. 20,000 people backed the project and Paris Saint-Germain were formed on 17 June 1970. Guyot was elected the club's first president a few days later. For the first time in French football history, the fans had financially contributed in the making of a club. The merger was made official following the creation of the club's association on 12 August 1970. PSG retains this day as their foundation date.\n\n## Top-Flight Return and Parc des Princes Move (1973-1978)\n\nParis Saint-Germain really took flight with the arrival of fashion designer Daniel Hechter as chairman of the management committee in June 1973. Besides offering his financial support to the club, he also designed the team's classic home outfit. Hechter then shocked the national game ahead of 1973–74 by appointing French legend Just Fontaine as sporting director.\n\n## First Major Honours and Decline (1978-1991)\n\nFollowing the arrival of manager Georges Peyroche in November 1979, the club established itself as a top-half team and then welcomed its first major honour when the Parisians reached their first French Cup final in 1982. Up against the great Saint-Étienne of Michel Platini at the Parc des Princes, Nambatingue Toko opened the scoring for PSG following a good cross from Ivica Šurjak. Saint-Étienne reacted and Platini equalized to send the game to extra-time. Platini then doubled his personal account, giving the Greens the lead. The Parc des Princes faithful no longer believed in their team when Dominique Rocheteau, after yet another assist from Šurjak, scored an unexpected equalizer in the last seconds of the match. PSG fans invaded the field in joy, while club president Francis Borelli kneeled and kissed the lawn of the Parc. Following an interruption of 30 minutes, the penalty shootout sealed PSG's coronation. Dominique Baratelli stopped Saint-Étienne's last attempt and Jean-Marc Pilorget scored the winning penalty for the capital side. This success opened the doors to Europe, where PSG made an impressive continental debut in reaching the quarterfinals of the 1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup.\n\n## Canal+ Takeover and Golden Era (1991-1998)\n\nThe takeover by television giants Canal+ in 1991 revitalised Paris Saint-Germain as they became one of the richest clubs in France. Canal+ wiped out PSG's huge debt and appointed Michel Denisot, journalist on the channel, as club president in place of Francis Borelli. Now enjoying serious investment, the Red and Blues were able to set their sights steadily higher: they had to qualify for European competitions in their first season and become French champions within three years. In consequence, Canal+ increased the club's budget from 90 to 120 million francs in order to build a strong squad for the 1991–92 season. The revolution began with the appointment of renowned coach Artur Jorge, famous for leading Porto to the 1986–87 European Cup trophy. The club then embarked on a spending spree, signing Brazilian stars Ricardo and Valdo as well as proven French players Paul Le Guen, Laurent Fournier, Patrick Colleter and prolific Liberian striker George Weah.\n\n## Crisis Mode and Relegation Battles (1998-2011)\n\nPSG then went into decline following years of mismanagement. In the summer 2000, PSG spent heavily on new players signing Nicolas Anelka, Peter Luccin and Stéphane Dalmat as part of the \"PSG Banlieue\" project of its shareholder Canal+, with the goal of winning Ligue 1 and performing a solid UEFA Champions League campaign but it was a failure. In 2003, the club faced a massive financial loss with a deficit of €65 million, leading Canal+ to fire Luis Fernandez as coach and Laurent Perpère as president and replacing them with Vahid Halilhodžić, who became the new coach and Francis Graille the new president. The club's form dwindled as they slipped further down the table and eventually, a split from owners Canal+ became inevitable.\n\n## QSI Ownership and Domestic Dominance (2011-Present)\n\nAfter two years of solid progress and stability under the stewardship of manager Antoine Kombouaré and president Robin Leproux, the fortunes of Paris Saint-Germain changed dramatically when Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) purchased the club in 2011. The takeover made PSG not only the richest club in France but one of the wealthiest in the world. Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi pledged to form a team capable of winning the UEFA Champions League and making the club France's biggest name.\n\nIdentity\n\nSince their foundation, Paris Saint-Germain have represented both the city of Paris and the nearby royal town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. As a result, red, blue and white are the club's traditional colours. The red and blue are Parisian colours, a nod to revolutionary figures Lafayette and Jean Sylvain Bailly, and the white is a symbol of French royalty and Saint-Germain-en-Laye.\n\nColours and Mascot\n\nSince their foundation, Paris Saint-Germain have represented both the city of Paris and the nearby royal town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

Europe, where PSG made an impressive continental debut in reaching the quarterfinals of the 1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup [12] [29]\n\n\nCanal+ takeover and golden era (1991–1998)\nThe takeover by television giants Canal+ in 1991 revitalised Paris Saint-Germain as they became one of the richest clubs in France [1] [18] Canal+ wiped out PSG's huge debt and appointed Michel Denisot, journalist on the channel, as club president in place of Francis Borelli [18] [38] Now enjoying serious investment, the Red and Blues were able to set their sights steadily higher: they had to qualify for European competitions in their first season and become French champions within three years [9] [38] In consequence, Canal+ increased the club's budget from 90 to 120 million francs in order to build a strong squad for the 1991–92 season [9] [38] The revolution began with the appointment of renowned coach Artur Jorge, famous for leading Porto to the 1986–87 European Cup trophy The club then embarked on a spending spree, signing Brazilian stars Ricardo and Valdo as well as proven French players Paul Le Guen, Laurent Fournier, Patrick Colleter and prolific Liberian striker George Weah [38]\n\n\nCrisis mode and relegation battles (1998–2011)\nPSG then went into decline following years of mismanagement [12] In the summer 2000, PSG spent heavily on new players signing Nicolas Anelka, Peter Luccin and Stéphane Dalmat as part of the \"PSG Banlieue\" project of its shareholder Canal+, with the goal of winning Ligue 1 and performing a solid UEFA Champions League campaign but it was a failure [12] In 2003, the club faced a massive financial loss with a deficit of €65 million, leading Canal+ to fire Luis Fernandez as coach and Laurent Perpère as president and replacing them with Vahid Halilhodžić, who became the new coach and Francis Graille the new president [12] The club's form dwindled as they slipped further down the table and eventually, a split from owners Canal+ became inevitable [9] [12]\n\n\nQSI ownership and domestic dominance (2011–present)\nAfter two years of solid progress and stability under the stewardship of manager Antoine Kombouaré and president Robin Leproux, the fortunes of Paris Saint-Germain changed dramatically when Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) purchased the club in 2011 [12] The takeover made PSG not only the richest club in France but one of the wealthiest in the world [51] Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi pledged to form a team capable of winning the UEFA Champions League and making the club France's biggest name [12] [52]\n\n\nIdentity\nSince their foundation, Paris Saint-Germain have represented both the city of Paris and the nearby royal town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye [12] As a result, red, blue and white are the

fan from the start, she was part of an association of hundreds of celebrities who contributed to the foundation of the club in 1970 [102] [103] The club's second anthem, \"Allez Paris-Saint-Germain!\" by Les Parisiens, was recorded in 1977, replacing Cordy's version The brainchild of historical PSG leader and music producer Charles Talar, he produced and released it under his homonym record label [104] [105] [106] The song's chorus became a popular chant among PSG supporters during games [107] A new version, also called \"Allez Paris-Saint-Germain!\", was recorded in 2010 as part of the club's 40th anniversary celebrations Sung to the tune of \"Go West\" by Village People, the lyrics were rewritten with suggestions made by fans This is the club's current official anthem [98] [101]

Portman was just 13 years old at the time and was initially hesitant to take on the role due to its mature themes and content. However, after meeting with Besson and discussing the script, she decided to accept the part. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Portman's performance earned her widespread recognition and acclaim.\n\n## 1999–2006: Star Wars, Education, and Transition to Adult Roles\n\nIn 1997, Portman began filming the part of Padmé Amidala in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The first film, Episode I – The Phantom Menace, was released in 1999 when she was in her senior year of high school. Portman was unfamiliar with the franchise when she was cast and watched the original Star Wars trilogy before filming began. She worked closely with director George Lucas on her character's accent and mannerisms and drew inspiration from the films of Lauren Bacall, Audrey Hepburn, and Katharine Hepburn.\n\nPortman's experience working on the Star Wars franchise was marked by challenging filming locations and grueling schedules. However, she has stated that the experience was also rewarding and helped her to develop her skills as an actress. The critical response to the film was mixed, but with earnings of $924 million worldwide, it was the second-highest-grossing film of all time to that point, and it established Portman as a global star.\n\n## 2007–2015: Career Expansion and Black Swan\n\nIn 2007, Portman began working on the romantic drama My Blueberry Nights, directed by Wong Kar-wai. She played the role of a gambler and trained with a poker coach to prepare for the part. Richard Corliss of Time magazine praised Portman's performance, stating that she brought a \"vibrancy, grittiness, and ache\" to the role. Her next appearance was in Hotel Chevalier, a short film from Wes Anderson, which served as a prologue to his feature The Darjeeling Limited.\n\nPortman's performance in Hotel Chevalier marked a departure from her typical roles, as she performed an extended nude scene. However, she later expressed disappointment at the undue focus on the scene and vowed to avoid appearing nude in the future. Portman's career continued to expand, and she appeared in a range of films, including Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium and Paul McCartney's music video \"Dance Tonight.\"\n\n## 2016–present: Jackie and Production Ventures\n\nIn 2016, Portman portrayed Jacqueline Kennedy in the Pablo Larraín-directed biopic Jackie. She was initially intimidated by the prospect of taking on the role of a well-known public figure, but she threw herself into the role, researching Kennedy extensively and working with a dialect coach to adopt her unique speaking style. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter praised Portman's performance, stating that she brought an \"incandescent\" portrayal to the role.\n\nPortman's performance in Jackie earned her widespread critical acclaim, and she won the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress. She also received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In addition to her acting work, Portman has also ventured into production, serving as producer on the comedy horror film Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. She has also starred in the French-Belgian drama Planetarium and the experimental romance Song to Song.\n\n## Political Views and Activism\n\nPortman is an advocate for animal rights and has been a vegetarian since the age of eight. She became a vegan in 2009 after reading Jonathan Safran Foer's Eating Animals. Portman has produced a documentary on factory farming systems in the U.S. and has been recognized for her work by the Environmental Media Association Awards. She has also launched her own brand of animal-friendly footwear and has been an advocate for environmental causes since childhood.\n\n## Personal Life and Endorsements\n\nPortman was married to French dancer and choreographer Benjamin Millepied in 2012. The couple has two children and has expressed a desire to become a French citizen. Portman has been living in Los Angeles in recent years and has been involved in various charitable endeavors. In 2017, she bought a Montecito mansion, which she sold in 2021 for $8 million.\n\n## Filmography and Awards\n\nPortman's most acclaimed and highest-grossing films include Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, Closer, Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, V for Vendetta, Black Swan, No Strings Attached, Thor, Thor: The Dark World, Jackie, Annihilation, and Thor: Love and Thunder.

Mappila) and Jews (Yuda Mappila) [39] [40] Some Syrian Christians of Travancore continue to attach this honorific title to their names [41] The Government of India designates members of the community as Syrian Christians, a term originating with the Dutch colonial authority that distinguishes the Saint Thomas Christians, who used Syriac (within East Syriac Rite or West Syriac Rite) as their liturgical language, from newly evangelised Christians who followed the Roman Rite [42] The terms Syrian or Syriac relate not to their ethnicity but to their historical, religious and liturgical connection to the Church of the East, or East Syriac Church [39]\n\n\nEthnic divisions\nInternally the Saint Thomas Christian community is divided into two ethnic groups, the majority Vadakkumbhagar or Northist and the minority Tekkumbhagar or Southist Saint Thomas Christian tradition traces the origin of these ethno-geographical epithets to the city of Kodungallur, the historic capital of the medieval Chera dynasty The early converts of Saint Thomas the Apostle and those who later joined the faith in India are believed to have initially resided on the northern side of the city of Kodungallur and for that reason became known as Vadakkumbhagar or Northist [43] [44] [45] [46]\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to tradition, Thomas the Apostle came to Muziris on the Kerala coast in AD 52 [48] [49] [10] which is in present-day Pattanam, near Kodungallur, Kerala [50]\n\n\nOrigin\nAccording to tradition, Thomas the Apostle came to Muziris on the Kerala coast in AD 52 [48] [49] [10] which is in present-day Pattanam, near Kodungallur, Kerala [50]\n\n\nClassical period\nAs the community grew and immigration by East Syriac Christians increased, the connection with the Church of the East, centred in the Persian capital of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, strengthened From the early 4th century the Patriarch of the Church of the East provided India with clergy, holy texts, and ecclesiastical infrastructure, and around 650 Patriarch Ishoyahb III solidified the Church of the East's jurisdiction over the Saint Thomas Christian community [85] [86] In the 8th century Patriarch Timothy I organised the community as the Ecclesiastical Province of India, one of the church's Provinces of the Exterior [13] After this point the Province of India was headed by a metropolitan bishop, dispatched from Persia, the \"Metropolitan-Bishop of the Seat of Saint Thomas and the Whole Christian Church of India\" [9] [12] His metropolitan see was probably in Cranganore, or (perhaps nominally) in Mylapore, where the shrine of Thomas was located [12] Under him were a varying number of bishops, as well as a native Archdeacon, who had authority over the clergy and who wielded a great amount of secular power [12]\n\n\nPortuguese contact\nThe Saint Thomas Christians first encountered the Portuguese in 1498, during the expedition of Vasco da Gama At the time the community was in a tenuous position: though thriving in the spice trade and protected by their own militia, the local political sphere was volatile and the Saint Thomas Christians found themselves under pressure from the rajas of Calicut and Cochin and other small kingdoms in the area The Saint Thomas Christians and the Portuguese newcomers quickly formed an alliance [113]\n\n\nDivision and defiance\nOver the next several decades, tensions seethed between the Portuguese and the remaining native hierarchy, and after 1641 Archdeacon Thomas, the nephew and successor to Archdeacon George of Cross, was often at odds with the Latin prelates [124] In 1652, the escalating situation was further complicated by the appearance in Mylapore of a mysterious figure named Ahatallah, who claimed to have been sent by the Pope, from the Church of Antioch to serve as \"Patriarch of the Whole of India and of China\" [124] [125]\n\n\nFailed attempts for reunification and solidification of the schism\nA minority within the community of Saint Thomas Christians tried to preserve the use of the East Syriac Rite and re-establishing ties with Patriarchs of the Church of the East, who occasionally sent envoys to India [25] At the beginning of the 18th century, Bishop Shemʿon of ʿAda (d c 1720) [153] and in (c 1708), Bishop Gabriel of Ardishai (d c 1733) arrived to India, sent by the Chaldean Patriarch [25] Bishop Gabriel temporarily succeeded in reviving the traditionalist community, but was faced with prolonged rivalry, both from West Syriac (Jacobite) and Latin Catholic (Propaganda Fide and Padroado) leadership [154]\n\n\nBritish period\nIn 1795, the kings of Travancore and Cochin entered into tributary alliance with the British East Indian Company to repel the attacks from Tipu Sultan The states soon became client regimes of the company: both were forced to disband their military The political order of the states also began to collapse Saint Thomas Christians were hit hard by the loss of their privileged military role, their kalari network was dissolved and many families lost their livelihood [168] The trading class, as well as the office bearers, also suffered the setback and many Europeans who visited the states between 1801 and 1820 noted the poor and depressed condition of Saint Thomas Christians of the Puthenkur Some partisan fund allocation for the churches by the British officials triggered a breakdown in the relationship between Saint Thomas Christians and prominent Hindu castes, at least temporarily [169] In 1815, the British Resident, Colonel John Munro, founded a seminary in Kottayam, for the theological education of Jacobite Christian priests and invited the Anglican missionaries to teach there This could be regarded as the beginning of the relationship between the CMS (Church Mission Society) and the Saint Thomas Christians of the Puthenkur [170]\n\n\nFurther divisions\nAs a protest against the interference of the Anglican Church in the affairs of the Puthenkur faction of the Saint Thomas Christians, the Metropolitan, Cheppad Dionysios, convened a Synod at Mavelikara on 16 January 1836 There it was declared that Malankara Church would be subject to the Syrian traditions and Patriarch of Antioch [171] The declaration resulted in the separation of the CMS missionaries from the communion with the Malankara Church [34] [172] Cheppad Dionysios, abdicated during the tenure of an Antiochian prelate named Yuyakim Koorilose [173] (arrived c. 1846, d. c. 1874) [23] During his stay in among the Puthenkur, Koorilose completed the transition to West Syriac ritual practices [173] However, a minority from the Malankara Church, who were in favour of the Reformed ideologies of the missionaries, stood along with them and joined the Anglican Church [34] [172] These Saint Thomas Anglicans, were the first Reformed group to emerge from the Saint Thomas Christian community and they worked along with the missionaries in their evangelical, educational and reformative activities [34] [174] [175] By 1879, the Diocese of Travancore and Cochin of the Church of England was established in Kottayam [176] [177] On 27 September 1947, the Anglican dioceses in South India, merged with other Protestant churches in the region and formed the Church of South India (CSI); an independent United Church in full communion with all its predecessor denominations [35] [36] Since then, Anglican Syrian Christians have been members of the Church of South India and also came to be known as CSI Syrian Christians [177]\n\n\nInvolvement in politics\nParticipation based on caste and community divisions and sympathies has been a feature of politics in the present day state of Kerala and its predecessor entities Until the mid-20th century the primary cause of the divisions between the various communities was competition for rights and resources.\n\n\nSocio-cultural and religious identity\nSt Thomas Christians are a distinct community, both in terms of culture and religion Though their liturgy and theology remained that of East-Syrian Christians of Persia, their life-style customs and traditions were basically Indian It is oft-quoted: \"Nazranis are Indian in culture, Christian in faith and Syrian in liturgy\" [223]\n\n\nExisting traditions, music, rituals and social life\nSaint Thomas Christians still retain many of their ancient traditions and rituals, both in their social and religious life Saint Thomas Christian services have many unique characteristics compared to others Prior to the 1970s, the Nasrani Qurbana was completely sung in Syriac Many of the tunes of the Saint Thomas Christian worship in Kerala, especially those in the East Syriac tradition, are remnants of ancient Syriac tunes of antiquity [238] [239] [240]\n\n\nChurch architecture\nThe earliest documentary evidence is Tharisapally Copper Plate, which refers to the construction of the church of Tharisapally in Quilon between 823 and 849 AD Antonio Gouvea, Portuguese envoy to Malabar, mentions in his 16th-century work Jornada that almost all the churches of Saint Thomas Christians followed the models of Hindu temples of that period, but were distinguished by the huge granite cross in the front yard of the church Despite the external similarity with temples, the structuring of the interior space of the church always followed the East Syriac architectural theology Thus the contemporary style is formed as an amalgamation of Indian architecture and Assyrian liturgical concepts [258] The church is arranged east-to-west, with the interior structured into three levels: the madbaha (sanctuary), the qestroma (choir) and the haykla (nave).\n\n\nThe Persian Crosses\nThe East Syriac Churches of the St Thomas Christians have accepted the Persian cross as their symbol They call it the Nasrani Menorah [261] or Mar Thoma Sleeva (St Thomas' Cross) [262] There are several interpretations for the St Thomas Christian Symbol The interpretation based on Christian Jewish tradition assumes that its design was based on Jewish menorah, an ancient symbol of the Hebrews, which consists of seven branched lamp stand (candelabra) [261] The St Thomas' Cross also appears on the official emblem of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.\n\n\nToday\nWriting in 2010, Devika and Varghese noted that \" [The St Thomas Christians] are at present a substantial minority, a powerful presence in all fields of life in Kerala.\" [264]\n\n\nSocioeconomic status\nEven though the Saint Thomas Christians had to compromise their social and religious privileges in the aftermath of Portuguese subjugation, they started reemerging as a powerful community from the 19th century onward They played a pioneering role in many spheres such as banking, commerce, cash crops, print media, film industry etc [265] Around 2003, among Saint Thomas Christians, 17.4 percent of the adult population are self-employed–the highest rate statistically among all the communities in the state of Kerala [266] Saint Thomas Christians lead all others with respect to per capita ownership of land, with many of them owning large estates With changing conditions, they have shifted from the agriculture of rice and coconut to plantation based agriculture and the trading of rubber, spices and cash crops They also take a prominent role in the educational institutions of Kerala and throughout India [267] The educational accomplishments of the community have helped its members to attain a good proportion of the Central and State Government jobs [265] Kerala Government in the year 2024 happened to present the community wise account of the government employees in its Legislative Assembly  According to the data, out of the then total 5,45,423 government employees in the state, 73,713 are from forward Christian communities, ie., Saint Thomas Christians, which accounts for the 13.5 percent of the total government employees [268] [269] With their level of education and limited employment opportunities within the state of Kerala, they became the community with the highest rate of migration Their resultant foreign remittances have also helped the socioeconomic progress of the community According to the Kerala Migration Survey (1998) by the Center for Developmental Studies, Kerala, Saint Thomas Christians top all other communities in Kerala with respect to the Socioeconomic Development Index which is based on parameters such as the possession of land, housing & consumer durables, education and employment status [270]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe Saint Thomas Syrian Christians form 12.5 percent of the total population of Kerala and 70.73 percent of the Christians in the state [citation needed] K C Zachariah notes that the 20th century was period of significant transition for the Saint Thomas Christians in terms of its demographic and socioeconomic status Around 1900, the community was concentrated in a few areas, was geographically static and \"... was characterised by very high death rate, very high birth rate, very early age at marriage, and 10 to 12 children per married woman\" The population had increased eight-fold during the preceding century, from a base figure of about 100,000, and comprised nearly 50 per cent children But, the population growth of Saint Thomas Christians came down drastically after the 1960s, with the lowest birth rate, highest age at marriage, highest family planning user rate, and lowest fertility rate compared to other communities in Kerala The proportion of children has come down to less than 25 percent The absolute and relative size of the community is in a diminishing trend and is approaching a zero population growth regime [271]\n\n\nSyrian Christian caste status\nDespite the sectarian differences, Saint Thomas Syrian Christians share a common social status within the Caste system of Kerala and is considered as an Upper caste community [272]\n\n\nChristian conventions\nThe Maramon Convention is one of the largest annual Christian gatherings in Asia [276] It takes place in Maramon, near Kozhencherry, during February on the vast sand-bed of the Pamba River next to the Kozhencherry Bridge The first convention was held in March 1895 for 10 days.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nSources\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Introduction**\n\nThe Saint Thomas Christians, also known as Nasranis or Syrian Christians, are a distinct community in India, primarily residing in the state of Kerala. They have a rich history, culture, and traditions, shaped by their Christian faith and Indian heritage. This article provides an overview of the Saint Thomas Christians, their history, traditions, and current status.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe Saint Thomas Christians have been nicknamed such due to their reverence for Saint Thomas the Apostle, who is said to have brought Christianity to India. The name dates back to the period of Portuguese colonization. They are also known, especially locally, as Nasrani or Nasrani Mappila. The former means Christian; it appears to have been derived from the Hebrew word Netzer or the Aramaic Nasraya from Isaiah 11:1. Nasrani is evolved from the Syriac term for \"Christian\" that emerges from the Greek word Nazōraioi, Nazarene in English. Mappila is an honorific applied to members of non-Indian faiths and descendants of immigrants from the middle east who had intermarried with the local population, including Muslims (Jonaka Mappila) and Jews (Yuda Mappila).

The early Christian community in India was established by Thomas the Apostle and his followers, who arrived in the region in the 1st century AD. They were influenced by the local culture and traditions, and developed a unique form of Christianity that blended Eastern and Western elements. Over time, the community grew and prospered, and became known for its distinctive liturgical practices and traditions.\n\n**Classical period**\n\nAs the community grew and immigration by East Syriac Christians increased, the connection with the Church of the East, centred in the Persian capital of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, strengthened.

[36] Since then, Anglican Syrian Christians have been members of the Church of South India and also came to be known as CSI Syrian Christians [177]\n\n\nInvolvement in politics\nParticipation based on caste and community divisions and sympathies has been a feature of politics in the present day state of Kerala and its predecessor entities Until the mid-20th century the primary cause of the divisions between the various communities was competition for rights and resources.\n\n\nSocio-cultural and religious identity\nSt Thomas Christians are a distinct community, both in terms of culture and religion Though their liturgy and theology remained that of East-Syrian Christians of Persia, their life-style customs and traditions were basically Indian It is oft-quoted: \"Nazranis are Indian in culture, Christian in faith and Syrian in liturgy\" [223]\n\n\nExisting traditions, music, rituals and social life\nSaint Thomas Christians still retain many of their ancient traditions and rituals, both in their social and religious life Saint Thomas Christian services have many unique characteristics compared to others Prior to the 1970s, the Nasrani Qurbana was completely sung in Syriac Many of the tunes of the Saint Thomas Christian worship in Kerala, especially those in the East Syriac tradition, are remnants of ancient Syriac tunes of antiquity [238] [239] [240]\n\n\nChurch architecture\nThe earliest documentary evidence is Tharisapally Copper Plate, which refers to the construction of the church of Tharisapally in Quilon between 823 and 849 AD Antonio Gouvea, Portuguese envoy to Malabar, mentions in his 16th-century work Jornada that almost all the churches of Saint Thomas Christians followed the models of Hindu temples of that period, but were distinguished by the huge granite cross in the front yard of the church Despite the external similarity with temples, the structuring of the interior space of the church always followed the East Syriac architectural theology Thus the contemporary style is formed as an amalgamation of Indian architecture and Assyrian liturgical concepts [258] The church is arranged east-to-west, with the interior structured into three levels: the madbaha (sanctuary), the qestroma (choir) and the haykla (nave).\n\n\nThe Persian Crosses\nThe East Syriac Churches of the St Thomas Christians have accepted the Persian cross as their symbol They call it the Nasrani Menorah [261] or Mar Thoma Sleeva (St Thomas' Cross) [262] There are several interpretations for the St Thomas Christian Symbol The interpretation based on Christian Jewish tradition assumes that its design was based on Jewish menorah, an ancient symbol of the Hebrews, which consists of seven branched lamp stand (candelabra) [261] The St Thomas' Cross also appears on the official emblem of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.\n\n\nToday\nWriting in 2010, Devika and Varghese noted that \" [The St Thomas Christians] are at present a substantial minority, a powerful presence in all fields of life in Kerala.\" [264]\n\n\nSocioeconomic status\nEven though the Saint Thomas Christians had to compromise their social and religious privileges in the aftermath of Portuguese subjugation, they started reemerging as a powerful community from the 19th century onward They played a pioneering role in many spheres such as banking, commerce, cash crops, print media, film industry etc [265] Around 2003, among Saint Thomas Christians, 17.4 percent of the adult population are self-employed–the highest rate statistically among all the communities in the state of Kerala [266] Saint Thomas Christians lead all others with respect to per capita ownership of land, with many of them owning large estates With changing conditions, they have shifted from the agriculture of rice and coconut to plantation based agriculture and the trading of rubber, spices and cash crops They also take a prominent role in the educational institutions of Kerala and throughout India [267] The educational accomplishments of the community have helped its members to attain a good proportion of the Central and State Government jobs [265] Kerala Government in the year 2024 happened to present the community wise account of the government employees in its Legislative Assembly  According to the data, out of the then total 5,45,423 government employees in the state, 73,713 are from forward Christian communities, ie., Saint Thomas Christians, which accounts for the 13.5 percent of the total government employees [268] [269] With their level of education and limited employment opportunities within the state of Kerala, they became the community with the highest rate of migration Their resultant foreign remittances have also helped the socioeconomic progress of the community According to the Kerala Migration Survey (1998) by the Center for Developmental Studies, Kerala, Saint Thomas Christians top all other communities in Kerala with respect to the Socioeconomic Development Index which is based on parameters such as the possession of land, housing & consumer durables, education and employment status [270]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe Saint Thomas Syrian Christians form 12.5 percent of the total population of Kerala and 70.73 percent of the Christians in the state [citation needed] K C Zachariah notes that the 20th century was period of significant transition for the Saint Thomas Christians in terms of its demographic and socioeconomic status Around 1900, the community was concentrated in a few areas, was geographically static and \"... was characterised by very high death rate, very high birth rate, very early age at marriage, and 10 to 12 children per married woman\" The population had increased eight-fold during the preceding century, from a base figure of about 100,000, and comprised nearly 50 per cent children But, the population growth of Saint Thomas Christians came down drastically after the 1960s, with the lowest birth rate, highest age at marriage, highest family planning user rate, and lowest fertility rate compared to other communities in Kerala The proportion of children has come down to less than 25 percent The absolute and relative size of the community is in a diminishing trend and is approaching a zero population growth regime [271]\n\n\nSyrian Christian caste status\nDespite the sectarian differences, Saint Thomas Syrian Christians share a common social status within the Caste system of Kerala and is considered as an Upper caste community [272]\n\n\nChristian conventions\nThe Maramon Convention is one of the largest annual Christian gatherings in Asia [276] It takes place in Maramon, near Kozhencherry, during February on the vast sand-bed of the Pamba River next to the Kozhencherry Bridge The first convention was held in March 1895 for 10 days.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nSources\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

bid\nSeveral days after the publication of the CoinDesk article, on November 6, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said on Twitter that his firm intended to sell all its holdings of FTT [57] Binance had received FTT from FTX in 2021 during a transaction in which FTX bought back Binance's equity stake in FTX [58] Zhao cited \"recent revelations that came to light\" as the motivation for selling FTT [58] Bloomberg and TechCrunch reported that any sale by Binance would likely have an outsized impact on FTT's price, given the token's low trading volume [59] [60] The announcement by Zhao of the pending sale and disputes between Zhao and Bankman-Fried on Twitter led to a decline in the price of FTT and other cryptocurrencies, [61] resulting in a three-day depositor sell-off, like a bank run, of an estimated $6 billion that sent FTX into crisis [62] On November 8, Zhao announced that Binance had entered into a non-binding agreement to purchase FTX due to what he referred to as a \"liquidity crisis\" at FTX [63] [64] The deal did not include the sale of FTX.US [63] Zhao announced on Twitter that the company would complete due diligence soon, adding that all cryptocurrency

Alameda could make investments with the money [51] On November 12, anonymous sources cited by the Wall Street Journal said Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison disclosed to other Alameda employees that she,

fears\nThe exchange token of Crypto.com, Cronos, lost approximately $1 billion in value in November, [109] a decline attributed in part due to the collapse of FTX and in part due to reporting that

It was developed at Emory University and has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19.\n\n**Medical Uses**\n\nIn the UK, molnupiravir is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test and who have at least one risk factor for developing severe illness. This includes individuals with underlying health conditions, older adults, and those who are immunocompromised.\n\n**Contraindications**\n\nUse of molnupiravir during pregnancy is not recommended due to a lack of human data on its safety and efficacy in this population. The drug may cause fetal harm, and its effects on the developing fetus are unknown.\n\n**Adverse Effects**\n\nAdverse reactions observed in the phase III MOVe-OUT study included diarrhea, nausea, and dizziness, all of which were mild or moderate. These reactions were reported in a small percentage of participants and were not severe enough to require hospitalization.\n\n**Overdose**\n\nThe effects of overdose are unknown, and treatment consists of general supportive measures such as monitoring of clinical status. It is essential to seek medical attention immediately if a patient experiences any symptoms of overdose.\n\n**Drug Interactions**\n\nThere are no known drug interactions with molnupiravir based on limited available data. However, it is essential to inform healthcare providers of all medications being taken to ensure safe and effective treatment.\n\n**Mechanism of Action**\n\nMolnupiravir works by inhibiting viral reproduction through the promotion of widespread mutations in the replication of viral RNA by RNA-directed RNA polymerase. It is metabolized into a ribonucleoside analog that resembles cytidine, which is then incorporated into newly made RNA instead of real cytidine.\n\n**Chemistry**\n\nThe first synthesis of molnupiravir was disclosed in a patent filed by Emory University in 2018. The compound is a prodrug, meaning it is converted into an active form in the body.\n\n**History**\n\nMolnupiravir was developed at Emory University by its drug innovation company, Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE). In 2014, DRIVE began a screening project funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to find an antiviral drug targeting Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). The discovery of EIDD-1931, a precursor to molnupiravir, led to the development of the compound.\n\n**Society and Culture**\n\nIn September 2021, Merck signed a voluntary licensing agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) that allows MPP to sublicense molnupiravir and supply the COVID-19 oral medication to 105 low- and middle-income countries. The cost of the US government's initial purchase was about $712 per course of treatment, while treatment with generics in developing countries can cost as little as $20.\n\n**Economics**\n\nThe cost of molnupiravir is significantly lower in developing countries due to the voluntary licensing agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP). This agreement allows MPP to sublicense the medication and supply it to low- and middle-income countries at a significantly lower cost.\n\n**Legal Status**\n\nIn October 2021, Merck submitted an EUA application to the FDA, and in November 2021, the FDA's Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee (AMDAC) met to discuss the application. The committee narrowly voted to recommend authorization for adults with mild to moderate illness who are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19.\n\n**Brand Names**\n\nMolnupiravir is the international nonproprietary name for the medication.\n\n**Public Health Concerns**\n\nThere is ongoing concern that molnupiravir could accelerate the emergence of variants of concern, potentially making the pandemic worse. This concern was raised by multiple advisors at an AMDAC meeting in November 2021 and has been confirmed by a September 2023 study of 15 million global SARS-CoV-2 sequences.\n\n**Research**\n\nAlternative patented routes to molnupiravir have been reviewed, and ongoing research aims to improve the understanding of the medication's effects and potential risks.\n\n**COVID-19 Clinical Trial**\n\nIn October 2021, preliminary results from a clinical trial (MOVe-OUT) indicated that treatment with molnupiravir may reduce the risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. The final analysis reported a 30% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMolnupiravir is a promising antiviral medication used to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test and at least one risk factor for developing severe illness. While it has shown effectiveness in reducing the risk of hospitalization and death, there are ongoing concerns about its potential to accelerate the emergence of variants of concern. Ongoing research aims to improve the understanding of the medication's effects and potential risks.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Molnupiravir\" following this outline:\n\n\nMedical uses\nIn the UK, molnupiravir is indicated for treatment of mild to moderate COVID‑19 in adults with a positive SARS-COV-2 diagnostic test and who have at least one risk factor for developing severe illness [7]\n\n\nContraindications\nUse during pregnancy is not recommended [4] There are no human data on use during pregnancy to assess the risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes [4] Based on animal data, the drug may cause fetal harm [4]\n\n\nAdverse effects\nAdverse reactions observed in the phase III MOVe-OUT study included diarrhea (2%), nausea (1%) and dizziness (1%), all of which were mild or moderate [12]\n\n\nOverdose\nThe effects of overdose are unknown, treatment consists of general supportive measures such as monitoring of clinical status [12]\n\n\nDrug interactions\nBased on limited available data, there are no drug interactions [12]\n\n\nMechanism of action\nMolnupiravir inhibits viral reproduction by promoting widespread mutations in the replication of viral RNA by RNA-directed RNA polymerase [27] It is metabolized into a ribonucleoside analog that resembles cytidine, β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine 5′-triphosphate (also called EIDD-1931 5′-triphosphate or NHC-TP) [28] [29] [30] During replication, the virus's enzyme incorporates NHC-TP into newly made RNA instead of using real cytidine [30]\n\n\nChemistry\nThe first synthesis of molnupiravir was disclosed in a patent filed by Emory University in 2018 [32]\n\n\nHistory\nMolnupiravir was developed at Emory University by its drug innovation company, Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE) [17] In 2014, DRIVE began a screening project funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency to find an antiviral drug targeting Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), which led to the discovery of EIDD-1931 [33] [unreliable medical source?] When turned into the prodrug EIDD-2801 (molnupiravir), the compound also showed activity against other RNA viruses including influenza, Ebola, chikungunya, and various coronaviruses [33]\n\n\nSociety and culture\nIn September 2021, Merck signed a voluntary licensing agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) that allows MPP to sublicense molnupiravir and supply the COVID‑19 oral medication to 105 low- and middle-income countries The cost of the US government's initial purchase was about $712 per course of treatment;

{"title": "Mastodon_(software)", "content": "\nFunctionality and features\nMastodon servers run social networking software that is capable of communicating using W3C's ActivityPub standard, which has been implemented since version 1.6 [15] A Mastodon user can therefore interact with users on any other server in the Fediverse that supports ActivityPub.\n\n\nContent moderation\nIn early 2017, journalists like Sarah Jeong [22] distinguished Mastodon from Twitter for its approach to combating harassment [21] Mastodon uses community-based moderation, in which each server can limit or filter out undesirable types of content, while Twitter uses a single, global policy on content moderation Servers can choose to limit or filter out messages with disparaging content The main author of the Mastodon software, Eugen Rochko, believes that small, closely related communities deal with unwanted behavior more effectively than a large company's small safety team [23] Users can also block and report others to administrators, much like on Twitter [21] [24]\n\n\nComparison to Twitter\nUnlike Twitter (now known as X), Mastodon by default only allows for hashtags and mentioned accounts in the Fediverse to be searched, but allows server administrators to enable functionality via Elasticsearch to search for the full text of public posts that have opted-in to being indexed [26] [27] Searches are limited to all content that the instance knows about, either locally or from other instances that have been indexed However, services utilizing the ActivityPub protocol exist which allow for searching all posts on all instances as long as users opt-in [28]\n\n\nVersions\nIn September 2018, with the release of version 2.5 with redesigned public profile pages, Mastodon marked its 100th release [32] Mastodon 2.6 was released in October 2018, introducing the possibilities of verified profiles and live, in-stream link previews for images and videos [33] Version 2.7, in January 2019, made it possible to search for multiple hashtags at once, instead of searching for just a single hashtag Version 2.7 has more robust moderation capabilities for server administrators and moderators, while accessibility, such as contrast for users with sight issues, was improved [34] The ability for users to create and vote in polls, as well as a new invitation system to manage registrations was integrated in April 2019 [35] Mastodon 2.8.1, released in May 2019, made images with content warnings blurred instead of completely hidden [36] In version 2.9 in June 2019, an optional single-column view was added [37] This view became the default displayed to new users, with a user \"preferences\" option to switch to a multiple-column-based view [citation needed]\n\n\nSoftware\nMastodon is published as free and open-source software under the Affero GPL license, allowing anyone to use the software or modify it as they wish Servers can be run by any individual or organization, and users can join these servers as they wish [41] [42] The server software itself is powered by Ruby on Rails and Node.js, with its web client being written in React.js and Redux [43] The only database software supported is PostgreSQL, with Redis being used for job processing and various actions that Mastodon needs to process [44] The service is interoperable with the fediverse, a collection of social networking services which use the ActivityPub protocol for communication between each other, [45] with previous versions containing support for OStatus [46]\n\n\nAdoption\nWhile Mastodon was first released in October 2016, the service began to expand in late March and early April 2017 [48]  Servers were mostly operated by academic institutions, journalists, hobbyists, and activists [49] The Verge wrote that the community at this time was small and that it had yet to attract the personalities that keep users at Twitter [21] The global use had risen from 766,500 users as of 1 August 2017, to 1 million users on 1 December 2017 [50] [51] In November 2017 artists, writers, and entrepreneurs such as Chuck Wendig, John Scalzi, Melanie Gillman and later John O'Nolan joined in [22] [52] [53] [54]\n\n\n2022 Twitter-related spikes in adoption\nA spike in Mastodon's user participation occurred in April 2022, following the 25 April announcement of Elon Musk purchasing Twitter By 27 April, 30,000 new users had joined Mastodon [61] [62] On 28 April 2022, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) launched the official ActivityPub microblogging platform (EU Voice) of the EU institutions, bodies and agencies (EUIs), based on Mastodon [63]\n\n\nNotable instances\nAs a result of its open source nature and ability to be deployed without restriction, various organizations, companies and governments have started their own Mastodon instances While some instances have mentioned their usage of Mastodon for the service and identify themselves as a Mastodon instance, others have attempted to conceal their origin by removing all mentions of Mastodon from the public view These instances also don't release their source code modifications, violating the AGPLv3 license in use by Mastodon.\n\n\nSecurity\nWhile Mastodon's decentralized structure is one of its most distinctive features, it also poses additional security challenges.\n\n\nFunding\nMastodon is crowdfunded and does not contain ads; as of November 2022, it was supported by 3,500 people Since 2021 it has been registered in Germany as a nonprofit organization (German: gemeinnützige GmbH); [117] a US nonprofit was established in April 2024 [118] The organization started selling stuffed toys in October 2024 [119]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Mastodon (software)**\n\nMastodon is a decentralized social media platform that enables users to create and share content in a decentralized network of interconnected servers. The platform was first released in October 2016 and has since gained popularity as an alternative to traditional social media platforms like Twitter.\n\n**Functionality and features**\n\nMastodon servers run social networking software that is capable of communicating using W3C's ActivityPub standard, which has been implemented since version 1.6. A Mastodon user can therefore interact with users on any other server in the Fediverse that supports ActivityPub. This allows users to share and engage with content across multiple servers and communities.\n\nMastodon's features include:\n\n* Decentralized architecture: Mastodon's architecture is decentralized, meaning that users can host their own servers and connect with other servers in the Fediverse.\n* ActivityPub support: Mastodon supports the ActivityPub standard, which enables communication between servers and allows users to interact with content across multiple servers.\n* Community-based moderation: Mastodon uses community-based moderation, where each server can limit or filter out undesirable types of content.\n* Content warnings: Mastodon allows users to add content warnings to their posts, which can be used to provide context or trigger warnings for sensitive topics.\n* Image and video hosting: Mastodon allows users to host images and videos directly on the platform, reducing the need for external hosting services.\n\n**Content moderation**\n\nMastodon's content moderation approach is distinct from that of traditional social media platforms like Twitter. While Twitter uses a single, global policy on content moderation, Mastodon uses community-based moderation, where each server can limit or filter out undesirable types of content.\n\nMastodon's community-based moderation approach has several benefits, including:\n\n* Increased flexibility: Community-based moderation allows servers to tailor their moderation policies to their specific needs and community standards.\n* Improved user trust: Community-based moderation can help build trust between users and the server administrators, as users feel that their concerns are being taken seriously.\n* Reduced reliance on central authorities: Community-based moderation reduces the reliance on central authorities to moderate content, allowing users to take more control over their online experiences.\n\n**Comparison to Twitter**\n\nMastodon differs from Twitter in several ways, including:\n\n* Decentralized architecture: Mastodon's decentralized architecture allows users to host their own servers and connect with other servers in the Fediverse.\n* ActivityPub support: Mastodon supports the ActivityPub standard, which enables communication between servers and allows users to interact with content across multiple servers.\n* Community-based moderation: Mastodon uses community-based moderation, where each server can limit or filter out undesirable types of content.\n\nWhile Twitter has its own set of features and policies, Mastodon offers a unique set of benefits, including:\n\n* Increased flexibility: Mastodon's decentralized architecture allows users to take more control over their online experiences.\n* Improved user trust: Mastodon's community-based moderation approach can help build trust between users and the server administrators.\n* Reduced reliance on central authorities: Mastodon's decentralized architecture reduces the reliance on central authorities to moderate content.\n\n**Versions**\n\nMastodon has undergone several updates and revisions since its initial release in 2016.

Decentralized systems can be more vulnerable to attacks and compromises, as there is no central authority to rely on for security.\n\n**Funding**\n\nMastodon is crowdfunded and does not contain ads. As of November 2022, it was supported by 3,500 people. Since 2021, it has been registered in Germany as a nonprofit organization (German: gemeinnützige GmbH).

ActivityPub.\n\n\nContent moderation\nIn early 2017, journalists like Sarah Jeong [22] distinguished Mastodon from Twitter for its approach to combating harassment [21] Mastodon uses community-based moderation, in which each server can limit or filter out undesirable types of content, while Twitter uses a single, global policy on content moderation Servers can choose to limit or filter out messages with disparaging content The main author of the Mastodon software, Eugen Rochko, believes that small, closely related communities deal with unwanted behavior more effectively than a large company's small safety team [23] Users can also block and report others to administrators, much like on Twitter [21] [24]\n\n\nComparison to Twitter\nUnlike Twitter (now known as X), Mastodon by default only allows for hashtags and mentioned accounts in the Fediverse to be searched, but allows server administrators to enable functionality via Elasticsearch to search for the full text of public posts that have opted-in to being indexed [26] [27] Searches are limited to all content that the instance knows about, either locally or from other instances that have been indexed However, services utilizing the ActivityPub protocol exist which allow for searching all posts on all instances as long as users opt-in [28]\n\n\nVersions\nIn September 2018, with the release of version 2.5 with redesigned public profile pages, Mastodon marked its 100th release [32] Mastodon 2.6 was released in October 2018, introducing the possibilities of verified profiles and live, in-stream link previews for images and videos [33] Version 2.7, in January 2019, made it possible to search for multiple hashtags at once, instead of searching for just a single hashtag Version 2.7 has more robust moderation capabilities for server administrators and moderators, while accessibility, such as contrast for users with sight issues, was improved [34] The ability for users to create and vote in polls, as well as a new invitation system to manage registrations was integrated in April 2019 [35] Mastodon 2.8.1, released in May 2019, made images with content warnings blurred instead of completely hidden [36] In version 2.9 in June 2019, an optional single-column view was added [37] This view became the default displayed to new users, with a user \"preferences\" option to switch to a multiple-column-based view [citation needed]\n\n\nSoftware\nMastodon is published as free and open-source software under the Affero GPL license, allowing anyone to use the software or modify it as they wish Servers can be run by any individual or organization, and users can join these servers as they wish [41] [42] The server software itself is powered by Ruby on Rails and Node.js, with its web client being written in React.js and Redux [43] The only database software supported is PostgreSQL, with Redis being used for job processing and various actions that Mastodon needs to process [44] The service is interoperable with the fediverse, a collection of social networking services which use the ActivityPub protocol for communication between each other, [45] with previous versions containing support for OStatus [46]\n\n\nAdoption\nWhile Mastodon was first released in October 2016, the service began to expand in late March and early April 2017 [48]  Servers were mostly operated by academic institutions, journalists, hobbyists, and activists [49] The Verge wrote that the community at this time was small and that it had yet to attract the personalities that keep users at Twitter [21] The global use had risen from 766,500 users as of 1 August 2017, to 1 million users on 1 December 2017 [50] [51] In November 2017 artists, writers, and entrepreneurs such as Chuck Wendig, John Scalzi, Melanie Gillman and later John O'Nolan joined in [22] [52] [53] [54]\n\n\n2022 Twitter-related spikes in adoption\nA spike in Mastodon's user participation occurred in April 2022, following the 25 April announcement of Elon Musk purchasing Twitter By 27 April, 30,000 new users had joined Mastodon [61] [62] On 28 April 2022, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) launched the official ActivityPub microblogging platform (EU Voice) of the EU institutions, bodies and agencies (EUIs), based on Mastodon [63]\n\n\nNotable instances\nAs a result of its open source nature and ability to be deployed without restriction, various organizations, companies and governments have started their own Mastodon instances While some instances have mentioned their usage of Mastodon for the service and identify themselves as a Mastodon instance, others have attempted to conceal their origin by removing all mentions of Mastodon from the public view These instances also don't release their source code modifications, violating the AGPLv3 license in use by Mastodon.\n\n\nSecurity\nWhile Mastodon's decentralized structure is one of its most distinctive features, it also poses additional security challenges.\n\n\nFunding\nMastodon is crowdfunded and does not contain ads; as of November 2022, it was supported by 3,500 people Since 2021 it has been registered in Germany as a nonprofit organization (German: gemeinnützige GmbH); [117] a US nonprofit was established in April 2024 [118] The organization started selling stuffed toys in October 2024 [119]\n\n\nSee

[1] [2] The team was named after the Boston Braves baseball team, with whom they shared Braves Field, with the inaugural season being coached by Lud Wray The team saw several changes in 1933, including a name change to the \"Redskins\" and playing their home games at Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox Wray was also replaced at head coach by William \"Lone Star\" Dietz [3] [4]  [5]\n\n\nGeorge Preston Marshall era (1932–1965)\nBoston was awarded a National Football League franchise on July 9, 1932, under the ownership of American businessman George Preston Marshall [1] [2] The team was named after the Boston Braves baseball team, with whom they shared Braves Field, with the inaugural season being coached by Lud Wray The team saw several changes in 1933, including a name change to the \"Redskins\" and playing their home games at Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox Wray was also replaced at head coach by William \"Lone Star\" Dietz [3] [4]  [5]\n\n\nIntegration controversy\nDuring most of this unsuccessful period, Marshall continually refused to integrate the team, despite pressure from the U.S government [19] Two months into the Kennedy administration on March 24, 1961, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall warned Marshall to hire black players or face federal retribution [20] For the first time in history, the federal government had attempted to desegregate a professional sports team [21] The Redskins were under the threat of civil rights legal action by the Kennedy administration, which would have prevented a segregated team from playing at the new federally-owned D.C Stadium, managed by the U.S Department of the Interior [22] The Redskins' previous venue, Griffith Stadium, was owned by the Griffith family, owners of the Washington Senators, who moved and became the Minnesota Twins in 1961.\n\n\nEdward Bennett Williams era (1965–1979)\nMarshall appointed board member Edward Bennett Williams to run the team's daily operations in 1965 due to declining health [26] He acquired controlling interest in the franchise following Marshall's death on August 9, 1969 [26] [27] In 1969, Williams hired former Green Bay Packers head coach Vince Lombardi for the same role, granting him a 5% stake in ownership and full control over football operations as the team's executive vice president [28] Lombardi coached the Redskins to a 7–5–2 record, their first winning season since 1955, but died from cancer shortly before the start of the 1970 season [28] Bill Austin, appointed earlier by Lombardi, served as interim head coach for the season.\n\n\nGeorge Allen years (1971–1977)\nOn January 6, 1971, Williams hired former Los Angeles Rams head coach George Allen as head coach and general manager [29] Partial to seasoned veterans instead of highly touted young players, Allen's teams became known as the Over-the-Hill Gang [30] That season, the Redskins made the playoffs for the first time since 1945 with a 9–4–1 mark [13] with Redskins first-year head coach George Allen winning the 1971 NFL Coach of the Year Award, the second of his career, winning his first Coach of the Year Award in 1967 as the head coach of the Rams [31] However, they lost in the Divisional Playoffs to the San Francisco 49ers, 24–20 [32]\n\n\nJack Kent Cooke era (1979–1998)\nCanadian-American businessman Jack Kent Cooke, who had owned minority shares of the Redskins and been a board member since 1960, purchased majority interest from Edward Bennett Williams in 1974 [27] Due to NFL rules at the time disallowing controlling ownership in other leagues, he allowed Williams to operate the team until selling his other properties, the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, to Jerry Buss in May 1979 [27] Cooke became the team's sole owner in 1985 after purchasing the remaining shares from Williams for around $9 million [27]\n\n\nJoe Gibbs years (1981–1992)\nJack Pardee, the 1979 NFL Coach of the Year, was fired following a 6–10 record in 1980 [35] On January 13, 1981, Cooke hired San Diego Chargers offensive coordinator Joe Gibbs as head coach [36] During the offseason, the Redskins acquired players such as Mark May, Russ Grimm, and Dexter Manley in the 1981 NFL draft [37] After starting the 1981 season 0–5, the Redskins won eight out of their next 11 games and finished the season 8–8 but fourth in the NFC East [38]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XVII champions (1982)\nStarting on September 21, 1982, [36] the NFL faced a 57-day long players' strike, which reduced the 1982 season from a 16-game schedule to a nine-game schedule [39] [40] Because of the shortened season, the NFL adopted a special 16-team playoff tournament, in which eight teams from each conference were seeded 1–8 based on their regular season records After the strike was settled, the Redskins dominated, winning six out of the seven remaining games to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976 [13]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XXII champions (1987)\nThe 1987 NFL season began with a players' strike that reduced the 16-game season to 15 [52] No Redskins players crossed the picket line—the only such team—and the games for Weeks 4–6 were won with all-replacement squads [53] Those three victories, often credited with getting the team into the playoffs, are the basis for the 2000 movie The Replacements The Redskins won their second championship in Super Bowl XXII on January 31, 1988, in San Diego, California The Redskins routed the Denver Broncos 42–10 [9] after starting the game down 10–0, the largest come-from-behind victory in Super Bowl history, which was tied by the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV and the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX This game is also noted for Super Bowl MVP quarterback Doug Williams, who threw four touchdowns in the second quarter en route to becoming the first black quarterback to lead his team to a championship, [54] and for rookie running back Timmy Smith, who ran for a Super Bowl-record 204 yards (187 m) [54]\n\n\nSuper Bowl XXVI champions (1991)\nThe 1991 season started with a franchise-record 11 straight victories [56] \"The Hogs\", under the coaching of Redskins offensive line coach Joe Bugel, allowed a league-low and franchise-record nine sacks, the third-lowest total in NFL history [56] The offense also dominated under head football coach Joe Gibbs, scoring 485 points, more than any other team that year [57] The defense was also dominant under defensive coordinator Richie Petitbon, giving up 224 total points, second-best of any team that year, while holding opponents scoreless three times [58] [59] After posting a 14–2 record, the Redskins dominated the playoffs, beating the Falcons and Lions by a combined score of 64–17 [9] On January 26, 1992, the Redskins won Super Bowl XXVI by defeating the Buffalo Bills 37–24; [9] QB Mark Rypien won the Super Bowl MVP award [60] After the Super Bowl, the Redskins set another franchise record by sending eight players to the Pro Bowl [56] The 1991 Washington Redskins are widely considered one of the best teams in NFL history [61]\n\n\nDaniel Snyder era (1999–2023)\nOn May 25, 1999, Cooke sold the Redskins to local businessman Daniel Snyder for $800 million after being unable to raise sufficient funds to keep the team [56] [68] Snyder sold the naming rights to Jack Kent Cooke Stadium to FedEx in November 1999, becoming FedExField [56]\n\n\nJay Gruden era (2014–2019)\nOn January 9, 2014, the Redskins hired Jay Gruden as their head coach Gruden became the eighth head coach of the team since Daniel Snyder purchased the franchise in 1999 [101] The Redskins struggled throughout the season, having three different quarterbacks start games, amounting to a 4–12 record [102] Defensive coordinator Jim Haslett was fired at the end of the season [103]\n\n\nRebranding, investigations into Snyder and workplace culture (2020–2023)\nThe team underwent several changes in 2020, including retiring the Redskins name and logo and hiring former Carolina Panthers head coach Ron Rivera in the same role, as well as naming Jason Wright as team president, the first black person named to that position in NFL history [126] [127] [128] Some notable members of Rivera's staff include former Jacksonville Jaguars and Oakland Raiders head coach Jack Del Rio as defensive coordinator and Scott Turner, the son of former Redskins head coach Norv Turner, as offensive coordinator [129] [130]\n\n\nJosh Harris era (2023–present)\nAfter mounting pressure from other league owners to sell the team, Snyder hired BofA Securities in November 2022 to explore possible transactions [145] [146] [147] In May 2023, he reached an agreement to sell the franchise to a group headed by Josh Harris, co-founder of Apollo Global Management and owner of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and NHL's New Jersey Devils, for $6.05 billion [148] Limited partners include Danaher and Glenstone founder Mitchell Rales, Hall of Fame basketball player Magic Johnson, 76ers and Devils co-owner David Blitzer, D.C entrepreneur Mark Ein, Maverick Capital founder Lee Ainslie, former Magic Johnson Enterprises president Eric Holoman, Blue Owl Capital founders Marc Lipschultz and Doug Ostrover, the Santo Domingo family, ProShares founder Michael Sapir, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, and Cambridge Information Group CEO Andy Snyder [149] [150] The sale was the highest price ever paid for a sports team and was unanimously approved by the NFL on July 20, 2023 [151] [152] By 2024, the team had invested $75 million in improving the infrastructure and game experience of Northwest Stadium, including improved food options and renovations to the sound system and suites [153]\n\n\nRedskins branding controversy\nThe team's former Redskins branding, used from 1933 until 2020, was one of the leading examples of the Native American mascot controversy Various people and groups, such as the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), considered the name a racial slur and attempted to get the team to change it for decades [161] [162] In a 2013 letter, Snyder stated that while respecting those that say they were offended, a poll conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004 found that 90% of Native Americans were not [163] [164] This poll was essentially replicated in 2016 by The Washington Post Social scientists from the University of Michigan and University of California at Berkeley performed a study in 2020 that measured Native American opinion in detail, finding that 49% had responded that the name was offensive, with the level of offense increasing to 67% for those with a stronger involvement in Native American culture [165] When the franchise was undergoing a trademark dispute in 2014, the Washington Post announced their editorials would no longer use the \"Redskins\" name [166] [167] ESPN updated their employee work policies to allow their reporters to choose how to refer to the team going forward [168] [169] [170]\n\n\nLogos and uniforms\nThe franchise's primary colors are burgundy and gold [178] [179] [185] From 1961 through 1978, Washington wore gold pants with both the burgundy and white jerseys, although details of the jerseys and pants changed a few times during this period Gold face masks were introduced in 1978 and remain as such to this day; previous to that they were grey Throughout most of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, Washington was just one of three other teams that primarily wore their white jerseys at home (the others being the Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins) The tradition of wearing white jerseys over burgundy pants at home, which is considered the \"classic\" look, was started by Joe Gibbs when he took over as coach in 1981 Gibbs was an assistant for the San Diego Chargers in 1979 and 1980 when the team wore white at home under head coach Don Coryell.\n\n\nRivalries\nThe Commanders' rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys features two teams that have won 31 combined division titles and 10 championships, including eight combined Super Bowls [201] The rivalry started in 1960 when the Cowboys joined the league as an expansion team [202] During that year they were in separate conferences, but played once during the season In 1961, Dallas was placed in the same division as the Redskins, and from that point on, they have played each other twice during every regular season.\n\n\nDivisional\nThe Commanders' rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys features two teams that have won 31 combined division titles and 10

began October 21, 1934, during Washington's first year under the Boston Redskins moniker; the Redskins defeated the Eagles 6–0 at Fenway Park Washington leads the series 87–80–8 The Eagles have won 12 of the last 20 matchups since 2010 [206]\n\n\nNew York Giants\nAs of the 2023 season, the Giants lead the all-time series 108–71–5 [207]\n\n\nOther\nThough the two teams only play each other every 4

prevent the city from receiving a new franchise until the Cleveland Browns relocated to Baltimore in 1996, prompting Cooke to put the Redskins' then-new stadium in Landover, Maryland [210] [211] [212]

Commanders**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Washington Commanders are a professional American football team based in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The team competes in the National Football League (NFL) and has a rich history dating back to 1932. The team has undergone several name changes over the years, including the Boston Braves, Washington Redskins, and Washington Redskins. In 2020, the team announced that it would be rebranding as the Washington Commanders, effective immediately.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early Years (1932-1933)\n\nThe Boston Braves were awarded a National Football League franchise on July 9, 1932, under the ownership of American businessman George Preston Marshall. The team was named after the Boston Braves baseball team, with whom they shared Braves Field. The inaugural season saw the team coached by Lud Wray, who was replaced by William \"Lone Star\" Dietz in 1933.\n\n### George Preston Marshall Era (1932-1965)\n\nBoston was awarded a National Football League franchise on July 9, 1932, under the ownership of American businessman George Preston Marshall. The team was named after the Boston Braves baseball team, with whom they shared Braves Field, with the inaugural season being coached by Lud Wray. The team saw several changes in 1933, including a name change to the \"Redskins\" and playing their home games at Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox. Wray was also replaced at head coach by William \"Lone Star\" Dietz.\n\n### Integration Controversy\n\nDuring most of this unsuccessful period, Marshall continually refused to integrate the team, despite pressure from the U.S government. Two months into the Kennedy administration on March 24, 1961, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall warned Marshall to hire black players or face federal retribution. For the first time in history, the federal government had attempted to desegregate a professional sports team.\n\n### Edward Bennett Williams Era (1965-1979)\n\nMarshall appointed board member Edward Bennett Williams to run the team's daily operations in 1965 due to declining health. He acquired controlling interest in the franchise following Marshall's death on August 9, 1969. In 1969, Williams hired former Green Bay Packers head coach Vince Lombardi for the same role, granting him a 5% stake in ownership and full control over football operations as the team's executive vice president.\n\n### George Allen Years (1971-1977)\n\nOn January 6, 1971, Williams hired former Los Angeles Rams head coach George Allen as head coach and general manager. Partial to seasoned veterans instead of highly touted young players, Allen's teams became known as the Over-the-Hill Gang. That season, the Redskins made the playoffs for the first time since 1945 with a 9–4–1 mark.\n\n### Jack Kent Cooke Era (1979-1998)\n\nCanadian-American businessman Jack Kent Cooke, who had owned minority shares of the Redskins and been a board member since 1960, purchased majority interest from Edward Bennett Williams in 1974. Due to NFL rules at the time disallowing controlling ownership in other leagues, he allowed Williams to operate the team until selling his other properties, the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, to Jerry Buss in May 1979.\n\n### Joe Gibbs Years (1981-1992)\n\nJack Pardee, the 1979 NFL Coach of the Year, was fired following a 6–10 record in 1980. On January 13, 1981, Cooke hired San Diego Chargers offensive coordinator Joe Gibbs as head coach. During the offseason, the Redskins acquired players such as Mark May, Russ Grimm, and Dexter Manley in the 1981 NFL draft.\n\n### Super Bowl XVII Champions (1982)\n\nStarting on September 21, 1982, the NFL faced a 57-day long players' strike, which reduced the 1982 season from a 16-game schedule to a nine-game schedule. Because of the shortened season, the NFL adopted a special 16-team playoff tournament, in which eight teams from each conference were seeded 1–8 based on their regular season records.\n\n### Super Bowl XXII Champions (1987)\n\nThe 1987 NFL season began with a players' strike that reduced the 16-game season to 15. No Redskins players crossed the picket line—the only such team—and the games for Weeks 4–6 were won with all-replacement squads.\n\n### Super Bowl XXVI Champions (1991)\n\nThe 1991 season started with a franchise-record 11 straight victories. \"The Hogs\", under the coaching of Redskins offensive line coach Joe Bugel, allowed a league-low and franchise-record nine sacks, the third-lowest total in NFL history.\n\n### Daniel Snyder Era (1999-2023)\n\nOn May 25, 1999, Cooke sold the Redskins to local businessman Daniel Snyder for $800 million after being unable to raise sufficient funds to keep the team. Snyder sold the naming rights to Jack Kent Cooke Stadium to FedEx in November 1999, becoming FedExField.\n\n### Jay Gruden Era (2014-2019)\n\nOn January 9, 2014, the Redskins hired Jay Gruden as their head coach. Gruden became the eighth head coach of the team since Daniel Snyder purchased the franchise in 1999. The Redskins struggled throughout the season, having three different quarterbacks start games, amounting to a 4–12 record.\n\n### Rebranding, Investigations into Snyder and Workplace Culture (2020-2023)\n\nThe team underwent several changes in 2020, including retiring the Redskins name and logo and hiring former Carolina Panthers head coach Ron Rivera as head coach, as well as naming Jason Wright as team president, the first black person named to that position in NFL history.\n\n### Josh Harris Era (2023-Present)\n\nAfter mounting pressure from other league owners to sell the team, Snyder hired BofA Securities in November 2022 to explore possible transactions. In May 2023, he reached an agreement to sell the franchise to a group headed by Josh Harris, co-founder of Apollo Global Management and owner of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and NHL's New Jersey Devils, for $6.05 billion.\n\n### Ownership and Staff\n\nOpposed calls to change the controversial Redskins branding until 2020 amid growing pressure from sponsors, with the franchise playing as the Washington Football Team prior to rebranding as the Commanders in 2022. Represented by his wife Tanya for league events following an indefinite suspension by the NFL in 2021.\n\n### Players\n\nRunning backs (RB)\n\n### Roster\n\nRunning backs (RB)\n\n### Retired Numbers\n\nSome numbers are unofficially retired and are withheld from being selected by other players.\n\n### Pro Football Hall of Fame Members\n\nNames in bold indicate induction primarily based on accomplishments with Washington.\n\n### Ring of Fame\n\nWhen the team left RFK Stadium in 1996, the signs commemorating the Washington Hall of Stars were left behind and the team began a new tradition of honoring Redskins greats via the \"Ring of Fame\", a set of signs on the upper level facade at FedExField. Team founder George Preston Marshall is the only member to ever be removed, which happened in 2020.\n\n### 90 Greatest\n\nIn honor of the Redskins' 70th anniversary in 2002, a panel selected the 70 Greatest Redskins to honor the players and coaches who were significant on-field contributors to the Redskins' five championships. They were honored in a weekend of festivities, including a special halftime ceremony during a Redskins' win over the Indianapolis Colts.\n\n### Individual Awards\n\nThe Command Force is the team's professional dance and performance group. They were originally formed in 1962 as a cheerleading squad known as the Redskinettes, named after the team's former Redskins name. They were revamped as the Command Force upon the team's rebranding as the Commanders in 2022.\n\n### Broadcasting\n\nThe Commanders' current flagship radio station is 100.3 WBIG-FM, which acquired the rights in 2022 as part of an agreement with iHeartMedia. Frank Herzog was the team's lead play-by-play announcer from 1979 to 2004, when he was replaced by Larry Michael. Herzog was joined from 1981 by former Redskins Sonny Jurgensen and Sam Huff.\n\n### U.S. Presidential Election Superstition\n\nBetween 1932 and 2008, for 19 of 20 United States presidential elections,

desegregate a professional sports team [21] The Redskins were under the threat of civil rights legal action by the Kennedy administration, which would have prevented a segregated team from playing at the new federally-owned D.C Stadium, managed by the U.S Department of the Interior [22] The Redskins' previous venue, Griffith Stadium, was owned by the Griffith family, owners of the Washington Senators, who moved and became the Minnesota Twins in 1961.\n\n\nEdward Bennett Williams era (1965–1979)\nMarshall appointed board member Edward Bennett Williams to run the team's daily operations in

holding opponents scoreless three times [58] [59] After posting a 14–2 record, the Redskins dominated the playoffs, beating the Falcons and Lions by a combined score of 64–17 [9] On January 26, 1992, the Redskins won Super Bowl XXVI by defeating the Buffalo Bills 37–24; [9] QB Mark Rypien won the Super Bowl MVP award [60] After the Super Bowl, the Redskins set another franchise record by sending

of Apollo Global Management and owner of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and NHL's New Jersey Devils, for $6.05 billion [148] Limited partners include Danaher and Glenstone founder Mitchell Rales, Hall

team's former Redskins branding, used from 1933 until 2020, was one of the leading examples of the Native American mascot controversy Various people and groups, such as the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), considered the name a racial slur and attempted to get the team to change it for decades [161] [162] In a 2013 letter, Snyder stated that while respecting those that say they were offended, a poll conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004 found that 90% of Native Americans were not [163] [164] This poll was essentially replicated in 2016 by The Washington Post Social scientists from the University of Michigan and University of California at Berkeley performed a study in 2020 that measured Native American opinion in detail, finding that 49% had responded that the name was offensive, with the level of offense increasing to 67% for those with a stronger involvement in Native American culture [165] When the franchise was undergoing a trademark dispute in 2014, the Washington Post announced their editorials would no longer use the \"Redskins\" name [166] [167] ESPN updated their employee work policies to allow their reporters to choose how to refer to the team going forward [168] [169] [170]\n\n\nLogos and uniforms\nThe franchise's primary colors are burgundy and gold [178] [179] [185] From 1961 through 1978, Washington wore gold pants with both the burgundy and white jerseys, although details of the jerseys and pants changed a few times during this period Gold face masks were introduced in 1978 and remain as such to this day; previous to that they were grey Throughout most of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, Washington was just one of three other teams that primarily wore their white jerseys at home (the others being the Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins) The tradition of wearing white jerseys over burgundy pants at home, which is considered the \"classic\" look, was started by Joe Gibbs when he took over as coach in 1981 Gibbs was an assistant for the San Diego Chargers in 1979 and 1980 when the team wore white at home under head coach Don Coryell.\n\n\nRivalries\nThe Commanders' rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys features two teams that have won 31 combined division titles and 10 championships, including eight combined Super Bowls [201] The rivalry started in 1960 when the Cowboys joined the league as an

thriller film directed and written by Guillermo del Toro, based on the 1946 novel of the same name by William Lindsay Gresham. The film stars Bradley Cooper, Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, and Toni Collette.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nNightmare Alley is a modern retelling of the classic 1947 film of the same name, which was based on the novel by William Lindsay Gresham. The film marks a departure for director Guillermo del Toro, who is known for his work in the horror and fantasy genres, as it contains no supernatural elements. Instead, the film is a dark and twisted tale of deception, manipulation, and the underbelly of society.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film takes place in 1939 and follows the story of Stan Carlisle (played by Bradley Cooper), a young man who runs away from a traveling carnival and joins a new show. Stan quickly becomes involved with the carnival's clairvoyant act, Madame Zeena (played by Cate Blanchett), and her husband Pete (played by Toni Collette). As Stan becomes more entrenched in the carnival, he begins to learn the art of conning and manipulating people, and he starts to see the world in a different light.\n\nHowever, Stan's newfound success and confidence soon lead him to make some questionable decisions, and he becomes embroiled in a complex web of deceit and manipulation. As the story unfolds, Stan's relationships with the people around him begin to fray, and he is forced to confront the darker aspects of his own nature.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features an all-star cast, including Bradley Cooper as Stan Carlisle, Cate Blanchett as Madame Zeena, Rooney Mara as Molly Cahill, and Toni Collette as Helen Archer. The cast delivers strong performances, bringing depth and nuance to their characters.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was shot on location in Toronto, Canada, and Buffalo, New York. The production team took advantage of the city's architecture and unfamiliar setting to create a unique and atmospheric look. The film's cinematography is stunning, with a blend of old and new techniques used to create a distinctive visual style.\n\nGuillermo del Toro has stated that he was drawn to the project because of its dark and twisted themes, which allowed him to explore the underbelly of society in a way that he had not been able to in his previous films. The director worked closely with his cast and crew to bring the story to life, and the result is a film that is both visually stunning and emotionally resonant.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's score was composed by Nathan Johnson, who took over from original composer Alexandre Desplat due to scheduling conflicts. The score is a dark and moody blend of jazz and orchestral elements, perfectly capturing the tone and atmosphere of the film.\n\n**Release**\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the Alice Tully Hall in New York on December 1, 2021, accompanied by simultaneous screenings at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles and the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto. The film was theatrically released on December 17, 2021, after being rescheduled from its original release date of December 3, 2021.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising its dark and twisted themes, strong performances, and stunning visuals. The film holds a 81% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.4/10.

in the idea [84] During Boyle's time, a leaked casting sheet described the male leading role as a \"cold and charismatic Russian\" and the female leading role as a \"witty and skillful survivor\" Production also sought male supporting roles of Māori descent with \"advanced combat skills\" [85] The idea of Bond having a child was introduced by Hodge and retained for the final script [84]\n\n\nCasting\nAfter Spectre, there was speculation that it would be Craig's final Bond film Immediately after the film's release, Craig had complained about the rigours of performing the part,

but turned it down [89] In October 2016, Craig denied having made a decision but praised his time in the role, describing it as \"the best job in the world doing Bond\" He further denied that $150 million was offered to him for the next two instalments [90] Eventually, Craig was paid $25 million for his involvement [91] In August 2017, on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Craig said that the next film would mark his final appearance as Bond [5] [92] His position was reaffirmed between November 2019 and March 2020 [93] [94] Craig later acknowledged that the physicality of the part had deterred him from returning to the role, having sustained injuries acting in earlier Bond films [95] [96] [97] Craig was also drawn by the similarities to On Her Majesty's Secret Service Craig said of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, [98]\n\n\nFilming\nProduction was scheduled to begin on 3 December 2018 at Pinewood Studios, [112] but filming was delayed until April 2019 after Boyle's departure

segregation on public buses in Montgomery, Alabama. Her bravery and determination inspired a citywide boycott and played a significant role in the eventual desegregation of public transportation in the United States.\n\n## Early Life\n\nRosa Parks was born Rosa Louise McCauley on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, to Leona (née Edwards) and James McCauley. Her parents were both African American, and her father was a carpenter. One of her great-grandfathers was Scots-Irish, and one of her great-grandmothers was a part-Native American slave. As a child, Parks suffered from chronic tonsillitis and was often bedridden, a condition that forced her family to relocate to her grandparents' farm outside Pine Level.\n\n## Early Activism\n\nIn 1932, Parks married Raymond Parks, a barber from Montgomery, who was a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). At her husband's urging, Rosa finished her high school studies in 1933, a remarkable achievement considering that fewer than 7% of African Americans had a high school diploma at the time. She took numerous jobs, ranging from domestic work to hospital aide, and became increasingly involved in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n## Parks' Arrest and Bus Boycott\n\nOn December 1, 1955, Parks boarded a Montgomery City Lines bus after finishing her shift at a local department store. When the bus filled up and the driver ordered her to give up her seat to a white person, Parks refused, citing her right to sit wherever she pleased. The driver called the police, and Parks was arrested and charged with violating the city's segregation laws. The incident sparked a citywide boycott of Montgomery's buses, led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the NAACP. The boycott lasted for 381 days and ended with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that segregation on public buses was unconstitutional.\n\n## Montgomery Bus Boycott\n\nThe Montgomery bus boycott was a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement, bringing national attention to the plight of African Americans in the South. During the boycott, African Americans used alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and carpooling, and supported local businesses that refused to serve customers who tried to cross the picket lines. The boycott also sparked a wave of protests and demonstrations across the country, drawing attention to the issue of racial segregation.\n\n## Detroit Years\n\nAfter her arrest, Parks became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement, but she suffered hardships as a result. Due to economic sanctions used against activists, she lost her job at the department store, and her husband lost his job as a barber at Maxwell Air Force Base. Parks traveled and spoke about the issues, using her platform to advocate for civil rights and social justice.\n\n## 1960s\n\nParks continued to be an active advocate for civil rights in the 1960s, participating in protests and demonstrations, including the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. She also worked closely with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other prominent civil rights leaders to advance the cause of racial equality.\n\n## 1970s\n\nIn the 1970s, Parks organized for the freedom of political prisoners in the United States, particularly cases involving issues of self-defense. She helped found the Detroit chapter of the Joanne Little Defense Committee and worked in support of the Wilmington 10, the RNA 11, and Gary Tyler.

She published her autobiography, \"Rosa Parks: My Story,\" and a memoir, \"Quiet Strength,\" which focuses on her faith. She also became a vocal critic of social injustice and racism, using her platform to speak out against issues such as police brutality and racial profiling.\n\n## Death and Funeral\n\nParks died on October 24, 2005, at the age of 92, in her apartment on the east side of Detroit. She was survived by her sister-in-law, 13 nieces and nephews, and their families, as well as several cousins, most of whom were residents of Michigan or Alabama.\n\n## Legacy and Honors\n\nParks' legacy continues to inspire people around the world.

His activities had significant historical implications and led to a dramatic and tragic conclusion.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMark Hofmann was born in 1954 in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Lucille (née Sears) and William Hofmann (1928–1993). He was raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and had a below-average high school education. However, he had a variety of hobbies, including stage magic, electronics, chemistry, and stamp and coin collecting. Hofmann and his friends were known to have made bombs for fun on the outskirts of Murray, Utah. He graduated 573 in a class of 700. According to Hofmann, while still a teenage coin collector, he forged a rare mint mark on a dime and was told by an organization of coin collectors that it was genuine.\n\n**Forgeries**\n\nIn 1980, Hofmann claimed that he had found a 17th-century King James Bible with a folded paper gummed inside. The document seemed to be the transcript that Smith's scribe Martin Harris had presented to Charles Anthon, a Columbia classics professor, in 1828. According to the Mormon scripture Joseph Smith–History, the transcript and its unusual reformed Egyptian characters were copied by Smith from the golden plates from which he translated the Book of Mormon. However, experts later discovered that the document was a forgery created by Hofmann.\n\n**Anthon Transcript Forgery**\n\nThe Anthon Transcript forgery was one of the most significant documents created by Hofmann. He claimed that it was a 17th-century King James Bible with a folded paper gummed inside, which was the transcript that Smith's scribe Martin Harris had presented to Charles Anthon, a Columbia classics professor, in 1828. However, experts later discovered that the document was a forgery created by Hofmann.\n\n**Joseph Smith III Blessing**\n\nDuring the early 1980s, a significant number of new Mormon documents came into the marketplace. Sometimes the church received these as donations, and others it purchased. According to the Ostlings, \"The church publicized some of the acquisitions; it orchestrated public relations for some that were known to be sensitive; others it acquired secretly and suppressed.\"\n\n**Salamander Letter**\n\nThe Salamander Letter was perhaps the most famous of Hofmann's Mormon forgeries. Supposedly written by Martin Harris to W W Phelps, the letter presented a version of the recovery of the gold plates that contrasted markedly with the church-sanctioned version of events. Not only did the letter intimate that Smith had been practicing \"money digging\" through magical practices, but it also replaced the angel that Smith said had appeared to him with a white salamander.\n\n**Other Mormon Forgeries**\n\nNo one is certain how many forged documents Hofmann created during the early 1980s, but they included a letter from Smith's mother, Lucy Mack Smith, describing the origin of the Book of Mormon; letters from Martin Harris and David Whitmer, two of the Three Witnesses, each giving a personal account of their visions; a contract between Smith and Egbert Bratt Grandin for the printing of the first edition of the Book of Mormon; and two pages of the original Book of Mormon manuscript taken in dictation from Smith to Oliver Cowdery.\n\n**Various Forged Americana**\n\nIn addition to documents from Mormon history, Hofmann also forged and sold signatures of many famous non-Mormons, including George Washington, John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Daniel Boone, John Brown, Andrew Jackson, Mark Twain, Nathan Hale, John Hancock, Francis Scott Key, Abraham Lincoln, John Milton, Paul Revere, Myles Standish, and Button Gwinnett, whose signature was the rarest, and therefore the most valuable, of any signer of the Declaration of Independence. Hofmann also forged a previously unknown poem in the hand of Emily Dickinson.\n\n**Murders**\n\nDespite the considerable amounts of money Hofmann had made from document sales, he was deeply in debt, in part because of his increasingly lavish lifestyle and his purchases of genuine first-edition books. In an effort to clear his debts, he attempted to broker a sale of the \"McLellin collection\" – a supposedly extensive group of documents written by William E McLellin, an early Mormon apostle who eventually broke with the LDS Church. Hofmann hinted that the McLellin collection would provide revelations unfavorable to the LDS Church.\n\n**Trial and Sentencing**\n\nDuring the bombing investigation, police discovered evidence of the forgeries in Hofmann's basement. They also found the engraving plant where the forged plate for Oath of a Freeman was made. Document examiner George Throckmorton analyzed several Hofmann documents that had previously been deemed authentic and determined they were forgeries. Three letters purportedly written from an Illinois prison by Smith used different ink, paper, and writing instruments. Because the letters had been authenticated by different experts, the inconsistencies had earlier escaped detection. Throckmorton also discovered that some documents, supposedly written by different people, had similar writing styles and that they had been written with homemade iron gall ink that looked cracked like alligator skin under a microscope, although authentic period ink did not.\n\n**Influence**\n\nAs a master forger, Hofmann deceived a number of renowned document experts during his short career. Some of his forgeries were accepted by scholars for years, and an unknown number of them may still be in circulation. However, it is Hofmann's forgeries of Mormon documents that have had the greatest historical significance. The sensationalist aspects of the Hofmann case led apostle Dallin H Oaks to believe that church members had witnessed \"some of the most intense LDS Church-bashing since the turn of the 20th century.\"\n\n**Portrayal in Media**\n\nA three-part documentary series about Hofmann's illegal activities, entitled Murder Among the Mormons, premiered on Netflix on March 3, 2021. The limited series debuted for the week ending March 7, 2021, as the third most streamed video on demand original-content program, according to Nielsen streaming ratings with 587 million viewer minutes.\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n**References**\n\n**Sources**\n\n**External Links**", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Mark_Hofmann\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nMark Hofmann was born in 1954 in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Lucille (née Sears) and William Hofmann (1928–1993) He was raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) [a] [5]: 41  [6] He was a below-average high school student, but had many hobbies including stage magic, electronics, chemistry, and stamp and coin collecting [5]: 55  Hofmann and his friends were said to have made bombs for fun on the outskirts of Murray, Utah Hofmann graduated 573 in a class of 700 [5]: 55  According to Hofmann, while still a teenage coin collector, he forged a rare mint mark on a dime and was told by an organization of coin collectors that it was genuine [b]\n\n\nForgeries\nIn 1980, Hofmann claimed that he had found a 17th-century King James Bible with a folded paper gummed inside [5]: 65–66  The document seemed to be the transcript that Smith's scribe Martin Harris had presented to Charles Anthon, a Columbia classics professor, in 1828 According to the Mormon scripture Joseph Smith–History, the transcript and its unusual reformed Egyptian characters were copied by Smith from the golden plates from which he translated the Book of Mormon.\n\n\nAnthon Transcript forgery\nIn 1980, Hofmann claimed that he had found a 17th-century King James Bible with a folded paper gummed inside [5]: 65–66  The document seemed to be the transcript that Smith's scribe Martin Harris had presented to Charles Anthon, a Columbia classics professor, in 1828 According to the Mormon scripture Joseph Smith–History, the transcript and its unusual reformed Egyptian characters were copied by Smith from the golden plates from which he translated the Book of Mormon.\n\n\nJoseph Smith III blessing\nDuring the early 1980s, a significant number of new Mormon documents came into the marketplace Sometimes the church received these as donations, and others it purchased According to the Ostlings, \"The church publicized some of the acquisitions;

It took place on January 6, 2021, and involved the counting of electoral votes by the Electoral College, a group of presidential electors required by the Constitution to form every four years for the purpose of electing the president and vice president.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe United States Electoral College is a unique aspect of the country's presidential election process. Each state appoints electors according to its legislature, equal in number to its congressional delegation (senators and representatives). Federal office holders cannot be electors. The total number of electors is 538, and an absolute majority of 270 or more electoral votes is required to elect the president and vice president. The Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlines the process for electing the president and vice president, including the role of the Electoral College in the event of a tie or no clear winner.\n\n**Electoral College**\n\nThe Electoral College is a group of presidential electors who are chosen by each state to cast electoral votes for the president and vice president. Each state has a certain number of electoral votes based on its population, with a total of 538 electoral votes. The candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes, at least 270, wins the presidency. If no candidate achieves a majority, a contingent election is held by the United States House of Representatives to elect the president, and by the United States Senate to elect the vice president.\n\n**Attempts to Thwart the Electoral College**\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2020 United States presidential election, President Trump and his supporters engaged in numerous attempts to overturn the results of the election. These attempts included:\n\n*   **Proposal for the military to decide the winner**: A team of Trump allies met with the president in the White House and urged him to issue a drafted executive order, which would have allowed the military to seize voting machines and delay the transition to the Biden administration.\n*   **Pressure on Vice President Pence to obstruct the certification of electoral votes**: Republican Representative Louis Gohmert of Texas and the slate of Republican presidential electors for Arizona filed a lawsuit against Vice President Pence, seeking to force him to decide the election outcome.\n*   **Fake electors sent by the Trump campaign in seven states**: The Trump campaign sent fake electors to seven states, alleging that these states had sent competing sets of electors. If the results from these states had been rejected, neither candidate would have had the 270 votes required in the Electoral College, and the House would have had to decide the election.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe proposed objection effort was widely condemned by politicians and experts. A bipartisan group of senators, including Joe Manchin, Susan Collins, and Angus King, issued a statement saying that the 2020 election is over and further attempts to cast doubt on its legitimacy serve only to undermine Americans' confidence in the already determined election results.\n\n**Joint Session of Congress**\n\nThe joint session of Congress met at 1:00 p.m. EST to count the results of the Electoral College. Prior to the vote, Pence released a letter to Congress, denying the assertion that he had \"unilateral authority\" to overturn any state results.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nOn January 11, 2021, Representative Cori Bush of Missouri filed a resolution calling for the possible expulsion of more than 100 Republican members of the U.S House of Representatives who voted against certifying results of the presidential election. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island said the Senate Ethics Committee \"must consider the expulsion, or censure and punishment, of Senators Cruz, Hawley, and perhaps others.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count\" following this outline:\n\n\nBackground\nThe United States Electoral College is the group of presidential electors required by the Constitution to form every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president Each state appoints electors according to its legislature, equal in number to its congressional delegation (senators and representatives) Federal office holders cannot be electors Of the current 538 electors, an absolute majority of 270 or more electoral votes is required to elect the president and vice president [1] As stated in the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, if no candidate for either office achieves an absolute majority there, a contingent election is held by the United States House of Representatives to elect the president, and by the United States Senate to elect the vice president;

The agency has a long and complex history, with notable achievements in law enforcement, industrial security, and private investigation. This article provides an overview of the agency's history, notable cases, and modern operations.\n\n**Origins**\n\nAllan Pinkerton, a former railroad police officer, met Chicago attorney Edward Rucker in a local Masonic Hall in the 1850s. The two men formed the North-Western Police Agency, later known as the Pinkerton Agency. Pinkerton used his skills in espionage to attract clients and begin growing the agency. Historian Frank Morn writes: \"By the mid-1850s, a few businessmen saw the need for greater control over their employees; their solution was to sponsor a private detective system.\" In February 1855, Allan Pinkerton, after consulting with six midwestern railroads, created such an agency in Chicago.\n\nThe Pinkerton Agency began to hire women and minorities shortly after its founding because they were useful as spies, a practice uncommon at the time. This decision helped the agency to gather intelligence and conduct investigations more effectively. The agency's early success led to its expansion, and it became a leading provider of private security services in the United States.\n\n**Forerunners to the Secret Service**\n\nAmong the business's early operations was to safely deliver the newly elected President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, from Springfield to Washington, D.C., in light of an assassination threat. Pinkerton detective Kate Warne was assigned and successfully delivered Lincoln to the U.S capital city through a series of disguises and related tactics that required her to stay awake throughout the entire long journey. As a result of the public notoriety of this success, the business adopted an open eye as its logo and the slogan, \"We never sleep.\"\n\nAllan Pinkerton around this time also served in the \"Secret Service\" intelligence division of what was then known as the U.S War Department. This division was responsible for gathering intelligence and conducting investigations related to national security. Pinkerton's experience in this role helped to inform the development of the agency's investigative techniques and strategies.\n\n**U.S. Government Contractor**\n\nIn 1871, Congress appropriated $50,000 (about equivalent to $1,272,000 in 2023) to the new Department of Justice to form a sub-organization devoted to \"the detection and prosecution of those guilty of violating federal law.\" The amount was insufficient to form an internal investigating unit, so they contracted out the services to the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. This marked the beginning of the agency's relationship with the U.S government, which would become a significant source of revenue and influence for the agency.\n\n**Molly Maguires**\n\nIn the 1870s, Franklin B Gowen, then president of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, hired the agency to investigate the labor unions in the company's mines. A Pinkerton agent, James McParland, using the alias \"James McKenna,\" infiltrated the Molly Maguires, a 19th-century secret society of mainly Irish-American coal miners, leading to the downfall of the organization.\n\nThe Molly Maguires were a group of coal miners who had formed a secret society to protect their interests and fight against the exploitation of workers by mine owners and managers. The group was accused of violence and intimidation, and the Pinkerton agency was hired to investigate and bring the members to justice. The case was highly publicized and led to the execution of several Molly Maguires leaders.\n\n**Homestead Strike**\n\nOn July 6, 1892, during the Homestead Strike, 300 Pinkerton agents from New York and Chicago were called in by Carnegie Steel's Henry Clay Frick to protect the Pittsburgh-area mill and act as strikebreakers. This resulted in a firefight and siege in which 16 men were killed and 23 others were wounded. Following the confrontation, the Governor of Pennsylvania, Robert E Pattison, mobilized state law enforcement and the National Guard. Private and government forces broke the strike, and workers returned to the steel mill.\n\nThe Homestead Strike was a major labor dispute between Carnegie Steel and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers. The strike was marked by violence and intimidation on both sides, and the Pinkerton agency was hired to protect the mill and break the strike. The agency's actions during the strike were highly criticized by labor organizers and union members.\n\n**Steunenberg Murder and Trial**\n\nHarry Orchard was arrested by the Idaho police and confessed to Pinkerton agent James McParland that he assassinated former Governor Frank Steunenberg of Idaho in 1905. Orchard testified (unsuccessfully), under threat of hanging, against Western Federation of Miners (WFM) president Big Bill Haywood, naming him as having hired the hit. With a stirring defense by Clarence Darrow, Haywood and the other defendants of the WFM were acquitted in a nationally publicized trial. Orchard received a death sentence, but it was commuted.\n\nThe Steunenberg murder was a highly publicized case that involved allegations of labor union violence and intimidation. The Pinkerton agency was involved in the investigation and prosecution of the case, and its actions were criticized by labor organizers and union members.\n\n**Outlaws and Competition**\n\nPinkerton agents were hired to track western outlaws Jesse James, the Reno Gang, and the Wild Bunch (including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid). On March 17, 1874, two Pinkerton detectives and a deputy sheriff, Edwin P Daniels, encountered the Younger brothers (associates of the James–Younger Gang); Daniels, John Younger, and one Pinkerton agent were killed. In Union, Missouri, a bank was robbed by George Collins, aka Fred Lewis, and Bill Randolph; Pinkerton Detective Chas Schumacher trailed them and was killed. Collins was hanged on March 26, 1904, and Randolph on May 8, 1905, in Union.\n\nPinkertons were also hired to transport money and other high-quality merchandise between cities and towns, which made them vulnerable to outlaws. Pinkerton agents were usually well paid and well armed.\n\n**Modern Era**\n\nDue to its conflicts with labor unions, the word Pinkerton continues to be associated by labor organizers and union members with strikebreaking. Pinkertons diversified from labor spying following revelations publicized by the La Follette Committee hearings in 1937, and the firm's criminal detection work also suffered from the police modernization movement, which saw the rise of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the bolstering of detective branches and resources of the public police.\n\nWith less of the labor and criminal investigation work on which Pinkertons thrived for decades, the company became increasingly involved in protection services, and in the 1960s, even the word \"detective\" disappeared from the agency's letterhead. The company now focuses on threat intelligence, risk management, executive protection, and active shooter response.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* La Follette Committee hearings\n* Federal Bureau of Investigation\n* National Guard\n* Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers\n* Western Federation of Miners\n* Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Pinkerton National Detective Agency (official website)\n* Pinkerton (Wikipedia article)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Pinkerton_(detective_agency)\" following this outline:\n\n\nOrigins\nIn the 1850s, Allan Pinkerton, a Scottish immigrant, met Chicago attorney Edward Rucker in a local Masonic Hall The two men formed the North-Western Police Agency, later known as the Pinkerton Agency [13] [14] [15] Pinkerton used his skills in espionage to attract clients and begin growing the agency Historian Frank Morn writes: \"By the mid-1850s, a few businessmen saw the need for greater control over their employees;

{"title": "September_11_attacks", "content": "\nBackground\n\n\nOsama bin Laden\n\nBin Laden orchestrated the September 11 attacks He initially denied involvement, but later recanted his denial [26] [27] [28] Al Jazeera broadcast a statement by him on September 16, 2001: \"I stress that I have not carried out this act, which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation\" [29] In November 2001, U.S forces recovered a videotape in which bin Laden, talking to Khaled al-Harbi, admitted foreknowledge of the attacks [30] On December 27, 2001, a second video of bin Laden was released in which he, stopping short of admitting responsibility for the attacks, said: [31]\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed and other al-Qaeda members\nJournalist Yosri Fouda of the Arabic television channel Al Jazeera reported that in April 2002, al-Qaeda member Khalid Sheikh Mohammed admitted his involvement in the attacks, along with Ramzi bin al-Shibh [36] [37] [38] The 2004 9/11 Commission Report determined that the animosity which Mohammed, the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks, felt towards the United States had stemmed from his \"violent disagreement with U.S foreign policy favoring Israel\" [39] Mohammed was also an adviser and financier of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the uncle of Ramzi Yousef, the lead bomber in that attack [40] [41] In late 1994, Mohammed and Yousef moved on to plan a new terrorist attack called the Bojinka plot planned for January 1995 Despite a failure and Yousef's capture by U.S forces the following month, the Bojinka plot would influence the later 9/11 attacks [42]\n\n\nMotives\nOsama bin Laden's declaration of a holy war against the United States, and a 1998 fatwā signed by bin Laden and others that called for the killing of Americans, [20] [44] are seen by investigators as evidence of his motivation [45] In November 2001, bin Laden defended the attacks as retaliatory strikes against American atrocities against Muslims across the world He also maintained that the attacks were not directed against women and children, asserting that the targets of the strikes were symbols of America's \"economic and military power\" [46] [47]\n\n\nPlanning\nDocuments seized during the 2011 operation that killed bin Laden included notes handwritten by bin Laden in September 2002 with the heading \"The Birth of the Idea of September 11\" He describes how he was inspired by the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 on October 31, 1999, which was deliberately crashed by co-pilot Gameel Al-Batouti, killing over 200 passengers \"This is how the idea of 9/11 was conceived and developed in my head, and that is when we began the planning\" bin Laden continued, adding that no one but Abu Hafs and Abu al-Khair knew about it at the time The 9/11 Commission Report identified Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the architect of 9/11, but he is not mentioned in bin Laden's notes [73]\n\n\nPrior intelligence\nIn late 1999, al-Qaeda associate Walid bin Attash (\"Khallad\") contacted Mihdhar and told him to meet in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Hazmi and Abu Bara al Yemeni would also be in attendance The NSA intercepted a telephone call mentioning the meeting, Mihdhar, and the name \"Nawaf\" (Hazmi); while the agency feared \"Something nefarious might be afoot\", it took no further action.\n\n\nAttacks\nEarly on the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001, nineteen hijackers took control of four commercial airliners (two Boeing 757s and two Boeing 767s) [107] Large planes with long flights were selected for hijacking because they would have more fuel [108]\n\n\nCrashes\nAt 7:59 a.m., American Airlines Flight 11 took off from Logan International Airport in Boston [110] Fifteen minutes into the flight, five hijackers armed with boxcutters took over the plane, injuring at least three people (and possibly killing one) [111] [112] [113] before forcing their way into the cockpit The terrorists also displayed an apparent explosive and sprayed mace into the cabin, to frighten the hostages into submission and further hinder resistance [114] Back at Logan, United Airlines Flight 175 took off at 8:14 a.m [115] Hundreds of miles southwest at Dulles International Airport, American Airlines Flight 77 left the runway at 8:20 a.m [115] Flight 175's journey proceeded normally for 28 minutes until 8:42 am, when a group of five hijacked the plane, murdering both pilots and stabbing several crew members before assuming control of the aircraft These hijackers also used bomb threats to instil fear into the passengers and crew, [116] also spraying chemical weapons to disable any opposition [117] Concurrently, United Airlines Flight 93 departed from Newark International Airport in New Jersey; [115] originally scheduled to pull away from the gate at 8:00 a.m., the plane was running 42 minutes late.\n\n\nCasualties\nThe attack on the World Trade Center's North Tower alone [m] made 9/11 the deadliest act of terrorism in history [155] Taken together, the four crashes killed 2,996 people (including the hijackers) and injured thousands more [156] The death toll included 265 on the four planes (from which there were no survivors); 2,606 in the World Trade Center and the surrounding area; and 125 at the Pentagon [157] [158] Most who died were civilians, as well as 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel, and the 19 terrorists [159] [160] More than 90 countries lost citizens in the attacks [161]\n\n\nDamage\nThe Twin Towers, the Marriott Hotel (3 WTC), 7 WTC, and St Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church were destroyed [206] The U.S Customs House (6 World Trade Center), 4 World Trade Center, 5 World Trade Center, and both pedestrian bridges connecting buildings were severely damaged All surrounding streets were in ruins [207] The last fires at the World Trade Center site were extinguished on December 20 [208]\n\n\nRescue efforts\nThe New York City Fire Department (FDNY) deployed more than 200 units (approximately half of the department) to the World Trade Center [227] Their efforts were supplemented by off-duty firefighters and emergency medical technicians [228] [227] [229] The New York City Police Department (NYPD) sent its Emergency Service Units and other police personnel and deployed its aviation unit, [230] which determined that helicopter rescues from the towers were not feasible [231] Numerous police officers of the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD) also participated in rescue efforts [232] Once on the scene, the FDNY, the NYPD, and the PAPD did not coordinate efforts and performed redundant searches for civilians [228] [233]\n\n\nReactions\nThe 9/11 attacks resulted in immediate responses, including domestic reactions; closings and cancellations; hate crimes; international responses; and military responses Shortly after the attacks, the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund was created by an Act of Congress [236] [237] The purpose of the fund was to compensate the victims of the attacks and their families with their agreement not to file lawsuits against the airlines involved [238] Legislation authorizes the fund to disburse a maximum of $7.375 billion, including operational and administrative costs, of U.S government funds [239] The fund was set to expire by 2020 but was in 2019 prolonged to allow claims to be filed until October 2090 [240] [241]\n\n\nImmediate response\nAt 8:32 a.m., FAA officials were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and they, in turn, notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) NORAD scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts; they were airborne by 8:53& a.m Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials, NORAD had nine minutes' notice, and no notice about any of the other flights before they crashed.\n\n\nDomestic reactions\nFollowing the attacks, President George W Bush's approval rating increased to 90% [255] On September 20, 2001, he addressed the nation and a joint session of Congress regarding the events, the rescue and recovery efforts, and his intended response to the attacks New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani's highly visible role resulted in praise in New York and nationally [256]\n\n\nHate crimes\nSix days after the attacks, President Bush made a public appearance at Washington, D.C.'s largest Islamic Center where he acknowledged the \"incredibly valuable contribution\" of American Muslims and called for them \"to be treated with respect\" [265] Numerous incidents of harassment and hate crimes against Muslims and South Asians were reported in the days following the attacks [266] [267] [268]\n\n\nDiscrimination and racial profiling\nA poll of Arab-Americans in May 2002 found that 20% had personally experienced discrimination since September 11 A July 2002 poll of Muslim Americans found that 48% believed their lives had changed for the worse since September 11, and 57% had experienced an act of bias or discrimination [273] Following the September 11 attacks, many Pakistani Americans identified themselves as Indians to avoid potential discrimination and obtain jobs [274]\n\n\nMuslim American response\nMuslim organizations in the United States were swift to condemn the attacks and called \"upon Muslim Americans to come forward with their skills and resources to help alleviate the sufferings of the affected people and their families\" [275] These organizations included the Islamic Society of North America, American Muslim Alliance, American Muslim Council, Council on American-Islamic Relations, Islamic Circle of North America, and the Shari'a Scholars Association of North America Along with monetary donations, many Islamic organizations launched blood drives and provided medical assistance, food, and shelter for victims [276] [277] [278]\n\n\nInterfaith efforts\nCuriosity about Islam increased after the attacks As a result, many mosques and Islamic centers began holding open houses and participating in outreach efforts to educate non-Muslims about the faith In the first 10 years after the attacks, interfaith community service increased from 8 to 20 percent and the percentage of U.S congregations involved in interfaith worship doubled from 7 to 14 percent [279]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nThe attacks were denounced by mass media and governments worldwide Nations offered pro-American support and solidarity [280] Leaders in most Middle Eastern countries, as well as Libya and Afghanistan, condemned the attacks Iraq was a notable exception, with an immediate official statement that \"the American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity\" [281] The government of Saudi Arabia officially condemned the attacks, but privately many Saudis favored bin Laden's cause [282] [283]\n\n\nMilitary operations\nAt 2:40 pm on September 11, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was issuing orders to his aides to look for evidence of Iraqi involvement According to notes taken by senior policy official Stephen Cambone, Rumsfeld asked for, \"Best info fast Judge whether they are good enough to hit S.H  [Saddam Hussein] at the same time Not only UBL\"  [Osama bin Laden] [310]\n\n\nAftermath\nHundreds of thousands of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants and known carcinogens were spread across Lower Manhattan when the towers collapsed [325] [326] Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at Ground Zero [327] [328] The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality in the aftermath of the attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002 [329]\n\n\nHealth issues\nHundreds of thousands of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants and known carcinogens were spread across Lower Manhattan when the towers collapsed [325] [326] Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at Ground Zero [327] [328] The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality in the aftermath of the attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002 [329]\n\n\nEconomic\nThe attacks had a significant economic impact on the US and world markets [343] The stock exchanges did not open on September 11 and remained closed until September 17 Reopening, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 684 points, or 7.1%, to 8921, a record-setting one-day point decline [344] By the end of the week, the DJIA had fallen 1,369.7 points (14.3%), at the time its largest one-week point drop in history In 2001 dollars, U.S stocks lost $1.4 trillion in valuation for the week [345]\n\n\nEffects in Afghanistan\nIf Americans are clamouring to bomb Afghanistan back to the Stone Age, they ought to know that this nation does not have so far to go This is a post-apocalyptic place of felled cities, parched land and downtrodden people.\n\n\nCultural influence\nImmediate responses to 9/11 included greater focus on home life and time spent with family, higher church attendance, and increased expressions of patriotism such as the flying of American flags [368] The radio industry responded by removing certain songs from playlists, and the attacks have subsequently been used as background, narrative, or thematic elements in film, music, literature, and humour Already-running television shows as well as programs developed after 9/11 have reflected post-9/11 cultural concerns [369]\n\n\nGovernment policies towards terrorism\nAs a result of the attacks, many governments across the world passed legislation to combat terrorism [376] In Germany, where several of the 9/11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country's liberal asylum policies, two major anti-terrorism packages were enacted The first removed legal loopholes that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in Germany The second addressed the effectiveness and communication of intelligence and law enforcement [377] Canada passed the Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act, their first anti-terrorism law [378] The United Kingdom passed the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 [379] [380] New Zealand enacted the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 [381]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nAs all 19 hijackers died in the attacks, they were never prosecuted Osama bin Laden was never formally indicted; he was ultimately killed by U.S special forces on May 2, 2011, in his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, after a 10-year manhunt [n] [394] The main trial of the attacks against Mohammed and his co-conspirators Walid bin Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Ammar al-Baluchi, and Mustafa Ahmad al Hawsawi remains unresolved Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was arrested on March 1, 2003, in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, by Pakistani security officials working with the CIA He was then held at multiple CIA secret prisons and Guantanamo Bay, where he was interrogated and tortured with methods including waterboarding [395] [396] In 2003, Mustafa al-Hawsawi and Abd al-Aziz Ali were arrested and transferred to U.S custody Both would later be accused of providing money and travel assistance to the hijackers [397] During U.S hearings at Guantanamo Bay in March 2007, Mohammed again confessed his responsibility for the attacks, stating he \"was responsible for the 9/11 operation from A to Z\" and that his statement was not made under duress [38] [398] In January 2023, the US government opened up about a potential plea deal, [399] with Biden giving up on the effort in September that year [400]\n\n\nInvestigations\nImmediately after the attacks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation started PENTTBOM, the largest criminal inquiry in US history At its height, more than half of the FBI's agents worked on the investigation and followed a half-million leads [404] The FBI concluded that there was \"clear and irrefutable\" evidence linking al-Qaeda and bin Laden to the attacks [405]\n\n\nFBI\nImmediately after the attacks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation started PENTTBOM, the largest criminal inquiry in US history At its height, more than half of the FBI's agents worked on the investigation and followed a half-million leads [404] The FBI concluded that there was \"clear and irrefutable\" evidence linking al-Qaeda and bin Laden to the attacks [405]\n\n\nCIA\nIn 2004, John L Helgerson, the Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), conducted an internal review of the agency's pre-9/11 performance and was harshly critical of senior CIA officials for not doing everything possible to confront terrorism [422] According to Philip Giraldi in The American Conservative, Helgerson criticized their failure to stop two of the 9/11 hijackers, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, as they entered the United States and their failure to share information on the two men with the FBI [423]\n\n\nCongressional inquiry\nIn February 2002, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence formed a joint inquiry into the performance of the U.S Intelligence Community [425] Their 832-page report released in December 2002 [426] detailed failings of the FBI and CIA to use available information, including about terrorists the CIA knew were in the United States, to disrupt the plots [427] The joint inquiry developed its information about possible involvement of Saudi Arabian government officials from non-classified sources [428] The Bush administration demanded 28 related pages remain classified [427] In December 2002, the inquiry's chair Bob Graham revealed in an interview that there was \"evidence that there were foreign governments involved in facilitating the activities of at least some of the terrorists in the United States\" [429] September 11 victim families were frustrated by the unanswered questions and redacted material from the congressional inquiry and demanded an independent commission [427] September 11 victim families, [430] members of Congress [431] and the Saudi Arabian government are still seeking the release of the documents [432] [433] In June 2016, CIA chief John Brennan said that he believes 28 redacted pages of a congressional inquiry into 9/11 will soon be made public, and that they will prove that the government of Saudi Arabia had no involvement in the September 11 attacks [434]\n\n\n9/11 Commission\nThe National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, popularly known as the 9/11 Commission, chaired by Thomas Kean, [o] was formed in late 2002 to prepare a thorough account of the circumstances surrounding the attacks, including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks [442] On July 22, 2004, the commission issued the 9/11 Commission Report, a 585-page report based on its investigations The report detailed the events leading up to the attacks, concluding that they were carried out by al-Qaeda [443] The commission also examined how security and intelligence agencies were inadequately coordinated to prevent the attacks.\n\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology\nThe U.S National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) investigated the collapses of the Twin Towers and 7 WTC The investigations examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures were in place, and evaluated how fire protection systems might be improved in future construction [446] The investigation into the collapse of 1 WTC and 2 WTC was concluded in October 2005 and that of 7 WTC was

September 11, 2001, by al-Qaeda, an Islamic extremist group led by Osama bin Laden. The attacks involved the hijacking of four commercial airplanes, two of which were intentionally crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, one into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and the fourth into a field in Pennsylvania.\n\n**Background**\n\nOsama bin Laden\n\nOsama bin Laden orchestrated the September 11 attacks.

In late 1994, Mohammed and Yousef moved on to plan a new terrorist attack called the Bojinka plot planned for January 1995.

Hazmi and Abu Bara al Yemeni would also be in attendance The NSA intercepted a telephone call mentioning the meeting, Mihdhar, and the name \"Nawaf\" (Hazmi); while the agency feared \"Something nefarious might be afoot\", it took no further action.\n\n\nAttacks\nEarly on the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001, nineteen hijackers took control of four commercial airliners (two Boeing 757s and two Boeing 767s) [107] Large planes with long flights were selected for hijacking because they would have more fuel [108]\n\n\nCrashes\nAt 7:59 a.m., American Airlines Flight 11 took off from Logan International Airport in Boston [110] Fifteen minutes into the flight, five hijackers armed with boxcutters took over the plane, injuring at least three people (and possibly killing one) [111] [112] [113] before forcing their way into the cockpit The terrorists also displayed an apparent explosive and sprayed mace into the cabin, to frighten the hostages into submission and further hinder resistance [114] Back at Logan, United Airlines Flight 175 took off at 8:14 a.m [115] Hundreds of miles southwest at Dulles International Airport, American Airlines Flight 77 left the runway at 8:20 a.m [115] Flight 175's journey proceeded normally for 28 minutes until 8:42 am, when a group of five hijacked the plane, murdering both pilots and stabbing several crew members before assuming control of the aircraft These hijackers also used bomb threats to instil fear into the passengers and crew, [116] also spraying chemical weapons to disable any opposition [117] Concurrently, United Airlines Flight 93 departed from Newark International Airport in New Jersey; [115] originally scheduled to pull away from the gate at 8:00 a.m., the plane was running 42 minutes late.\n\n\nCasualties\nThe attack on the World Trade Center's North Tower alone [m] made 9/11 the deadliest act of terrorism in history [155] Taken together, the four crashes killed 2,996 people (including the hijackers) and injured thousands more [156] The death toll included 265 on the four planes (from which there were no survivors); 2,606 in the World Trade Center and the surrounding area; and 125 at the Pentagon [157] [158] Most who died were civilians, as well as 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel, and the 19 terrorists [159] [160] More than 90 countries lost citizens in the attacks [161]\n\n\nDamage\nThe Twin Towers, the Marriott Hotel (3 WTC), 7 WTC, and St Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church were destroyed [206] The U.S Customs House (6 World Trade Center), 4 World Trade Center, 5 World Trade Center, and both pedestrian bridges connecting buildings were severely damaged All surrounding streets were in ruins [207] The last fires at the World Trade Center site were extinguished on December 20 [208]\n\n\nRescue efforts\nThe New York City Fire Department (FDNY) deployed more than 200 units (approximately half of the department) to the World Trade Center [227] Their efforts were supplemented by off-duty firefighters and emergency medical technicians [228] [227] [229] The New York City Police Department (NYPD) sent its Emergency Service Units and other police personnel and deployed its aviation unit, [230] which determined that helicopter rescues from the towers were not feasible [231] Numerous police officers of the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD) also participated in rescue efforts [232] Once on the scene, the FDNY, the NYPD, and the PAPD did not coordinate efforts and performed redundant searches for civilians [228] [233]\n\n\nReactions\nThe 9/11 attacks resulted in immediate responses, including domestic reactions; closings and cancellations; hate crimes; international responses; and military responses Shortly after the attacks, the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund was created by an Act of Congress [236] [237] The purpose of the fund was to compensate the victims of the attacks and their families with their agreement not to file lawsuits against the airlines involved [238] Legislation authorizes the fund to disburse a maximum of $7.375 billion, including operational and administrative costs, of U.S government funds [239] The fund was set to expire by 2020 but was in 2019 prolonged to allow claims to be filed until October 2090 [240] [241]\n\n\nImmediate response\nAt 8:32 a.m., FAA officials were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and they, in turn, notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) NORAD scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts; they were airborne by 8:53& a.m Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials, NORAD had nine minutes' notice, and no notice about any of the other flights before they crashed.\n\n\nDomestic reactions\nFollowing the attacks, President George W Bush's approval rating increased to 90% [255] On September 20, 2001, he addressed the nation and a joint session of Congress regarding the events, the rescue and recovery efforts, and his intended response to the attacks New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani's highly visible role resulted in praise in New York and nationally [256]\n\n\nHate crimes\nSix days after the attacks, President Bush made a public appearance at Washington, D.C.'s largest Islamic Center where he acknowledged the \"incredibly valuable contribution\" of American Muslims and called for them \"to be treated with respect\" [265] Numerous incidents of harassment and hate crimes against Muslims and South Asians were reported in the days following the attacks [266] [267] [268]\n\n\nDiscrimination and racial profiling\nA poll of Arab-Americans in May 2002 found that 20% had personally experienced discrimination since September 11 A July 2002 poll of Muslim Americans found that 48% believed their lives had changed for the worse since September 11, and 57% had experienced an act of bias or discrimination [273] Following the September 11 attacks, many Pakistani Americans identified themselves as Indians to avoid potential discrimination and obtain jobs [274]\n\n\nMuslim American response\nMuslim organizations in the United States were swift to condemn the attacks and called \"upon Muslim Americans to come forward with their skills and resources to help alleviate the sufferings of the affected people and their families\" [275] These organizations included the Islamic Society of North America, American Muslim Alliance, American Muslim Council, Council on American-Islamic Relations, Islamic Circle of North America, and the Shari'a Scholars Association of North America Along with monetary donations, many Islamic organizations launched blood drives and provided medical assistance, food, and shelter for victims [276] [277] [278]\n\n\nInterfaith efforts\nCuriosity about Islam increased after the attacks As a result, many mosques and Islamic centers began holding open houses and participating in outreach efforts to educate non-Muslims about the faith In the first 10 years after the attacks, interfaith community service increased from 8 to 20 percent and the percentage of U.S congregations involved in interfaith worship doubled from 7 to 14 percent [279]\n\n\nInternational reactions\nThe attacks were denounced by mass media and governments worldwide Nations offered pro-American support and solidarity [280] Leaders in most Middle Eastern countries, as well as Libya and Afghanistan, condemned the attacks Iraq was a notable exception, with an immediate official statement that \"the American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their crimes against humanity\" [281] The government of Saudi Arabia officially condemned the attacks, but privately many Saudis favored bin Laden's cause [282] [283]\n\n\nMilitary operations\nAt 2:40 pm on September 11, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was issuing orders to his aides to look for evidence of Iraqi involvement According to notes taken by senior policy official Stephen Cambone, Rumsfeld asked for, \"Best info fast Judge whether they are good enough to hit S.H  [Saddam Hussein] at the same time Not only UBL\"  [Osama bin Laden] [310]\n\n\nAftermath\nHundreds of thousands of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants and known carcinogens were spread across Lower Manhattan when the towers collapsed [325] [326] Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at Ground Zero [327] [328] The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue reassuring statements regarding air quality in the aftermath of the attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002 [329]\n\n\nHealth issues\nHundreds of thousands of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants and known carcinogens were spread across Lower Manhattan when the towers collapsed [325] [326] Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at Ground Zero

but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002 [329]\n\n\nEconomic\nThe attacks had a significant economic impact on the US and world markets [343] The stock exchanges did not open on September 11 and remained closed until September 17 Reopening, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 684 points, or 7.1%, to 8921, a record-setting one-day point decline [344] By the end of the week, the DJIA had fallen 1,369.7 points (14.3%), at the time its largest one-week point drop in history In 2001 dollars, U.S stocks lost $1.4 trillion in valuation for the week [345]\n\n\nEffects in Afghanistan\nIf Americans are clamouring to bomb Afghanistan back to the Stone Age, they ought to know that this nation does not have so far to go This is a post-apocalyptic place of felled cities, parched land and downtrodden people.\n\n\nCultural influence\nImmediate responses to 9/11 included greater focus on home life and time spent with family, higher church attendance, and increased expressions of patriotism such as the flying of American flags [368] The radio industry responded by removing certain songs from playlists, and the attacks have subsequently been used as background, narrative, or thematic elements in film, music, literature, and humour Already-running television shows as well as programs developed after 9/11 have reflected post-9/11 cultural concerns [369]\n\n\nGovernment policies towards terrorism\nAs a result of the attacks, many governments across the world passed legislation to combat terrorism [376] In Germany, where several of the 9/11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country's liberal asylum policies, two major anti-terrorism packages were enacted The first removed legal loopholes that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in Germany The second addressed the effectiveness and communication of intelligence and law enforcement [377] Canada passed the Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act, their first anti-terrorism law [378] The United Kingdom passed the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 [379] [380] New Zealand enacted the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 [381]\n\n\nLegal proceedings\nAs all 19 hijackers died in the attacks, they were never prosecuted Osama bin Laden was never formally indicted; he was ultimately killed by U.S special forces on May 2, 2011, in his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, after a 10-year manhunt [n] [394] The main trial of the attacks against Mohammed and his co-conspirators Walid bin Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Ammar al-Baluchi, and Mustafa Ahmad al Hawsawi remains unresolved Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was arrested on March 1, 2003, in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, by Pakistani security officials working with the CIA He was then held at multiple CIA secret prisons and Guantanamo Bay, where he was interrogated and tortured with methods including waterboarding [395] [396] In 2003, Mustafa al-Hawsawi and Abd al-Aziz Ali were arrested and transferred to U.S custody Both would later be accused of providing money and travel assistance to the hijackers [397] During U.S hearings at Guantanamo Bay in March 2007, Mohammed again confessed his responsibility for the attacks, stating he \"was responsible for the 9/11 operation from A to Z\" and that his statement was not made under duress [38] [398] In January 2023, the US government opened up about a potential plea deal, [399] with Biden giving up on the effort in September that year [400]\n\n\nInvestigations\nImmediately after the attacks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation started PENTTBOM, the largest criminal inquiry in US history At its height, more than half of the FBI's agents worked on the investigation and followed a half-million leads [404] The FBI concluded that there was \"clear and irrefutable\" evidence linking al-Qaeda and bin Laden to the attacks [405]\n\n\nFBI\nImmediately after the attacks, the Federal

[404] The FBI concluded that there was \"clear and irrefutable\" evidence linking al-Qaeda and bin Laden to the attacks [405]\n\n\nCIA\nIn 2004, John L Helgerson, the Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), conducted an internal review of the agency's pre-9/11 performance and was harshly critical of senior CIA officials for not doing everything possible to confront terrorism [422] According to Philip Giraldi in The American Conservative, Helgerson criticized their failure to stop two of the 9/11 hijackers, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, as they entered the United States and their failure to share information on the two men with the FBI [423]\n\n\nCongressional inquiry\nIn February 2002, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence formed a joint inquiry into the performance of the U.S Intelligence Community [425] Their 832-page report released in December 2002 [426] detailed failings of the FBI and CIA to use available information, including about terrorists the CIA knew were in the United States, to disrupt the plots [427] The joint inquiry developed its information about possible involvement of Saudi Arabian government officials from non-classified sources [428] The Bush administration demanded 28 related pages remain classified [427] In December 2002, the inquiry's chair Bob Graham revealed in an interview that there was \"evidence that there were foreign governments involved in facilitating the activities of at least some of the terrorists in the United States\" [429] September 11 victim families were frustrated by the unanswered questions and redacted material from the congressional inquiry and demanded an independent commission [427] September 11 victim families, [430] members of Congress [431] and the Saudi Arabian government are still seeking the release of the documents [432] [433] In June 2016, CIA chief John Brennan said that he believes 28 redacted pages of a congressional inquiry into 9/11 will soon be made public, and that they will prove that the government of Saudi Arabia had no involvement in the September 11 attacks [434]\n\n\n9/11 Commission\nThe National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, popularly known as the 9/11 Commission, chaired by Thomas Kean, [o] was formed in late 2002 to prepare a thorough account of the circumstances surrounding the attacks, including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks [442] On July 22, 2004, the commission issued the 9/11 Commission Report, a 585-page report based on its investigations The report detailed the events leading up to the attacks, concluding that they were carried out by al-Qaeda [443] The commission also examined how security and intelligence agencies were inadequately coordinated to prevent the attacks.\n\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology\nThe U.S National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) investigated the collapses of the Twin Towers and 7 WTC The investigations examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures were in place, and evaluated how fire protection systems might be improved in future construction [446] The investigation into the collapse of 1 WTC and 2 WTC was concluded in October 2005 and that of 7 WTC was completed in August 2008 [447]\n\n\nAlleged Saudi government role\nIn July 2016, the Obama administration released a document compiled by U.S investigators Dana Lesemann and Michael Jacobson, known as \"File 17\", [453] which contains a list naming three dozen people, including the suspected Saudi intelligence officers attached to Saudi Arabia's embassy in Washington, D.C., [454] which connects Saudi Arabia to the hijackers [455] [456]\n\n\nRebuilding and memorials\nOn the day of the attacks, New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani stated: \"We will rebuild We're going to come out of this stronger than before, politically stronger, economically stronger The skyline will be made whole again\" [461]\n\n\nReconstruction\nOn the day of the attacks, New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani stated: \"We will rebuild We're going to come out

Recording was finished by the end of the following month, and on October 11, the band's debut album was released through Immortal Records (an Epic imprint label); it peaked at number one on the Heatseekers Albums chart and would eventually reach number 72 on the Billboard 200 in February 1996. The album received positive reviews by critics, and is said to have established the new wave of metal, as well as sparking the nu metal genre. As well as sparking the nu metal genre, it also started record producer Ross Robinson's music career and influenced bands such as Slipknot, Coal Chamber, and Limp Bizkit.\n\n## Life Is Peachy (1996–1997)\n\nAfter the success of their debut, Korn decided to enter the studio again for a second album. By then, the band had created a large fan base and the expectations for their follow-up album were high. They went back into the studio in early April 1996 at Indigo Ranch Studios, Malibu, California.\n\n## Follow the Leader (1998–1999)\n\nIn 1998, Korn signed a publishing contract with Warner Chappell Music. While Korn was waiting for a full partnership with Adidas (which had previously sponsored Run-DMC), the brand refused to sign a contract with Korn. In a contradictory argument, Adidas told them: \"We do sports, not music.\" In 1998, Puma seized the opportunity and offered a $500,000 deal to Korn, including their music featured in Kevin Kerslake-directed advertisements. Korn accepted the contract; Davis said, \"That's more than Adidas ever did for us! It wasn't a sell-out thing.

Issues was released during a week of many highly anticipated records. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with at least 573,000 copies sold, keeping Dr Dre's second album 2001 and All the Way..

It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with 434,000 in sales. The band has blamed music piracy for the drop in sales, as an unmastered version of the album had leaked three months prior to its official release date.\n\n## Take a Look in the Mirror and Welch's departure (2003–2005)\n\nDue to the album Untouchables leaking onto the Internet, Take a Look in the Mirror was released on Friday November 21, 2003– four days earlier than its original release date. The album therefore received a weekend's worth of sales, which resulted in a poor showing on the Billboard 200. During its first full week, Take a Look in the Mirror soared ten places from number 19 to number 9, increasing the album's total sales to 179,000.\n\n## See You on the Other Side and Silveria's departure (2005–2007)\n\nUpon completing their record deal with Sony, Korn partnered with EMI and signed to Virgin Records. As part of this innovative arrangement, Virgin paid Korn $25 million upfront in exchange for a share in the profits of their next two studio albums, including tours and merchandising. Virgin also received a 30 percent stake in the band's licensing, ticket sales, and other revenue sources.\n\n## Untitled eighth album and Luzier's addition (2007–2008)\n\nKorn's untitled album was released on July 31, 2007, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 with 123,000 copies sold in its first week. The album was certified gold by the RIAA. It concluded Korn's deal with Virgin Records and features touring keyboardist Zac Baird. Drumming duties were left up to Terry Bozzio and Bad Religion's Brooks Wackerman, as David Silveria went on a hiatus. Joey Jordison from Slipknot played drums during Korn's live shows until the permanent addition of Ray Luzier (Army of Anyone, David Lee Roth). This confirmed David's departure.\n\n## Korn III: Remember Who You Are (2009–2011)\n\nIn a YouTube video, bassist Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu affirmed that a charity song titled \"A Song for Chi\" would be released, featuring Slipknot guitarist Jim Root; Clint Lowery of Sevendust; drummer Dave McClain of Machine Head; and former Korn guitarist Brian \"Head\" Welch, among many other musicians. The song was intended to raise money for Deftones bassist Chi Cheng, who fell into a comatose state following a car accident in November 2008.\n\n## The Path of Totality (2011–2012)\n\nKorn's tenth studio album, The Path of Totality, was released on December 6, 2011. It was the second and final studio album for Roadrunner Records. The album features contributions from Skrillex; 12th Planet; Excision; Downlink; Kill the Noise; Noisia; and various other EDM artists.\n\n## The Paradigm Shift and Welch's return (2012–2015)\n\nOn May 5, 2012, guitarist Brian \"Head\" Welch joined Korn on stage at the Carolina Rebellion festival to play \"Blind\" for the first time since his departure.\n\n## The Serenity of Suffering (2015–2018)\n\nKorn soon began the process of writing new songs for a twelfth studio album. Guitarist Head described the music on the new album as \"heavier than anyone's heard us in a long time.\" Their twelfth studio album The Serenity of Suffering was released on October 21, 2016. On July 14, 2016, guitarist James \"Munky\" Shaffer revealed to Metal Hammer that Corey Taylor of Slipknot/Stone Sour would make a guest appearance on the new album. He also revealed Nick Raskulinecz as the album's producer. On July 16, 2016, Korn premiered a new song, \"Rotting in Vain\", at Chicago Open Air Festival.\n\n## The Nothing (2018–2020)\n\nOn May 15, 2018, Korn announced the dates of special shows in order to mark the 20th anniversary of their album Follow the Leader. In order to mark the album's 20th anniversary, the band partnered with the clothing company Pleasures to release clothing merchandise dedicated to the album.\n\n## Requiem, Fieldy's hiatus and upcoming fifteenth studio album (2021–present)\n\nIn his first online interview of 2021, Brian Welch revealed that the band had plans for 2021 but was coy about what they were, hinting it had something to do with touring in a powerful way. On April 24, 2021, Korn released a one-off, online streaming event entitled Monumental that was filmed on the top of a parking structure at the Stranger Things: A Drive-Into Experience set in Los Angeles.\n\n## Artistry\n\nKorn is identified as the pioneers of nu metal music, a form of alternative metal music which began in the mid-1990s. While generally considered an alternative metal and nu metal band, the band has also been labeled as heavy metal, grunge, rap rock, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal, and hard rock. They are characterized by the style that incorporated downtuned guitars, a groove-heavy rhythm section, haunted atmospheric production, and dark lyrics. Their lyrics focus on pain and personal alienation rather than traditional heavy metal themes.\n\n## Style and instrumentation\n\nKorn is identified as the pioneers of nu metal music, a form of alternative metal music which began in the mid-1990s. While generally considered an alternative metal and nu metal band, the band has also been labeled as heavy metal, grunge, rap rock, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal, and hard rock. They are characterized by the style that incorporated downtuned guitars, a groove-heavy rhythm section, haunted atmospheric production, and dark lyrics. Their lyrics focus on pain and personal alienation rather than traditional heavy metal themes.\n\n## Lyrical themes\n\nMany of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song \"Daddy\" was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: \"When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son... I don't really like to talk about that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it...\" \"Kill You\" was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his stepmother. Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like \"Justin\" and \"Pretty\" written about incidents occurring during adulthood.\n\n## Influences\n\nA few years before establishing Korn, James \"Munky\" Shaffer; Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu; and David Silveria (who were three members of the funk rock band L.A.P.D.), alongside friend Brian \"Head\" Welch, all had the common influences of Red Hot Chili Peppers and especially the Faith No More album The Real Thing. Likewise, Davis was greatly inspired by the adventurousness of The Real Thing upon its 1989 release: \"It showed everybody you could do heavy music and not be 'metal'. It was something completely different.\"\n\n## In other media\n\nThey have contributed music to the soundtracks for movies such as The Crow: City of Angels, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Spawn, End of Days, and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life. The music of Korn has also been featured on various television series, including South Park (which they starred as guests), Beavis and Butt-head, and Daria.\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe band has sold over 40 million records worldwide as of 2021. Seven of their official releases are certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); two are certified double platinum; one is certified triple platinum; one is certified five times platinum; and two are certified Gold. Fourteen of their records have reached the top 10 of the Billboard 200, with eight reaching the top five; they are tied with Van Halen for the most top 10 records as a rock or metal artist. The band has also won two Grammy Awards from eight nominations.\n\n## Band members\n\n* Jonathan Davis – lead vocals (1993–present)\n* James \"Munky\" Shaffer – guitar (1993–present)\n* Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu – bass (1993–present)\n* Ray Luzier – drums (2009–present)\n\n## Discography\n\n* Korn (1994)\n* Life Is Peachy (1996)\n* Follow the Leader (1998)\n* Issues (1999)\n* Untouchables (2002)\n* Take a Look in the Mirror (2003)\n* See You on the Other Side (2005)\n* Untitled seventh studio album (2007)\n* Korn III: Remember Who You Are (2010)\n* The Path of Totality (2011)\n* The Paradigm Shift (2013)\n* The Serenity of Suffering (2016)\n* The Nothing (2019)\n* Requiem (2023)\n\n## Awards and nominations\n\n* Grammy Awards:\n\t+ Won: Best Metal Performance for \"Freak on a Leash\" (1999)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal Performance for \"Falling Away from Me\" (2000)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal Performance for \"Here to Stay\" (2004)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal Performance for \"Did My Time\" (2007)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Hard Rock Performance for \"Hunger Strike\" (2010)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Hard Rock Performance for \"Narcissus\" (2012)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal Performance for \"Sociopath\" (2013)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal Performance for \"Haze\" (2015)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal Performance for \"A Different World\" (2017)\n* American Music Awards:\n\t+ Nominated: Favorite Alternative Artist (1998)\n\t+ Nominated: Favorite Alternative Artist (1999)\n* MTV Video Music Awards:\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal/Hard Rock Video for \"Freak on a Leash\" (1999)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal/Hard Rock Video for \"Falling Away from Me\" (2000)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal/Hard Rock Video for \"Here to Stay\" (2004)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal/Hard Rock Video for \"Did My Time\" (2007)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal/Hard Rock Video for \"Hysteria\" (2010)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal/Hard Rock Video for \"Narcissus\" (2012)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal/Hard Rock Video for \"Sociopath\" (2013)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal/Hard Rock Video for \"Haze\" (2015)\n\t+ Nominated: Best Metal/Hard Rock Video for \"A Different World\" (2017)\n\n## See also\n\n* List of best-selling music artists\n* List of best-selling albums in the United States\n* List of number-one albums in the United States\n* List of number-one singles in the United States\n* List of Grammy Award winners and nominees\n\n## References\n\n## Bibliography\n\n* Shaw, Greg (2000).

{"title": "Jennifer_Love_Hewitt", "content": "\nEarly life\nHewitt was born in Waco, Texas [3] to Patricia Mae (née Shipp), a speech-language pathologist, and Herbert Daniel Hewitt, a medical technician She grew up in Nolanville in Central Texas, [4] and has close kinship ties in parts of Arkansas [5] After their parents divorced, Hewitt and her older brother Todd were raised by their mother [6]\n\n\nActing career\nHewitt moved to Los Angeles, at age ten, with her mother, to pursue a career in both acting and singing, at the suggestion of talent scouts, and after winning the title of \"Texas Our Little Miss Talent Winner\" [6] She attended Lincoln High School [16] where her classmates included Jonathan Neville, who became a talent scout and recommended Hewitt for her role in Party of Five [8]\n\n\n1989–1994: Early acting credits\nHewitt moved to Los Angeles, at age ten, with her mother, to pursue a career in both acting and singing, at the suggestion of talent scouts, and after winning the title of \"Texas Our Little Miss Talent Winner\" [6] She attended Lincoln High School [16] where her classmates included Jonathan Neville, who became a talent scout and recommended Hewitt for her role in Party of Five [8]\n\n\n1995–1999: Rise to stardom\nHewitt rose to teen idol status after landing the role of Sarah Reeves Merrin on the popular Fox show Party of Five (1995–99) [26] Originally cast for a nine-episode arc in season two, reception from producers and audiences was so positive that she became a series regular, continuing to play the character until the show's sixth and final season [27] Co-creator Amy Lippman once stated: \"She was a crazy professional You didn't have to ask yourself, ‘I don't know if she'll be able to work up a head of steam here, I don't know if she'll be able to cry.' She wasn't running to her trailer  [between takes] to smoke cigarettes or play with a toy poodle She was reading material and trying to plot her career\" [28] For her performance, Hewitt garnered nominations for a Kids' Choice Award, a Teen Choice Award and a YoungStar Award [citation needed]\n\n\n2000–2004: Steady film work\nIn The Audrey Hepburn Story (2000), a biographical drama television film based on the life of actress and humanitarian Audrey Hepburn, Hewitt starred as the title role and served as an executive producer [41] She had been recommended for the role by director Steven Robman, who had previously directed her in Party of Five [42] The production aired as a three-hour film on ABC on March 27, 2000, and drew mixed reviews Entertainment Weekly wrote that Hewitt had \"guts\" to take on the role and called her \"excellent at conveying Hepburn's studied modesty\", [43] while The Baltimore Sun review stated: \"What's impossibly wrong with this film is that Hewitt has no physical grace while Hepburn was the very embodiment of it\" [44]\n\n\n2005–2010: Return to television\nHewitt portrayed Melinda Gordon, a woman with the ability to see and communicate with ghosts, on the CBS television series Ghost Whisperer, which ran on CBS for five seasons and 107 episodes, from September 23, 2005, to May 21, 2010 [55] [56] She also served as a producer and directed three episodes, including the 100th episode In his review for the first season, David Bianculli, of New York Daily News, wrote: \"If  [television] really wants a success built around this actress, someone in Hollywood should pay attention to her chameleonic and comedic role in Heartbreakers, and give her a role that plays to those strengths, instead of something this translucent\" [57] Nevertheless, the series emerged as a ratings success and earned Hewitt two Saturn Awards for Best Television Actress [58] In 2005, she played a happily married English woman in the romantic comedy The Truth About Love, and a 28-year-old advertising executive more concerned with being a well-known socialite than being a good person in the television film Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber.\n\n\n2011–present: Continued television roles\nHewitt starred as a journalist, opposite Betty White, in the Hallmark Hall of Fame film The Lost Valentine (2011) [69] While reviewers unanimously praised White's performance, Variety wrote: \"The same can hardly be said of Hewitt, who —in her current TV movie phase— was put to better use as a mom turned hooker in Lifetime's The Client List [70] With 14.53 million viewers, the film won its time period and represented the most-watched Hallmark movie in four years [71]\n\n\nOther endeavors\nHewitt was one of the backing vocalists on Martika's number-one single, \"Toy Soldiers\" (1989) At age 12, Meldac funded the recording of Hewitt's debut studio album, Love Songs (1992) [77] The album was released exclusively in Japan, where Hewitt became a pop star [78] Her explanation for her success in Japan is that the Japanese \"love perky music The poppier the music, the better.\" [79] She was subsequently signed to

She grew up in Nolanville in Central Texas, with close kinship ties in parts of Arkansas. After their parents divorced, Hewitt and her older brother Todd were raised by their mother.

three episodes, including the 100th episode In his review for the first season, David Bianculli, of New York Daily News, wrote: \"If  [television] really wants a success built around this actress,

Nevertheless, the series emerged as a ratings success and earned Hewitt two Saturn Awards for Best Television Actress [58] In 2005, she played a happily married English woman in the romantic comedy

much so that Michael Dummett has remarked that analytic philosophy is better characterized as Anglo-Austrian rather than the usual Anglo-American [28]\n\n\nAustrian realism\nAnalytic philosophy was deeply influenced by what is called Austrian realism in the former state of Austria-Hungary, so much so that Michael Dummett has remarked that analytic philosophy is better characterized as Anglo-Austrian rather than the usual Anglo-American [28]\n\n\nBrentano\nUniversity of Vienna philosopher and psychologist Franz Brentano—in Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874) and through the subsequent influence of the School of Brentano and its members, such as Edmund Husserl and Alexius Meinong—gave to analytic philosophy the problem of intentionality or of aboutness [29] For Brentano, all mental events have a real, non-mental intentional object, which the thinking is directed at or \"about\".\n\n\nMeinong\nMeinong is known for his unique ontology of real nonexistent objects as a solution to the problem of empty names [30] The Graz School followed Meinong.\n\n\nLwów–Warsaw\nThe Polish Lwów–Warsaw school, founded by Kazimierz Twardowski in 1895, grew as an offshoot of the Graz School It was closely associated with the Warsaw School of Mathematics.\n\n\nFrege\nGottlob Frege (1848–1925) was a German geometry professor at the University of Jena who is understood as the father of analytic philosophy Frege proved influential as a philosopher of mathematics in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century He advocated logicism, the project of reducing arithmetic to pure logic.\n\n\nLogic\nAs a result of his logicist project, Frege developed predicate logic in his book Begriffsschrift (English: Concept-script, 1879), which allowed for a much greater range of sentences to be parsed into logical form than was possible using the ancient Aristotelian logic [q] An example of this is the problem of multiple generality.\n\n\nNumber\nNeo-Kantianism dominated the late 19th century in German philosophy Edmund Husserl's 1891 book Philosophie der Arithmetik argued that the concept of the cardinal number derived from psychical acts of grouping objects and counting them [32]\n\n\nLanguage\nFrege also proved influential in the philosophy of language and analytic philosophy's interest in meaning [33] Michael Dummett traces the linguistic turn to Frege's Foundations of Arithmetic and his context principle [34]\n\n\nRussell\nBritish philosophy in the 19th century had seen a revival of logic started by Richard Whately, in reaction to the anti-logical tradition of British empiricism The major figure of this period is English mathematician George Boole Other figures include William Hamilton, Augustus de Morgan, William Stanley Jevons, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland author Lewis Carroll, [r] Hugh MacColl, and American pragmatist Charles Sanders Peirce [35]\n\n\nParadox\nBertrand Russell, during his early career, was much influenced by Frege Russell famously discovered the paradox in Basic Law V which undermined Frege's logicist project However, like Frege, Russell argued that mathematics is reducible to logical fundamentals, in The Principles of Mathematics (1903) He also argued for Meinongianism [39]\n\n\nOn Denoting\nRussell sought to resolve various philosophical problems by applying Frege's new logical apparatus, most famously in his theory of definite descriptions in \"On Denoting\", published in Mind in 1905 [40] Russell here argues against Meinongianism He argues all names (aside from demonstratives like \"this\" or \"that\") are disguised definite descriptions, using this to solve ascriptions of nonexistence This position came to be called descriptivism.\n\n\nPrincipia Mathematica\nLater, his book written with Alfred North Whitehead, Principia Mathematica (1910–1913), the seminal text of classical logic and of the logicist project, encouraged many philosophers to renew their interest in the development of symbolic logic It used a notation from Italian logician Giuseppe Peano, and it uses a theory of types to avoid the pitfalls of Russell's paradox Whitehead developed process metaphysics in Process and Reality [41]\n\n\nIdeal language\nAdditionally, Russell adopted Frege's predicate logic as his primary philosophical method, a method Russell thought could expose the underlying structure of philosophical problems Logical form would be made clear by syntax For example, the English word \"is\" has three distinct meanings, which predicate logic can express as follows:\n\n\nLogical atomism\nAn important aspect of Hegelianism and British idealism was logical holism—the opinion that there are aspects of the world that can be known only by knowing the whole world This is closely related to the doctrine of internal relations, the opinion that relations between items are internal relations, that is, essential properties of the nature of those items.\n\n\nEarly Wittgenstein\nWittgenstein developed a comprehensive system of logical atomism with a picture theory of meaning in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (German: Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung, 1921) sometimes known as simply the Tractatus He claimed the universe is the totality of actual states of affairs and that these states of affairs can be expressed and mirrored by the language of first-order predicate logic Thus a picture of the universe can be constructed by expressing facts in the form of atomic propositions and linking them using logical operators.\n\n\nLogical positivism\nDuring the late 1920s to 1940s, a group of philosophers known as the Vienna Circle, and another one known as the Berlin Circle, developed Russell and Wittgenstein's philosophy into a doctrine known as \"logical positivism\" (or logical empiricism)  The Vienna Circle was led by Moritz Schlick and included Rudolf Carnap and Otto Neurath [44] The Berlin Circle was led by Hans Reichenbach and included Carl Hempel and mathematician David Hilbert.\n\n\nOrdinary language\nAfter World War II, from the late 1940s to the 1950s, analytic philosophy became involved with ordinary-language analysis This resulted in two main trends.\n\n\nLater Wittgenstein\nOne strain of language analysis continued Wittgenstein's later philosophy, from the Philosophical Investigations (1953), which differed dramatically from his early work of the Tractatus [v] The criticisms of Frank P Ramsey on color and logical form in the Tractatus led to some of Wittgenstein's first doubts with regard to his early philosophy Philosophers refer to them like two different philosophers: \"early Wittgenstein\" and \"later Wittgenstein\" In his later philosophy, Wittgenstein develops the concept of a \"language-game\" and, rather than his prior picture theory of meaning, advocates a theory of meaning as use It also contains the private language argument and the notion of family resemblance.\n\n\nOxford philosophy\nThe other trend was known as \"Oxford philosophy\", in contrast to earlier analytic Cambridge philosophers (including the early Wittgenstein) who thought philosophers should avoid the deceptive trappings of natural language by constructing ideal languages Influenced by Moore's Common Sense and what they perceived as the later Wittgenstein's quietism, the Oxford philosophers claimed that ordinary language already represents many subtle distinctions not recognized in the formulation of traditional philosophical theories or problems.\n\n\nSpread of Analytic philosophy\nThe school known as Australian realism began when John Anderson accepted the Challis Chair of Philosophy at the University of Sydney in 1927 His elder brother was William Anderson, Professor of Philosophy at Auckland University College from 1921 to his death in 1955, who was described as \"the most dominant figure in New Zealand philosophy.\" [49] J N Findlay was a student of Ernst Mally of the Austrian realists and taught at the University of Otago.\n\n\nAustralia and New Zealand\nThe school known as Australian realism began when John Anderson accepted the

Finnish Georg Henrik von Wright succeeded Wittgenstein at Cambridge in 1948 [50]\n\n\nContemporary analytic philosophy\nOne striking difference with respect to early analytic philosophy was the revival of metaphysical theorizing during the second half of the 20th century, and metaphysics remains a fertile topic of research Although many discussions are continuations of old ones from previous decades and centuries, the debates remains active [51]\n\n\nMetaphysics\nOne striking difference with respect to early analytic philosophy was the revival of metaphysical theorizing during the second half of the 20th century, and metaphysics remains a fertile topic of research Although many discussions are continuations of old ones from previous decades and centuries, the debates remains active [51]\n\n\nDecline of logical positivism\nThe rise of metaphysics mirrored the decline of logical positivism, first challenged by the later Wittgenstein.\n\n\nSellars\nWilfred Sellars's criticism of the \"Myth of the Given\", in Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind (1956), challenged logical positivism by arguing against sense-data theories In his \"Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man\" (1962), Sellars distinguishes between the \"manifest image\" and the \"scientific image\" of the world Sellars's goal of a synoptic philosophy that unites the everyday and scientific views of reality is the foundation and archetype of what is sometimes called the Pittsburgh School, whose members include Robert Brandom, John McDowell, and John Haugeland.\n\n\nQuine\nAlso among the developments that resulted in the decline of logical positivism and the revival of metaphysical theorizing was Harvard philosopher W V O Quine's attack on the analytic–synthetic distinction in \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\", published in 1951 in The Philosophical Review and republished in Quine's book From A Logical Point of View (1953), a paper \"sometimes regarded as the most important in all of twentieth-century philosophy\" [52] [53] [54]\n\n\nKripke\nImportant also for the revival of metaphysics was the further development of modal logic, first introduced by pragmatist C I Lewis, especially the work of Saul Kripke and his Naming and Necessity (1980) [w]\n\n\nDavid Lewis\nAmerican philosopher David Lewis defended a number of elaborate metaphysical theories In works such as On the Plurality of Worlds (1986) and Counterfactuals (1973) he argued for modal realism and counterpart theory – the belief in real, concrete possible worlds According to Lewis, \"actual\" is merely an indexical label we give a world when we are in it Lewis also defended what he called Humean supervenience, a counterfactual theory of causation, [58] and contributed to abstract object theory [59] He became closely associated with Australia, whose philosophical community he visited almost annually for more than 30 years.\n\n\nUniversals\nIn response to the problem of universals, Australian David Malet Armstrong defended a kind of moderate realism [60] [61] Quine and Lewis defended nominalism [59]\n\n\nMereology\nPolish philosopher Stanisław Leśniewski coined the term mereology, which is the formal study of parts and wholes, a subject that arguably goes back to the time of the pre-Socratics [62] David Lewis believed in perdurantism and introduced the term 'gunk' Peter Van Inwagen believes in mereological nihilism, except for living beings, a view called organicism.\n\n\nFree will and determinism\nPeter van Inwagen's 1983 monograph An Essay on Free Will [63] played an important role in rehabilitating libertarianism with respect to free will, in mainstream analytical philosophy [64] In the book, he introduces the consequence argument and the term incompatibilism about free will and determinism, to stand in contrast to compatibilism—the view that free will is compatible with determinism Charlie Broad had previously made similar arguments.\n\n\nPersonal identity\nSince John Locke, philosophers have been concerned with the problem of personal identity Derek Parfit in Reasons and Persons (1984) defends a kind of bundle theory, while David Lewis again defends perdurantism Bernard Williams in The Self and the Future (1970) argues that personal identity is bodily identity rather than mental continuity [65]\n\n\nPrinciple of sufficient reason\nSince Leibniz philosophers have discussed the principle of sufficient reason or PSR Van Inwagen criticizes the PSR [63] Alexander Pruss defends it [66]\n\n\nPhilosophy of time\nAnalytic philosophy of time traces its roots to the British idealist J M E McTaggart's article \"The Unreality of Time\"  (1908) In it, McTaggart distinguishes between the dynamic, A-, or tensed, theory of time (past, present, future), in which time flows; and the static or tenseless B-theory of time (earlier than, simultaneous with, later than) Eternalism holds that past, present, and future are equally real In contrast, Presentism holds that only entities in the present exist [67]\n\n\nLogical pluralism\nMany-valued and non-classical logics have been popular since the Polish logician Jan Lukasiewicz Graham Priest is a dialetheist, seeing it as the most natural solution to problems such as the liar paradox JC Beall, together with Greg Restall, is a pioneer of a widely-discussed version of logical pluralism [69]\n\n\nEpistemology\nOwing largely to Edmund Gettier's 1963 paper \"Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\", [70] and the so-called Gettier problem, epistemology has enjoyed a resurgence as a topic of analytic philosophy during the last 50 years A large portion of current epistemological research is intended to resolve the problems that Gettier's examples presented to the traditional \"justified true belief\" model of knowledge, found as early as Plato's dialogue Theaetetus These include developing theories of justification to deal with Gettier's examples, or giving alternatives to the justified-true-belief model.\n\n\nJustification\nOwing largely to Edmund Gettier's 1963 paper \"Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\", [70] and the so-called Gettier problem, epistemology has enjoyed a resurgence as a topic of analytic philosophy during the last 50 years A large portion of current epistemological research is intended to resolve the problems that Gettier's examples presented to the traditional \"justified true belief\" model of knowledge, found as early as Plato's dialogue Theaetetus These include developing theories of justification to deal with Gettier's examples, or giving alternatives to the justified-true-belief model.\n\n\nGettier\nOwing largely to Edmund Gettier's 1963 paper \"Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\", [70] and the so-called Gettier problem, epistemology has enjoyed

traditional \"justified true belief\" model of knowledge, found as early as Plato's dialogue Theaetetus These include developing theories of justification to deal with Gettier's examples, or giving alternatives to the justified-true-belief model.\n\n\nTheories\nChisholm defended foundationalism Quine defended coherentism, a \"web of belief\" [71] Quine proposed naturalized epistemology.\n\n\nInternalism and externalism\nThe debate between internalism and externalism still exists in analytic philosophy [72] Alvin Goldman is an externalist known for developing a popular form of externalism called reliabilism Most externalists reject the KK thesis, which has been disputed since the introduction of the epistemic logic by Jaakko Hintikka in 1962 [73]\n\n\nProblem of the Criterion\nWhile a problem since antiquity, American philosopher Roderick Chisholm, in his Theory of Knowledge, details the problem of the criterion with two sets of questions:\n\n\nTruth\nFrege questioned standard theories of truth, and sometimes advocated a redundancy theory of truth Frank Ramsey also advocated a redundancy theory  Alfred Tarski put forward a semantic theory of truth [74] [75]\n\n\nClosure\nEpistemic closure is the claim that knowledge is closed under entailment; in other words epistemic closure is a property or the principle that if a subject \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n knows \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n, and \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n knows that \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n entails \n\n\n\nq\n\n\n{\\displaystyle q}\n\n, then \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n can thereby come to know \n\n\n\nq\n\n\n{\\displaystyle q}\n\n [77] Most epistemological theories involve a closure principle, and many skeptical arguments assume a closure principle In Proof of An External World, G E Moore uses closure in his famous anti-skeptical \"here is one hand\" argument Shortly before his death, Wittgenstein wrote On Certainty in response to Moore.\n\n\nInduction\nIn his book Fact, Fiction, and Forecast, Nelson Goodman introduced the \"new riddle of induction\", so-called by analogy with Hume's classical problem of induction  Goodman's famous example was to introduce the predicates grue and bleen \"Grue\" applies to all things before a certain time t, just in case they are green, but also just in case they are blue after time t; and \"bleen\" applies to all things before a certain time t, just in the case they are blue, but also just in case they are green after time t.\n\n\nOther topics\nOther, related topics of contemporary research include debates over basic knowledge, the nature of evidence, the value of knowledge, epistemic luck, virtue epistemology, the role of intuitions in justification, and treating knowledge as a primitive concept.\n\n\nEthics\nDue to the commitments to empiricism and symbolic logic in the early analytic period, early analytic philosophers often thought that inquiry in the ethical domain could not be made rigorous enough to merit any attention [79] It was only with the emergence of ordinary-language philosophers that ethics started to become an acceptable area of inquiry for analytic philosophers [79] Philosophers working within the analytic tradition have gradually come to distinguish three major types of moral philosophy.\n\n\nMeta-ethics\nAs well as Hume's famous is/ought distinction, twentieth-century meta-ethics has two original strains.\n\n\nPrincipia Ethica\nThe first is G E Moore's investigation into the nature of ethical terms (e.g., good) in his Principia Ethica (1903), which  advances a kind of moral realism called ethical non-naturalism and is known for the open question argument and identifying the naturalistic fallacy, a major topic of investigation for analytical philosophers According to Moore, \"Goodness is a simple, undefinable, non-natural property.\"\n\n\nEmotivism\nThe second is founded on logical positivism and its attitude that unverifiable statements are meaningless As a result, they avoided normative ethics and instead began meta-ethical investigations into the nature of moral terms, statements, and judgments.\n\n\nCritics\nStructuralist Paul Benacerraf has an epistemological objection to mathematical platonism.\n\n\nNormative ethics\nThe first half of the 20th century was marked by skepticism toward, and neglect of, normative ethics However, contemporary normative ethics is dominated by three schools: consequentialism, virtue ethics, and deontology [y]\n\n\nConsequentialism, or Utilitarianism\nDuring the early 20th century, utilitarianism was the only non-skeptical type of ethics to remain popular among analytic philosophers However, as the influence of logical positivism declined mid-century, analytic philosophers had a renewed interest in ethics Utilitarianism: For and Against was written with J J C Smart arguing for and Bernard Williams arguing against.\n\n\nVirtue ethics\nAnscombe, Foot, and Alasdair Macintyre's After Virtue sparked a revival of Aristotle's virtue ethical approach This increased interest in virtue ethics has been dubbed the \"aretaic turn\" mimicking the linguistic turn.\n\n\nDeontology\nJohn Rawls's 1971 A Theory of Justice restored interest in Kantian ethical philosophy.\n\n\nApplied ethics\nSince around 1970, a significant feature of analytic philosophy has been the emergence of applied ethics—an interest in the application of moral principles to specific practical issues The philosophers following this orientation view ethics as involving humanistic values, which involve practical implications and applications in the way people interact and lead their lives socially [84]\n\n\nPolitical philosophy\nIsaiah Berlin had a lasting influence on both analytic political philosophy and liberalism with his lecture \"Two Concepts of Liberty\" [citation needed] Berlin defined 'negative liberty' as absence of coercion or interference in private actions 'Positive liberty' Berlin maintained, could be thought of as self-mastery, which asks not what we are free from, but what we are free to do.\n\n\nLiberalism\nIsaiah Berlin had a lasting influence on both analytic political philosophy and liberalism with his lecture \"Two Concepts of Liberty\" [citation needed] Berlin defined 'negative liberty' as absence of coercion or interference in private actions 'Positive liberty' Berlin maintained, could be thought of as self-mastery, which asks not what we are free from, but what we are free to do.\n\n\nAnalytical Marxism\nAnother development of political philosophy was the emergence of the school of analytical Marxism Members of this school seek to apply techniques of analytic philosophy and modern social science to clarify the theories of Karl Marx and his successors The best-known member of this school is G A Cohen, whose 1978 book, Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence, is generally considered to represent the genesis of this school In that book, Cohen used logical and linguistic analysis to clarify and defend Marx's materialist conception of history Other prominent analytical Marxists include the economist John Roemer, the social scientist Jon Elster, and the sociologist Erik Olin Wright The work of these later philosophers has furthered Cohen's work by bringing to bear modern social science methods, such as rational choice theory, to supplement Cohen's use of analytic philosophical techniques in the interpretation of Marxian theory.\n\n\nCommunitarianism\nCommunitarians such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor, Michael Walzer, and Michael Sandel advance a critique of liberalism that uses analytic techniques to isolate the main assumptions of liberal individualists, such as Rawls, and then challenges these assumptions In particular, communitarians challenge the liberal assumption that the individual can be considered as fully autonomous from the community in which he is brought up and lives Instead, they argue for a conception of the individual that emphasizes the role that the community plays in forming his or her values, thought processes, and opinions While in the analytic tradition, its major exponents often also engage at length with figures generally considered continental, notably G W F Hegel and Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\n\nAesthetics\nAs a result of logical positivism, as well as what seemed like rejections of the traditional aesthetic notions of beauty and sublimity from post-modern thinkers, analytic philosophers were slow to consider art and aesthetic judgment Susanne Langer [89] and Nelson Goodman [90] addressed these problems in an analytic style during the 1950s and 1960s Since Goodman, aesthetics as a discipline for analytic philosophers has flourished [91]\n\n\nPhilosophy of language\nGiven the linguistic turn, it can be hard to separate logic, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language in analytic philosophy Philosophy of language is a topic that has decreased in activity during the last four decades, as evidenced by the fact that few major philosophers today treat it as a primary research topic While the debate remains fierce, it is still strongly influenced by those authors from the first half of the century, e.g Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Austin, Tarski, and Quine.\n\n\nSemantics\nSaul Kripke provided a semantics for modal logic In his book Naming and Necessity (1980), Kripke challenges the descriptivist theory with a causal theory of reference In it he introduced the term rigid designator According to one author, \"In the philosophy of language, Naming and Necessity is among the most important works ever.\" [55] Ruth Barcan Marcus also challenged descriptivism So did Keith Donnellan [97]\n\n\nPragmatics\nPaul Grice and his maxims and theory of implicature established the discipline of pragmatics.\n\n\nPhilosophy of mind and cognitive science\nJohn Searle suggests that the obsession with the philosophy of language during the 20th century has been superseded by an emphasis on the philosophy of mind [98]\n\n\nPhysicalism\nMotivated by the logical positivists' interest in verificationism, logical behaviorism was the most prominent theory of mind of analytic philosophy for the first half of the 20th century [99] Behaviorism later became much less popular, in favor of either type physicalism or functionalism During this period, topics of the philosophy of mind were often related strongly to topics of cognitive science, such as modularity or innateness.\n\n\nBehaviorism\nBehaviorists such as B F Skinner tended to opine either that statements about the mind were equivalent to statements about behavior and dispositions to behave in particular ways or that mental states were directly equivalent to behavior and dispositions to behave.\n\n\nType Identity\nType physicalism or type identity theory identified mental states with brain states Former students of Ryle at the University of Adelaide J J C Smart and Ullin Place argued for type physicalism.\n\n\nFunctionalism\nFunctionalism remains the dominant theory Type identity was criticized using multiple realizability.\n\n\nEliminativism\nThe view of eliminative materialism is most closely associated with Paul and Patricia Churchland, who deny the existence of propositional attitudes, and with Daniel Dennett, who is generally considered an eliminativist about qualia and phenomenal aspects of consciousness.\n\n\nDualism\nFinally, analytic philosophy has featured a certain number of philosophers who were dualists, and recently forms of property dualism have had a resurgence; the most prominent representative is David Chalmers [101] Kripke also makes a notable argument for dualism [102]\n\n\nTheories of consciousness\nIn recent years, a central focus of research in the philosophy of mind has been consciousness and the philosophy of perception While there is a general consensus for the global neuronal workspace model of consciousness, [103] there are many opinions as to the specifics The best known theories are Searle's naive realism, Fred Dretske and Michael Tye's representationalism,  Daniel Dennett's heterophenomenology, and the higher-order theories of either David M Rosenthal—who advocates a higher-order thought (HOT) model—or David Armstrong and William Lycan—who advocate a higher-order perception (HOP) model An alternative higher-order theory, the higher-order global states (HOGS) model, is offered by Robert van Gulick [104]\n\n\nPhilosophy of mathematics\nSince the beginning, analytic philosophy has had an interest in the philosophy of mathematics Kurt Gödel, a student of Hans Hahn of the Vienna Circle, produced his incompleteness theorems showing that Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica also failed to reduce arithmetic to logic Gödel has been ranked as one  of the four greatest logicians of all time, along with Aristotle, Frege, and Tarski [105] Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel established Zermelo Fraenkel Set Theory Quine developed his own system, dubbed New Foundations.\n\n\nPlatonism\nGödel was a platonist who postulated a special kind of mathematical intuition that lets us perceive mathematical objects directly Quine and Putnam argued for platonism with the indispensability argument Crispin Wright, along with Bob Hale, led a Neo-Fregean revival with his work Frege's Conception of Numbers as Objects [109]\n\n\nCritics\nStructuralist Paul Benacerraf has an epistemological objection to mathematical platonism.\n\n\nIntuitionism\nThe intuitionists, led by L E J Brouwer, are a constructivist school of mathematics that argues that mathematics is a cognitive construct rather than a type of objective truth.\n\n\nFormalism\nThe formalists, best exemplified by David Hilbert, considered mathematics to be merely the investigation of formal axiom systems Hartry Field defended mathematical fictionalism.\n\n\nPhilosophy of religion\nIn Analytic Philosophy of Religion, James Franklin Harris noted that:\n\n\nReformed epistemology\nAnalytic philosophy formed the basis for some sophisticated Christian arguments, such as those of the reformed epistemologists such as Alvin Plantinga, William Alston, and Nicholas Wolterstorff.\n\n\nAnalytic Thomism\nCatholic philosophers in the analytic tradition—such as Elizabeth Anscombe, Peter Geach, Anthony Kenny, Alasdair MacIntyre, John Haldane, Eleonore Stump, and others—developed an analytic approach to Thomism.\n\n\nOrthodox\nRichard Swinburne wrote a trilogy of books, arguing for God, consisting of The Coherence of Theism, The Existence of God, and Faith and Reason.\n\n\nWittgenstein and religion\nThe analytic philosophy of religion has been preoccupied with Wittgenstein, as well as his interpretation of Søren Kierkegaard's philosophy of religion [115] Wittgenstein fought for the Austrian army in the First World War and came upon a copy of Leo Tolstoy's Gospel in Brief At that time, he underwent some kind of religious conversion [116]\n\n\nPhilosophy of science\nScience and the philosophy of science have also had increasingly significant roles in analytic metaphysics The theory of special relativity has had a profound effect on the philosophy of time, and quantum physics is routinely discussed in the free will debate [51] The weight given to scientific evidence is largely due to commitments of philosophers to scientific realism and naturalism Others will see a commitment to using science in philosophy as scientism.\n\n\nConfirmation theory\nCarl Hempel advocated confirmation theory or Bayesian epistemology He introduced the famous raven's paradox [120]\n\n\nFalsification\nIn reaction to what he considered excesses of logical positivism, Karl Popper, in The Logic of Scientific Discovery, insisted on the role of falsification in the philosophy of science, using it to solve the demarcation problem [121]\n\n\nConfirmation holism\nThe Duhem–Quine thesis, or problem of underdetermination, posits that no scientific hypothesis can be understood in isolation, a viewpoint called confirmation holism [52]\n\n\nConstructivism\nIn reaction to both the logical positivists and Popper, discussions of the philosophy of science during the last 40 years were dominated by social constructivist and cognitive relativist theories of science Following Quine and Duhem, subsequent theories emphasized theory-ladenness Thomas Samuel Kuhn, with his formulation of paradigm shifts, and Paul Feyerabend, with his epistemological anarchism, are significant for these discussions [122]\n\n\nBiology\nThe philosophy of biology has also undergone considerable growth, particularly due to the considerable debate in recent years over the nature of evolution, particularly natural selection [123] Daniel Dennett and his 1995 book Darwin's Dangerous Idea, which defends Neo-Darwinism, stand at the forefront of this debate [124] Jerry Fodor criticizes natural selection.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBooks and articles\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Analytic Philosophy\n\nAnalytic philosophy is a branch of philosophy that has its roots in the 19th and 20th centuries in Europe and North America. It is characterized by a focus on logical analysis, linguistic precision, and the use of empirical evidence to support philosophical claims. Analytic philosophers often employ formal methods, such as logical and mathematical tools, to investigate philosophical problems.\n\nHistory of Analytic Philosophy\n\nThe history of analytic philosophy is closely tied to the development of logic and mathematics in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the late 19th century, philosophers such as Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege began to develop formal systems of logic and to apply these systems to philosophical problems. This led to the development of analytic philosophy as a distinct branch of philosophy.\n\nAustrian Realism\n\nAustrian realism was a philosophical movement that emerged in the late 19th century in Austria. It was characterized by a focus on the study of the relationship between language and reality. Austrian realists such as Franz Brentano and Alexius Meinong developed a philosophy of intentionality, which holds that all mental events have a real, non-mental intentional object.\n\nBrentano\n\nFranz Brentano was a philosopher and psychologist who is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy. His book \"Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint\" (1874) laid the foundation for the development of analytic philosophy. Brentano's philosophy of intentionality holds that all mental events have a real, non-mental intentional object.\n\nMeinong\n\nAlexius Meinong was a philosopher who developed a unique ontology of real nonexistent objects. His philosophy of objects holds that objects can exist even if they do not exist in reality. Meinong's philosophy was influential in the development of analytic philosophy.\n\nLwów-Warsaw\n\nThe Lwów-Warsaw school was a philosophical movement that emerged in Poland in the late 19th century. It was characterized by a focus on the study of the nature of language and reality. The Lwów-Warsaw school was influenced by the Austrian realists and developed a philosophy of language that emphasized the importance of linguistic analysis.\n\nFrege\n\nGottlob Frege was a German philosopher and mathematician who is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy. His book \"Begriffsschrift\" (1879) laid the foundation for the development of modern logic. Frege's philosophy of mathematics holds that mathematics can be reduced to pure logic.\n\nLogic\n\nFrege's development of predicate logic had a significant impact on the development of analytic philosophy. His work on logic led to the development of modern logic and paved the way for the development of analytic philosophy.\n\nNumber\n\nThe concept of number was a major area of study in the development of analytic philosophy. Philosophers such as Frege and Russell developed theories of number that emphasized the importance of logical analysis.\n\nLanguage\n\nThe philosophy of language was a major area of study in the development of analytic philosophy. Philosophers such as Frege and Wittgenstein developed theories of language that emphasized the importance of linguistic analysis.\n\nRussell\n\nBertrand Russell was a philosopher who was heavily influenced by Frege's philosophy of mathematics. He developed a philosophy of mathematics that held that mathematics can be reduced to pure logic. Russell's philosophy of mathematics was influential in the development of analytic philosophy.\n\nParadox\n\nRussell discovered the paradox in Basic Law V, which undermined Frege's logicist project. However, like Frege, Russell argued that mathematics is reducible to logical fundamentals.\n\nOn Denoting\n\nRussell's theory of definite descriptions in \"On Denoting\" (1905) was a major contribution to the development of analytic philosophy. He argued that all names (aside from demonstratives like \"this\" or \"that\") are disguised definite descriptions.\n\nPrincipia Mathematica\n\nRussell's book \"Principia Mathematica\" (1910-1913) was a seminal text of classical logic and the logicist project. It used a notation from Giuseppe Peano and developed a theory of types to avoid the pitfalls of Russell's paradox.\n\nIdeal Language\n\nRussell adopted Frege's predicate logic as his primary philosophical method. He thought that this method could expose the underlying structure of philosophical problems.\n\nLogical Atomism\n\nThe concept of logical atomism was an important aspect of Hegelianism and British idealism. It held that there are aspects of the world that can be known only by knowing the whole world.\n\nEarly Wittgenstein\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein developed a comprehensive system of logical atomism with a picture theory of meaning in his \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" (1921). He claimed that the universe is the totality of actual states of affairs and that these states of affairs can be expressed and mirrored by the language of first-order predicate logic.\n\nLogical Positivism\n\nThe Vienna Circle and the Berlin Circle developed Russell and Wittgenstein's philosophy into a doctrine known as \"logical positivism\" or \"logical empiricism\". They argued that unverifiable statements are meaningless and that only statements that can be verified by experience are meaningful.\n\nOrdinary Language\n\nAfter World War II, analytic philosophy became involved with ordinary-language analysis. This resulted in two main trends: one continued Wittgenstein's later philosophy, and the other was known as \"Oxford philosophy\".\n\nOxford Philosophy\n\nOxford philosophy was characterized by a focus on the use of ordinary language to solve philosophical problems. It was influenced by the later Wittgenstein and the work of philosophers such as G.E. Moore and J.L. Austin.\n\nAustralian Realism\n\nThe school of Australian realism began when John Anderson accepted the Challis Chair of Philosophy at the University of Sydney in 1927. It was characterized by a focus on the study of the relationship between language and reality.\n\nFinnish Analytic Philosophy\n\nThe Finnish philosopher Georg Henrik von Wright succeeded Wittgenstein at Cambridge in 1948. He developed a comprehensive system of philosophy that was influenced by the later Wittgenstein.\n\nContemporary Analytic Philosophy\n\nOne striking difference with respect to early analytic philosophy was the revival of metaphysical theorizing during the second half of the 20th century. Metaphysics remains a fertile topic of research in analytic philosophy.\n\nDecline of Logical Positivism\n\nThe rise of metaphysics mirrored the decline of logical positivism, which was challenged by the later Wittgenstein.\n\nSellars\n\nWilfred Sellars's criticism of the \"Myth of the Given\" challenged logical positivism by arguing against sense-data theories. He also developed a theory of the \"manifest image\" and the \"scientific image\" of the world.\n\nQuine\n\nHarvard philosopher W.V.O. Quine's attack on the analytic-synthetic distinction in \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\" (1951) challenged logical positivism and the revival of metaphysical theorizing.\n\nKripke\n\nThe development of modal logic, first introduced by C.I. Lewis, was further developed by Saul Kripke in his book \"Naming and Necessity\" (1980). He challenged the descriptivist theory with a causal theory of reference.\n\nDavid Lewis\n\nDavid Lewis defended a number of elaborate metaphysical theories, including modal realism and counterpart theory.\n\nUniversals\n\nIn response to the problem of universals, Australian philosopher David Malet Armstrong defended a kind of moderate realism. Quine and Lewis defended nominalism.\n\nMereology\n\nPolish philosopher Stanisław Leśniewski coined the term \"mereology\", which is the formal study of parts and wholes.\n\nFree Will and Determinism\n\nPeter van Inwagen's monograph \"An Essay on Free Will\" (1983) played an important role in rehabilitating libertarianism with respect to free will.\n\nPersonal Identity\n\nDerek Parfit in \"Reasons and Persons\" (1984) defends a kind of bundle theory. David Lewis again defends perdurantism.\n\nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason\n\nThe principle of sufficient reason or PSR has been discussed in analytic philosophy since Leibniz. Van Inwagen criticizes the PSR. Alexander Pruss defends it.\n\nPhilosophy of Time\n\nAnalytic philosophy of time traces its roots to the British idealist J.M.E. McTaggart's article \"The Unreality of Time\" (1908). McTaggart distinguished between the dynamic, A-, or tensed, theory of time and the static or tenseless B-theory of time.\n\nLogic\n\nMany-valued and non-classical logics have been popular in analytic philosophy since the Polish logician Jan Lukasiewicz. Graham Priest is a dialetheist. JC Beall and Greg Restall are pioneers of logical pluralism.\n\nEpistemology\n\nEpistemology has enjoyed a resurgence in analytic philosophy since Edmund Gettier's paper \"Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\" (1963). The Gettier problem has led to the development of theories of justification to deal with Gettier's examples or give alternatives to the justified-true-belief model.\n\nTheories\n\nChisholm defended foundationalism. Quine defended coherentism, a \"web of belief\". Quine proposed naturalized epistemology.\n\nInternalism and Externalism\n\nThe debate between internalism and externalism still exists in analytic philosophy. Alvin Goldman is an externalist known for developing a popular form of externalism called reliabilism.\n\nProblem of the Criterion\n\nThe problem of the criterion is a problem in epistemology that has been discussed since antiquity. American philosopher Roderick Chisholm detailed the problem of the criterion in his book \"Theory of Knowledge\".\n\nTruth\n\nFrege questioned standard theories of truth, and sometimes advocated a redundancy theory of truth. Frank Ramsey also advocated a redundancy theory. Alfred Tarski put forward a semantic theory of truth.\n\nClosure\n\nEpistemic closure is the claim that knowledge is closed under entailment. Most epistemological theories involve a closure principle. The Gettier problem is often seen as a challenge to closure.\n\nInduction\n\nNelson Goodman introduced the \"new riddle of induction\" in his book \"Fact, Fiction, and Forecast\" (1954). He argued that inductive reasoning is problematic.\n\nAesthetics\n\nAesthetics was a slow-developing area of research in analytic philosophy. However, since Goodman, aesthetics has flourished in the analytic tradition.\n\nPhilosophy of Language\n\nThe philosophy of language is a topic that has decreased in activity in recent decades. However, the debate remains fierce and is still influenced by the early 20th-century philosophers.\n\nSemantics\n\nSaul Kripke introduced a semantics for modal logic in his book \"Naming and Necessity\" (1980).

of underdetermination posits that no scientific hypothesis can be understood in isolation.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Analytic_philosophy\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory of analytic philosophy\nAnalytic philosophy was deeply influenced by what is called Austrian realism in the former state of Austria-Hungary, so much so that Michael Dummett has remarked that analytic philosophy is better characterized as Anglo-Austrian rather than the usual Anglo-American [28]\n\n\nAustrian realism\nAnalytic philosophy was deeply influenced by what is called Austrian realism in the former state of Austria-Hungary, so much so that Michael Dummett has remarked that analytic philosophy is better characterized as Anglo-Austrian rather than the usual Anglo-American [28]\n\n\nBrentano\nUniversity of Vienna philosopher and psychologist Franz Brentano—in Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874) and through the subsequent influence of the School of Brentano and its members, such as Edmund Husserl and Alexius Meinong—gave to analytic philosophy the problem of intentionality or of aboutness [29] For Brentano, all mental events have a real, non-mental intentional object, which the thinking is directed at or \"about\".\n\n\nMeinong\nMeinong is known for his unique ontology of real nonexistent objects as a solution to the problem of empty names [30] The Graz School followed Meinong.\n\n\nLwów–Warsaw\nThe Polish Lwów–Warsaw school, founded by Kazimierz Twardowski in 1895, grew as an offshoot of the Graz School It was closely associated with the Warsaw School of Mathematics.\n\n\nFrege\nGottlob Frege (1848–1925) was a German geometry professor at the University of Jena who is understood as the father of analytic philosophy Frege proved influential as a philosopher of mathematics in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century He advocated logicism, the project of reducing arithmetic to pure logic.\n\n\nLogic\nAs a result of his logicist project, Frege developed predicate logic in his book Begriffsschrift (English: Concept-script, 1879), which allowed for a much greater range of sentences to be parsed into logical form than was possible using the ancient Aristotelian logic [q] An example of this is the problem of multiple generality.\n\n\nNumber\nNeo-Kantianism dominated the late 19th century in German philosophy Edmund Husserl's 1891 book Philosophie der Arithmetik argued that the concept of the cardinal number derived from psychical acts of grouping objects and counting them [32]\n\n\nLanguage\nFrege also proved influential in the philosophy of language and analytic philosophy's interest in meaning [33] Michael Dummett traces the linguistic turn to Frege's Foundations of Arithmetic and his context principle [34]\n\n\nRussell\nBritish philosophy in the 19th century had seen a revival of logic started by Richard Whately, in reaction to the anti-logical tradition of British empiricism The major figure of this period is English mathematician George Boole Other figures include William Hamilton, Augustus de Morgan, William Stanley Jevons, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland author Lewis Carroll, [r] Hugh MacColl, and American pragmatist Charles Sanders Peirce [35]\n\n\nParadox\nBertrand Russell, during his early career, was much influenced by Frege Russell famously discovered the paradox in Basic Law V which undermined Frege's logicist project However, like Frege, Russell argued that mathematics is reducible to logical fundamentals, in The Principles of Mathematics (1903) He also argued for Meinongianism [39]\n\n\nOn Denoting\nRussell sought to resolve various philosophical problems by applying Frege's new logical apparatus, most famously in his theory of definite descriptions in \"On Denoting\", published in Mind in 1905 [40] Russell here argues against Meinongianism He argues all names (aside from demonstratives like \"this\" or \"that\") are disguised definite descriptions, using this to solve ascriptions of nonexistence This position came to be called descriptivism.\n\n\nPrincipia Mathematica\nLater, his book written with Alfred North Whitehead, Principia Mathematica (1910–1913), the seminal text of classical logic and of the logicist project, encouraged many philosophers to renew their interest in the development of symbolic logic It used a notation from Italian logician Giuseppe Peano, and it uses a theory of types to avoid the pitfalls of Russell's paradox Whitehead developed process metaphysics in Process and Reality [41]\n\n\nIdeal language\nAdditionally, Russell adopted Frege's predicate logic as his primary philosophical method, a method Russell thought could expose the underlying structure of philosophical problems Logical form would be made clear by syntax For example, the English word \"is\" has three distinct meanings, which predicate logic can express as follows:\n\n\nLogical atomism\nAn important aspect of Hegelianism and British idealism was logical holism—the opinion that there are aspects of the world that can be known only by knowing the whole world This is closely related to the doctrine of internal relations, the opinion that relations between items are internal relations, that is, essential properties of the nature of those items.\n\n\nEarly Wittgenstein\nWittgenstein developed a comprehensive system of logical atomism with a picture theory of meaning in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (German: Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung, 1921) sometimes known as simply the Tractatus He claimed the universe is the totality of actual states of affairs and that these states of affairs can be expressed and mirrored by the language of first-order predicate logic Thus a picture of the universe can be constructed by expressing facts in the form of atomic propositions and linking them using logical operators.\n\n\nLogical positivism\nDuring the late 1920s to 1940s, a group of philosophers known as the Vienna Circle, and another one known as the Berlin Circle, developed Russell and Wittgenstein's philosophy into a doctrine known as \"logical positivism\" (or logical empiricism)  The Vienna Circle was led by Moritz Schlick and included Rudolf Carnap and Otto Neurath [44] The Berlin Circle was led by Hans Reichenbach and included Carl Hempel and mathematician David Hilbert.\n\n\nOrdinary language\nAfter World War II, from the late 1940s to the 1950s, analytic philosophy became involved with ordinary-language analysis This resulted in two main trends.\n\n\nLater Wittgenstein\nOne strain of language analysis continued Wittgenstein's later philosophy, from the Philosophical Investigations (1953), which differed dramatically from his early work of the Tractatus [v] The criticisms of Frank P Ramsey on color and logical form in the Tractatus led to some of Wittgenstein's first doubts with regard to his early philosophy Philosophers refer to them like two different philosophers: \"early Wittgenstein\" and \"later Wittgenstein\" In his later philosophy, Wittgenstein develops the concept of a \"language-game\" and, rather than his prior picture theory of meaning, advocates a theory of meaning as use It also contains the private language argument and the notion of family resemblance.\n\n\nOxford philosophy\nThe other trend was known as \"Oxford philosophy\", in contrast to earlier analytic Cambridge philosophers (including the early Wittgenstein) who thought philosophers should avoid the deceptive trappings of natural language by constructing ideal languages Influenced by Moore's Common Sense and what they perceived as the later Wittgenstein's quietism, the Oxford philosophers claimed that ordinary language already represents many subtle distinctions not recognized in the formulation of traditional philosophical theories or problems.\n\n\nSpread of Analytic philosophy\nThe school known as Australian realism began when John Anderson accepted the Challis Chair of Philosophy at the University of Sydney in 1927 His elder brother was William Anderson, Professor of Philosophy at Auckland University College from 1921 to his death in 1955, who was described as \"the most dominant figure in New Zealand philosophy.\" [49] J N Findlay was a student of Ernst Mally of the Austrian realists and taught at the University of Otago.\n\n\nAustralia and New Zealand\nThe school known as Australian realism began when John Anderson accepted the Challis Chair of Philosophy at the University of Sydney in 1927 His elder brother was William Anderson, Professor of Philosophy at Auckland University College from 1921 to his death in 1955, who was described as \"the most dominant figure in New Zealand philosophy.\" [49] J N Findlay was a student of Ernst Mally of the Austrian realists and taught at the University of Otago.\n\n\nFinland\nThe Finnish Georg Henrik von Wright succeeded Wittgenstein at Cambridge in 1948 [50]\n\n\nContemporary analytic philosophy\nOne striking difference with respect to early analytic philosophy was the revival of metaphysical theorizing during the second half of the 20th century, and metaphysics remains a fertile topic of research Although many discussions are continuations of old ones from previous decades and centuries, the debates remains active [51]\n\n\nMetaphysics\nOne striking difference with respect to early analytic philosophy was the revival of metaphysical theorizing during the second half of the 20th century, and metaphysics remains a fertile topic of research Although many discussions are continuations of old ones from previous decades and centuries, the debates remains active [51]\n\n\nDecline of logical positivism\nThe rise of metaphysics mirrored the decline of logical positivism, first challenged by the later Wittgenstein.\n\n\nSellars\nWilfred Sellars's criticism of the \"Myth of the Given\", in Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind (1956), challenged logical positivism by arguing against sense-data theories In his \"Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man\" (1962), Sellars distinguishes between the \"manifest image\" and the \"scientific image\" of the world Sellars's goal of a synoptic philosophy that unites the everyday and scientific views of reality is the foundation and archetype of what is sometimes called the Pittsburgh School, whose members include Robert Brandom, John McDowell, and John Haugeland.\n\n\nQuine\nAlso among the developments that resulted in the decline of logical positivism and the revival of metaphysical theorizing was Harvard philosopher W V O Quine's attack on the analytic–synthetic distinction in \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\", published in 1951 in The Philosophical Review and republished in Quine's book From A Logical Point of View (1953), a paper \"sometimes regarded as the most important in all of twentieth-century philosophy\" [52] [53] [54]\n\n\nKripke\nImportant also for the revival of metaphysics was the further development of modal logic, first introduced by pragmatist C I Lewis, especially the work of Saul Kripke and his Naming and Necessity (1980) [w]\n\n\nDavid Lewis\nAmerican philosopher David Lewis defended a number of elaborate metaphysical theories In works such as On the Plurality of Worlds (1986) and Counterfactuals (1973) he argued for modal realism and counterpart theory – the belief in real, concrete possible worlds According to Lewis, \"actual\" is merely an indexical label we give a world when we are in it Lewis also defended what he called Humean supervenience, a counterfactual theory of causation, [58] and contributed to abstract object theory [59] He became closely associated with Australia, whose philosophical community he visited almost annually for more than 30 years.\n\n\nUniversals\nIn response to the problem of universals, Australian David Malet Armstrong defended a kind of moderate realism [60] [61] Quine and Lewis defended nominalism [59]\n\n\nMereology\nPolish philosopher Stanisław Leśniewski coined the term mereology, which is the formal study of parts and wholes, a subject that arguably goes back to the time of the pre-Socratics [62] David Lewis believed in perdurantism and introduced the term 'gunk' Peter Van Inwagen believes in mereological nihilism, except for living beings, a view called organicism.\n\n\nFree will and determinism\nPeter van Inwagen's 1983 monograph An Essay on Free Will [63] played an important role in rehabilitating libertarianism with respect to free will, in mainstream analytical philosophy [64] In the book, he introduces the consequence argument and the term incompatibilism about free will and determinism, to stand in contrast to compatibilism—the view that free will is compatible with determinism Charlie Broad had previously made similar arguments.\n\n\nPersonal identity\nSince John Locke, philosophers have been concerned with the problem of personal identity Derek Parfit in Reasons and Persons (1984) defends a kind of bundle theory, while David Lewis again defends perdurantism Bernard Williams in The Self and the Future (1970) argues that personal identity is bodily identity rather than mental continuity [65]\n\n\nPrinciple of sufficient reason\nSince Leibniz philosophers have discussed the principle of sufficient reason or PSR Van Inwagen criticizes the PSR [63] Alexander Pruss defends it [66]\n\n\nPhilosophy of time\nAnalytic philosophy of time traces its roots to the British idealist J M E McTaggart's article \"The Unreality of Time\"  (1908) In it, McTaggart distinguishes between the dynamic, A-, or tensed, theory of time (past, present, future), in which time flows; and the static or tenseless B-theory of time (earlier than, simultaneous with, later than) Eternalism holds that past, present, and future are equally real In contrast, Presentism holds that only entities in the present exist [67]\n\n\nLogical pluralism\nMany-valued and non-classical logics have been popular since the Polish logician Jan Lukasiewicz Graham Priest is a dialetheist, seeing it as the most natural solution to problems such as the liar paradox JC Beall, together with Greg Restall, is a pioneer of a widely-discussed version of logical pluralism [69]\n\n\nEpistemology\nOwing largely to Edmund Gettier's 1963 paper \"Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\", [70] and the so-called Gettier problem, epistemology has enjoyed a resurgence as a topic of analytic philosophy during the last 50 years A large portion of current epistemological research is intended to resolve the problems that Gettier's examples presented to the traditional \"justified true belief\" model of knowledge, found as early as Plato's dialogue Theaetetus These include developing theories of justification to deal with Gettier's examples, or giving alternatives to the justified-true-belief model.\n\n\nJustification\nOwing largely to Edmund Gettier's 1963 paper \"Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\", [70] and the so-called Gettier problem, epistemology has enjoyed a resurgence as a topic of analytic philosophy during the last 50 years A large portion of current epistemological research is intended to resolve the problems that Gettier's examples presented to the traditional \"justified true belief\" model of knowledge, found as early as Plato's dialogue Theaetetus These include developing theories of justification to deal with Gettier's examples, or giving alternatives to the justified-true-belief model.\n\n\nGettier\nOwing largely to Edmund Gettier's 1963 paper \"Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\", [70] and the so-called Gettier problem, epistemology has enjoyed a resurgence as a topic of analytic philosophy during the last 50 years A large portion of current epistemological research is intended to resolve the problems that Gettier's examples presented to the traditional \"justified true belief\" model of knowledge, found as early as Plato's dialogue Theaetetus These include developing theories of justification to deal with Gettier's examples, or giving alternatives to the justified-true-belief model.\n\n\nTheories\nChisholm defended foundationalism Quine defended coherentism, a \"web of belief\" [71] Quine proposed naturalized epistemology.\n\n\nInternalism and externalism\nThe debate between internalism and externalism still exists in analytic philosophy [72] Alvin Goldman is an externalist known for developing a popular form of externalism called reliabilism Most externalists reject the KK thesis, which has been disputed since the introduction of the epistemic logic by Jaakko Hintikka in 1962 [73]\n\n\nProblem of the Criterion\nWhile a problem since antiquity, American philosopher Roderick Chisholm, in his Theory of Knowledge, details the problem of the criterion with two sets of questions:\n\n\nTruth\nFrege questioned standard theories of truth, and sometimes advocated a redundancy theory of truth Frank Ramsey also advocated a redundancy theory  Alfred Tarski put forward a semantic theory of truth [74] [75]\n\n\nClosure\nEpistemic closure is the claim that knowledge is closed under entailment; in other words epistemic closure is a property or the principle that if a subject \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n knows \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n, and \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n knows that \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n entails \n\n\n\nq\n\n\n{\\displaystyle q}\n\n, then \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n can thereby come to know \n\n\n\nq\n\n\n{\\displaystyle q}\n\n [77] Most epistemological theories involve a closure principle, and many skeptical arguments assume a closure principle In Proof of An External World, G E Moore uses closure in his famous anti-skeptical \"here is one hand\" argument Shortly before his death, Wittgenstein wrote On Certainty in response to Moore.\n\n\nInduction\nIn his book Fact, Fiction, and Forecast, Nelson Goodman introduced the \"new riddle of induction\", so-called by analogy with Hume's classical problem of induction  Goodman's famous example was to introduce the predicates grue and bleen \"Grue\" applies to all things before a certain time t, just in case they are green, but also just in case they are blue after time t; and \"bleen\" applies to all things before a certain time t, just in the case they are blue, but also just in case they are green after time t.\n\n\nOther topics\nOther, related topics of contemporary research include debates over basic knowledge, the nature of evidence, the value of knowledge, epistemic luck, virtue epistemology, the role of intuitions in justification, and treating knowledge as a primitive concept.\n\n\nEthics\nDue to the commitments to empiricism and symbolic logic in the early analytic period, early analytic philosophers often thought that inquiry in the ethical domain could not be made rigorous enough to merit any attention [79] It was only with the emergence of ordinary-language philosophers that ethics started to become an acceptable area of inquiry for analytic philosophers [79] Philosophers working within the analytic tradition have gradually come to distinguish three major types of moral philosophy.\n\n\nMeta-ethics\nAs well as Hume's famous is/ought distinction, twentieth-century meta-ethics has two original strains.\n\n\nPrincipia Ethica\nThe first is G E Moore's investigation into the nature of ethical terms (e.g., good) in his Principia Ethica (1903), which  advances a kind of moral realism called ethical non-naturalism and is known for the open question argument and identifying the naturalistic fallacy, a major topic of investigation for analytical philosophers According to Moore, \"Goodness is a simple, undefinable, non-natural property.\"\n\n\nEmotivism\nThe second is founded on logical positivism and its attitude that unverifiable statements are meaningless As a result, they avoided normative ethics and instead began meta-ethical investigations into the nature of moral terms, statements, and judgments.\n\n\nCritics\nStructuralist Paul Benacerraf has an epistemological objection to mathematical platonism.\n\n\nNormative ethics\nThe first half of the 20th century was marked by skepticism toward, and neglect of, normative ethics However, contemporary normative ethics is dominated by three schools: consequentialism, virtue ethics, and deontology [y]\n\n\nConsequentialism, or Utilitarianism\nDuring the early 20th century, utilitarianism was the only non-skeptical type of ethics to remain popular among analytic philosophers However, as the influence of logical positivism declined mid-century, analytic philosophers had a renewed interest in ethics Utilitarianism: For and Against was written with J J C Smart arguing for and Bernard Williams arguing against.\n\n\nVirtue ethics\nAnscombe, Foot, and Alasdair Macintyre's After Virtue sparked a revival of Aristotle's virtue ethical approach This increased interest in virtue ethics has been dubbed the \"aretaic turn\" mimicking the linguistic turn.\n\n\nDeontology\nJohn Rawls's 1971 A Theory of Justice restored interest in Kantian ethical philosophy.\n\n\nApplied ethics\nSince around 1970, a significant feature of analytic philosophy has been the emergence of applied ethics—an interest in the application of moral principles to specific practical issues The philosophers following this orientation view ethics as involving humanistic values, which involve practical implications and applications in the way people interact and lead their lives socially [84]\n\n\nPolitical philosophy\nIsaiah Berlin had a lasting influence on both analytic political philosophy and liberalism with his lecture \"Two Concepts of Liberty\" [citation needed] Berlin defined 'negative liberty' as absence of coercion or interference in private actions 'Positive liberty' Berlin maintained, could be thought of as self-mastery, which asks not what we are free from, but what we are free to do.\n\n\nLiberalism\nIsaiah Berlin had a lasting influence on both analytic political philosophy and liberalism with his lecture \"Two Concepts of Liberty\" [citation needed] Berlin defined 'negative liberty' as absence of coercion or interference in private actions 'Positive liberty' Berlin maintained, could be thought of as self-mastery, which asks not what we are free from, but what we are free to do.\n\n\nAnalytical Marxism\nAnother development of political philosophy was the emergence of the school of analytical Marxism Members of this school seek to apply techniques of analytic philosophy and modern social science to clarify the theories of Karl Marx and his successors The best-known member of this school is G A Cohen, whose 1978 book, Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence, is generally considered to represent the genesis of this school In that book, Cohen used logical and linguistic analysis to clarify and defend Marx's materialist conception of history Other prominent analytical Marxists include the economist John Roemer, the social scientist Jon Elster, and the sociologist Erik Olin Wright The work of these later philosophers has furthered Cohen's work by bringing to bear modern social science methods, such as rational choice theory, to supplement Cohen's use of analytic philosophical techniques in the interpretation of Marxian theory.\n\n\nCommunitarianism\nCommunitarians such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor, Michael Walzer, and Michael Sandel advance a critique of liberalism that uses analytic techniques to isolate the main assumptions of liberal individualists, such as Rawls, and then challenges these assumptions In particular, communitarians challenge the liberal assumption that the individual can be considered as fully autonomous from the community in which he is brought up and lives Instead, they argue for a conception of the individual that emphasizes the role that the community plays in forming his or her values, thought processes, and opinions While in the analytic tradition, its major exponents often also engage at length with figures generally considered continental, notably G W F Hegel and Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\n\nAesthetics\nAs a result of logical positivism, as well as what seemed like rejections of the traditional aesthetic notions of beauty and sublimity from post-modern thinkers, analytic philosophers were slow to consider art and aesthetic judgment Susanne Langer [89] and Nelson Goodman [90] addressed these problems in an analytic style during the 1950s and 1960s Since Goodman, aesthetics as a discipline for analytic philosophers has flourished [91]\n\n\nPhilosophy of language\nGiven the linguistic turn, it can be hard to separate logic, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language in analytic philosophy Philosophy of language is a topic that has decreased in activity during the last four decades, as evidenced by the fact that few major philosophers today treat it as a primary research topic While the debate remains fierce, it is still strongly influenced by those authors from the first half of the century, e.g Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Austin, Tarski, and Quine.\n\n\nSemantics\nSaul Kripke provided a semantics for modal logic In his book Naming and Necessity (1980), Kripke challenges the descriptivist theory with a causal theory of reference In it he introduced the term rigid designator According to one author, \"In the philosophy of language, Naming and Necessity is among the most important works ever.\" [55] Ruth Barcan Marcus also challenged descriptivism So did Keith Donnellan [97]\n\n\nPragmatics\nPaul Grice and his maxims and theory of implicature established the discipline of pragmatics.\n\n\nPhilosophy of mind and cognitive science\nJohn Searle suggests that the obsession with the philosophy of language during the 20th century has been superseded by an emphasis on the philosophy of mind [98]\n\n\nPhysicalism\nMotivated by the logical positivists' interest in verificationism, logical behaviorism was the most prominent theory of mind of analytic philosophy for the first half of the 20th century [99] Behaviorism later became much less popular, in favor of either type physicalism or functionalism During this period, topics of the philosophy of mind were often related strongly to topics of cognitive science, such as modularity or innateness.\n\n\nBehaviorism\nBehaviorists such as B F Skinner tended to opine either that statements about the mind were equivalent to statements about behavior and dispositions to behave in particular ways or that mental states were directly equivalent to behavior and dispositions to behave.\n\n\nType Identity\nType physicalism or type identity theory identified mental states with brain states Former students of Ryle at the University of Adelaide J J C Smart and Ullin Place argued for type physicalism.\n\n\nFunctionalism\nFunctionalism remains the dominant theory Type identity was criticized using multiple realizability.\n\n\nEliminativism\nThe view of eliminative materialism is most closely associated with Paul and Patricia Churchland, who deny the existence of propositional attitudes, and with Daniel Dennett, who is generally considered an eliminativist about qualia and phenomenal aspects of consciousness.\n\n\nDualism\nFinally, analytic philosophy has featured a certain number of philosophers who were dualists, and recently forms of property dualism have had a resurgence; the most prominent representative is David Chalmers [101] Kripke also makes a notable argument for dualism [102]\n\n\nTheories of consciousness\nIn recent years, a central focus of research in the philosophy of mind has been consciousness and the philosophy of perception While there is a general consensus for the global neuronal workspace model of consciousness, [103] there are many opinions as to the specifics The best known theories are Searle's naive realism, Fred Dretske and Michael Tye's representationalism,  Daniel Dennett's heterophenomenology, and the higher-order theories of either David M Rosenthal—who advocates a higher-order thought (HOT) model—or David Armstrong and William Lycan—who advocate a higher-order perception (HOP) model An alternative higher-order theory, the higher-order global states (HOGS) model, is offered by Robert van Gulick [104]\n\n\nPhilosophy of mathematics\nSince the beginning, analytic philosophy has had an interest in the philosophy of mathematics Kurt Gödel, a student of Hans Hahn of the Vienna Circle, produced his incompleteness theorems showing that Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica also failed to reduce arithmetic to logic Gödel has been ranked as one  of the four greatest logicians of all time, along with Aristotle, Frege, and Tarski [105] Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel established Zermelo Fraenkel Set Theory Quine developed his own system, dubbed New Foundations.\n\n\nPlatonism\nGödel was a platonist who postulated a special kind of mathematical intuition that lets us perceive mathematical objects directly Quine and Putnam argued for platonism with the indispensability argument Crispin Wright, along with Bob Hale, led a Neo-Fregean revival with his work Frege's Conception of Numbers as Objects [109]\n\n\nCritics\nStructuralist Paul Benacerraf has an epistemological objection to mathematical platonism.\n\n\nIntuitionism\nThe intuitionists, led by L E J Brouwer, are a constructivist school of mathematics that argues that mathematics is a cognitive construct rather than a type of objective truth.\n\n\nFormalism\nThe formalists, best exemplified by David Hilbert, considered mathematics to be merely the investigation of formal axiom systems Hartry Field defended mathematical fictionalism.\n\n\nPhilosophy of religion\nIn Analytic Philosophy of Religion, James Franklin Harris noted that:\n\n\nReformed epistemology\nAnalytic philosophy formed the basis for some sophisticated Christian arguments, such as those of the reformed epistemologists such as Alvin Plantinga, William Alston, and Nicholas Wolterstorff.\n\n\nAnalytic Thomism\nCatholic philosophers in the analytic tradition—such as Elizabeth Anscombe, Peter Geach, Anthony Kenny, Alasdair MacIntyre, John Haldane, Eleonore Stump, and others—developed an analytic approach to Thomism.\n\n\nOrthodox\nRichard Swinburne wrote a trilogy of books, arguing for God, consisting of The Coherence of Theism, The Existence of God, and Faith and Reason.\n\n\nWittgenstein and religion\nThe analytic philosophy of religion has been preoccupied with Wittgenstein, as well as his interpretation of Søren Kierkegaard's philosophy of religion [115] Wittgenstein fought for the Austrian army in the First World War and came upon a copy of Leo Tolstoy's Gospel in Brief At that time, he underwent some kind of religious conversion [116]\n\n\nPhilosophy of science\nScience and the philosophy of science have also had increasingly significant roles in analytic metaphysics The theory of special relativity has had a profound effect on the philosophy of time, and quantum physics is routinely discussed in the free will debate [51] The weight given to scientific evidence is largely due to commitments of philosophers to scientific realism and naturalism Others will see a commitment to using science in philosophy as scientism.\n\n\nConfirmation theory\nCarl Hempel advocated confirmation theory or Bayesian epistemology He introduced the famous raven's paradox [120]\n\n\nFalsification\nIn reaction to what he considered excesses of logical positivism, Karl Popper, in The Logic of Scientific Discovery, insisted on the role of falsification in the philosophy of science, using it to solve the demarcation problem [121]\n\n\nConfirmation holism\nThe Duhem–Quine thesis, or problem of underdetermination, posits that no scientific hypothesis can be understood in isolation, a viewpoint called confirmation holism [52]\n\n\nConstructivism\nIn reaction to both the logical positivists and Popper, discussions of the philosophy of science during the last 40 years were dominated by social constructivist and cognitive relativist theories of science Following Quine and Duhem, subsequent theories emphasized theory-ladenness Thomas Samuel Kuhn, with his formulation of paradigm shifts, and Paul Feyerabend, with his epistemological anarchism, are significant for these discussions [122]\n\n\nBiology\nThe philosophy of biology has also undergone considerable growth, particularly due to the considerable debate in recent years over the nature of evolution, particularly natural selection [123] Daniel Dennett and his 1995 book Darwin's Dangerous Idea, which defends Neo-Darwinism, stand at the forefront of this debate [124] Jerry Fodor criticizes natural selection.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBooks and articles\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

thinking about my daughter and my wife Right then I said goodbye to anything that would put me in that situation again I was up on trial on an attempted murder charge I was a motherfucking fool, with all that knowledge in my head and ending up there.\" [12]\nIn 1992, Diggs formed a new group with his two cousins and five other childhood friends They named the group Wu-Tang Clan, after the 1983 kung fu film Shaolin and Wu Tang As part of the group's formation, each member chose a new nickname for themselves Diggs chose \"RZA\", based on a nickname he had been given by fans of his music, \"Rza Rza Rakeem\", which in turn was based on a song by All in Together Now, \"Pza Pza Pumpin\", as well as Diggs' graffiti tag, \"Razor\" He created a backronym for \"RZA\", stating that the name

arranging the instrumental tracks as well as overseeing and directing the creative process RZA's rule over the Clan at this time is described in 2004's Wu-Tang Manual book as \"a dictatorship\" He also released a hit single of his own, in the form of \"Wu-Wear: The Garment Renaissance\" The song was featured on the High School High soundtrack, and was released to promote the Wu-Tang clothing

praise; he also had a brief cameo in the film itself, as a fellow samurai wearing camouflage The experience was positive and, as he noted during an interview on National Public Radio's Fresh Air, the work with traditional musicians gave him the desire to learn how to read and write music [18] In 2004, he co-scored David S Goyer's \"Blade: Trinity\" with composer Ramin Djawadi.\n\n\n2005–present:

labels\nSince the early 1990s, various Wu Tang Clan-affiliated recording labels were established The earlier labels are believed to be dissolved The connection that RZA had to these labels is unknown.\n\n\nArtistry\nRZA's production technique, specifically the manner of chopping up and/or speeding or slowing soul samples to fit his beats, has been imitated by hip hop producers including Kanye West and Just Blaze West's own take on RZA's style [33] briefly flooded the rap market with what was dubbed \"chipmunk soul,\" the speeding of a vocal sample to where it sounded as though the singer had inhaled helium Several producers at the time copied the style, creating other offshoots West has admitted that his style was distinctly influenced by the RZA's production, saying

promotion version of the EP, but was forced to remix and rerelease the single when Tommy Boy failed to acquire the rights to the original sample The rereleased version underperformed commercially, and Diggs was subsequently dropped by Tommy Boy [1]\n\n\nBefore the Wu-Tang Clan\nDiggs first became interested in making his own hip-hop music in 1979 when a friend of his introduced him to Rapper's Delight by The Sugarhill Gang and in 1984, Diggs formed a rap group with his cousins Russell Jones, then known as The Specialist, and Gary Grice, then known as Allah Justice, called \"Force of the Imperial Master\", which they soon after renamed as \"All in Together Now\" in 1985 Around this time Diggs formed the DMD Posse which consisted of RZA, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, U-God, Inspectah

original sample The rereleased version underperformed commercially, and Diggs was subsequently dropped by Tommy Boy [1]\n\n\n1992–1993: Forming the Wu-Tang Clan\nAfter a shoot-out in Ohio in 1992, he faced eight years in jail \"When they said 'not guilty', my face stuck in a smile for three days,\" he recalled \"I was just walking around town, thinking about my daughter and my wife Right then I said goodbye to anything that would put me in that situation again I was up on trial on an attempted murder charge I was a motherfucking fool, with all that knowledge in my head and ending up there.\" [12]\nIn 1992, Diggs formed a new group with his two cousins and five other childhood friends They named the group Wu-Tang Clan, after the 1983 kung fu film Shaolin and Wu Tang As part of the group's formation, each member chose a new nickname for themselves Diggs chose \"RZA\", based on a nickname he had been given by fans of his music, \"Rza Rza Rakeem\", which in turn was based on a song by All in Together Now, \"Pza Pza Pumpin\", as well as Diggs' graffiti tag, \"Razor\" He created a backronym for \"RZA\", stating that the name stood for \"Ruler, Zig-Zag-Zig, Allah\" which further translated into \"Ruler, Knowledge-Wisdom-Understanding, Allah\" when using the Supreme Alphabet [13]\n\n\n1994–1996: Gravediggaz and Wu-Tang solo projects: Round one\nAs each of the group's members embarked on solo careers, RZA continued to produce nearly everything Wu-Tang released during the period 1994–1996, which included both composing and arranging the instrumental tracks as well as overseeing and directing the creative process RZA's rule over the Clan at this time is described in 2004's Wu-Tang Manual book as \"a dictatorship\" He also released a hit single of his own, in the form of \"Wu-Wear: The Garment Renaissance\" The song was featured on the High School High soundtrack, and was released to promote the Wu-Tang clothing brand, also called \"Wu-Wear\" It peaked at #60 on the Billboard Hot 100, and #6 on the Hot Rap Singles chart [15]\n\n\n1997: Wu-Tang Forever\n1997 saw the release of Wu-Tang Forever, the Wu-Tang Clan's highly anticipated second album The album for the first time featured RZA delegating a small number of beat-making duties to other producers in the Wu-Tang camp, such as his protégés Mathematics, True Master and 4th Disciple who are known as the original Wu-Elements, and Clan member Inspectah Deck [17]\n\n\n1998–1999: Gravediggaz and Wu-Tang solo projects: Round two\nDuring the 1998–2000 period RZA ceased to produce every Wu-Tang solo album as he had done previously, but continued to contribute usually one or two songs on average to each record as well as receiving an Executive Producer credit.\n\n\n2001–2004: Post The W solo projects\nIn 1999 the RZA moved into composing film scores His first work, Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999), earned praise; he also had a brief cameo in the film itself, as a fellow samurai wearing camouflage The experience was positive and, as he noted during an interview on National Public Radio's Fresh Air, the work with traditional musicians gave him the desire to learn how to read and write music [18] In 2004, he co-scored David S Goyer's \"Blade: Trinity\" with composer Ramin Djawadi.\n\n\n2005–present: Solo projects: Round three\nHe has also stated that the long-delayed The Cure album will be his final solo album, so that he can devote more time to his movie directing career [19]\n\n\nWu-Recording labels\nSince the early 1990s, various Wu Tang Clan-affiliated recording labels were established The earlier labels are believed to be dissolved The connection that RZA had to these labels is unknown.\n\n\nArtistry\nRZA's production technique, specifically the manner of chopping up and/or speeding or slowing soul samples to fit his beats, has been imitated by hip hop producers including Kanye West and Just Blaze West's own take on RZA's style [33] briefly flooded the rap market with what was dubbed \"chipmunk soul,\" the speeding of a vocal sample to where it sounded as though the singer had inhaled helium Several producers at the time copied the style, creating other offshoots West has admitted that his style was distinctly influenced by the RZA's production, saying [34]\n\n\nAlter egos\nRZA is known for having multiple aliases, for different lyrical styles and personalities: Prince Rakeem, The Abbot, Bobby Digital, Bobby Steels, the Scientist, Prince Delight, Prince Dynamite, Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah [39] During his time with the Gravediggaz, he went by the name the RZArector, which is for waking up the mentally dead [40]\n\n\nFilm career\nRZA has had cameo appearances in films including Funny People, Due Date, Gospel Hill, Ghost Dog, Life Is Hot in Cracktown and Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping.\n\n\nActing\nRZA has had cameo appearances in films including Funny People, Due Date, Gospel Hill, Ghost Dog, Life Is Hot in Cracktown and Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping.\n\n\nFilmmaking\nI made my albums like movies, you know what I mean? I wanted people to be able to listen to a movie in their car while they was driving \"I want to start off making movies where people will know they're at a movie Like my man Tarantino, he did that movie Pulp Fiction – classic movie, man Every time it comes on TV or cable, I have to stop and watch it And it's based on nothing, really There's only a few people out there that are able to do that, where it comes from nothing but the vision and imagination of the artist [47]\n\nPersonal life\nRZA is a Five Percenter and is usually seen wearing the 5% Nation's flag necklace around his neck He actively extols the 5% culture (which include the Supreme Mathematics and the Supreme Alphabet) He has also embraced various aspects of Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Islam, and Christianity, as he describes in his two books, The Wu-Tang Manual and The Tao of Wu He has described the Quran, The Bible, and the Lotus Sutra as three of his favorite books, stating that each contains enlightenment  RZA provided the afterword to See You at San Diego: An Oral History of Comic-Con, Fandom, and the Triumph of Geek Culture [51]\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nStudio albums\n\n\nCollaboration albums\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilms\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Robert_F._Kennedy", "content": "\nEarly life\nRobert Francis Kennedy was born outside Boston in Brookline, Massachusetts, on November 20, 1925, to Joseph P Kennedy Sr., a politician and businessman, and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, a philanthropist and socialite He was the seventh of their nine children [10] Robert described his position in the family hierarchy by saying, \"When you come from that far down, you have to struggle to survive.\" [11] His parents were members of two prominent Irish-American families that were active in the Massachusetts Democratic Party [12] All four of Kennedy's grandparents were children of Irish immigrants [13] His eight siblings were Joseph Jr., John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Jean, and Ted [14]\n\n\nNaval service (1944–1946)\nSix weeks before his 18th birthday in 1943, Kennedy enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve as a seaman apprentice [35] He was released from active duty in March 1944, when he left Milton Academy early to report to the V-12 Navy College Training Program at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts from March to November 1944 He was relocated to Bates College in Lewiston, Maine from November 1944 to June 1945, [36] where he received a specialized V-12-degree along with 15 others [37] During the college's winter carnival, Robert built a snow replica of a Navy boat [38] [39] He returned to Harvard in June 1945, completing his post-training requirements in January 1946 [40]\n\n\nFurther study and journalism (1946–1951)\nThroughout 1946, Kennedy became active in his brother John's campaign for the U.S House seat vacated by James Michael Curley; he joined the campaign full-time after his naval discharge Schlesinger wrote that the election served as an entry into politics for both Robert and John [45] In September, Kennedy entered Harvard as a junior after receiving credit for his time in the V-12 program [46] He worked hard to make the Harvard Crimson football team as an end; he was a starter and scored a touchdown in the first game of his senior year before breaking his leg in practice [46] He earned his varsity letter when his coach sent him in wearing a cast during the last minutes of a game against Yale [47] Kennedy graduated from Harvard in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in political science [48]\n\n\nCollege and law school\nThroughout 1946, Kennedy became active in his brother John's campaign for the U.S House seat vacated by James Michael Curley; he joined the campaign full-time after his naval discharge Schlesinger wrote that the election served as an entry into politics for both Robert and John [45] In September, Kennedy entered Harvard as a junior after receiving credit for his time in the V-12 program [46] He worked hard to make the Harvard Crimson football team as an end; he was a starter and scored a touchdown in the first game of his senior year before breaking his leg in practice [46] He earned his varsity letter when his coach sent him in wearing a cast during the last minutes of a game against Yale [47] Kennedy graduated from Harvard in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in political science [48]\n\n\nThe Boston Post\nUpon graduating from Harvard, Kennedy sailed on the RMS Queen Mary with a college friend for a tour of Europe and the Middle East, accredited as a correspondent for The Boston Post, filing six stories [52] Four of these stories, submitted from Palestine shortly before the end of the British Mandate, provided a first-hand view of the tensions in the land [52] He was critical of British policy on Palestine and praised the Jewish people he met there, calling them \"hardy and tough.\" Kennedy predicted that \"before too long,\" the United States and Great Britain would be looking for a Jewish state to preserve a \"toehold\" of democracy in the region [53] He held out some hope after seeing Arabs and Jews working side by side but, in the end, feared that the hatred between the groups was too strong and would lead to a war [54] In June 1948, Kennedy reported on the Berlin Blockade [55] He wrote home about the experience: \"It is a very moving and disturbing sight to see plane after plane take off amidst a torrent of rain particularly when I was aboard one.\" [56] In September 1951, a few months after Kennedy graduated from law school, The Boston Post sent him to San Francisco to cover the convention that concluded the Treaty of Peace with Japan [57]\n\n\nSenate committee counsel and political campaigns (1951–1960)\nIn 1951, Kennedy was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar [58] [51] That November, he started work as a lawyer in the Internal Security Division of the U.S Department of Justice, which prosecuted espionage and subversive-activity cases In February 1952, he was transferred to the Criminal Division to help prepare fraud cases against former officials of the Truman administration before a Brooklyn grand jury [59] [60] On June 6, 1952, he resigned to manage his brother John's U.S Senate campaign in Massachusetts [61] JFK's victory was of great importance to the Kennedys, elevating him to national prominence and turning him into a serious potential presidential candidate John's victory was also equally important to Robert, who felt he had succeeded in eliminating his father's negative perceptions of him [62]\n\n\nJFK Senate campaign and Joseph McCarthy (1952–1955)\nIn 1951, Kennedy was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar [58] [51] That November, he started work as a lawyer in the Internal Security Division of the U.S Department of Justice, which prosecuted espionage and subversive-activity cases In February 1952, he was transferred to the Criminal Division to help prepare fraud cases against former officials of the Truman administration before a Brooklyn grand jury [59] [60] On June 6, 1952, he resigned to manage his brother John's U.S Senate campaign in Massachusetts [61] JFK's victory was of great importance to the Kennedys, elevating him to national prominence and turning him into a serious potential presidential candidate John's victory was also equally important to Robert, who felt he had succeeded in eliminating his father's negative perceptions of him [62]\n\n\nStevenson aide and focus on organized labor (1956–1960)\nKennedy went on to work as an aide to Adlai Stevenson II during the 1956 presidential election which helped him learn how national campaigns worked, in preparation for a future run by his brother, John [74] Unimpressed with Stevenson, he reportedly voted for incumbent Dwight D Eisenhower [75] Kennedy was also a Massachusetts delegate at the 1956 Democratic National Convention, [76] having replaced Tip O'Neil at the request of his brother John, joining in what was ultimately an unsuccessful effort to help JFK get the vice-presidential nomination [77]\n\n\nSenate Rackets Committee\nFrom 1957 to 1959, he made a name for himself while serving as the chief counsel to the U.S Senate's Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management (also known as the Senate Rackets Committee) under chairman John L McClellan [78] [79] Kennedy was given authority over testimony scheduling, areas of investigation, and witness questioning by McClellan, a move that was made by the chairman to limit attention to himself and allow outrage by organized labor to be directed toward Kennedy [80] In a famous scene, Kennedy and his brother John (also a member of the Senate Rackets Committee) squared off with Teamsters Union president Jimmy Hoffa during the antagonistic argument that marked Hoffa's testimony [81] Kennedy's investigations convinced him that Hoffa had worked with mobsters, extorted money from employers, and raided Teamster pension funds [82] During the hearings, Kennedy received criticism from liberal critics and other commentators both for his outburst of impassioned anger and doubts about the innocence of those who invoked the Fifth Amendment [83] Senators Barry Goldwater and Karl Mundt wrote to each other and complained about \"the Kennedy boys\" having hijacked the McClellan Committee by their focus on Hoffa and the Teamsters They believed Kennedy covered for Walter Reuther and the United Automobile Workers (UAW), a union which typically would back Democratic office seekers Amidst the allegations, Kennedy wrote in his journal that the two senators had \"no guts\" as they never addressed him directly, only through the press [84] Although the Rackets investigations produced few criminal prosecutions, glossy magazines began running glowing spreads: Life (\"Young Man with Tough Questions\" [85]) and the Saturday Evening Post (\"The Amazing Kennedys\") helped raise the Kennedy profile [86] \"Two boyish young men from Boston,\" wrote a Look magazine reporter, \"have become hot tourist attractions in Washington.\" [87] Kennedy left the committee in September 1959 in order to manage his brother's presidential campaign [88] The following year, Kennedy published The Enemy Within, a book which described the corrupt practices within the Teamsters and other unions that he had helped investigate [89]\n\n\nJFK presidential campaign (1960)\nKennedy went to work on the presidential campaign of his brother, John [90] In contrast to his role in his brother's previous campaign eight years prior, Kennedy gave stump speeches throughout the primary season, gaining confidence as time went on [91] His strategy \"to win at any cost\" led him to call on Franklin D Roosevelt Jr to attack Senator Hubert Humphrey as a draft dodger; Roosevelt eventually did make the statement that Humphrey avoided service [92]\n\n\nAttorney General of the United States (1961–1964)\nAfter winning the 1960 presidential election, president-elect John F Kennedy appointed his younger brother as U.S attorney general [100] The choice was controversial, with publications including The New York Times and The New Republic calling him inexperienced and unqualified [101] He had no experience in any state or federal court, [102] causing the president to joke, \"I can't see that it's wrong to give him a little legal experience before he goes out to practice law.\" [103] Pressed by the Senate Judiciary Committee about his inexperience, Kennedy responded: \"In my estimation I think that I have had invaluable experience .. I would not have given up one year of experience that I have had over the period since I graduated from law school for experience practicing law in Boston.\" [104]\n\n\nOrganized crime and the Teamsters\nAs attorney general, Kennedy pursued a relentless crusade against organized crime and the Mafia, sometimes disagreeing on strategy with FBI Director J Edgar Hoover Through speeches and writing, Kennedy alerted the country to the existence of a \"private government of organized crime with an annual income of billions, resting on a base of human suffering and moral corrosion\" He established the first coordinated program involving all 26 federal law enforcement agencies to investigate organized crime [79] The Justice Department targeted prominent Mafia leaders like Carlos Marcello and Joey Aiuppa; Marcello was deported to Guatemala, while Aiuppa was convicted of violating of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 [113] In 1961, Kennedy worked to secure the passage of anti-racketeering legislation (Wire Act, Travel Act, and Interstate Transportation of Paraphernalia Act) to prohibit interstate gambling The Federal Wire Act specifically targeted the use of wire communications and sought to disrupt the Mafia's gambling operations [114] [115] [116] Convictions against organized crime figures rose by 800 percent during his term [117] Kennedy worked to shift Hoover's focus away from communism, which Hoover saw as a more serious threat, to organized crime [118] According to James Neff, Kennedy's success in this endeavor was due to his brother's position, giving the attorney general leverage over Hoover [119] Biographer Richard Hack concluded that Hoover's dislike for Kennedy came from his being unable to control him [120]\n\n\nJuvenile delinquency\nIn his first press conference as attorney general in 1961, Kennedy spoke of an \"alarming increase\" in juvenile delinquency In May 1961, Kennedy was named chairman of the President's Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime (PCJD), with lifelong friend David Hackett as director After visits to blighted communities, Kennedy and Hackett concluded that delinquency was the result of racial discrimination and lack of opportunities The committee held that government must not impose solutions but empower the poor to develop their own The PCJD provided comprehensive services (education, employment, and job training) that encouraged self-sufficiency [134] In September 1961, the Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Offenses Control Act was signed into law [135]\n\n\nCivil rights\nKennedy expressed the administration's commitment to civil rights during a May 6, 1961, speech at the University of Georgia School of Law:\n\n\nU.S. Steel\nAt the president's direction, Kennedy used the power of federal agencies to influence U.S Steel not to institute a price increase, and announced a grand jury probe to investigate possible collusion and price fixing by U.S Steel in collaboration with other major steel manufacturers [161] The Wall Street Journal wrote that the administration had set prices of steel \"by naked power, by threats, by agents of the state security police\" Yale law professor Charles Reich wrote in The New Republic that the Justice Department had violated civil liberties by calling a federal grand jury to indict U.S Steel so quickly, then disbanding it after the price increase did not occur [162]\n\n\nBerlin\nAs one of the president's closest White House advisers, Kennedy played a crucial role in the events surrounding the Berlin Crisis of 1961 [163] Operating mainly through a private, backchannel connection to Soviet GRU officer Georgi Bolshakov, he relayed important diplomatic communications between the U.S and Soviet governments [164] Most significantly, this connection helped the U.S set up the Vienna Summit in June 1961, and later to defuse the tank standoff with the Soviets at Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie in October [165] [166] Kennedy's visit with his wife to West Berlin in February 1962 demonstrated U.S support for the city and helped repair the strained relationship between the administration and its special envoy in Berlin, Lucius D Clay [167]\n\n\nCuba\nAs his brother's confidant, Kennedy oversaw the CIA's anti-Castro activities after the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in Cuba, which included covert operations that targeted Cuban civilians [168] He also helped develop the strategy during the Cuban Missile Crisis to blockade Cuba instead of initiating a military strike that might have led to nuclear war [169]\n\n\nJapan\nAt a summit meeting with Japanese prime minister Hayato Ikeda in Washington D.C in 1961, President Kennedy promised to make a reciprocal visit to Japan in 1962, [186] but the decision to resume atmospheric nuclear testing forced him to postpone such a visit, and he sent Robert in his stead [186] Kennedy arrived in Tokyo in February 1962 at a very sensitive time in U.S.-Japan relations, shortly after the massive Anpo protests against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty had highlighted anti-American grievances Kennedy won over a highly skeptical Japanese public and press with his cheerful, open demeanor, sincerity, and youthful energy [186] Most famously, Kennedy scored a public relations coup during a nationally televised speech at Waseda University in Tokyo When radical Marxist student activists from Zengakuren attempted to shout him down, he calmly invited one of them on stage and engaged the student in an impromptu debate [186] Kennedy's calmness under fire and willingness to take the student's questions seriously won many admirers in Japan and praise from the Japanese media, both for himself and on his brother's behalf [186]\n\n\nAssassination of John F. Kennedy\nWhen President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963, Robert Kennedy was at home with aides from the Justice Department J Edgar Hoover called and told him his brother had been shot [187] Hoover then hung up before he could ask any questions Kennedy later said he thought Hoover had enjoyed telling him the news [188] [187] Shortly after the call from Hoover, Kennedy phoned McGeorge Bundy at the White House, instructing him to change the locks on the president's files He ordered the Secret Service to dismantle the hidden taping system in the Oval Office and cabinet room He scheduled a meeting with CIA director John McCone and asked if the CIA had any involvement in his brother's death McCone denied it, with Kennedy later telling investigator Walter Sheridan that he asked the director \"in a way that he couldn't lie to me, and they  [the CIA] hadn't\" [189]\n\n\n1964 vice presidential candidate\nIn the wake of the assassination of his brother and Lyndon Johnson's ascension to the presidency, with the office of vice president now vacant, Kennedy was viewed favorably as a potential candidate for the position in the 1964 presidential election [203] Johnson faced pressure from some within the Democratic Party to name Kennedy as his running mate, which Johnson staffers referred to internally as the \"Bobby problem.\" [204] It was an open secret that they disliked each other, [205] and Johnson had no intention of remaining in the shadow of another Kennedy [206] At the time, Johnson privately said of Kennedy, \"I don't need that little runt to win\", while Kennedy privately said of Johnson that he was \"mean, bitter, vicious—an animal in many ways.\" [207] [208] An April 1964 Gallup poll reported Kennedy as the vice-presidential choice of 47 percent of Democratic voters Coming in a distant second and third were Adlai Stevenson with 18 percent and Hubert Humphrey with 10 percent [209]\n\n\nThe \"Bobby problem\"\nIn the wake of the assassination of his brother and Lyndon Johnson's ascension to the presidency, with the office of vice president now vacant, Kennedy was viewed favorably as a potential candidate for the position in the 1964 presidential election [203] Johnson faced pressure from some within the Democratic Party to name Kennedy as his running mate, which Johnson staffers referred to internally as the \"Bobby

Kennedy as the vice-presidential choice of 47 percent of Democratic voters Coming in a distant second and third were Adlai Stevenson with 18 percent and Hubert Humphrey with 10 percent [209]\n\n\nDemocratic National Convention\nAs the Democratic National Convention approached, Johnson feared that delegates, still swept with lingering emotion over the assassination of JFK, might draft his brother onto the ticket as the vice-presidential nominee Johnson ordered the FBI to monitor Kennedy's contacts and actions at the convention, and made sure that Kennedy did not speak until after Hubert Humphrey was confirmed as his running mate [206]\n\n\nKennedy's political future\nIn June 1964, Kennedy offered to succeed Henry Cabot Lodge Jr as U.S ambassador to South Vietnam [216] President Johnson rejected the idea [217] Kennedy considered leaving politics altogether after his brother, Ted Kennedy, suffered a broken back in the crash of a small plane near Southampton, Massachusetts, on June 19 [218] [219] Positive reception during a six-day trip to Germany and Poland convinced him to remain in politics [218] [217]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (1965–1968)\nOn August 25, 1964, two days before the end of that year's Democratic National Convention, [222] Kennedy announced his candidacy for the U.S Senate representing New York [223] He resigned as attorney general on September 2 [224] Kennedy could not run for the U.S Senate from his native Massachusetts because his younger brother Ted was running for reelection in 1964 [225] [226] Despite their notoriously difficult relationship, President Johnson gave considerable support to Kennedy's campaign [227] The New York Times editorialized, \"there is nothing illegal about the possible nomination of Robert F Kennedy of Massachusetts as Senator from New York, but there is plenty of cynical about it, .. merely choosing the state as a convenient launching‐pad for the political ambitions of himself.\" [228] [229]\n\n\n1964 election\nOn August 25, 1964, two days before the end of that year's Democratic National Convention, [222] Kennedy announced his candidacy for the U.S Senate representing New York [223] He resigned as attorney general on September 2 [224] Kennedy could not run for the U.S Senate from his native Massachusetts because his younger brother Ted was running for reelection in 1964 [225] [226] Despite their notoriously difficult relationship, President Johnson gave considerable support to Kennedy's campaign [227] The New York Times editorialized, \"there is nothing illegal about the possible nomination of Robert F Kennedy of Massachusetts as Senator from New York, but there is plenty of cynical about it, .. merely choosing the state as a convenient launching‐pad for the political ambitions of himself.\" [228] [229]\n\n\nTenure\nKennedy drew attention in Congress early on as the brother of President Kennedy, which set him apart from other senators He drew more than 50 senators as spectators when he delivered a speech in the Senate on nuclear proliferation in June 1965 [242] But he also saw a decline in his power, going from the president's most influential advisor to one of a hundred senators, and his impatience with collaborative lawmaking showed [243] Though fellow senator Fred R Harris expected not to like Kennedy, the two became allies; Harris even called them \"each other's best friends in the Senate\" [244] Kennedy's younger brother Ted was his senior there Robert saw his brother as a guide on managing within the Senate, and the arrangement worked to deepen their relationship [243] Harris noted that Kennedy was intense about matters and issues that concerned him [245] Kennedy gained a reputation in the Senate for being well prepared for debate, but his tendency to speak to other senators in a more \"blunt\" fashion caused him to be \"unpopular .. with many of his colleagues\" [245]\n\n\nVietnam\nThe JFK administration backed U.S involvement in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world in the frame of the Cold War, but Kennedy was not known to be involved in discussions on the Vietnam War as his brother's attorney general [289] [290] Entering the Senate, Kennedy initially kept private his disagreements with President Johnson on the war While Kennedy vigorously supported his brother's earlier efforts, he never publicly advocated commitment of ground troops Though bothered by the beginning of the bombing of North Vietnam in February 1965, Kennedy did not wish to appear antagonistic toward the president's agenda [291] But by April, Kennedy was advocating a halt to the bombing to Johnson, who acknowledged that Kennedy played a part in influencing his choice to temporarily cease bombing the following month [292] Kennedy cautioned Johnson against sending combat troops as early as 1965, but Johnson chose instead to follow the recommendation of the rest of his predecessor's still intact staff of advisers In July, after Johnson made a large commitment of American ground forces to Vietnam, Kennedy made multiple calls for a settlement through negotiation In a letter to Kennedy the following month, John Paul Vann, a lieutenant colonel in the U.S Army, wrote that Kennedy \"indicat [ed] comprehension of the problems we face\" [293] In December 1965, Kennedy advised his friend, the Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, that he should counsel Johnson to declare a ceasefire in Vietnam, a bombing pause over North Vietnam, and to take up an offer by Algeria to serve as a \"honest broker\" in peace talks [294] The left-wing Algerian government had friendly relations with North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front and had indicated in 1965–1966 that it was willing to serve as a conduit for peace talks, but most of Johnson's advisers were leery of the Algerian offer [295]\n\n\n1968 presidential campaign\nIn 1968, Johnson prepared to run for reelection In January, faced with what was widely considered an unrealistic race against an incumbent president, Kennedy said he would not seek the presidency [312] After the Tet Offensive in Vietnam in early February, he received a letter from writer Pete Hamill that said poor people kept pictures of President Kennedy on their walls and that Kennedy had an \"obligation of staying true to whatever it was that put those pictures on those walls\" [313] There were other factors that influenced Kennedy's decision to seek the presidency On February 29, the Kerner Commission issued a report on the racial unrest that had affected American cities during the previous summer The report blamed \"white racism\" for the violence, but its findings were largely dismissed by the Johnson administration [314] Kennedy indicated that Johnson's apparent disinterest in the commission's conclusions meant that \"he's not going to do anything about the cities.\" [315]\n\n\nAssassination\nKennedy scored major victories when he won both the California and South Dakota primaries on June 4 [350] He was now in second place with 393 total delegates, against Humphrey's 561 delegates [351] Kennedy addressed his supporters shortly after midnight on June 5, in a ballroom at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles [352] At approximately 12:10 a.m., concluding his speech, Kennedy said: \"So my thanks to all of you and on to Chicago and let's win there.\" [353] Leaving the ballroom, he went through the hotel kitchen after being told it was a shortcut to a press room [354] He did this despite being advised by his bodyguard—former FBI agent Bill Barry—to avoid the kitchen In a crowded kitchen passageway, Kennedy turned to his left and shook hands with hotel busboy Juan Romero just as Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian, [355] opened fire with a .22-caliber revolver Kennedy was hit three times, and five other people were wounded [356]\n\n\nFuneral\nKennedy's body was returned to Manhattan, where it lay in repose at Saint Patrick's Cathedral from approximately 10:00 p.m until 10:00 a.m on June 8 [366] [367] A high requiem Mass was held at the cathedral at 10:00 a.m on June 8 The service was attended by members of the extended Kennedy family, President Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson, and members of the Johnson cabinet [368] Ted, the only surviving Kennedy brother, said the following:\n\n\nBurial\nKennedy was buried close to his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C [370] Although he had always maintained that he wished to be buried in Massachusetts, his family believed Robert should be interred in Arlington next to his brother [380] The procession left Union Station and passed the New Senate Office Building, where he had his offices, and then proceeded to the Lincoln Memorial, where it paused The Marine Corps Band played \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" [375] The funeral motorcade arrived at the cemetery at 10:24 p.m As the vehicles entered the cemetery, people lining the roadway spontaneously lit candles to guide the motorcade to the burial site [375]\n\n\nPersonal life\nOn June 17, 1950, Kennedy married Ethel Skakel at St Mary's Catholic Church in Greenwich, Connecticut [386] They first met during a skiing trip to Mont Tremblant Resort in Quebec, Canada in December 1945 [387] The couple had 11 children: Kathleen in 1951, Joseph in 1952, Robert Jr in 1954, David in 1955, Mary Courtney in 1956, Michael in 1958, Mary Kerry in 1959, Christopher in 1963, Maxwell in 1965, Douglas in 1967, and Rory in 1968 [388]\n\n\nWife and children\nOn June 17, 1950, Kennedy married Ethel Skakel at St Mary's Catholic Church in Greenwich, Connecticut [386] They first met during a skiing trip to Mont Tremblant Resort in Quebec, Canada in December 1945 [387] The couple had 11 children: Kathleen in 1951, Joseph in 1952, Robert Jr in 1954, David in 1955, Mary Courtney in 1956, Michael in 1958, Mary Kerry in 1959, Christopher in 1963, Maxwell in 1965, Douglas in 1967, and Rory in 1968 [388]\n\n\nAttitudes and approach\nKennedy's opponents on Capitol Hill maintained that his collegiate magnanimity was sometimes hindered by a tenacious and somewhat impatient manner His professional life was dominated by the same attitudes that governed his family life: a certainty that good humor and leisure must be balanced by service and accomplishment Schlesinger comments that Kennedy could be both the most ruthlessly diligent and yet generously adaptable of politicians, at once both temperamental and forgiving In this he was very much his father's son, lacking truly lasting emotional independence, and yet possessing a great desire to contribute He lacked the innate self-confidence of his contemporaries yet found a greater self-assurance in the experience of married life; an experience he said had given him a base of self-belief from which to continue his efforts in the public arena [400]\n\n\nRelationship with family members\nKennedy's mother Rose found his gentle personality endearing, but this made him \"invisible to his father.\" [29] She influenced him heavily and, like her, Robert became a devout Catholic, practicing his faith more seriously than his siblings over his lifetime [406] Joe Sr was satisfied with Kennedy as an adult, believing him to have become \"hard as nails\", more like him than any of the other children, while his mother believed he exemplified all she had wanted in a child [407]\n\n\nReligious faith and Greek philosophy\nThroughout his life, Kennedy made reference to his faith, how it informed every area of his life, and how it gave him the strength to reenter politics after his brother's assassination [411] Historian Evan Thomas calls Kennedy a \"romantic Catholic who believed that it was possible to create the Kingdom of Heaven on earth.\" [412] Journalist Murray Kempton wrote about Kennedy: \"His was not an unresponsive and staid faith, but the faith of a Catholic Radical, perhaps the first successful Catholic Radical in American political history.\" [413] Kennedy was deeply shaken by anti-Catholicism he encountered during his brother's presidential campaign in 1960, especially that of Protestant intellectuals and journalists That year, Kennedy said, \"Anti-Catholicism is the anti-semitism of the intellectuals.\" [414]\n\n\nLegacy\nKennedy's approach to national problems did not fit neatly into the idealogical categories of his time ...His was a muscular liberalism, committed to an activist federal government but deeply suspicious of concentrated power and certain that fundamental change would best be achieved at the community level, insistent on responsibilities as well as rights, and convinced that the dynamism of capitalism could be the impetus for broadening national growth.\n\n\nHonors\nIn the months and years after Kennedy's death, numerous roads, public schools, and other facilities across the United States have been named in his memory Examples include:\n\n\nKennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\"I have bad news for you, for all of our fellow citizens, and people who love peace all over the world, and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and killed tonight.\" \"Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and justice for his fellow human beings, and he died because of that effort In this difficult day, in this difficult time for the United States, it is perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in.\" — Robert Kennedy

Massachusetts, on November 20, 1925, to Joseph P Kennedy Sr., a politician and businessman, and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, a philanthropist and socialite. He was the seventh of their nine children. Robert described his position in the family hierarchy by saying, \"When you come from that far down, you have to struggle to survive.\" His parents were members of two prominent Irish-American families that were active in the Massachusetts Democratic Party. All four of Kennedy's grandparents were children of Irish immigrants. His eight siblings were Joseph Jr., John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Jean, and Ted.\n\n## Naval Service (1944–1946)\n\nSix weeks before his 18th birthday in 1943, Kennedy enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve as a seaman apprentice. He was released from active duty in March 1944, when he left Milton Academy early to report to the V-12 Navy College Training Program at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From March to November 1944, he was relocated to Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, where he received a specialized V-12 degree along with 15 others. During the college's winter carnival, Robert built a snow replica of a Navy boat. He returned to Harvard in June 1945, completing his post-training requirements in January 1946.\n\n## Further Study and Journalism (1946–1951)\n\nThroughout 1946, Kennedy became active in his brother John's campaign for the U.S House seat vacated by James Michael Curley. He joined the campaign full-time after his naval discharge. In September, Kennedy entered Harvard as a junior after receiving credit for his time in the V-12 program. He worked hard to make the Harvard Crimson football team as an end and was a starter, scoring a touchdown in the first game of his senior year before breaking his leg in practice. He earned his varsity letter when his coach sent him in wearing a cast during the last minutes of a game against Yale. Kennedy graduated from Harvard in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in political science.\n\n## The Boston Post\n\nUpon graduating from Harvard, Kennedy sailed on the RMS Queen Mary with a college friend for a tour of Europe and the Middle East, accredited as a correspondent for The Boston Post. He filed six stories, four of which were submitted from Palestine shortly before the end of the British Mandate. He was critical of British policy on Palestine and praised the Jewish people he met there, calling them \"hardy and tough.\" Kennedy predicted that \"before too long,\" the United States and Great Britain would be looking for a Jewish state to preserve a \"toehold\" of democracy in the region. He held out some hope after seeing Arabs and Jews working side by side but feared that the hatred between the groups was too strong and would lead to a war.\n\n## Senate Rackets Committee\n\nFrom 1957 to 1959, Kennedy made a name for himself while serving as the chief counsel to the U.S Senate's Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management (also known as the Senate Rackets Committee) under chairman John L McClellan. Kennedy was given authority over testimony scheduling, areas of investigation, and witness questioning by McClellan. In a famous scene, Kennedy and his brother John (also a member of the Senate Rackets Committee) squared off with Teamsters Union president Jimmy Hoffa during the antagonistic argument that marked Hoffa's testimony. Kennedy's investigations convinced him that Hoffa had worked with mobsters, extorted money from employers, and raided Teamster pension funds.\n\n## Attorney General of the United States (1961–1964)\n\nAfter winning the 1960 presidential election, President-elect John F Kennedy appointed his younger brother as U.S attorney general. The choice was controversial, with publications including The New York Times and The New Republic calling him inexperienced and unqualified. He had no experience in any state or federal court, causing the president to joke, \"I can't see that it's wrong to give him a little legal experience before he goes out to practice law.\" Pressed by the Senate Judiciary Committee about his inexperience, Kennedy responded: \"In my estimation I think that I have had invaluable experience... I would not have given up one year of experience that I have had over the period since I graduated from law school for experience practicing law in Boston.\"\n\n## Organized Crime and the Teamsters\n\nAs attorney general, Kennedy pursued a relentless crusade against organized crime and the Mafia. He established the first coordinated program involving all 26 federal law enforcement agencies to investigate organized crime. The Justice Department targeted prominent Mafia leaders like Carlos Marcello and Joey Aiuppa; Marcello was deported to Guatemala, while Aiuppa was convicted of violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. In 1961, Kennedy worked to secure the passage of anti-racketeering legislation (Wire Act, Travel Act, and Interstate Transportation of Paraphernalia Act) to prohibit interstate gambling. The Federal Wire Act specifically targeted the use of wire communications and sought to disrupt the Mafia's gambling operations. Convictions against organized crime figures rose by 800 percent during his term.\n\n## Juvenile Delinquency\n\nIn his first press conference as attorney general in 1961, Kennedy spoke of an \"alarming increase\" in juvenile delinquency. He was named chairman of the President's Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime (PCJD), with lifelong friend David Hackett as director. After visits to blighted communities, Kennedy and Hackett concluded that delinquency was the result of racial discrimination and lack of opportunities. The committee held that government must not impose solutions but empower the poor to develop their own. In September 1961, the Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Offenses Control Act was signed into law.\n\n## Civil Rights\n\nKennedy expressed the administration's commitment to civil rights during a May 6, 1961, speech at the University of Georgia School of Law. He advocated for the use of federal authority to enforce the rights of African Americans and to protect their voting rights. He stated that the federal government must not stand idly by while state and local authorities deny equal protection under the law to citizens of color.\n\n## U.S. Steel\n\nAt the president's direction, Kennedy used the power of federal agencies to influence U.S Steel not to institute a price increase. He announced a grand jury probe to investigate possible collusion and price fixing by U.S Steel in collaboration with other major steel manufacturers. The Wall Street Journal wrote that the administration had set prices of steel \"by naked power, by threats, by agents of the state security police.\" Yale law professor Charles Reich wrote in The New Republic that the Justice Department had violated civil liberties by calling a federal grand jury to indict U.S Steel so quickly, then disbanding it after the price increase did not occur.\n\n## Berlin\n\nAs one of the president's closest White House advisers, Kennedy played a crucial role in the events surrounding the Berlin Crisis of 1961. Operating mainly through a private, backchannel connection to Soviet GRU officer Georgi Bolshakov, he relayed important diplomatic communications between the U.S and Soviet governments. Most significantly, this connection helped the U.S set up the Vienna Summit in June 1961, and later to defuse the tank standoff with the Soviets at Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie in October.\n\n## Cuba\n\nAs his brother's confidant, Kennedy oversaw the CIA's anti-Castro activities after the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in Cuba, which included covert operations that targeted Cuban civilians. He also helped develop the strategy during the Cuban Missile Crisis to blockade Cuba instead of initiating a military strike that might have led to nuclear war.\n\n## Japan\n\nAt a summit meeting with Japanese prime minister Hayato Ikeda in Washington D.C in 1961, President Kennedy promised to make a reciprocal visit to Japan in 1962. However, the decision to resume atmospheric nuclear testing forced him to postpone such a visit, and he sent Robert in his stead. Kennedy arrived in Tokyo in February 1962 at a very sensitive time in U.S.-Japan relations, shortly after the massive Anpo protests against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty had highlighted anti-American grievances. Kennedy won over a highly skeptical Japanese public and press with his cheerful, open demeanor, sincerity, and youthful energy.\n\n## Assassination\n\nKennedy scored major victories when he won both the California and South Dakota primaries on June 4. He was now in second place with 393 total delegates, against Humphrey's 561 delegates. Kennedy addressed his supporters shortly after midnight on June 5, in a ballroom at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. At approximately 12:10 a.m., concluding his speech, Kennedy said: \"So my thanks to all of you and on to Chicago and let's win there.\" Leaving the ballroom, he went through the hotel kitchen after being told it was a shortcut to a press room.

A high requiem Mass was held at the cathedral at 10:00 a.m on June 8. The service was attended by members of the extended Kennedy family, President Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson, and members of the Johnson cabinet. Ted, the only surviving Kennedy brother, said the following: \"My brother need not be idealized, or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life, to be remembered simply as a good and decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it.\"\n\n## Burial\n\nKennedy was buried close to his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. Although he had always maintained that he wished to be buried in Massachusetts, his family believed Robert should be interred in Arlington next to his brother. The procession left Union Station and passed the New Senate Office Building, where he had his offices, and then proceeded to the Lincoln Memorial, where it paused.

Kennedy Elementary School in Los Angeles.\n\n## Publications\n\nKennedy has been the subject of several documentaries and has appeared in various works of popular culture. His role in the Cuban Missile Crisis has been dramatized by Martin Sheen in the TV play The Missiles of October (1974) and by Steven Culp in Thirteen Days (2000). The film Bobby (2006) is the story of multiple people's lives leading up to RFK's assassination. The film employs stock footage from his presidential campaign, and he is briefly portrayed by Dave Fraunces. Barry Pepper won an Emmy for his portrayal of Kennedy in The Kennedys (2011), an eight-part miniseries. He is played by Peter Sarsgaard in the film about Jacqueline Kennedy, Jackie (2016).

RMS Queen Mary with a college friend for a tour of Europe and the Middle East, accredited as a correspondent for The Boston Post, filing six stories [52] Four of these stories, submitted from Palestine shortly before the end of the British Mandate, provided a first-hand view of the tensions in the land [52] He was critical of British policy on Palestine and praised the Jewish people he met there, calling them \"hardy and tough.\" Kennedy predicted that \"before too long,\" the United States and Great Britain would be looking for a Jewish state to preserve a \"toehold\" of democracy in the region [53] He held out some hope after seeing Arabs and Jews working side by side but, in the end, feared that the hatred between the groups was too strong and would lead to a war [54] In June 1948, Kennedy reported on the Berlin Blockade [55] He wrote home about the experience: \"It is a very moving and disturbing sight to see plane after plane take off amidst a torrent of rain particularly when I was aboard one.\" [56] In September 1951, a few months after Kennedy graduated from law school, The Boston Post sent him to San Francisco to cover the convention that concluded the Treaty of Peace with Japan [57]\n\n\nSenate committee counsel and political campaigns (1951–1960)\nIn 1951, Kennedy was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar [58] [51] That November, he started work as a lawyer in the Internal Security Division of the U.S Department of Justice, which prosecuted espionage and subversive-activity cases In February 1952, he was transferred to the Criminal Division to help prepare fraud cases against former officials of the Truman administration before a Brooklyn grand jury [59] [60] On June 6, 1952, he resigned to manage his brother John's U.S Senate campaign in Massachusetts [61] JFK's victory was of great importance to the Kennedys, elevating him to national prominence and turning him into a serious potential presidential candidate John's victory was also equally important to Robert, who felt he had succeeded in eliminating his father's negative perceptions of him [62]\n\n\nJFK Senate campaign and Joseph McCarthy (1952–1955)\nIn 1951, Kennedy was

learn how national campaigns worked, in preparation for a future run by his brother, John [74] Unimpressed with Stevenson, he reportedly voted for incumbent Dwight D Eisenhower [75] Kennedy was also a Massachusetts delegate at the 1956 Democratic National Convention, [76] having replaced Tip O'Neil at the request of his brother John, joining in what was ultimately an unsuccessful effort to help JFK get the vice-presidential nomination [77]\n\n\nSenate Rackets Committee\nFrom 1957 to 1959, he made a name for himself while serving as the chief counsel to the U.S Senate's Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management (also known as the Senate Rackets Committee) under chairman John L McClellan [78] [79] Kennedy was given authority over testimony scheduling, areas of investigation, and witness questioning by McClellan, a move that was made by the chairman to limit attention to himself and allow outrage by organized labor to be directed toward Kennedy [80] In a famous scene, Kennedy and his brother John (also a member of the Senate Rackets Committee) squared off with Teamsters Union president Jimmy Hoffa during the antagonistic argument that marked Hoffa's testimony [81] Kennedy's investigations convinced him that Hoffa had worked with mobsters, extorted money from employers, and raided Teamster pension funds [82] During the hearings, Kennedy received criticism from liberal critics and other commentators both for his outburst of impassioned anger and doubts about the innocence of those who invoked the Fifth Amendment [83] Senators Barry Goldwater and Karl Mundt wrote to each other and complained about \"the Kennedy boys\" having hijacked the McClellan Committee by their focus on Hoffa and the Teamsters They believed Kennedy covered for Walter Reuther and the United Automobile Workers (UAW), a union which typically would back Democratic office seekers Amidst the allegations, Kennedy wrote in his journal that the two senators had \"no guts\" as they never addressed him directly, only through the press [84] Although the Rackets investigations produced few criminal prosecutions, glossy magazines began running glowing spreads: Life (\"Young Man with Tough Questions\" [85]) and the Saturday Evening Post (\"The Amazing Kennedys\") helped raise the Kennedy profile [86] \"Two boyish young men from Boston,\" wrote a Look magazine reporter, \"have become hot tourist attractions in Washington.\" [87] Kennedy left the committee in September 1959 in order to manage his brother's presidential campaign [88] The following year, Kennedy published The Enemy Within, a book which described the corrupt practices within the Teamsters and other unions that he had helped investigate [89]\n\n\nJFK presidential campaign (1960)\nKennedy went to work on the presidential campaign of his brother, John [90] In contrast to his role in his brother's previous campaign eight years prior, Kennedy gave stump speeches throughout the primary season, gaining confidence as time went on [91] His strategy \"to win at any cost\" led him to call on Franklin D Roosevelt Jr to attack Senator Hubert Humphrey as a draft dodger; Roosevelt eventually did make the statement that Humphrey avoided service [92]\n\n\nAttorney General of the United States (1961–1964)\nAfter winning the 1960 presidential election, president-elect John F Kennedy appointed his younger brother as U.S attorney general [100] The choice was controversial, with publications including The New York Times and The New Republic calling him inexperienced and unqualified [101] He had

I would not have given up one year of experience that I have had over the period since I graduated from law school for experience practicing law in Boston.\" [104]\n\n\nOrganized crime and the Teamsters\nAs attorney general, Kennedy pursued a relentless crusade against organized crime and the Mafia, sometimes disagreeing on strategy with FBI Director J Edgar Hoover Through speeches and writing, Kennedy alerted the country to the existence of a \"private government of organized crime with an annual income of billions, resting on a base of human suffering and moral corrosion\" He established the first coordinated program involving all 26 federal law enforcement agencies to investigate organized crime [79] The Justice Department targeted prominent Mafia leaders like Carlos Marcello and Joey Aiuppa; Marcello was deported to Guatemala, while Aiuppa was convicted of violating of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 [113] In 1961, Kennedy worked to secure the passage of anti-racketeering legislation (Wire Act, Travel Act, and Interstate Transportation of Paraphernalia Act) to prohibit interstate gambling The Federal Wire Act specifically targeted the use of wire communications and sought to disrupt the Mafia's gambling operations [114] [115] [116] Convictions against organized crime figures rose by 800 percent during his term [117] Kennedy worked to shift Hoover's focus away from communism, which Hoover saw as a more serious threat, to organized crime [118] According to James Neff, Kennedy's success in this endeavor was due to his brother's position, giving the attorney general leverage over Hoover [119] Biographer Richard Hack concluded that Hoover's dislike for Kennedy came from his being unable to control him [120]\n\n\nJuvenile delinquency\nIn his first press conference as attorney general in 1961, Kennedy spoke of an \"alarming increase\" in juvenile delinquency In May 1961, Kennedy was named chairman of the President's Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime (PCJD), with lifelong friend David Hackett as director After visits to blighted communities, Kennedy and Hackett concluded that delinquency was the result of racial discrimination and lack of opportunities The committee held that government must not impose solutions but empower the poor to develop their own The PCJD provided comprehensive services (education, employment, and job training) that encouraged self-sufficiency [134] In September 1961, the Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Offenses Control Act was signed into law [135]\n\n\nCivil rights\nKennedy expressed the administration's commitment to civil rights during a May 6, 1961, speech at the University of Georgia School of Law:\n\n\nU.S. Steel\nAt the president's direction, Kennedy used the power of federal agencies to influence U.S Steel not to institute a price increase, and announced a grand jury probe to investigate possible collusion and price fixing by U.S Steel in collaboration with other major steel manufacturers [161] The Wall Street Journal wrote that the administration had set prices of steel \"by naked power, by threats, by agents of the state security police\" Yale law professor Charles Reich wrote in The New Republic that the Justice Department had violated civil liberties by calling a federal grand jury to indict U.S Steel so quickly, then disbanding it after the price increase did not occur [162]\n\n\nBerlin\nAs one of the president's closest White House advisers, Kennedy played a crucial role in the events surrounding the Berlin Crisis of 1961 [163] Operating mainly through a private, backchannel connection to Soviet GRU officer Georgi Bolshakov, he relayed important diplomatic communications between the U.S and Soviet governments [164] Most significantly, this connection helped the U.S set up the Vienna Summit in June 1961, and later to defuse the tank standoff with the Soviets at Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie in October [165] [166] Kennedy's visit with his wife to West Berlin in February 1962 demonstrated U.S support for the city and helped repair the strained relationship between the administration and its special envoy in Berlin, Lucius D Clay [167]\n\n\nCuba\nAs his brother's confidant, Kennedy oversaw the CIA's anti-Castro activities after the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in Cuba, which included covert operations that targeted Cuban civilians [168] He also helped develop the strategy during the Cuban Missile Crisis to blockade Cuba instead of initiating a military strike that might have led to nuclear war [169]\n\n\nJapan\nAt a summit meeting with Japanese prime minister Hayato Ikeda in Washington D.C in 1961, President Kennedy promised to make a reciprocal visit to Japan in 1962, [186] but the decision to resume atmospheric nuclear testing forced him to postpone such a visit, and he sent Robert in his stead [186] Kennedy arrived in Tokyo in February 1962 at a very sensitive time in U.S.-Japan relations, shortly after the massive Anpo protests against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty had highlighted anti-American grievances Kennedy won over a highly skeptical Japanese public and press with his cheerful, open demeanor, sincerity, and youthful energy [186] Most famously, Kennedy scored a public relations coup during a nationally televised speech at Waseda University in Tokyo When radical Marxist student activists from Zengakuren attempted to shout him down, he calmly invited one of them on stage and engaged the student in an impromptu debate [186] Kennedy's calmness under fire and willingness to take the student's questions seriously won many admirers in Japan and praise from the Japanese media, both for himself and on his brother's behalf [186]\n\n\nAssassination of John F. Kennedy\nWhen President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963, Robert Kennedy was at home with aides from the Justice Department J Edgar Hoover called and told him his brother had been shot [187] Hoover then hung up before he could ask any questions Kennedy later said he thought Hoover had enjoyed telling him the news [188] [187] Shortly after the call from Hoover, Kennedy phoned McGeorge Bundy at the White House, instructing him to change the locks on the president's files He ordered the Secret Service to dismantle the hidden taping system in the Oval Office and cabinet room He scheduled a meeting with CIA director John McCone and asked if the CIA had any involvement in his brother's death McCone denied it, with Kennedy later telling investigator Walter Sheridan that he asked the director \"in a way that he couldn't lie to me, and they  [the CIA] hadn't\" [189]\n\n\n1964 vice presidential candidate\nIn the wake of the assassination of his brother and Lyndon Johnson's ascension to the presidency, with the office of vice president now vacant, Kennedy was viewed favorably as a potential candidate for the position in the 1964 presidential election [203] Johnson faced pressure from some within the Democratic Party to name Kennedy as his running mate, which Johnson staffers referred to internally as the \"Bobby problem.\" [204] It was an open secret that they disliked each other, [205] and Johnson had no intention of remaining in the shadow of another Kennedy [206] At the time, Johnson privately said of Kennedy, \"I don't need that little runt to win\", while Kennedy privately said of Johnson that he was \"mean, bitter, vicious—an animal in many ways.\" [207] [208] An April 1964 Gallup poll reported Kennedy as the vice-presidential choice of 47 percent of Democratic voters Coming in a distant second and third were Adlai Stevenson with 18 percent and Hubert Humphrey with 10 percent [209]\n\n\nThe \"Bobby problem\"\nIn the wake of the assassination of his brother and Lyndon Johnson's ascension to the presidency, with the office of vice president now vacant, Kennedy was viewed favorably as a potential candidate for the position in the 1964 presidential election [203] Johnson faced pressure from some within the Democratic Party to name Kennedy as his running mate, which Johnson staffers referred to internally as the \"Bobby problem.\" [204] It was an open secret that they disliked each other, [205] and Johnson had no intention of remaining in the shadow of another Kennedy [206] At the time, Johnson privately said of Kennedy, \"I don't need that little runt to win\", while Kennedy privately said of Johnson that he was \"mean, bitter, vicious—an animal in many ways.\" [207] [208] An April 1964 Gallup poll reported Kennedy as the vice-presidential choice of 47 percent of Democratic voters Coming in a distant second and third were Adlai Stevenson with 18 percent and Hubert Humphrey with 10 percent [209]\n\n\nDemocratic National Convention\nAs the Democratic National Convention approached, Johnson feared that delegates, still swept with lingering emotion over the assassination of JFK, might draft his brother onto the ticket as the vice-presidential nominee Johnson ordered the FBI to monitor Kennedy's contacts and actions at the convention, and made sure that Kennedy did not speak until after Hubert Humphrey was confirmed as his running mate [206]\n\n\nKennedy's political future\nIn June 1964, Kennedy offered to succeed Henry Cabot Lodge Jr as U.S ambassador to South Vietnam [216] President Johnson rejected the idea [217] Kennedy considered leaving politics altogether after his brother, Ted Kennedy, suffered a broken back in the crash of a small plane near Southampton, Massachusetts, on June 19 [218] [219] Positive reception during a six-day trip to Germany and Poland convinced him to remain in politics [218] [217]\n\n\nU.S. Senate (1965–1968)\nOn August 25, 1964, two days before the end of that year's Democratic National Convention, [222] Kennedy announced his candidacy for the U.S Senate representing New York [223] He resigned as attorney general on September 2 [224] Kennedy could not run for the U.S Senate from his native Massachusetts because his younger brother Ted was running for reelection in 1964 [225] [226] Despite their notoriously difficult relationship, President Johnson gave considerable support to Kennedy's campaign [227] The New York Times editorialized, \"there is nothing illegal about the possible nomination of Robert F Kennedy of Massachusetts as Senator from New York, but there is plenty of cynical about it, .. merely choosing the state as a convenient launching‐pad for the political ambitions of himself.\" [228] [229]\n\n\n1964 election\nOn August 25, 1964, two days before the end of that year's Democratic National Convention, [222] Kennedy announced his candidacy for the U.S Senate representing New York [223] He resigned as attorney general on September 2 [224] Kennedy could not run for the U.S Senate from his native Massachusetts because his younger brother Ted was running for reelection in 1964 [225] [226] Despite their notoriously difficult relationship, President Johnson gave considerable support to Kennedy's campaign [227] The New York Times editorialized, \"there is nothing illegal about the possible nomination of Robert F Kennedy of Massachusetts as Senator from New York, but there is plenty of cynical about it, .. merely choosing the state as a convenient launching‐pad for the political ambitions of himself.\" [228] [229]\n\n\nTenure\nKennedy drew attention in Congress early on as the brother of President Kennedy, which set him apart from other senators He drew more than 50 senators as spectators when he delivered a speech in the Senate on nuclear proliferation in June 1965 [242] But he also saw a decline in his power, going from the president's most influential advisor to one of a hundred senators, and his impatience with collaborative lawmaking showed [243] Though fellow senator Fred R Harris expected not to like Kennedy, the two became allies; Harris even called them \"each other's best friends in the Senate\" [244] Kennedy's younger brother Ted was his senior there Robert saw his brother as a guide on managing within the Senate, and the arrangement worked to deepen their relationship [243] Harris noted that Kennedy was intense about matters and issues that concerned him [245] Kennedy gained a reputation in the Senate for being well prepared for debate, but his tendency to speak to other senators in a more \"blunt\" fashion caused him to be \"unpopular .. with many of his colleagues\" [245]\n\n\nVietnam\nThe JFK administration backed U.S involvement in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world in the frame of the Cold War, but Kennedy was not known to be involved in discussions on the Vietnam War as his brother's attorney general [289] [290] Entering the Senate, Kennedy initially kept private his disagreements with President Johnson on the war While Kennedy vigorously supported his brother's earlier efforts, he never publicly advocated commitment of ground troops Though bothered by the beginning of the bombing of North Vietnam in February 1965, Kennedy did not wish to appear antagonistic toward the president's agenda [291] But by April, Kennedy was advocating a halt to the bombing to Johnson, who acknowledged that Kennedy played a part in influencing his choice to temporarily cease bombing the following month [292] Kennedy cautioned Johnson against sending combat troops as early as 1965, but Johnson chose instead to follow the recommendation of the rest of his predecessor's still intact staff of advisers In July, after Johnson made a large commitment of American ground forces to Vietnam, Kennedy made multiple calls for a settlement through negotiation In a letter to Kennedy the following month, John Paul Vann, a lieutenant colonel in the U.S Army, wrote that Kennedy \"indicat [ed] comprehension of the problems we face\" [293] In December 1965, Kennedy advised his friend, the Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, that he should counsel Johnson to declare a ceasefire in Vietnam, a bombing pause over North Vietnam, and to take up an offer by Algeria to serve as a \"honest broker\" in peace talks [294] The left-wing Algerian government had friendly relations with North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front and had indicated in 1965–1966 that it was willing to serve as a conduit for peace talks, but most of Johnson's advisers were leery of the Algerian offer [295]\n\n\n1968 presidential campaign\nIn 1968, Johnson prepared to run for reelection In January, faced with what was widely considered an unrealistic race against an incumbent president, Kennedy said he would not seek the presidency [312] After the Tet Offensive in Vietnam in early February, he received a letter from writer Pete Hamill that said poor people kept pictures of President Kennedy on their walls and that Kennedy had an \"obligation of staying true to whatever it was that put those pictures on those walls\" [313] There were other factors that influenced Kennedy's decision to seek the presidency On February 29, the Kerner Commission issued a report on the racial unrest that had affected American cities during the previous summer The report blamed \"white racism\" for the violence, but its findings were largely dismissed by the Johnson administration [314] Kennedy indicated that Johnson's apparent disinterest in the commission's conclusions meant that \"he's not going to do anything about the cities.\" [315]\n\n\nAssassination\nKennedy scored major victories when he won both the California and South Dakota primaries on June 4 [350] He was now in second place with 393 total delegates, against Humphrey's 561 delegates [351] Kennedy addressed his supporters shortly after midnight on June 5, in a ballroom at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles [352] At approximately 12:10 a.m., concluding his speech, Kennedy said: \"So my thanks to all of you and on to Chicago and let's win there.\" [353] Leaving the ballroom, he went through the hotel kitchen after being told it was a shortcut to a press room [354] He did this despite being advised by his bodyguard—former FBI agent Bill Barry—to avoid the kitchen In a crowded kitchen passageway, Kennedy turned to his left and shook hands with hotel busboy Juan Romero just as Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian, [355] opened fire with a .22-caliber revolver Kennedy was hit three times, and five other people were wounded [356]\n\n\nFuneral\nKennedy's body was returned to Manhattan, where it lay in repose at Saint Patrick's Cathedral from approximately 10:00 p.m until 10:00 a.m on June 8 [366] [367] A high requiem Mass was held at the cathedral at 10:00 a.m on June 8 The service was attended by members of the extended Kennedy family, President Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson, and members of the Johnson cabinet [368] Ted, the only surviving Kennedy brother, said the following:\n\n\nBurial\nKennedy was buried close to his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C [370] Although he had always maintained that he wished to be buried in Massachusetts, his family believed Robert should be interred in Arlington next to his brother [380] The procession left Union Station and passed the New Senate Office Building, where he had his offices, and then proceeded to the Lincoln Memorial, where it paused The Marine Corps Band played \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" [375] The funeral motorcade arrived at the cemetery at 10:24 p.m As the vehicles entered the cemetery, people lining the roadway spontaneously lit candles to guide the motorcade to the burial site [375]\n\n\nPersonal life\nOn June 17, 1950, Kennedy married Ethel Skakel at St Mary's Catholic Church in Greenwich, Connecticut [386] They first met during a skiing trip to Mont Tremblant Resort in Quebec, Canada in December 1945 [387] The couple had 11 children: Kathleen in 1951, Joseph in 1952, Robert Jr in 1954, David in 1955, Mary Courtney in 1956, Michael in 1958, Mary Kerry in 1959, Christopher in 1963, Maxwell in 1965, Douglas in 1967, and Rory in 1968 [388]\n\n\nWife and children\nOn June 17, 1950, Kennedy married Ethel Skakel at St Mary's Catholic Church in Greenwich, Connecticut [386] They first met during a skiing trip to Mont Tremblant Resort in Quebec, Canada in December 1945 [387] The couple had 11 children: Kathleen in 1951, Joseph in 1952, Robert Jr in 1954, David in 1955, Mary Courtney in 1956, Michael in 1958, Mary Kerry in 1959, Christopher in 1963, Maxwell in 1965, Douglas in 1967, and Rory in 1968 [388]\n\n\nAttitudes and approach\nKennedy's opponents on Capitol Hill maintained that his collegiate magnanimity was sometimes hindered by a tenacious and somewhat impatient manner His professional life was dominated by the same attitudes that governed his family life: a certainty that good humor and leisure must be balanced by service and accomplishment Schlesinger comments that Kennedy could be both the most ruthlessly diligent and yet generously adaptable of politicians, at once both temperamental and forgiving In this he was very much his father's son, lacking truly lasting emotional independence, and yet possessing a great desire to contribute He lacked the innate self-confidence of his contemporaries yet found a greater self-assurance in the experience of married life; an experience he said had given him a base of self-belief from which to continue his efforts in the public arena [400]\n\n\nRelationship with family members\nKennedy's mother Rose found his gentle personality endearing, but this made him \"invisible to his father.\" [29] She influenced him heavily and, like her, Robert became a devout Catholic, practicing his faith more seriously than his siblings over his lifetime [406] Joe Sr was satisfied with Kennedy as an adult, believing him to have become \"hard as nails\", more like him than any of the other children, while his mother believed he exemplified all she had wanted in a child [407]\n\n\nReligious faith and Greek philosophy\nThroughout his life, Kennedy made reference to his faith, how it informed every area of his life, and how it gave him the strength to reenter politics after his brother's assassination [411] Historian Evan Thomas calls Kennedy a \"romantic Catholic who believed that it was possible to create the Kingdom of Heaven on earth.\" [412] Journalist Murray Kempton wrote about Kennedy: \"His was not an unresponsive and staid faith, but the faith of a Catholic Radical, perhaps the first successful Catholic Radical in American political history.\" [413] Kennedy was deeply shaken by anti-Catholicism he encountered during his brother's presidential campaign in 1960, especially that of Protestant intellectuals and journalists That year, Kennedy said, \"Anti-Catholicism is the anti-semitism of the intellectuals.\" [414]\n\n\nLegacy\nKennedy's approach to national problems did not fit neatly into the idealogical categories of his time ...His was a muscular liberalism, committed to an activist federal government but deeply suspicious of concentrated power and certain that fundamental change would best be achieved at the community level, insistent on responsibilities as well as rights, and convinced that the dynamism of capitalism could be the impetus for broadening national growth.\n\n\nHonors\nIn the months and years after Kennedy's death, numerous roads, public schools, and other facilities across the United States have been named in his memory Examples include:\n\n\nKennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\"I have bad news for you, for all of our fellow citizens, and people who love peace all over the world, and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and killed tonight.\" \"Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and justice for his fellow human beings, and he died because of that effort In this difficult day, in this difficult time for the United States, it is perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in.\" — Robert Kennedy

He has been involved in various legal battles regarding free speech and obscenity, and has been a vocal advocate for civil liberties.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nFlynt was born on November 1, 1942, in Lakeville, Magoffin County, Kentucky, to Larry Claxton Flynt Sr. and Edith (née Arnett) Flynt. His father was a sharecropper, and his mother was a homemaker. Flynt's early life was marked by poverty, and he has said that Magoffin County was the poorest county in the nation during the Great Depression.\n\nFlynt's father served in the United States Army during World War II, and was away from home for much of Flynt's childhood. As a result, Flynt was raised by his mother and maternal grandmother for the first three years of his life. In 1951, Flynt's sister, Judy, died of leukemia at the age of four. The death of his sister had a profound impact on Flynt's life, and he has said that it was a turning point in his relationship with his parents.\n\nFlynt's parents divorced in 1952, and he was raised by his mother in Hamlet, Indiana. His brother, Jimmy, was raised by their maternal grandmother in Magoffin County. Flynt has said that he was a rebellious child, and that he often clashed with his parents.\n\n**First Enterprises**\n\nIn 1965, Flynt took $1,800 from his savings and bought his mother's bar in Dayton, Ohio, called the Keewee. He refitted the bar and was soon making $1,000 a week. Flynt worked long hours, often 20 hours a day, and used amphetamines to stay awake.\n\nFlynt's success with the Keewee led him to purchase two other bars, and he soon became a prominent figure in the adult entertainment industry. He was known for his aggressive marketing tactics and his ability to push the boundaries of what was considered acceptable in the industry.\n\n**Hustler Magazine**\n\nIn January 1972, Flynt created the Hustler Newsletter, a two-page, black-and-white publication about his clubs. The newsletter became popular with his customers, and Flynt expanded it to 16 pages by May 1972. He continued to expand the publication, and by August 1973, it had grown to 32 pages.\n\nFlynt's success with the Hustler Newsletter led him to create a full-fledged magazine, which he launched in 1974. The magazine was an instant success, and it quickly became one of the most popular adult publications in the country.\n\nFlynt's success with Hustler was not without controversy. He was a pioneer in the adult entertainment industry, and he was often at the forefront of battles over free speech and obscenity.

I threw the magazine down and thought, I'm gonna kill that guy.\" [15] Flynt himself suspected the attack was part of a larger conspiracy involving ultra-right elements surrounding U.S Representative Larry McDonald also behind the Karen Silkwood case with ties to the Intelligence Community and that Franklin may have been subject to MKULTRA-style mind control [16]\n\n\nPersonal life and death\nFlynt was married five times; his wives were: [18]\n\n\nFlynt's enterprises\nBy 1970, he ran eight strip clubs throughout Ohio in Cincinnati, Toledo, Akron, and Cleveland.\n\n\nLegal battles\nFlynt was embroiled in many legal battles regarding the regulation of pornography and free speech within the United States, especially attacking the Miller v California (1973) obscenity exception to the First Amendment He was first prosecuted on obscenity and organized crime charges in Cincinnati in 1976 by Simon Leis, who headed a local anti-pornography committee He was given a sentence of 7–25 years in prison, but served only six days in jail; the sentence was overturned on appeal following allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, as well as judicial and jury bias [31] One argument resulting from this case was reviewed by the U.S Supreme Court in 1981 [32] Flynt made an appearance in a feature film based on the trial, The People vs Larry Flynt (1996), playing the judge who sentenced him in the case.\n\n\nPolitics\nFlynt was a Democrat when Bill Clinton was president In 2013, he said he was \"a civil libertarian to the core\", [42] though he once attempted a presidential run as a Republican in 1984 [43] He was a staunch critic of the Warren Commission and offered $1 million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the assassin of John F Kennedy In 2003, Flynt was a candidate in the recall election of California governor Gray Davis, calling himself a \"smut peddler who cares\" [44] He finished seventh in a field of 135 candidates with 17,458 votes (0.2%) [45]\n\n\nAllegations of incest, misogyny, and racism\nFlynt's daughter, Tonya Flynt-Vega, accused him of sexually abusing her as a child [55] [8]: 16  In the 1998 book, Hustled: My Journey from Fear to Faith, Flynt-Vega writes about her father showing her images from Hustler and while he did so, he began touching her, had her remove her bathing suit, assaulted her orally, then showed her his erection and tried to penetrate her She writes, \"The pain was intense I know I was hurt Dad had not penetrated  [me].\" [8]: 116–117  She described an exchange with her father after he knew she planned to publish a book describing his abuses of her: \"He called me at work one day and said 'If you don't back-off that book, I'll send somebody to wring your  [expletive] neck.' ..

advertisement Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album, Metal Massacre Slagel accepted, and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar [9] The band was officially formed on October 28, 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met [10] [11]\n\n\n1981–1984: Formation, early years, and Kill 'Em All\nMetallica was formed in Los Angeles in late 1981 when Danish drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper, The Recycler, which read, \"Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden.\" [9] Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement

Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar [9] The band was officially formed on October 28, 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met [10] [11]\n\n\n1984–1986: Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and Burton's death\nMetallica recorded its second studio album, Ride the Lightning, at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark, from February to March 1984 It was released in August 1984 and reached number 100 on the Billboard 200 [28] A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors' items Mustaine received writing credit for \"Ride the Lightning\" and \"The Call of Ktulu\" [27]\n\n\n1986–1994: Newsted joins, ...And Justice for All and Metallica\nBurton's death left Metallica's future in doubt The three remaining members decided Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings, the band sought a replacement [35] Roughly 40 people – including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus; Troy Gregory of Prong; and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam – auditioned for the band to fill Burton's spot Newsted learned Metallica's entire setlist; after the audition, Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco Hetfield, Ulrich and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; his first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi [35] The band finished its tour in February 1987.\n\n\n1994–2001: Load, Reload, Napster controversy and Newsted's departure\nAfter almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, which comprised three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy? and Corrosion of Conformity The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996 Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number one album [28] The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass [55] The release marked another change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the band members' hair was cut While Load was a commercial success, the band's change in style had polarized their fanbase [56] Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996 [57] [58]\n\n\n2001–2006: Some Kind of Monster, St. Anger, and Trujillo joins\nIn April 2001, filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky began following Metallica to document the recording process of the band's next studio album Over two years they recorded more than 1,000 hours of footage On July 19, 2001, before preparations to enter the recording studio, Hetfield entered rehab to treat his \"alcoholism and other addictions\" All recording plans were put on hold and the band's future was in doubt [70] Hetfield left rehab on December 4, 2001, [70] and the band returned to the recording studio on April 12, 2002 Hetfield was required to limit his work to four hours a day between noon and 4 pm, and to spend the rest of his time with his family [59] The footage recorded by Berlinger and Sinofsky was compiled into the documentary Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004 In the documentary, Newsted said his former bandmates' decision to hire a therapist to help solve their problems which he felt they could have solved on their own was \"really fucking lame and weak\" [59]\n\n\n2006–2013: Death Magnetic and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction\nIn February 2006, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing the band's next studio album Instead, the band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin [80] Around the same time, a petition signed by 1,500 fans was posted online in an attempt to encourage the band to prohibit Rock from producing Metallica albums, saying he had too much influence on the band's sound and musical direction Rock said the petition hurt his children's feelings; he said, \"sometimes, even with a great coach, a team keeps losing You have to get new blood in there.\" [81]\n\n\n2013–2019: Metallica: Through the Never and Hardwired... to Self-Destruct\nIn an interview with Classic Rock on January 8, 2013, Ulrich said regarding the band's upcoming album, \"What we're doing now certainly sounds like a continuation  [of Death Magnetic]\" He also said, \"I love Rick  [Rubin] We all love Rick We're in touch with Rick constantly We'll see where it goes It would stun me if the record came out in 2013.\" [142] Also in 2013, the band starred in a 3D concert film titled Metallica: Through the Never, which was directed by Antal Nimród and was released in IMAX theaters on September 27 [143]\n\n\n2019–2023: S&M2 and 72 Seasons\nIn an interview with Australian magazine The Music's official podcast in March 2019, Trujillo said that Metallica had begun jamming on new material for its next studio album \"I'm excited about the next record because I believe it will also be a culmination of the two  [previous] records and another journey There's no shortage of original ideas, that's the beauty of being in this band.\" He estimated that the album would be released \"a lot sooner than the previous two did.. this time around I think we'll be able to jump on it a lot quicker and jump in the studio and start working We've all vowed to get this one going sooner than later.\" [173] In an interview with Australian magazine Mixdown the following month, Hammett said that the band had tentative plans to enter the studio after the conclusion of its WorldWired Tour He stated, \"We're in our third year since Hardwired Maybe we can get a bit more focus and go into the studio a bit sooner.\" After not contributing any writing to Hardwired.. to Self-Destruct, Hammett said regarding his ideas for the new album, \"I have a ton of material I've over-compensated, so I'm ready to go anytime.\" [174]\n\n\n2023–present: Future plans\nIn an interview on Loudwire Nights radio program in April 2023, Ulrich stated that \"there  [were] some ideas  [Metallica] could start with\" for the follow-up to 72 Seasons, adding, \"I'm looking forward to going live and being in sharing mode for the next couple of years The beauty of being with these guys, I kind of joke, James writes more riffs when he's tuning his guitar than most people do in a lifetime That's the beauty of being in band with these guys and I'm eternally grateful I'm dumbfounded by it.\" When asked about \"leftovers\" that could be used for the next Metallica album, Ulrich said, \"There's always a few riffs in the riff tank.\" [217] In May 2024, Hetfield confirmed that he has been \"writing lots of music, playing guitar pretty much every day.\" [218]\n\n\nStyle and lyrical themes\nMetallica played thrash [222] and speed metal [224] on their first four albums before changing their sound to traditional heavy metal [227] on 1991's Black Album Load and Reload, released in 1996 and 1997 respectively, saw the band move towards hard rock [228] 2008's Death Magnetic saw them returning to a more thrash-influenced sound [229]\n\n\nAll Within My Hands Foundation\nIn February 2017, Metallica launched All Within My Hands Foundation, \"dedicated to creating sustainable communities by supporting workforce education, the fight against hunger, and other critical local services\" For example, the group works with various selected charities to organize volunteer projects at food banks It also works with workforce training institutions on its Metallica Scholars grant program to help chosen students learn new trade skills [248] The Foundation has also donated and further raised funds for World Central Kitchen's Ukraine war relief efforts [249] [250] and granted $200,000 for relief efforts after the destructive August 2023 Maui, Hawaii fire [251] The band has also performed fundraising concerts for the Foundation [252]\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nMetallica has become one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time and is credited as one of the \"big four\" of thrash metal, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth [253] The band has sold more than 125 million records worldwide, [3] including an RIAA-certified 66 million and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 58 million in the US, making Metallica one of the most commercially successful bands of all time [254] [255] The writers of The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll said Metallica gave heavy metal \"a much-needed charge\" [256] Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica \"expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions\", and called the band \"easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth\" [257]\n\n\nFeuds\nFormer lead guitarist and Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine has been involved in a historic feud with Metallica During his time as a founding member during the first two years of the band, Mustaine's tenure was marred by his alcoholism and even a physical altercation with James Hetfield [290] Mustaine continued to make numerous inflammatory statements against his former band in the press due to buried tension primarily stemming from his firing in 1983 among other issues such as existing songwriting credits across Metallica's first three albums [291] [292] By the late 1980s, it was believed that the feud had largely subsided; later confirmed after Megadeth were hired to open for Metallica on numerous European dates in 1993 [293] Despite this, Mustaine expressed his anger at Metallica during his appearance in the band's documentary Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, [294] in a scene he later disapproved of as he felt he was mischaracterized, and that it did not represent the full extent of what happened during the meeting [295] The two bands would again find themselves on friendlier terms in 2011 when they took part in the lauded 'Big 4 Tour', alongside Slayer and Anthrax [296] That same year, Mustaine took part in Metallica's exclusive 30th anniversary show in San Francisco which invited other former members: Ron McGovney, Lloyd Grant, and Jason Newsted [297]\n\n\nDave Mustaine/Megadeth\nFormer lead guitarist and Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine has been involved in a historic feud with Metallica During his time as a founding member during the first two years of the band, Mustaine's tenure was marred by his alcoholism and even a physical altercation with James Hetfield [290] Mustaine continued to make numerous inflammatory statements

McGovney, Lloyd Grant, and Jason Newsted [297]\n\n\nMötley Crüe\nOften clashing during the early 1980s, both bands were fighting for dominance in the Los Angeles rock scene during Metallica's early years prior to their relocation to the Bay Area Both James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich expressed their hatred of the hair metal scene in Los Angeles during the time and frequently attacked multiple up-and-coming local bands in multiple interviews, including Mötley Crüe [298] Ulrich and Mötley Crüe's bassist Nikki Sixx had allegedly been involved in a spat prior to a show at the Troubadour in Hollywood in 1982 Though despite their public disdain for glam metal, Metallica were impressed by the production and commercial success of Dr Feelgood in 1989, later hiring the album's producer Bob Rock to produce their self-titled fifth album in 1991 Several years later; both Sixx and Ulrich would reignite the feud after Ulrich accused Mötley Crüe of performing to a backing track at the 1997 American Music Awards Sixx responded via an online forum in which he insulted numerous band members and also attacked Metallica's then-recent album Load [299] [300] Despite this, Sixx would praise Metallica's then-latest album St Anger during a 2003 interview, contrary to the negative attention it received upon release [301] In 2006, both Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, and former bassist Jason Newsted took part in a reality show entitled Rock Star: Supernova as they would both participate in creating a supergroup while the show's premise revolved around finding a frontman via contest During a 2011 meet-and-greet in Mexico City, Hetfield was approached by a fan attacking Mötley Crüe due to their public image and frequent appearances in tabloids Hetfield refused to directly respond to the fan's comments towards Mötley Crüe but laughed in his insults toward the band [302] In 2015, drummer Lee reignited the feud when he tweeted a picture of Ulrich with the words \"Straight Outta Tempo\" superimposed over his face Following the post by Lee, Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil had stated online that he was unaware of the feud with Metallica; however, during a later interview with an Oregon radio show, Neil was again asked about the band's current relationship with Metallica and hung up on the show's host [303] Things were alleged to have calmed down by 2017, when Hetfield appeared on Sixx's radio show 'Sixx Sense' [304] During an interview in 2021, Sixx applauded Metallica's longevity and praised several of their releases during an interview [305]\n\n\nJason Newsted\nFollowing his hiring in 1986, former bassist Jason Newsted had regularly experienced incidents of hazing and a perceived lack of acceptance from his bandmates despite his strong efforts in a majority of the band's live performances [306] Many fans and outlets cite the band's fourth album's unusual mixing to drown the bass tracks as a possible effort by Hetfield and Ulrich to minimize Newsted's involvement [307] [308] This sentiment was further exacerbated by the fact that Newsted was only given songwriting credits on three songs during his 14-year span in the band which also saw him perform on four studio albums [309] Tensions between Hetfield and Newsted reached a breaking point in 2000 after Hetfield repeatedly blocked Newsted's request to venture into his side project Echobrain [310] [311] Discussions broke down and Newsted abruptly left the band in January 2001 prior to the recording of St Anger [312] Despite Newsted's animosity surrounding his decision, he was later inducted into the hall of fame as a member of the band in 2009 and also appeared at the band's 30th anniversary show in San Francisco in 2011 In August 2021, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the release of the band's self-titled album, Newsted was given a box set of the reissue to open for an unboxing video, which was uploaded to the band's YouTube channel [313] [314]\n\n\nBand members\nCurrent

Around the same time, a petition signed by 1,500 fans was posted online in an attempt to encourage the band to prohibit Rock from producing Metallica albums, saying he had too much influence on the band's sound and musical direction. Rock said the petition hurt his children's feelings; he said, \"sometimes, even with a great coach, a team keeps losing You have to get new blood in there.\" In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n**2013–2019: Metallica: Through the Never and Hardwired... to Self-Destruct**\n\nIn 2013, Metallica starred in a 3D concert film titled Metallica: Through the Never, which was directed by Antal Nimród and was released in IMAX theaters on September 27. In an interview with Classic Rock on January 8, 2013, Ulrich said regarding the band's upcoming album, \"What we're doing now certainly sounds like a continuation [of Death Magnetic].\" The band released its ninth studio album, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, on November 18, 2016.\n\n**2019–2023: S&M2 and 72 Seasons**\n\nIn 2019, Metallica released its live album S&M2, which was recorded with the San Francisco Symphony in 2019. In 2022, the band announced that it was working on its eleventh studio album, 72 Seasons, which was released on April 14, 2023.\n\n**Style and lyrical themes**\n\nMetallica played thrash and speed metal on their first four albums before changing their sound to traditional heavy metal on 1991's Black Album. Load and Reload, released in 1996 and 1997 respectively, saw the band move towards hard rock. 2008's Death Magnetic saw them returning to a more thrash-influenced sound.\n\n**All Within My Hands Foundation**\n\nIn 2017, Metallica launched All Within My Hands Foundation, \"dedicated to creating sustainable communities by supporting workforce education, the fight against hunger, and other critical local services.\" For example, the group works with various selected charities to organize volunteer projects at food banks. It also works with workforce training institutions on its Metallica Scholars grant program to help chosen students learn new trade skills.\n\n**Legacy and influence**\n\nMetallica has become one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time and is credited as one of the \"big four\" of thrash metal, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth. The band has sold more than 125 million records worldwide, including an RIAA-certified 66 million and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 58 million in the US, making Metallica one of the most commercially successful bands of all time. The writers of The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll said Metallica gave heavy metal \"a much-needed charge.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica \"expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions,\" and called the band \"easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth.\"\n\n**Feuds**\n\nFormer lead guitarist and Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine has been involved in a historic feud with Metallica. During his time as a founding member during the first two years of the band, Mustaine's tenure was marred by his alcoholism and even a physical altercation with James Hetfield. Mustaine continued to make numerous inflammatory statements against his former band in the press due to buried tension primarily stemming from his firing in 1983 among other issues such as existing songwriting credits across Metallica's first three albums. By the late 1980s, it was believed that the feud had largely subsided; later confirmed after Megadeth were hired to open for Metallica on numerous European dates in 1993. Despite this, Mustaine expressed his anger at Metallica during his appearance in the band's documentary Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, in a scene he later disapproved of as he felt he was mischaracterized, and that it did not represent the full extent of what happened during the meeting. The two bands would again find themselves on friendlier terms in 2011 when they took part in the lauded 'Big 4 Tour,' alongside Slayer and Anthrax.\n\n**Band members**\n\n* **Current members**\n\t+

\"Metallica\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nMetallica was formed in Los Angeles in late 1981 when Danish drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper, The Recycler, which read, \"Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden.\" [9] Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album, Metal Massacre Slagel accepted, and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar [9] The band was officially formed on October 28, 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met [10] [11]\n\n\n1981–1984: Formation, early years, and Kill 'Em All\nMetallica was formed in Los Angeles in late 1981 when Danish drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper, The Recycler, which read, \"Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden.\" [9] Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album, Metal Massacre Slagel accepted, and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar [9] The band was officially formed on October 28, 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met [10] [11]\n\n\n1984–1986: Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and Burton's death\nMetallica recorded its second studio album, Ride the Lightning, at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark, from February to March 1984 It was released in August 1984 and reached number 100 on the Billboard 200 [28] A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors' items Mustaine received writing credit for \"Ride the Lightning\" and \"The Call of Ktulu\" [27]\n\n\n1986–1994: Newsted joins, ...And Justice for All and Metallica\nBurton's death left Metallica's future in doubt The three remaining members decided Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings, the band sought a replacement [35] Roughly 40 people – including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus; Troy Gregory of Prong; and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam – auditioned for the band to fill Burton's spot Newsted learned Metallica's entire setlist; after the audition, Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco Hetfield, Ulrich and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; his first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi [35] The band finished its tour in February 1987.\n\n\n1994–2001: Load, Reload, Napster controversy and Newsted's departure\nAfter almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, which comprised three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy? and Corrosion of Conformity The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996 Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number one album [28] The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass [55] The release marked another change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the band members' hair was cut While Load was a commercial success, the band's change in style had polarized their fanbase [56] Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996 [57] [58]\n\n\n2001–2006: Some Kind of Monster, St. Anger, and Trujillo joins\nIn April 2001, filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky began following Metallica to document the recording process of the band's next studio album Over two years they recorded more than 1,000 hours of footage On July 19, 2001, before preparations to enter the recording studio, Hetfield entered rehab to treat his \"alcoholism and other addictions\" All recording plans were put on hold and the band's future was in doubt [70] Hetfield left rehab on December 4, 2001, [70] and the band returned to the recording studio on April 12, 2002 Hetfield was required to limit his work to four hours a day between noon and 4 pm, and to spend the rest of his time with his family [59] The footage recorded by Berlinger and Sinofsky was compiled into the documentary Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004 In the documentary, Newsted said his former bandmates' decision to hire a therapist to help solve their problems which he felt they could have solved on their own was \"really fucking lame and weak\" [59]\n\n\n2006–2013: Death Magnetic and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction\nIn February 2006, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing the band's next studio album Instead, the band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin [80] Around the same time, a petition signed by 1,500 fans was posted online in an attempt to encourage the band to prohibit Rock from producing Metallica albums, saying he had too much influence on the band's sound and musical direction Rock said the petition hurt his children's feelings; he said, \"sometimes, even with a great coach, a team keeps losing You have to get new blood in there.\" [81]\n\n\n2013–2019: Metallica: Through the Never and Hardwired... to Self-Destruct\nIn an interview with Classic Rock on January 8, 2013, Ulrich said regarding the band's upcoming album, \"What we're doing now certainly sounds like a continuation  [of Death Magnetic]\" He also said, \"I love Rick  [Rubin] We all love Rick We're in touch with Rick constantly We'll see where it goes It would stun me if the record came out in 2013.\" [142] Also in 2013, the band starred in a 3D concert film titled Metallica: Through the Never, which was directed by Antal Nimród and was released in IMAX theaters on September 27 [143]\n\n\n2019–2023: S&M2 and 72 Seasons\nIn an interview with Australian magazine The Music's official podcast in March 2019, Trujillo said that Metallica had begun jamming on new material for its next studio album \"I'm excited about the next record because I believe it will also be a culmination of the two  [previous] records and another journey There's no shortage of original ideas, that's the beauty of being in this band.\" He estimated that the album would be released \"a lot sooner than the previous two did.. this time around I think we'll be able to jump on it a lot quicker and jump in the studio and start working We've all vowed to get this one going sooner than later.\" [173] In an interview with Australian magazine Mixdown the following month, Hammett said that the band had tentative plans to enter the studio after the conclusion of its WorldWired Tour He stated, \"We're in our third year since Hardwired Maybe we can get a bit more focus and go into the studio a bit sooner.\" After not contributing any writing to Hardwired.. to Self-Destruct, Hammett said regarding his ideas for the new album, \"I have a ton of material I've over-compensated, so I'm ready to go anytime.\" [174]\n\n\n2023–present: Future plans\nIn an interview on Loudwire Nights radio program in April 2023, Ulrich stated that \"there  [were] some ideas  [Metallica] could start with\" for the follow-up to 72 Seasons, adding, \"I'm looking forward to going live and being in sharing mode for the next couple of years The beauty of being with these guys, I kind of joke, James writes more riffs when he's tuning his guitar than most people do in a lifetime That's the beauty of being in band with these guys and I'm eternally grateful I'm dumbfounded by it.\" When asked about \"leftovers\" that could be used for the next Metallica album, Ulrich said, \"There's always a few riffs in the riff tank.\" [217] In May 2024, Hetfield confirmed that he has been \"writing lots of music, playing guitar pretty much every day.\" [218]\n\n\nStyle and lyrical themes\nMetallica played thrash [222] and speed metal [224] on their first four albums before changing their sound to traditional heavy metal [227] on 1991's Black Album Load and Reload, released in 1996 and 1997 respectively, saw the band move towards hard rock [228] 2008's Death Magnetic saw them returning to a more thrash-influenced sound [229]\n\n\nAll Within My Hands Foundation\nIn February 2017, Metallica launched All Within My Hands Foundation, \"dedicated to creating sustainable communities by supporting workforce education, the fight against hunger, and other critical local services\" For example, the group works with various selected charities to organize volunteer projects at food banks It also works with workforce training institutions on its Metallica Scholars grant program to help chosen students learn new trade skills [248] The Foundation has also donated and further raised funds for World Central Kitchen's Ukraine war relief efforts [249] [250] and granted $200,000 for relief efforts after the destructive August 2023 Maui, Hawaii fire [251] The band has also performed fundraising concerts for the Foundation [252]\n\n\nLegacy and influence\nMetallica has become one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time and is credited as one of the \"big four\" of thrash metal, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth [253] The band has sold more than 125 million records worldwide, [3] including an RIAA-certified 66 million and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 58 million in the US, making Metallica one of the most commercially successful bands of all time [254] [255] The writers of The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll said Metallica gave heavy metal \"a much-needed charge\" [256] Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica \"expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions\", and called the band \"easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth\" [257]\n\n\nFeuds\nFormer lead guitarist and Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine has been involved in a historic feud with Metallica During his time as a founding member during the first two years of the band, Mustaine's tenure was marred by his alcoholism and even a physical altercation with James Hetfield [290] Mustaine continued to make numerous inflammatory statements against his former band in the press due to buried tension primarily stemming from his firing in 1983 among other issues such as existing songwriting credits across Metallica's first three albums [291] [292] By the late 1980s, it was believed that the feud had largely subsided; later confirmed after Megadeth were hired to open for Metallica on numerous European dates in 1993 [293] Despite this, Mustaine expressed his

represent the full extent of what happened during the meeting [295] The two bands would again find themselves on friendlier terms in 2011 when they took part in the lauded 'Big 4 Tour', alongside Slayer and Anthrax [296] That same year, Mustaine took part in Metallica's exclusive 30th anniversary show in San Francisco which invited other former members: Ron McGovney, Lloyd Grant, and Jason Newsted [297]\n\n\nDave Mustaine/Megadeth\nFormer lead guitarist and Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine has been involved in a historic feud with Metallica During his time as a founding member during the first two years of the band, Mustaine's tenure was marred by his alcoholism and even a physical altercation with James Hetfield [290] Mustaine continued to make numerous inflammatory statements

McGovney, Lloyd Grant, and Jason Newsted [297]\n\n\nMötley Crüe\nOften clashing during the early 1980s, both bands were fighting for dominance in the Los Angeles rock scene during Metallica's early years prior to their relocation to the Bay Area Both James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich expressed their hatred of the hair metal scene in Los Angeles during the time and frequently attacked multiple up-and-coming local bands in multiple interviews, including Mötley Crüe [298] Ulrich and Mötley Crüe's bassist Nikki Sixx had allegedly been involved in a spat prior to a show at the Troubadour in Hollywood in 1982 Though despite their public disdain for glam metal, Metallica were impressed by the production and commercial success of Dr Feelgood in 1989, later hiring the album's producer Bob Rock to produce their self-titled fifth album in 1991 Several years later; both Sixx and Ulrich would reignite the feud after Ulrich accused Mötley Crüe of performing to a backing track at the 1997 American Music Awards Sixx responded via an online forum in which he insulted numerous band members and also attacked Metallica's then-recent album Load [299] [300] Despite this, Sixx would praise Metallica's then-latest album St Anger during a 2003 interview, contrary to the negative attention it received upon release [301] In 2006, both Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, and former bassist Jason Newsted took part in a reality show entitled Rock Star: Supernova as they would both participate in creating a supergroup while the show's premise revolved around finding a frontman via contest During a 2011 meet-and-greet in Mexico City, Hetfield was approached by a fan attacking Mötley Crüe due to their public image and frequent appearances in tabloids Hetfield refused to directly respond to the fan's comments towards Mötley Crüe but laughed in his insults toward the band [302] In 2015, drummer Lee reignited the feud when he tweeted a picture of Ulrich with the words \"Straight Outta Tempo\" superimposed over his face Following the post by Lee, Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil had stated online that he was unaware of the feud with Metallica; however, during a later interview with an Oregon radio show, Neil was again asked about the band's current relationship with Metallica and hung up on the show's host [303] Things were alleged to have calmed down by 2017, when Hetfield appeared on Sixx's radio show 'Sixx Sense' [304] During an interview in 2021, Sixx applauded Metallica's longevity and praised several of their releases during an interview [305]\n\n\nJason Newsted\nFollowing his hiring in 1986, former bassist Jason Newsted had regularly experienced incidents of hazing and a perceived lack of acceptance from his bandmates despite his strong efforts in a majority of the band's live performances [306] Many fans and outlets cite the band's fourth album's unusual mixing to drown the bass tracks as a possible effort by Hetfield and Ulrich to minimize Newsted's involvement [307] [308] This sentiment was further exacerbated by the fact that Newsted was only given songwriting credits on three songs during his 14-year span in the band which also saw him perform on four studio albums [309] Tensions between Hetfield and Newsted reached a breaking point in 2000 after Hetfield repeatedly blocked Newsted's request to venture into his side project Echobrain [310] [311] Discussions broke down and Newsted abruptly left the band in January 2001 prior to the recording of St Anger [312] Despite Newsted's animosity surrounding his decision, he was later inducted into the hall of fame as a member of the band in 2009 and also appeared at the band's 30th anniversary show in San Francisco in 2011 In August 2021, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the release of the band's self-titled album, Newsted was given a box set of the reissue to open for an unboxing video, which was uploaded to the band's YouTube channel [313] [314]\n\n\nBand members\nCurrent

{"title": "Al-Qaeda", "content": "\nOrganization\nAl-Qaeda only indirectly controls its day-to-day operations Its philosophy calls for the centralization of decision making, while allowing for the decentralization of execution [127] The top leaders of al-Qaeda have defined the organization's ideology and guiding strategy, and they have also articulated simple and easy-to-receive messages At the same time, mid-level organizations were given autonomy, but they had to consult with top management before large-scale attacks and assassinations Top management included the shura council as well as committees on military operations, finance, and information sharing Through the information committees of al-Qaeda, Zawahiri placed special emphasis on communicating with his groups [128] However, after the war on terror, al-Qaeda's leadership has become isolated As a result, the leadership has become decentralized, and the organization has become regionalized into several al-Qaeda groups [129] [130]\n\n\nAffiliates\nAl-Qaeda has the following direct affiliates:\n\n\nLeadership\nOsama bin Laden served as the emir of al-Qaeda from the organization's founding in 1988 until his assassination by US forces on May 1, 2011 [143] Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on August 22, 2011 [144]\n\n\nOsama bin Laden (1988 – May 2011)\nOsama bin Laden served as the emir of al-Qaeda from the organization's founding in 1988 until his assassination by US forces on May 1, 2011 [143] Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on August 22, 2011 [144]\n\n\nAfter May 2011\nAyman al-Zawahiri had been al-Qaeda's deputy emir and assumed the role of emir following bin Laden's death Al-Zawahiri replaced Saif al-Adel, who had served as interim commander [145]\n\n\nAfter Al-Zawahiri (2022 – present)\nAl-Zawahiri was killed on July 31, 2022, in a drone strike in Afghanistan [155] In February 2023, a report from the United Nations, based on member state intelligence, concluded that de facto leadership of al-Qaeda had passed to Saif al-Adel, who was operating out of Iran Adel, a former Egyptian army officer, became a military instructor in al-Qaeda camps in the 1990s and was known for his involvement in the Battle of Mogadishu The report stated that al-Adel's leadership could not officially be declared by al-Qaeda because of \"political sensitivities\" of Afghan government in acknowledging the death of Al-Zawahiri as well as due to \"theological and operational\" challenges posed by the location of al-Adel in Iran [156] [157]\n\n\nCommand structure\nMost of al-Qaeda's top leaders and operational directors were veterans who fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, were the leaders who were considered the operational commanders of the organization [158] Nevertheless, al-Qaeda was not operationally managed by Ayman al-Zawahiri Several operational groups exist, which consult with the leadership in situations where attacks are in preparation [128] \"... Zawahiri does not claim to have direct hierarchical control over al Qaeda's vast, networked structure Al Qaeda's core leadership seeks to centralize the organization's messaging and strategy rather than to manage the daily operations of its franchises But formal affiliates are required to consult with al Qaeda's core leadership before carrying out large-scale attacks.\" Al-Qaeda central (AQC) is a conglomerate of expert committees, each in supervision of distinct tasks and objectives Its membership is mostly composed of Egyptian Islamist leaders who participated in the anti-communist Afghan Jihad Assisting them are hundreds of Islamic field operatives and commanders, based in various regions of the Muslim World The central leadership assumes control of the doctrinal approach and overall propaganda campaign; while the regional commanders were empowered with independence in military strategy and political maneuvering This novel hierarchy made it possible for the organisation to launch wide-range offensives [159]\n\n\nField operatives\nThe number of individuals in the group who have undergone proper military training, and are capable of commanding insurgent forces, is largely unknown Documents captured in the raid on bin Laden's compound in 2011 show that the core al-Qaeda membership in 2002 was 170 [167] In 2006, it was estimated that al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 countries [168] As of 2009 [update], it was believed that no more than 200–300 members were still active commanders [169]\n\n\nInsurgent forces\nAccording to author Robert Cassidy, al-Qaeda maintains two separate forces which are deployed alongside insurgents in Iraq and Pakistan The first, numbering in the tens of thousands, was \"organized, trained, and equipped as insurgent combat forces\" in the Soviet–Afghan war [168] The force was composed primarily of foreign mujahideen from Saudi Arabia and Yemen Many of these fighters went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global jihad Another group, which numbered 10,000 in 2006, live in the West and have received rudimentary combat training [168]\n\n\nFinancing\nAl-Qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks, and very rarely makes wire transfers [175] In the 1990s, financing came partly from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden [176] Other sources of income included the heroin trade and donations from supporters in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Islamic Gulf states [176] A 2009 leaked diplomatic cable stated that \"terrorist funding emanating from Saudi Arabia remains a serious concern.\" [177]\n\n\nAllegations of Qatari support\nSeveral Qatari citizens have been accused of funding al-Qaeda This includes Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi, a Qatari citizen and a human-rights activist who founded the Swiss-based non-governmental organization (NGO) Alkarama On December 18, 2013, the US Treasury designated Nuaimi as a terrorist for his activities supporting al-Qaeda [181] The US Treasury has said Nuaimi \"has facilitated significant financial support to al-Qaeda in Iraq, and served as an interlocutor between al-Qaeda in Iraq and Qatar-based donors\" [181]\n\n\nStrategy\nIn the disagreement over whether al-Qaeda's objectives are religious or political, Mark Sedgwick describes al-Qaeda's strategy as political in the immediate term but with ultimate aims that are religious [192]\nOn March 11, 2005, Al-Quds Al-Arabi published extracts from Saif al-Adel's document \"Al Qaeda's Strategy to the Year 2020\" [10] [193] Abdel Bari Atwan summarizes this strategy as comprising five stages to rid the Ummah from all forms of oppression:\n\n\nName\nThe English name of the organization is a simplified transliteration of the Arabic noun al-qāʿidah (‏القاعدة‎), which means \"the foundation\" or \"the base\" The initial al- is the Arabic definite article \"the\", hence \"the base\" [196] In Arabic, al-Qaeda has four syllables (/alˈqaː.ʕi.da/) However, since two of the Arabic consonants in the name are not phones found in the English language, the common naturalized English pronunciations include /ælˈkaɪdə/, /ælˈkeɪdə/ and /ˌælkɑːˈiːdə/ Al-Qaeda's name can also be transliterated as al-Qaida, al-Qa'ida, or el-Qaida [197]\n\n\nIdeology\nPolitical\n\n\nFormation\n\nThe Afghan jihad against the pro-Soviet government further developed the Salafist Jihadist movement which inspired al-Qaeda [215] During this period, al-Qaeda embraced the ideals of the Indian Muslim militant revivalist Syed Ahmad Barelvi (d 1831) who led a Jihad movement against British India from the frontiers of Afghanistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkwa in the early 19th century Al-Qaeda readily adopted Sayyid Ahmad's doctrines such as returning to the purity of early generations (Salaf as-Salih), antipathy towards Western influences and restoration of Islamic political power [216] [217] According to Pakistani journalist Hussain Haqqani, \n\nObjectives\nThe long-term objective of al-Qaeda is to unite the Muslim World under a supra-national Islamic state known as the Khilafah (Caliphate), headed by an elected Caliph descended from the Ahl al-Bayt (Muhammad's family) The immediate objectives include the expulsion of American troops from the Arabian Peninsula, waging armed Jihad to topple US-allied governments in the region, etc [218] [219]\n\n\nTheory of Islamic State\nAl-Qaeda aims to establish an Islamic state in the Arab World, modelled after the Rashidun Caliphate, by initiating a global Jihad against the \"International Jewish-Crusader Alliance\" led by the United States, which it sees as the \"external enemy\" and against the secular governments in Muslim countries, that are described as \"the apostate domestic enemy\" [221] Once foreign influences and the secular ruling authorities are removed from Muslim countries through Jihad; al-Qaeda supports elections to choose the rulers of its proposed Islamic states This is to be done through representatives of leadership councils (Shura) that would ensure the implementation of Shari'a (Islamic law) However, it opposes elections that institute parliaments which empower Muslim and non-Muslim legislators to collaborate in making laws of their own choosing [221] In the second edition of his book Knights Under the Banner of the Prophet, Ayman Al Zawahiri writes:\n\n\nGrievances\nA recurring theme in al-Qaeda's ideology is the perpetual grievance over the violent subjugation of Islamic dissidents by the authoritarian, secularist regimes allied to the West Al-Qaeda denounces these post-colonial governments as a system led by Westernised elites designed to advance neo-colonialism and maintain Western hegemony over the Muslim World The most prominent topic of grievance is over the American foreign policy in the Arab World; especially over its strong economic and military support to Israel Other concerns of resentment include presence of NATO troops to support allied regimes; injustices committed against Muslims in Kashmir, Chechnya, Xinjiang, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq etc [222]\n\n\nReligious compatibility\nAbdel Bari Atwan wrote that:\n\n\nAttacks on civilians\nUnder the leadership of Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda organization adopted the strategy of targeting non-combatant civilians of enemy states that indiscriminately attacked Muslims Following the September 11 attacks, al-Qaeda provided a justification for the killing of non-combatants/civilians, entitled, \"A Statement from Qaidat al-Jihad Regarding the Mandates of the Heroes and the Legality of the Operations in New York and Washington\" According to a couple of critics, Quintan Wiktorowicz and John Kaltner, it provides \"ample theological justification for killing civilians in almost any imaginable situation.\" [225]\n\n\nHistory\nAl-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major attacks, four of them in its jihad against America In each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance, arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities [227]\n\n\nAttacks\nAl-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major attacks, four of them in its jihad against America In each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance, arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities [227]\n\n\n1991\nTo prevent the former Afghan king Mohammed Zahir Shah from coming back from exile and possibly becoming head of a new government, bin Laden instructed a Portuguese convert to Islam, Paulo Jose de Almeida Santos, to assassinate Zahir Shah On November 4, 1991, Santos entered the king's villa in Rome posing as a journalist and tried to stab him with a dagger A tin of cigarillos in the king's breast pocket deflected the blade and saved Zahir Shah's life, although the king was also stabbed several times in the neck and was taken to hospital, later recovering from the attack Santos was apprehended by General Abdul Wali, a former commander of the Royal Afghan Army, and jailed for 10 years in Italy [228] [229]\n\n\n1992\nOn December 29, 1992, al-Qaeda launched the 1992 Yemen hotel bombings Two bombs were detonated in Aden, Yemen The first target was the Movenpick Hotel and the second was the parking lot of the Goldmohur Hotel [230]\n\n\nLate 1990s\nIn 1996, bin Laden personally engineered a plot to assassinate United States President Bill Clinton while the president was in Manila for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation However, intelligence agents intercepted a message before the motorcade was to leave, and alerted the US Secret Service Agents later discovered a bomb planted under a bridge [232]\n\n\nSeptember 11 attacks\nThe September 11 attacks on America by al-Qaeda killed 2,996 people – 2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel as well as 19 hijackers who committed murder-suicide Two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, a third into the Pentagon, and a fourth, originally intended to target either the United States Capitol or the White House, crashed in a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania after passengers revolted It was the deadliest foreign attack on American soil since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and to this day remains the deadliest terrorist attack in human history.\n\n\nDesignation as a terrorist group\nAl-Qaeda is deemed a designated terrorist group by the following countries and international organizations:\n\n\nWar on terror\nIn the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the US government responded, and began to prepare its armed forces to overthrow the Taliban, which it believed was harboring al-Qaeda The US offered Taliban leader Mullah Omar a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were paramilitary officers from the CIA's elite Special Activities Division (SAD).\n\n\nActivities\nAl-Qaeda involvement in Africa has included a number of bombing attacks in North Africa, while supporting parties in civil wars in Eritrea and Somalia From 1991 to 1996, bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan.\n\n\nAfrica\nAl-Qaeda involvement in Africa has included a number of bombing attacks in North Africa, while supporting parties in civil wars in Eritrea and Somalia From 1991 to 1996, bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan.\n\n\nEurope\nPrior to the September 11 attacks, al-Qaeda was present in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and its members were mostly veterans of the El Mudžahid detachment of the Bosnian Muslim Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Three al-Qaeda operatives carried out the Mostar car bombing in 1997 The operatives were closely linked to and financed by the Saudi High Commission for Relief of Bosnia and Herzegovina founded by then-prince King Salman of Saudi Arabia [citation needed]\n\n\nArab world\nFollowing Yemeni unification in 1990, Wahhabi networks began moving missionaries into the country Although it is unlikely bin Laden or Saudi al-Qaeda were directly involved, the personal connections they made would be established over the next decade and used in the USS Cole bombing [308] Concerns grew over al-Qaeda's group in Yemen [309]\n\n\nKashmir\nBin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri consider India to be a part of an alleged Crusader-Zionist-Hindu conspiracy against the Islamic world [320] According to a 2005 report by the Congressional Research Service, bin Laden was involved in training militants for Jihad in Kashmir while living in Sudan in the early 1990s By 2001, Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen had become a part of the al-Qaeda coalition [321] According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), al-Qaeda was thought to have established bases in Pakistan administered Kashmir (in Azad Kashmir, and to some extent in Gilgit–Baltistan) during the 1999 Kargil War and continued to operate there with tacit approval of Pakistan's Intelligence services [322]\n\n\nInternet\nAl-Qaeda and its successors have migrated online to escape detection in an atmosphere of increased international vigilance The group's use of the Internet has grown more sophisticated, with online activities that include financing, recruitment, networking, mobilization, publicity, and information dissemination, gathering and sharing [357]\n\n\nOnline communications\nIn 2007, al-Qaeda released Mujahedeen Secrets, encryption software used for online and cellular communications A later version, Mujahideen Secrets 2, was released in 2008 [364]\n\n\nAviation network\nAl-Qaeda is believed to be operating a clandestine aviation network including \"several Boeing 727 aircraft\", turboprops and executive jets, according to a 2010 Reuters story Based on a US Department of Homeland Security report, the story said al-Qaeda is possibly using aircraft to transport drugs and weapons from South America to various unstable countries in West Africa A Boeing 727 can carry up to ten tons of cargo The drugs eventually are smuggled to Europe for distribution and sale, and the weapons are used in conflicts in Africa and possibly elsewhere Gunmen with links to al-Qaeda have been increasingly kidnapping Europeans for ransom The profits from the drug and weapon sales, and kidnappings can, in turn, fund more militant activities [365]\n\n\nInvolvement in military conflicts\nThe following is a list of military conflicts in which al-Qaeda and its direct affiliates have taken part militarily.\n\n\nBroader influence\nAnders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, was inspired by al-Qaeda, calling it \"the most successful revolutionary movement in the world.\" While admitting different aims, he sought to \"create a European version of Al-Qaida.\" [369] [370]\n\n\nCriticism\nAccording to CNN journalists Peter Bergen and Paul Cruickshank, a number of \"religious scholars, former fighters and militants\" who previously supported Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) had turned against the al-Qaeda-supported Iraqi insurgency in 2008; due to ISI's indiscriminate attacks against civilians while

"en", "article": "# Al-Qaeda\n\nAl-Qaeda is a militant Sunni Islamist extremist organization founded by Osama bin Laden in the late 1980s, with the goal of establishing a global Islamic caliphate. The organization is known for its violent and terrorist tactics, including the September 11 attacks in 2001, which killed nearly 3,000 people.\n\n## Organization\n\nAl-Qaeda operates on a decentralized structure, with a central leadership that sets the overall strategy and goals for the organization. The central leadership, known as the Shura Council, is composed of senior leaders who advise bin Laden and make key decisions for the organization. The Shura Council is responsible for setting the overall direction and strategy for the organization, as well as allocating resources and making key decisions.\n\n## Leadership\n\nOsama bin Laden served as the emir of al-Qaeda from its founding in 1988 until his death in 2011. Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was alleged to be second in command prior to his death in 2011. After bin Laden's death, Ayman al-Zawahiri assumed the role of emir and has been leading the organization since then.\n\n## After May 2011\n\nIn 2011, Ayman al-Zawahiri became the new leader of al-Qaeda after Osama bin Laden's death. Al-Zawahiri replaced Saif al-Adel, who had served as interim commander. Al-Zawahiri has been leading the organization and has continued to promote the goals and ideology of al-Qaeda.\n\n## After Al-Zawahiri (2022 – present)\n\nIn 2022, al-Zawahiri was killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan. In February 2023, a report from the United Nations concluded that de facto leadership of al-Qaeda had passed to Saif al-Adel, who was operating out of Iran. Adel, a former Egyptian army officer, became a military instructor in al-Qaeda camps in the 1990s and was known for his involvement in the Battle of Mogadishu.\n\n## Command Structure\n\nMost of al-Qaeda's top leaders and operational directors were veterans who fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, were the leaders who were considered the operational commanders of the organization. Al-Qaeda was not operationally managed by Ayman al-Zawahiri, but rather, he served as a central figure who advised and directed the organization's operations.\n\n## Field Operatives\n\nThe number of individuals in the group who have undergone proper military training, and are capable of commanding insurgent forces, is largely unknown. Documents captured in the raid on bin Laden's compound in 2011 show that the core al-Qaeda membership in 2002 was 170. In 2006, it was estimated that al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 countries. As of 2009, it was believed that no more than 200-300 members were still active commanders.\n\n## Insurgent Forces\n\nAl-Qaeda maintains two separate forces which are deployed alongside insurgents in Iraq and Pakistan. The first, numbering in the tens of thousands, was \"organized, trained, and equipped as insurgent combat forces\" in the Soviet-Afghan war. The force was composed primarily of foreign mujahideen from Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Many of these fighters went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global jihad.\n\n## Financing\n\nAl-Qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks, and very rarely makes wire transfers. In the 1990s, financing came partly from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden. Other sources of income included the heroin trade and donations from supporters in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and other Islamic Gulf states.\n\n## Allegations of Qatari Support\n\nSeveral Qatari citizens have been accused of funding al-Qaeda. This includes Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi, a Qatari citizen and a human-rights activist who founded the Swiss-based non-governmental organization (NGO) Alkarama. On December 18, 2013, the US Treasury designated Nuaimi as a terrorist for his activities supporting al-Qaeda.\n\n## Strategy\n\nIn the disagreement over whether al-Qaeda's objectives are religious or political, Mark Sedgwick describes al-Qaeda's strategy as political in the immediate term but with ultimate aims that are religious. The organization's strategy is focused on establishing a global Islamic caliphate and removing Western influences from Muslim countries.\n\n## Name\n\nThe English name of the organization is a simplified transliteration of the Arabic noun al-qāʿidah (‏القاعدة‎), which means \"the foundation\" or \"the base.\" The initial al- is the Arabic definite article \"the,\" hence \"the base.\"\n\n## Ideology\n\nAl-Qaeda's ideology is based on the principles of Salafism and Wahhabism. The organization believes in the establishment of a global Islamic caliphate and the removal of Western influences from Muslim countries. Al-Qaeda's ideology is based on the idea that Muslims are obligated to defend their faith and territory against non-Muslims.\n\n## Formation\n\nThe Afghan jihad against the pro-Soviet government further developed the Salafist Jihadist movement which inspired al-Qaeda. During this period, al-Qaeda embraced the ideals of the Indian Muslim militant revivalist Syed Ahmad Barelvi (d 1831) who led a Jihad movement against British India from the frontiers of Afghanistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkwa in the early 19th century.\n\n## Objectives\n\nThe long-term objective of al-Qaeda is to unite the Muslim World under a supra-national Islamic state known as the Khilafah (Caliphate), headed by an elected Caliph descended from the Ahl al-Bayt (Muhammad's family). The immediate objectives include the expulsion of American troops from the Arabian Peninsula, waging armed Jihad to topple US-allied governments in the region, and establishing an Islamic state in the Arab World.\n\n## Theory of Islamic State\n\nAl-Qaeda aims to establish an Islamic state in the Arab World, mode", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Al-Qaeda\" following this outline:\n\n\nOrganization\nAl-Qaeda only indirectly controls its day-to-day operations Its philosophy calls for the centralization of decision making, while allowing for the decentralization of execution [127] The top leaders of al-Qaeda have defined the organization's ideology and guiding strategy, and they have also articulated simple and easy-to-receive messages At the same time, mid-level organizations were given autonomy, but they had to consult with top management before large-scale attacks and assassinations Top management included the shura council as well as committees on military operations, finance, and information sharing Through the information committees of al-Qaeda, Zawahiri placed special emphasis on communicating with his groups [128] However, after the war on terror, al-Qaeda's leadership has become isolated As a result, the leadership has become decentralized, and the organization has become regionalized into several al-Qaeda groups [129] [130]\n\n\nAffiliates\nAl-Qaeda has the following direct affiliates:\n\n\nLeadership\nOsama bin Laden served as the emir of al-Qaeda from the organization's founding in 1988 until his assassination by US forces on May 1, 2011 [143] Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on August 22, 2011 [144]\n\n\nOsama bin Laden (1988 – May 2011)\nOsama bin Laden served as the emir of al-Qaeda from the organization's founding in 1988 until his assassination by US forces on May 1, 2011 [143] Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on August 22, 2011 [144]\n\n\nAfter May 2011\nAyman al-Zawahiri had been al-Qaeda's deputy emir and assumed the role of emir following bin Laden's death Al-Zawahiri replaced Saif al-Adel, who had served as interim commander [145]\n\n\nAfter Al-Zawahiri (2022 – present)\nAl-Zawahiri was killed on July 31, 2022, in a drone strike in Afghanistan [155] In February 2023, a report from the United Nations, based on member state intelligence, concluded that de facto leadership of al-Qaeda had passed to Saif al-Adel, who was operating out of Iran Adel, a former Egyptian army officer, became a military instructor in al-Qaeda camps in the 1990s and was known for his involvement in the Battle of Mogadishu The report stated that al-Adel's leadership could not officially be declared by al-Qaeda because of \"political sensitivities\" of Afghan government in acknowledging the death of Al-Zawahiri as well as due to \"theological and operational\" challenges posed by the location of al-Adel in Iran [156] [157]\n\n\nCommand structure\nMost of al-Qaeda's top leaders and operational directors were veterans who fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, were the leaders who were considered the operational commanders of the organization [158] Nevertheless, al-Qaeda was not operationally managed by Ayman al-Zawahiri Several operational groups exist, which consult with the leadership in situations where attacks are in preparation [128] \"... Zawahiri does not claim to have direct hierarchical control over al Qaeda's vast, networked structure Al Qaeda's core leadership seeks to centralize the organization's messaging and strategy rather than to manage the daily operations of its franchises But formal affiliates are required to consult with al Qaeda's core leadership before carrying out large-scale attacks.\" Al-Qaeda central (AQC) is a conglomerate of expert committees, each in supervision of distinct tasks and objectives Its membership is mostly composed of Egyptian Islamist leaders who participated in the anti-communist Afghan Jihad Assisting them are hundreds of Islamic field operatives and commanders, based in various regions of the Muslim World The central leadership assumes control of the doctrinal approach and overall propaganda campaign; while the regional commanders were empowered with independence in military strategy and political maneuvering This novel hierarchy made it possible for the organisation to launch wide-range offensives [159]\n\n\nField operatives\nThe number of individuals in the group who have undergone proper military training, and are capable of commanding insurgent forces, is largely unknown Documents captured in the raid on bin Laden's compound in 2011 show that the core al-Qaeda membership in 2002 was 170 [167] In 2006, it was estimated that al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 countries [168] As of 2009 [update], it was believed that no more than 200–300 members were still active commanders [169]\n\n\nInsurgent forces\nAccording to author Robert Cassidy, al-Qaeda maintains two separate forces which are deployed alongside insurgents in Iraq and Pakistan The first, numbering in the tens of thousands, was \"organized, trained, and equipped as insurgent combat forces\" in the Soviet–Afghan war [168] The force was composed primarily of foreign mujahideen from Saudi Arabia and Yemen Many of these fighters went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global jihad Another group, which numbered 10,000 in 2006, live in the West and have received rudimentary combat training [168]\n\n\nFinancing\nAl-Qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks, and very rarely makes wire transfers [175] In the 1990s, financing came partly from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden [176] Other sources of income included the heroin trade and donations from supporters in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Islamic Gulf states [176] A 2009 leaked diplomatic cable stated that \"terrorist funding emanating from Saudi Arabia remains a serious concern.\" [177]\n\n\nAllegations of Qatari support\nSeveral Qatari citizens have been accused of funding al-Qaeda This includes Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi, a Qatari citizen and a human-rights activist who founded the Swiss-based non-governmental organization (NGO) Alkarama On December 18, 2013, the US Treasury designated Nuaimi as a terrorist for his activities supporting al-Qaeda [181] The US Treasury has said Nuaimi \"has facilitated significant financial support to al-Qaeda in Iraq, and served as an interlocutor between al-Qaeda in Iraq and Qatar-based donors\" [181]\n\n\nStrategy\nIn the disagreement over whether al-Qaeda's objectives are religious or political, Mark Sedgwick describes al-Qaeda's strategy as political in the immediate term but with ultimate aims that are religious [192]\nOn March 11, 2005, Al-Quds Al-Arabi published extracts from Saif al-Adel's document \"Al Qaeda's Strategy to the Year 2020\" [10] [193] Abdel Bari Atwan summarizes this strategy as comprising five stages to rid the Ummah from all forms of oppression:\n\n\nName\nThe English name of the organization is a simplified transliteration of the Arabic noun al-qāʿidah (‏القاعدة‎), which means \"the foundation\" or \"the base\" The initial al- is the Arabic definite article \"the\", hence \"the base\" [196] In Arabic, al-Qaeda has four syllables (/alˈqaː.ʕi.da/) However, since two of the Arabic consonants in the name are not phones found in the English language, the common naturalized English pronunciations include /ælˈkaɪdə/, /ælˈkeɪdə/ and /ˌælkɑːˈiːdə/ Al-Qaeda's name can also be transliterated as al-Qaida, al-Qa'ida, or el-Qaida [197]\n\n\nIdeology\nPolitical\n\n\nFormation\n\nThe Afghan jihad against the pro-Soviet government further developed the Salafist Jihadist movement which inspired al-Qaeda [215] During this period, al-Qaeda embraced the ideals of the Indian Muslim militant revivalist Syed Ahmad Barelvi (d 1831) who led a Jihad movement against British India from the frontiers of Afghanistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkwa in the early 19th century Al-Qaeda readily adopted Sayyid Ahmad's doctrines such as returning to the purity of early generations (Salaf as-Salih), antipathy towards Western influences and restoration of Islamic political power [216] [217] According to Pakistani journalist Hussain Haqqani, \n\nObjectives\nThe long-term objective of al-Qaeda is to unite the Muslim World under a supra-national Islamic state known as the Khilafah (Caliphate), headed by an elected Caliph descended from the Ahl al-Bayt (Muhammad's family) The immediate objectives include the expulsion of American troops from the Arabian Peninsula, waging armed Jihad to topple US-allied governments in the region, etc [218] [219]\n\n\nTheory of Islamic State\nAl-Qaeda aims to establish an Islamic state in the Arab World, modelled after the Rashidun Caliphate, by initiating a global Jihad against the \"International Jewish-Crusader Alliance\" led by the United States, which it sees as the \"external enemy\" and against the secular governments in Muslim countries, that are described as \"the apostate domestic enemy\" [221] Once foreign influences and the secular ruling authorities are removed from Muslim countries through Jihad; al-Qaeda supports elections to choose the rulers of its proposed Islamic states This is to be done through representatives of leadership councils (Shura) that would ensure the implementation of Shari'a (Islamic law) However, it opposes elections that institute parliaments which empower Muslim and non-Muslim legislators to collaborate in making laws of their own choosing [221] In the second edition of his book Knights Under the Banner of the Prophet, Ayman Al Zawahiri writes:\n\n\nGrievances\nA recurring theme in al-Qaeda's ideology is the perpetual grievance over the violent subjugation of Islamic dissidents by the authoritarian, secularist regimes allied to the West Al-Qaeda denounces these post-colonial governments as a system led by Westernised elites designed to advance neo-colonialism and maintain Western hegemony over the Muslim World The most prominent topic of grievance is over the American foreign policy in the Arab World; especially over its strong economic and military support to Israel Other concerns of resentment include presence of NATO troops to support allied regimes; injustices committed against Muslims in Kashmir, Chechnya, Xinjiang, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq etc [222]\n\n\nReligious compatibility\nAbdel Bari Atwan wrote that:\n\n\nAttacks on civilians\nUnder the leadership of Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda organization adopted the strategy of targeting non-combatant civilians of enemy states that indiscriminately attacked Muslims Following the September 11 attacks, al-Qaeda provided a justification for the killing of non-combatants/civilians, entitled, \"A Statement from Qaidat al-Jihad Regarding the Mandates of the Heroes and the Legality of the Operations in New York and Washington\" According to a couple of critics, Quintan Wiktorowicz and John Kaltner, it provides \"ample theological justification for killing civilians in almost any imaginable situation.\" [225]\n\n\nHistory\nAl-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major attacks, four of them in its jihad against America In each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance, arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities [227]\n\n\nAttacks\nAl-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major attacks, four of them in its jihad against America In each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance, arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities [227]\n\n\n1991\nTo prevent the former Afghan king Mohammed Zahir Shah from coming back from exile and possibly becoming head of a new government, bin Laden instructed a Portuguese convert to Islam, Paulo Jose de Almeida Santos, to assassinate Zahir Shah On November 4, 1991, Santos entered the king's villa in Rome posing as a journalist and tried to stab him with a dagger A tin of cigarillos in the king's breast pocket deflected the blade and saved Zahir Shah's life, although the king was also stabbed several times in the neck and was taken to hospital, later recovering from the attack Santos was apprehended by General Abdul Wali, a former commander of the Royal Afghan Army, and jailed for 10 years in Italy [228] [229]\n\n\n1992\nOn December 29, 1992, al-Qaeda launched the 1992 Yemen hotel bombings Two bombs were detonated in Aden, Yemen The first target was the Movenpick Hotel and the second was the parking lot of the Goldmohur Hotel [230]\n\n\nLate 1990s\nIn 1996, bin Laden personally engineered a plot to assassinate United States President Bill Clinton while the president was in Manila for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation However, intelligence agents intercepted a message before the motorcade was to leave, and alerted the US Secret Service Agents later discovered a bomb planted under a bridge [232]\n\n\nSeptember 11 attacks\nThe September 11 attacks on America by al-Qaeda killed 2,996 people – 2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel as well as 19 hijackers who committed murder-suicide Two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, a third into the Pentagon, and a fourth, originally intended to target either the United States Capitol or the White House, crashed in a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania after passengers revolted It was the deadliest foreign attack on American soil since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and to this day remains the deadliest terrorist attack in human history.\n\n\nDesignation as a terrorist group\nAl-Qaeda is deemed a designated terrorist group by the following countries and international organizations:\n\n\nWar on terror\nIn the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the US government responded, and began to prepare its armed forces to overthrow the Taliban, which it believed was harboring al-Qaeda The US offered Taliban leader Mullah Omar a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were paramilitary officers from the CIA's elite Special Activities Division (SAD).\n\n\nActivities\nAl-Qaeda involvement in Africa has included a number of bombing attacks in North Africa, while supporting parties in civil wars in Eritrea and Somalia From 1991 to 1996, bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan.\n\n\nAfrica\nAl-Qaeda involvement in Africa has included a number of bombing attacks in North Africa, while supporting parties in civil wars in Eritrea and Somalia From 1991 to 1996, bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan.\n\n\nEurope\nPrior to the September 11 attacks, al-Qaeda was present in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and its members were mostly veterans of the El Mudžahid detachment of the Bosnian Muslim Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Three al-Qaeda operatives carried out the Mostar car bombing in 1997 The operatives were closely linked to and financed by the Saudi High Commission for Relief of Bosnia and Herzegovina founded by then-prince King Salman of Saudi Arabia [citation needed]\n\n\nArab world\nFollowing Yemeni unification in 1990, Wahhabi networks began moving missionaries into the country Although it is unlikely bin Laden or Saudi al-Qaeda were directly involved, the personal connections they made would be established over the next decade and used in the USS Cole bombing [308] Concerns grew over al-Qaeda's group in Yemen [309]\n\n\nKashmir\nBin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri consider India to be a part of an alleged Crusader-Zionist-Hindu conspiracy against the Islamic world [320] According to a 2005 report by the Congressional Research Service, bin Laden was involved in training militants for Jihad in Kashmir while living in Sudan in the early 1990s By 2001, Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen had become a part of the al-Qaeda coalition [321] According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), al-Qaeda was thought to have established bases in Pakistan administered Kashmir (in Azad Kashmir, and to some extent in Gilgit–Baltistan) during the 1999 Kargil War and continued to operate there with tacit approval of Pakistan's Intelligence services [322]\n\n\nInternet\nAl-Qaeda and its successors have migrated online to escape detection in an atmosphere of increased international vigilance The group's use of the Internet has grown more sophisticated, with online activities that include financing, recruitment, networking, mobilization, publicity, and information dissemination, gathering and sharing [357]\n\n\nOnline communications\nIn 2007, al-Qaeda released Mujahedeen Secrets, encryption software used for online and cellular communications A later version, Mujahideen Secrets 2, was released in 2008 [364]\n\n\nAviation network\nAl-Qaeda is believed to be operating a clandestine aviation network including \"several Boeing 727 aircraft\", turboprops and executive jets, according to a 2010 Reuters story Based on a US Department of Homeland Security report, the story said al-Qaeda is possibly using aircraft to transport drugs and weapons from South America to various unstable countries in West Africa A Boeing 727 can carry up to ten tons of cargo The drugs eventually are smuggled to Europe for distribution and sale, and the weapons are used in conflicts in Africa and possibly elsewhere Gunmen with links to al-Qaeda have been increasingly kidnapping Europeans for ransom The profits from the drug and weapon sales, and kidnappings can, in turn, fund more militant activities [365]\n\n\nInvolvement in military conflicts\nThe following is a list of military conflicts in which al-Qaeda and its direct affiliates have taken part militarily.\n\n\nBroader influence\nAnders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, was inspired by al-Qaeda, calling it \"the most successful revolutionary movement in the world.\" While admitting different aims, he sought to \"create a European version of Al-Qaida.\" [369] [370]\n\n\nCriticism\nAccording to CNN journalists Peter Bergen and Paul Cruickshank, a number of \"religious scholars, former fighters and militants\" who previously supported Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) had turned against the al-Qaeda-supported Iraqi insurgency in 2008; due to ISI's indiscriminate attacks against civilians while targeting US-led coalition forces American military analyst Bruce Riedel wrote in 2008 that \"a wave of revulsion\" arose against ISI, which enabled US-allied Sons of Iraq faction to turn various tribal leaders in the Anbar region against the Iraqi insurgency In response, Bin Laden and Zawahiri issued public statements urging Muslims to rally behind ISI leadership and support the armed struggle against American forces [372]\n\n\nOther criticisms\nBilal Abdul Kareem, an American journalist based in Syria created a documentary about al-Shabab, al-Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia The documentary included interviews with former members of the group who stated their reasons for leaving al-Shabab The members made accusations of segregation, lack of religious awareness and internal corruption and favoritism In response to Kareem, the Global Islamic Media Front condemned Kareem, called him a liar, and denied the accusations from the former fighters [380]\n\n\nSee

I can't release the date because he wants to surprise people.\" [119] On February 15, during Drake's performance at the NBA All-Star Weekend festivities in New Orleans, Carter appeared as a guest performer before announcing that Tha Carter V would be released on May 5, 2014 [120] [121] In March 2014, Carter again said during an interview at SXSW that Tha Carter V would be his last album [122]\n\n\n2020–present: Funeral and Tha Carter VI\nWhile Carter was working on Tha Carter V, it was announced that his next album would be titled Funeral [156] On January 23, 2020, he revealed the album's release date and album artwork [157] [158] Funeral was released on January 31, and debuted at number one on the U.S Billboard 200, with 139,000 album-equivalent units, becoming his fifth U.S number-one album [159] The album received generally mixed-to-positive reviews from music critics [160] On February 2, 2020, Lil Wayne competed in season three of The Masked Singer after the Super Bowl LIV as \"Robot\" He was the first to be eliminated Carter featured on Lil Baby's track \"Forever\", a track from Baby's second studio album, My Turn, which was released on February 28, 2020 [161] [162] The song's music video was released on March 3, 2020 [163] This marked the second collaboration for the two artists in 2020, with the first being on Carter's single, \"I Do It\" [161]\n\n\nFuture and unreleased projects\nCarter has announced several possible upcoming projects, including a collaborative album entitled I Can't Feel My Face with Harlem-based rapper Juelz Santana, that has been in production for several years [182] [183] In late 2011, it was announced by Mack Maine that Carter and Juelz Santana had gone back to work on their collaborative album I Can't Feel My Face, which had been delayed for a few years due to \"label politics\" [184]\n\n\nArtistry\nLil Wayne has cited rapper Missy Elliott as his biggest musical inspiration, saying \"she's a huge influence of everything I've ever done\" [196] Another one of his major influences is American hip hop group Goodie Mob [197] In an interview with Genius, Lil Wayne said \"I've been listening to Goodie Mob since I was in the 7th grade\" [198] For his MTV Unplugged special, Lil Wayne paid tribute to Tupac by covering his music [199] He also pulled inspiration from Tupac's \"Keep Ya Head Up\" for his 2011 single \"How to Love\" [10]\n\n\nLegacy\nLil Wayne is claimed to be \"one of the most influential artists in the 21st century\" and is many times called as \"the greatest rapper of his generation\", as well as one of the greatest rappers of all time [206] [207] His musical style and usage of autotune influenced modern sound of hip-hop music and its subgenres, especially development of trap [208]\n\n\nPersonal life\nCarter has four children His first child, daughter Reginae, was born November 29, 1998, when he was 16, [231] to his high school sweetheart and later ex-wife Toya Johnson Internet rumors circulated in August 2008 that Carter's daughter had died in an auto accident; he immediately dispelled them [232] His second child, son Dwayne III, was born on October 22, 2008, at The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati [233] to former radio personality Sarah Vivan [234] [235] His third child, son Cameron, [236] was born to actress Lauren London on September 9, 2009 [237] His fourth child, son Neal, was born on November 30, 2009, to singer  Nivea [238]\n\n\nRelationships and children\nCarter has four children His first child, daughter Reginae, was born November 29, 1998, when he was 16, [231] to his high school sweetheart and later ex-wife Toya Johnson Internet rumors circulated in August 2008 that Carter's daughter had died in an auto accident;

you'll have a true problem with me\", referring to the Cash Money-Juvenile/B.G feud [358] [359] One of the reasons 50 Cent stated he was dismissing Young Buck was what he called \"inconsistent behavior\" which included appearing on stage with Carter, then seemingly dissing him on records with G-Unit [360] After he was dismissed, Young Buck appeared in the music video \"My Life\" by The Game, which featured Carter on the song's chorus [361] As of 2009, Young Buck and Carter have squashed their beef and also linked up to record a track \"Up's and Down's\" for Young Buck's Back on My Buck Shit mixtape.\n\n\nPusha T\nTension between Wayne and Pusha T had been going on for years, beginning soon after Clipse and Birdman worked on \"What Happened to That Boy\", the latter's 2002 single In 2006, Wayne felt the Clipse song \"Mr Me Too\" was directed at him which caused more tension between the two [362] In 2012, after much speculation that Pusha T was subliminally dissing Canadian rapper and Wayne's Young Money signee Drake in several songs, the speculation heightened after the release of Pusha T's \"Exodus 23:1\" song Lil Wayne quickly responded on online social networking service Twitter and later released a diss track titled \"Goulish\" In the first verse, Wayne raps \"Fuck Pusha T and anybody that love him / His head up his ass, I'mma have to head-butt him\" [363] Pusha T called Wayne's diss track \"horrible\" and said he felt it did not deserve a response Both men have downplayed the feud, with Wayne saying he's over it [364] [365] However, in November 2012, Pusha T dissed Wayne and Birdman on a new Ludacris song titled \"Tell Me What They Mad For\" [366] In December 2014, once the feud between Lil Wayne and Birdman arose, Pusha T sent out a tweet encouraging Lil Wayne to sign to G.O.O.D Music, which also insulted Birdman for his hand-rubbing habit [367] [non-primary source needed]\n\n\nJay-Z\nIn a 2009 interview with Tropical TV, Birdman disputed the MTV poll that voted Jay-Z \"The Hottest MC in the Game\", stating that Lil Wayne was a better rapper and made more money [368] In early 2011, when Jay-Z and Kanye West's single \"H•A•M\" was released, Jay-Z took shots at Birdman, saying \"Really, you got Baby money\" and \" [you] ain't got my lady's money!\" [369] On August 24, 2011, a song called \"It's Good\" by Lil Wayne (featuring Drake and Jadakiss) was leaked online and included Lil Wayne responding \"Talkin' 'bout baby money?

{"title": "2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami", "content": "\nEarthquake\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was initially documented as having a moment magnitude of 8.8 The United States Geological Survey has its estimate of 9.1 [23] Hiroo Kanamori of the California Institute of Technology estimates that Mw 9.2 is best representative of the earthquake's size [24] However, more recent studies estimate the magnitude to be Mw 9.3 [25] [26] [27] [28] A 2016 study estimated the magnitude to be Mw 9.25, [29] while a 2021 study revised its 2007 estimate of Mw 9.1 to a new magnitude of Mw 9.2 [30]\n\n\nHistorical comparisons\nGreat earthquakes, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, are associated with megathrust events in subduction zones Their seismic moments can account for a significant fraction of the global seismic moment across century-scale periods Of all the moment released by earthquakes in the 100 years from 1906 through 2005, roughly one eighth was due to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake [34] This quake, together with the Great Alaskan earthquake (1964) and the Great Chilean earthquake (1960), account for almost half of the total moment [34] [35]\n\n\nTectonic plates\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was unusually large in geographical and geological extent An estimated 1,600 km (1,000 mi) of fault surface slipped (or ruptured) about 15 m (50 ft) along the subduction zone where the Indian plate slides under (or subducts) the overriding Burma plate The slip did not happen instantaneously but took place in two phases over several minutes: Seismographic and acoustic data indicate that the first phase involved a rupture about 400 km (250 mi) long and 100 km (60 mi) wide, 30 km (19 mi) beneath the sea bed—the largest rupture ever known to have been caused by an earthquake The rupture proceeded at about 2.8 km/s (1.74 mi/s; 10,100 km/h; 6,260 mph), beginning off the coast of Aceh and proceeding north-westerly over about 100 seconds After a pause of about another 100 seconds, the rupture continued northwards towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands The northern rupture occurred more slowly than in the south, at about 2.1 km/s (1.3 mi/s; 7,600 km/h; 4,700 mph), continuing north for another five minutes to a plate boundary where the fault type changes from subduction to strike-slip (the two plates slide past one another in opposite directions).\n\n\nAftershocks and other earthquakes\nNumerous aftershocks were reported off the Andaman Islands, the Nicobar Islands and the region of the original epicentre in the hours and days that followed The magnitude 8.6 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, which originated off the coast of the Sumatran island of Nias, is not considered an aftershock, despite its proximity to the epicentre, and was most likely triggered by stress changes associated with the 2004 event [39] The earthquake produced its own aftershocks (some registering a magnitude of as high as 6.9 [40]) and presently ranks as the third-largest earthquake ever recorded on the moment magnitude or Richter scale.\n\n\nEnergy released\nThe energy released on the Earth's surface (Me, the energy magnitude, which is the seismic potential for damage) by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was estimated at 1.1×1017 joules [48]\n\n\nAssessment of potential earthquakes in the future\nBefore the 2004 quake there were three arguments against a large earthquake occurring in the Sumatra region After the quake it was considered that earthquake hazard risk would need to be reassessed for regions previously thought to have low risk based on these criteria: [58]\n\n\nTsunami\nThe sudden vertical rise of the seabed by several metres during the earthquake displaced massive volumes of water, resulting in a tsunami that struck the coasts of the Indian Ocean A tsunami that causes damage far away from its source is sometimes called a teletsunami and is much more likely to be produced by the vertical motion of the seabed than by horizontal motion [59]\n\n\nEarly signs and warnings\nDespite a delay of up to several hours between the earthquake and the impact of the tsunami, nearly all of the victims were taken by surprise There were no tsunami warning systems in the Indian Ocean to detect tsunamis or to warn the general population living around the ocean [68] Tsunami detection is difficult because while a tsunami is in deep water, it has little height and a network of sensors is needed to detect it.\n\n\nIndonesia\nThe tsunami devastated the coastline of Aceh province, about 20 minutes after the earthquake Banda Aceh, the closest major city, suffered severe casualties The sea receded and exposed the seabed, prompting locals to collect stranded fish and explore the area Local eyewitnesses described three large waves, with the first wave rising gently to the foundation of the buildings, followed minutes later by a sudden withdrawal of the sea near the port of Ulèë Lheue This was succeeded by the appearance of two large black-coloured steep waves which then travelled inland into the capital city as a large turbulent bore Eyewitnesses described the tsunami as a \"black giant\", \"mountain\" and a \"wall of water\" Video footage revealed torrents of black water, surging by windows of a two-story residential area situated about 3.2 km (2.0 mi) inland Additionally, amateur footage recorded in the middle of the city captured an approaching black surge flowing down the city streets, full of debris, inundating them [76]\n\n\nAceh\nThe tsunami devastated the coastline of Aceh province, about 20 minutes after the earthquake Banda Aceh, the closest major city, suffered severe casualties The sea receded and exposed the seabed, prompting locals to collect stranded fish and explore the area Local eyewitnesses described three large waves, with the first wave rising gently to the foundation of the buildings, followed minutes later by a sudden withdrawal of the sea near the port of Ulèë Lheue

amateur footage recorded in the middle of the city captured an approaching black surge flowing down the city streets, full of debris, inundating them [76]\n\n\nSri Lanka\nThe island country of Sri Lanka, located about 1,700 km (1,100 mi) from Sumatra, was ravaged by the tsunami around two hours after the earthquake The tsunami first struck the eastern coastline and subsequently refracted around the southern point of Sri Lanka (Dondra Head) The refracted tsunami waves then inundated the southwestern part of Sri Lanka after some of its energy was reflected from impact with the Maldives [85] In Sri Lanka, the civilian casualties were second only to those in Indonesia, with approximately 35,000 killed The eastern shores of Sri Lanka were the hardest hit since it faced the epicentre of the earthquake, while the southwestern shores were hit later, but the death toll was just as severe The southwestern shores are a hotspot for tourists and fishing [86] The degradation of the natural environment in Sri Lanka contributed to the high death tolls Approximately 90,000 buildings and many wooden houses were destroyed [86]\n\n\nThailand\nThe tsunami travelled eastward through the Andaman Sea and hit the south-western coasts of Thailand, about 2 hours after the earthquake Located about 500 km (310 mi) from the epicentre, at the time, the region was popular with tourists because of Christmas Many of these tourists were caught off-guard by the tsunami, as they had no prior warning The tsunami hit during high tide Major locations damaged included the western shores of Phuket island, the resort town of Khao Lak in Phang Nga Province, the coastal provinces of Krabi, Satun, Ranong and Trang and small offshore islands like Ko Racha Yai, the Phi Phi islands, the Surin Islands and the Similan archipelago Approximately 8,000 people were killed.\n\n\nIndia\nThe tsunami reached the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu along the southeastern coastline of the Indian mainland about two hours after the earthquake At the same time, it arrived in the state of Kerala, on the southwestern coast There were two to five tsunamis that coincided with the local high tide in some areas [92] [93] [94] [95]\n\n\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands\nDue to close proximity to the earthquake, the tsunami took just minutes to devastate the Andaman and Nicobar Islands The Andaman Islands were moderately affected while the island of Little Andaman and the Nicobar Islands were severely affected by the tsunami.\n\n\nMaldives\nThe tsunami severely affected the Maldives at a distance of 2,500 km (1,600 mi) from the epicentre Similar to Sri Lanka, survivors reported three waves with the second wave being the most powerful Being rich in coral reefs, the Maldives provides an opportunity for scientists to assess the impact of a tsunami on coral atolls The significantly lower tsunami impact on the Maldives compared to Sri Lanka is mostly due to the topography and bathymetry of the atoll chain with offshore coral reefs, deep channels separating individual atolls and its arrival within low tide which decreased the power of the tsunami After the tsunami, there was some concern that the country might be submerged entirely and become uninhabitable However, this was proven untrue.\n\n\nMyanmar\nIn Myanmar, the tsunami caused only moderate damage, which arrived between 2 and 5.5 hours after the earthquake Although the country's western Andaman Sea coastline lies at the proximity of the rupture zone, there were smaller tsunamis than the neighbouring Thai coast, because the main tsunami source did not extend to the Andaman Islands Another factor is that some coasts of Taninthayi Division were protected by the Myeik Archipelago Based on scientific surveys from the Irrawaddy Delta through Taninthayi Division, it was revealed that tsunami heights along the Myanmar coast were between 0.4–2.9 m (1 ft 4 in – 9 ft 6 in) Eyewitnesses compared the tsunami with the \"rainy-season high tide\"; although at most locations, the tsunami height was similar or smaller than the \"rainy-season high tide\" level [106]\n\n\nSomalia\nThe tsunami travelled 5,000 km (3,100 mi) west across the open ocean before striking the East African country of Somalia Around 289 fatalities were reported in the Horn of Africa, drowned by four tsunami waves The hardest-hit was a 650 km (400 mi) stretch of coastline between Garacad (Mudug region) and Hafun (Bari region), which forms part of Puntland province Most of the victims were reported along the low-lying Xaafuun Peninsula [107] The Puntland coast in northern Somalia was by far the area hardest hit by the waves to the west of the Indian subcontinent The waves arrived around noon local time [107]\n\n\nOther locations\nThe tsunami also reached Malaysia, mainly on the northern states such as Kedah, Perak and Penang and on offshore islands such as Langkawi island Peninsular Malaysia was shielded by the full force of the tsunami due to the protection offered by the island of Sumatra, which lies just off the western coast [108]\n\n\nImpact\nAccording to the final report of the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition, a total of 227,898 people died [113] Another common total, as given by the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, is 229,866 dead [114] Measured in lives lost, this is one of the ten worst earthquakes in recorded history, as well as the single worst tsunami in history Indonesia was the worst affected area, with most death toll estimates at around 170,000 [115] The death toll for Indonesia alone may be as high as 172,761 lives [116] An initial report by Siti Fadilah Supari, the Indonesian Minister of Health at the time, estimated the death total to be as high as 220,000 in Indonesia alone, giving a total of 280,000 fatalities [117] However, the estimated number of dead and missing in Indonesia were later reduced by over 50,000 In their report, the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition stated, \"It should be remembered that all such data are subject to error, as data on missing persons especially are not always as good as one might wish\" [118] A much higher number of deaths has been suggested for Myanmar based on reports from Thailand [119]\n\n\nCountries affected\nAccording to the final report of the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition, a total of 227,898 people died [113] Another common total, as given by the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, is 229,866 dead [114] Measured in lives lost, this is one of the ten worst earthquakes in recorded history, as well as the single worst tsunami in history Indonesia was the worst affected area, with most death toll estimates at around 170,000 [115] The death toll for Indonesia alone may be as high as 172,761 lives [116] An initial report by Siti Fadilah Supari, the Indonesian Minister of Health at the time, estimated the death total to be as high as 220,000 in Indonesia alone, giving a total of 280,000 fatalities [117] However, the estimated number of dead and missing in Indonesia were later reduced by over 50,000 In their report, the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition stated, \"It should be remembered that all such data are subject to error, as data on missing persons especially are not always as good as one might wish\" [118] A much higher number of deaths has been suggested for Myanmar based on reports from Thailand [119]\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\nBeyond the heavy toll on human lives, the Indian Ocean earthquake caused an enormous environmental impact that affected the region for many years Severe damage was inflicted on ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, forests, coastal wetlands, vegetation, sand dunes and rock formations, animal and plant biodiversity and groundwater Also, the spread of solid and liquid waste and industrial chemicals, water pollution and the destruction of sewage collectors and treatment plants threatened the environment even further The environmental impact took a long time and significant resources to assess [141]\n\n\nEconomic impact\nThe level of damage to the economy resulting from the tsunami depends on the scale examined While the overall impact on the national economies was minor, local economies were devastated The two main occupations most affected by the tsunami were fishing and tourism [150] Some economists believe that damage to the affected national economies will be minor because losses in the tourism and fishing industries are a relatively small percentage of the GDP However, others caution that damage to infrastructure is an overriding factor In some areas drinking water supplies and farm fields may have been contaminated for years by saltwater from the ocean [151]\n\n\nHistorical context\nThe last major tsunami in the Indian Ocean was about A.D 1400 [160] [161] In 2008, a team of scientists working on Phra Thong, a barrier island along the hard-hit west coast of Thailand, reported evidence of at least three previous major tsunamis in the preceding 2,800 years, the most recent from about 700 years ago A second team found similar evidence of previous tsunamis in Aceh, a province at the northern tip of Sumatra; radiocarbon dating of bark fragments in the soil below the second sand layer led the scientists to estimate that the most recent predecessor to the 2004 tsunami probably occurred between A.D 1300 and 1450 [162]\n\n\nOther effects\nMany health professionals and aid workers have reported widespread psychological trauma associated with the tsunami [166] Even 14 years afterwards, researchers find HPA axis dysregulation and \"burnout\" in survivors [167] Traditional beliefs in many of the affected regions state that a relative of the family must bury the body of the dead, and in many cases, no body remained to be buried Women in Aceh required a special approach from foreign aid agencies, and continue to have unique needs [citation needed]\n\n\nHumanitarian response\nA great deal of humanitarian aid was needed because of widespread damage to the infrastructure, shortages of food and water, and economic damage Epidemics were of particular concern due to the high population density and tropical climate of the affected areas The main concern of humanitarian and government agencies was to provide sanitation facilities and fresh

"**2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami**\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, also known as the Sumatran earthquake, was a massive undersea earthquake that occurred on December 26, 2004, off the coast of Indonesia. It is considered one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history, causing widespread destruction and loss of life across several countries in Southeast Asia and East Africa.\n\n**Earthquake**\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was initially documented as having a moment magnitude of 8.8. The United States Geological Survey has its estimate of 9.1. Hiroo Kanamori of the California Institute of Technology estimates that Mw 9.2 is best representative of the earthquake's size. However, more recent studies estimate the magnitude to be Mw 9.3. A 2016 study estimated the magnitude to be Mw 9.25, while a 2021 study revised its 2007 estimate of Mw 9.1 to a new magnitude of Mw 9.2.\n\nThe earthquake was a megathrust event, where the Indian plate slides under the overriding Burma plate. An estimated 1,600 km (1,000 mi) of fault surface slipped about 15 m (50 ft) along the subduction zone. The slip did not happen instantaneously but took place in two phases over several minutes. Seismographic and acoustic data indicate that the first phase involved a rupture about 400 km (250 mi) long and 100 km (60 mi) wide, 30 km (19 mi) beneath the sea bed. The rupture proceeded at about 2.8 km/s (1.74 mi/s; 10,100 km/h; 6,260 mph), beginning off the coast of Aceh and proceeding north-westerly over about 100 seconds.\n\n**Aftershocks and Other Earthquakes**\n\nNumerous aftershocks were reported off the Andaman Islands, the Nicobar Islands, and the region of the original epicentre in the hours and days that followed. The magnitude 8.6 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, which originated off the coast of the Sumatran island of Nias, is not considered an aftershock, despite its proximity to the epicentre, and was most likely triggered by stress changes associated with the 2004 event. The earthquake produced its own aftershocks (some registering a magnitude of as high as 6.9) and presently ranks as the third-largest earthquake ever recorded on the moment magnitude or Richter scale.\n\n**Energy Released**\n\nThe energy released on the Earth's surface (Me, the energy magnitude, which is the seismic potential for damage) by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was estimated at 1.1×1017 joules.\n\n**Tsunami**\n\nThe sudden vertical rise of the seabed by several metres during the earthquake displaced massive volumes of water, resulting in a tsunami that struck the coasts of the Indian Ocean. A tsunami that causes damage far away from its source is sometimes called a teletsunami and is much more likely to be produced by the vertical motion of the seabed than by horizontal motion.\n\n**Early Signs and Warnings**\n\nDespite a delay of up to several hours between the earthquake and the impact of the tsunami, nearly all of the victims were taken by surprise. There were no tsunami warning systems in the Indian Ocean to detect tsunamis or to warn the general population living around the ocean. Tsunami detection is difficult because while a tsunami is in deep water, it has little height and a network of sensors is needed to detect it.\n\n**Countries Affected**\n\nThe countries most affected by the tsunami were Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, and Myanmar. Indonesia was the worst affected area, with most death toll estimates at around 170,000. The death toll for Indonesia alone may be as high as 172,761 lives. An initial report by Siti Fadilah Supari, the Indonesian Minister of Health at the time, estimated the death total to be as high as 220,000 in Indonesia alone, giving a total of 280,000 fatalities.\n\n**Environmental Impact**\n\nBeyond the heavy toll on human lives, the Indian Ocean earthquake caused an enormous environmental impact that affected the region for many years. Severe damage was inflicted on ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, forests, coastal wetlands, vegetation, sand dunes, and rock formations, animal and plant biodiversity, and groundwater. Also, the spread of solid and liquid waste and industrial chemicals, water pollution, and the destruction of sewage collectors and treatment plants threatened the environment even further.\n\n**Economic Impact**\n\nThe level of damage to the economy resulting from the tsunami depends on the scale examined. While the overall impact on the national economies was minor, local economies were devastated. The two main occupations most affected by the tsunami were fishing and tourism. Some economists believe that damage to the affected national economies will be minor because losses in the tourism and fishing industries are a relatively small percentage of the GDP. However, others caution that damage to infrastructure is an overriding factor.\n\n**Historical Context**\n\nThe last major tsunami in the Indian Ocean was about A.D 1400. In 2008, a team of scientists working on Phra Thong, a barrier island along the hard-hit west coast of Thailand, reported evidence of at least three previous major tsunamis in the preceding 2,800 years, the most recent from about 700 years ago. A second team found similar evidence of previous tsunamis in Aceh, a province at the northern tip of Sumatra; radiocarbon dating of bark fragments in the soil below the second sand layer led the scientists to estimate that the most recent predecessor to the 2004 tsunami probably occurred between A.D 1300 and 1450.\n\n**Other Effects**\n\nMany health professionals and aid workers have reported widespread psychological trauma associated with the tsunami. Even 14 years afterwards, researchers find HPA axis dysregulation and \"burnout\" in survivors. Traditional beliefs in many of the affected regions state that a relative of the family must bury the body of the dead, and in many cases, no body remained to be buried. Women in Aceh required a special approach from foreign aid agencies, and continue to have unique needs.\n\n**Humanitarian Response**\n\nA great deal of humanitarian aid was needed because of widespread damage to the infrastructure, shortages of food and water, and economic damage. Epidemics were of particular concern due to the high population density and tropical climate of the affected areas. The main concern of humanitarian and government agencies was to provide sanitation facilities and fresh drinking water to contain the spread of diseases such as cholera, diphtheria, dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and hepatitis B.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nThe 2004 disaster prompted the creation of the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarthquake\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was initially documented as having a moment magnitude of 8.8 The United States Geological Survey has its estimate of 9.1 [23] Hiroo Kanamori of the California Institute of Technology estimates that Mw 9.2 is best representative of the earthquake's size [24] However, more recent studies estimate the magnitude to be Mw 9.3 [25] [26] [27] [28] A 2016 study estimated the magnitude to be Mw 9.25, [29] while a 2021 study revised its 2007 estimate of Mw 9.1 to a new magnitude of Mw 9.2 [30]\n\n\nHistorical comparisons\nGreat earthquakes, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, are associated with megathrust events in subduction zones Their seismic moments can account for a significant fraction of the global seismic moment across century-scale periods Of all the moment released by earthquakes in the 100 years from 1906 through 2005, roughly one eighth was due to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake [34] This quake, together with the Great Alaskan earthquake (1964) and the Great Chilean earthquake (1960), account for almost half of the total moment [34] [35]\n\n\nTectonic plates\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was unusually large in geographical and geological extent An estimated 1,600 km (1,000 mi) of fault surface slipped (or ruptured) about 15 m (50 ft) along the subduction zone where the Indian plate slides under (or subducts) the overriding Burma plate The slip did not happen instantaneously but took place in two phases over several minutes: Seismographic and acoustic data indicate that the first phase involved a rupture about 400 km (250 mi) long and 100 km (60 mi) wide, 30 km (19 mi) beneath the sea bed—the largest rupture ever known to have been caused by an earthquake The rupture proceeded at about 2.8 km/s (1.74 mi/s; 10,100 km/h; 6,260 mph), beginning off the coast of Aceh and proceeding north-westerly over about 100 seconds After a pause of about another 100 seconds, the rupture continued northwards towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands The northern rupture occurred more slowly than in the south, at about 2.1 km/s (1.3 mi/s; 7,600 km/h; 4,700 mph), continuing north for another five minutes to a plate boundary where the fault type changes from subduction to strike-slip (the two plates slide past one another in opposite directions).\n\n\nAftershocks and other earthquakes\nNumerous aftershocks were reported off the Andaman Islands, the Nicobar Islands and the region of the original epicentre in the hours and days that followed The magnitude 8.6 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, which originated off the coast of the Sumatran island of Nias, is not considered an aftershock, despite its proximity to the epicentre, and was most likely triggered by stress changes associated with the 2004 event [39] The earthquake produced its own aftershocks (some registering a magnitude of as high as 6.9 [40]) and presently ranks as the third-largest earthquake ever recorded on the moment magnitude or Richter scale.\n\n\nEnergy released\nThe energy released on the Earth's surface (Me, the energy magnitude, which is the seismic potential for damage) by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was estimated at 1.1×1017 joules [48]\n\n\nAssessment of potential earthquakes in the future\nBefore the 2004 quake there were three arguments against a large earthquake occurring in the Sumatra region After the quake it was considered that earthquake hazard risk would need to be reassessed for regions previously thought to have low risk based on these criteria: [58]\n\n\nTsunami\nThe sudden vertical rise of the seabed by several metres during the earthquake displaced massive volumes of water, resulting in a tsunami that struck the coasts of the Indian Ocean A tsunami that causes damage far away from its source is sometimes called a teletsunami and is much more likely to be produced by the vertical motion of the seabed than by horizontal motion [59]\n\n\nEarly signs and warnings\nDespite a delay of up to several hours between the earthquake and the impact of the tsunami, nearly all of the victims were taken by surprise There were no tsunami warning systems in the Indian Ocean to detect tsunamis or to warn the general population living around the ocean [68] Tsunami detection is difficult because while a tsunami is in deep water, it has little height and a network of sensors is needed to detect it.\n\n\nIndonesia\nThe tsunami devastated the coastline of Aceh province, about 20 minutes after the earthquake Banda Aceh, the closest major city, suffered severe casualties The sea receded and exposed the seabed, prompting locals to collect stranded fish and explore the area Local eyewitnesses described three large waves, with the first wave rising gently to the foundation of the buildings, followed minutes later by a sudden withdrawal of the sea near the port of Ulèë Lheue This was succeeded by the appearance of two large black-coloured steep waves which then travelled inland into the capital city as a large turbulent bore Eyewitnesses described the tsunami as a \"black giant\", \"mountain\" and a \"wall of water\" Video footage revealed torrents of black water, surging by windows of a two-story residential area situated about 3.2 km (2.0 mi) inland Additionally, amateur footage recorded in the middle of the city captured an approaching black surge flowing down the city streets, full of debris, inundating them [76]\n\n\nAceh\nThe tsunami devastated the coastline of

inland Additionally, amateur footage recorded in the middle of the city captured an approaching black surge flowing down the city streets, full of debris, inundating them [76]\n\n\nSri Lanka\nThe island country of Sri Lanka, located about 1,700 km (1,100 mi) from Sumatra, was ravaged by the tsunami around two hours after the earthquake The tsunami first struck the eastern coastline and subsequently refracted around the southern point of Sri Lanka (Dondra Head) The refracted tsunami waves then inundated the southwestern part of Sri Lanka after some of its energy was reflected from impact with the Maldives [85] In Sri Lanka, the civilian casualties were second only to those in Indonesia, with approximately 35,000 killed The eastern shores of Sri Lanka were the hardest hit since it faced the epicentre of the earthquake, while the southwestern shores were hit later, but the death toll was just as severe The southwestern shores are a hotspot for tourists and fishing [86] The degradation of the natural environment in Sri Lanka contributed to the high death tolls Approximately 90,000 buildings and many wooden houses were destroyed [86]\n\n\nThailand\nThe tsunami travelled eastward through the Andaman Sea and hit the south-western coasts of Thailand, about 2 hours after the earthquake Located about 500 km (310 mi) from the epicentre, at the time, the region was popular with tourists because of Christmas Many of these tourists were caught off-guard by the tsunami, as they had no prior warning The tsunami hit during high tide Major locations damaged included the western shores of Phuket island, the resort town of Khao Lak in Phang Nga Province, the coastal provinces of Krabi, Satun, Ranong and Trang and small offshore islands like Ko Racha Yai, the Phi Phi islands, the Surin Islands and the Similan archipelago Approximately 8,000 people were killed.\n\n\nIndia\nThe tsunami reached the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu along the southeastern coastline of the Indian mainland about two hours after the earthquake At the same time, it arrived in the state of Kerala, on the southwestern coast There were two to five tsunamis that coincided with the local high tide in some areas [92] [93] [94] [95]\n\n\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands\nDue to close proximity to the earthquake, the tsunami took just minutes to devastate the Andaman and Nicobar Islands The Andaman Islands were moderately affected while the island of Little Andaman and the Nicobar Islands were severely affected by the tsunami.\n\n\nMaldives\nThe tsunami severely affected the Maldives at a distance of 2,500 km (1,600 mi) from the epicentre Similar to Sri Lanka, survivors reported three waves with the second wave being the most powerful Being rich in coral reefs, the Maldives provides an opportunity for scientists to assess the impact of a tsunami on coral atolls The significantly lower tsunami impact on the Maldives compared to Sri Lanka is mostly due to the topography and bathymetry of the atoll chain with offshore coral reefs, deep channels separating individual atolls and its arrival within low tide which decreased the power of the tsunami After the tsunami, there was some concern that the country might be submerged entirely and become uninhabitable However, this was proven untrue.\n\n\nMyanmar\nIn Myanmar, the tsunami caused only moderate damage, which arrived between 2 and 5.5 hours after the earthquake Although the country's western Andaman Sea coastline lies at the proximity of the rupture zone, there were smaller tsunamis than the neighbouring Thai coast, because the main tsunami source did not extend to the Andaman Islands Another factor is that some coasts of Taninthayi Division were protected by the Myeik Archipelago Based on scientific surveys from the Irrawaddy Delta through Taninthayi Division, it was revealed that tsunami heights along the Myanmar coast were between 0.4–2.9 m (1 ft 4 in – 9 ft 6 in) Eyewitnesses compared the tsunami with the \"rainy-season high tide\"; although at most locations, the tsunami height was similar or smaller than the \"rainy-season high tide\" level [106]\n\n\nSomalia\nThe tsunami travelled 5,000 km (3,100 mi) west across the open ocean before striking the East African country of Somalia Around 289 fatalities were reported in the Horn of Africa, drowned by four tsunami waves The hardest-hit was a 650 km (400 mi) stretch of coastline between Garacad (Mudug region) and Hafun (Bari region), which forms part of Puntland province Most of the victims were reported along the low-lying Xaafuun Peninsula [107] The Puntland coast in northern Somalia was by far the area hardest hit by the waves to the west of the Indian subcontinent The waves arrived around noon local time [107]\n\n\nOther locations\nThe tsunami also reached Malaysia, mainly on the northern states such as Kedah, Perak and Penang and on offshore islands such as Langkawi island Peninsular Malaysia was shielded by the full force of the tsunami due to the protection offered by the island of Sumatra, which lies just off the western coast [108]\n\n\nImpact\nAccording to the final report of the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition, a total of 227,898 people died [113] Another common total, as given by the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, is 229,866 dead [114] Measured in lives lost, this is one of the ten worst earthquakes in recorded history, as well as the single worst tsunami in history Indonesia was the worst affected area, with most death toll estimates at around 170,000 [115] The death toll for Indonesia alone may be as high as 172,761 lives [116] An initial report by Siti Fadilah Supari, the Indonesian Minister of Health at the time, estimated the death total to be as high as 220,000 in Indonesia alone, giving a total of 280,000 fatalities [117] However, the estimated number of dead and missing in Indonesia were later reduced by over 50,000 In their report, the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition stated, \"It should be remembered that all such data are subject to error, as data on missing persons especially are not always as good as one might wish\" [118] A much higher number of deaths has been suggested for Myanmar based on reports from Thailand [119]\n\n\nCountries affected\nAccording to the final report of the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition, a

Some economists believe that damage to the affected national economies will be minor because losses in the tourism and fishing industries are a relatively small percentage of the GDP However, others caution that damage to infrastructure is an overriding factor In some areas drinking water supplies and farm fields may have been contaminated for years by saltwater from the ocean

became difficult to maintain his 13-year-old prepubescent voice throughout the years of recording [18] He was originally introduced as a test voice for early animatics, but Smith kept him on after being astounded by the emotional range of his performance [19]\n\n\nAnimation\nThe character of Ron was designed to be aesthetically reminiscent of \"stripped-down\" computer software, with the pixelated interfaces of the MS-DOS operating system being a source of inspiration Emphasis was placed on allowing Ron's animated performance to be versatile within the constraints of his design, which demanded precise control over his motion graphics skin that deliver his facial expressions [20] This included allowing his face slide all across his body, such as his eyeballs appearing between his legs when picked up [21] Baynham explained \"he doesn't have a face that you can do all the classic things with, but somehow he does.. like the way his eye might slip a little bit.. that speaks to his simple clownishness.\" [22] Vine referred to Ron's behaviour as being alike to the Clippy personal assistant, describing him \"cheerfully and annoyingly helpful all the time\" [23] Locksmith consulted with the toy designer Sphero to investigate what would be a realistic design for a social media robot [24] Vine said, \"we wanted the movie to feel like it’s set right around now so the bot needs to feel tangible\" [9] Animation director Eric Leighton explained that it was important to track the emotional state of Ron to determine his range of behaviour The scene where Ron physically attacks children is where he is \"the most broken that a robot could possibly be\", and the scene where he is reprogrammed is at his most benign The whole movie was shot out of sequence in favor of doing scenes across his degrees of \"brokenness\" [20] The character design of Barney was distinguished through coordinated color palettes; Barney's clothes are patterned in \"earth tones\" to indicate his love of nature, and his home is vibrant in contrast to the muted colors of other homes in the town he lives in [20]\n\n\nMusical score and soundtrack album\nHenry Jackman composed the film score [32] Speaking about the score, Jackman said that \"it has its own identity, similar to Wreck-It Ralph or Big Hero 6\" having the \"same musical landscape and color in this film\", [33] and also had enjoyed working in the film, calling the scoring sessions as \"enormous fun\" [34] Vine and Smith expressed gratitude to Jackman on how his score elevated the film Smith wanted the score to have a \"contemporary John Hughes feel along with a classic 'high school movie' vibe and the orchestral scale and emotion of E.T on top\" [35] The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and Air Studios in London, England.\n\n\nRelease\nIn October 2017, Ron's Gone Wrong was scheduled for a theatrical release on November 6, 2020 [38] In November 2019, the film was moved to February 26, 2021 [39] In May

made to set it in a United States suburb Locksmith co-founder Julie Lockhart explained, \"From a design perspective, the fact that all the big tech companies are in California made it feel that’s

[10]\n\n\nCasting\nGrazer first began recording lines for the role of Barney in 2017 when he was 13 and did not finalize his role until early 2021 by the time he was 18 Grazer said that it became difficult to maintain his 13-year-old prepubescent voice throughout the years of recording [18] He was originally introduced as a test voice for early animatics, but Smith kept him on after being astounded by the emotional range of his performance [19]\n\n\nAnimation\nThe character of Ron was designed to be aesthetically reminiscent of \"stripped-down\" computer software, with the pixelated interfaces of the MS-DOS operating system being a source of inspiration Emphasis was placed on allowing Ron's animated performance to be versatile within the constraints of his design, which demanded precise control over his motion graphics skin that deliver his facial expressions [20] This included allowing his face slide all across his body, such as his eyeballs appearing between his legs when picked up [21] Baynham explained \"he doesn't have a face that you can do all the classic things with, but somehow he does.. like the way his eye might slip a little bit.. that speaks to his simple clownishness.\" [22] Vine referred to Ron's behaviour as being alike to the Clippy personal assistant, describing him \"cheerfully and annoyingly helpful all the time\" [23] Locksmith consulted with the toy designer Sphero to investigate what would be a realistic design for a social media robot [24] Vine said, \"we wanted the movie to feel like it’s set right around now so the bot needs to feel tangible\" [9] Animation director Eric Leighton explained that it was important to track the emotional state of Ron to determine his range of behaviour The scene where Ron physically attacks children is where he is \"the most broken that a robot could possibly be\", and the scene where he is reprogrammed is at his most benign The whole movie was shot out of sequence in favor of doing scenes across his degrees of \"brokenness\" [20] The character design of Barney was distinguished through coordinated color palettes; Barney's clothes are patterned in \"earth tones\" to indicate his love of nature, and his home is vibrant in contrast to the muted colors of other homes in the town he lives in [20]\n\n\nMusical score and soundtrack album\nHenry Jackman composed the film score [32] Speaking about the score, Jackman said that \"it has its own identity, similar to Wreck-It Ralph or Big Hero 6\" having the \"same musical landscape and color in this film\", [33] and also had enjoyed working in the film, calling the scoring sessions as \"enormous fun\" [34] Vine and Smith expressed gratitude to Jackman on how his score elevated the film Smith wanted the score to have a \"contemporary John Hughes feel along with a classic 'high school movie' vibe and the orchestral scale and emotion of E.T on top\" [35] The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and Air Studios in London, England.\n\n\nRelease\nIn October 2017, Ron's Gone Wrong was scheduled for a theatrical release on November 6, 2020 [38] In November 2019, the film was moved to February 26, 2021 [39] In May 2020, the

There, they meet Ace, a Boxer who tries to escape but is stopped by Krypto.\n\nLater, Superman and Krypto spot their archenemy, LexCorp CEO Lex Luthor, reeling in a meteor strapped with orange kryptonite with a tractor beam, intending to gain superpowers. The two are aided by the Justice League, formed by Superman himself, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, and Aquaman. Together, they thwart Lex's plan and save the day.\n\n**Voice Cast**\n\nThe film features a talented voice cast, including Dwayne Johnson as Krypto, Kevin Hart as Ace, Keanu Reeves as Batman, and Kate McKinnon as Jenny Kowalski, a veterinarian who helps the Justice League. The movie also features the voices of John Krasinski as Superman, Vanessa Bayer as Lois Lane, and Marc Maron as Lex Luthor.\n\n**Production**\n\nIn July 2018, Jared Stern was hired to write and direct an animated film about DC's Legion of Super-Pets. In January 2019, it was announced that Sam J. Levine would serve as co-director with Stern, and that Patty Hicks had signed on as producer. The film was pitched by Stern in 2012, during the early days of the Warner Animation Group.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe film's development began with Stern's pitch for the movie after working in an animal shelter, where he noticed how older animals were less likely to be adopted and wondered \"what if those pets got superpowers?\" Stern was originally unsure what DC characters he was allowed to incorporate in the film, though he added Luthor after the character was suggested by DC. This led to the concept of the villain, Lulu, being a guinea pig, as Stern felt \"guinea pigs are someone who would have a chip on their shoulder\" due to them being used as test subjects, and Lulu being Lex's test subject served as a parallel with Krypto and Superman's relationship.\n\n**Animation**\n\nThe animation was provided by Animal Logic in Sydney and Vancouver, which also provided animation for the Warner Animation Group's The Lego Movie series. Approximately 70 animators worked on the film, and they worked on the film for 2 years, as well as an extra 3-4 months after the film's release date was delayed by a year.\n\n**Music**\n\nThe film's original score was composed by Steve Jablonsky. The film's score album was released on July 29, 2022, by WaterTower Music. The film also features the songs \"Message in a Bottle (Taylor's Version)\" and a re-recording of the song \"Bad Blood\" by Taylor Swift, as well as other songs on the soundtrack, including Queen's \"You're My Best Friend\", Sturgill Simpson's \"Sing Along\", R.E.M.'s cover of \"Superman\", A Tribe Called Quest's “Electric Relaxation”, The Pharcyde’s \"Passin' Me By\", Bill Beach's \"Tudo É Relativo\", Europe’s “The Final Countdown”, Percy Faith & His Orchestra’s “Theme from A Summer Place”, Burt Bacharach’s \"What the World Needs Now Is Love\", The Chemical Brothers’ “Block Rockin’ Beats” and Canned Heat’s “Let's Work Together.”\n\n**Marketing**\n\nOn May 24, 2022, Warner Bros Consumer Products and DC Comics announced the release of merchandise inspired by the film in collaboration with Fisher-Price. The products include apparel, pet accessories, toys, collectibles, costumes, and furniture. McDonald's also announced that their Happy Meals would have toys based on the film.\n\n**Release**\n\nIn January 2019, the film was scheduled to be released on May 21, 2021. The release date was later pushed back to May 20, 2022, in favor of The Matrix Resurrections, another WB film starring Keanu Reeves. It was then pushed back to July 29, 2022, among other films from Warner Bros getting pushed due to production delays. DC League of Super-Pets premiered in Los Angeles on July 13, 2022. This was the final production under the name Warner Animation Group before the studio's rebranding in June 2023.\n\n**Reception**\n\nDC League of Super-Pets grossed $93.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $113.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $207.6 million. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with a 72% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and a 56 out of 100 score on Metacritic. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars.\n\n**Accolades**\n\nIn August 2022, following the positive financial and audience reception, Johnson stated that the film will be the first installment of a new franchise.\n\n**Future**\n\nA video game based on the film titled DC League of Super-Pets: The Adventures of Krypto and Ace was announced during DC FanDome, and was released on July 15, 2022. The game allows players to control Krypto and Ace as they team up to save the world from various villains.\n\n**References**\n\n**External Links**\n\n* DC League of Super-Pets on IMDb\n* DC League of Super-Pets on Rotten Tomatoes\n* DC League of Super-Pets on Metacritic\n* DC League of Super-Pets on Box Office Mojo", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"DC_League_of_Super-Pets\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nSuperman grows up with a Kryptonian Labrador Retriever named Krypto, who goes by the name Bark Kent in everyday life Krypto feels jealous when Superman starts dating Lois Lane, so Superman goes to an animal shelter to find Krypto a friend A Boxer named Ace tries to escape the shelter, but Krypto stops him Later, Superman and Krypto spot their archenemy, LexCorp CEO Lex Luthor, reeling in a meteor strapped with orange kryptonite with a tractor beam, intending to gain superpowers He is easily defeated as the two are aided by the Justice League, formed by Superman himself, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, and Aquaman.\n\n\nVoice cast\nIn July 2018, Jared Stern was hired to write and direct an animated film about DC's Legion of Super-Pets [24] In January 2019, it was announced that Sam J Levine would serve as co-director with Stern, and that Patricia Hicks had signed on as producer [25] The film was pitched by Stern in 2012, during the early days of the Warner Animation Group [26]\n\n\nProduction\nIn July 2018, Jared Stern was hired to write and direct an animated film about DC's Legion of Super-Pets [24] In January 2019, it was announced that Sam J Levine would serve as co-director with Stern, and that Patricia Hicks had signed on as producer [25] The film was pitched by Stern in 2012, during the early days of the Warner Animation Group [26]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn July 2018, Jared Stern was hired to write and direct an animated film about DC's Legion of Super-Pets [24] In January 2019, it was announced that Sam J Levine would serve as co-director with Stern, and that Patricia Hicks had signed on as producer [25] The film was pitched by Stern in 2012, during the early days of the Warner Animation Group [26]\n\n\nWriting\nStern developed a pitch for the film after working in an animal shelter, where he noticed how older animals were less likely to be adopted and wondered \"what if those pets got superpowers?\" [30] Stern was originally unsure what DC characters he was allowed to incorporate in the film, though he added Luthor after the character was suggested by DC This led to the concept of the villain, Lulu, being a guinea pig, as Stern felt \"guinea pigs are someone who would have a chip on their shoulder\" due to them being used as test subjects, and Lulu being Lex's test subject served as a parallel with Krypto and Superman's relationship [26]\n\n\nAnimation\nThe animation was provided by Animal Logic in Sydney and Vancouver, which also provided animation for the Warner Animation Group's The Lego Movie series [31] Approximately 70 animators worked on the film Animators worked on the film for 2 years, as well as an extra 3–4 months after the film's release date was delayed by a year [30]\n\n\nMusic\nThe film's original score was composed by Steve Jablonsky [33] The film's score album was released on July 29, 2022, by WaterTower Music [34] The Taylor Swift songs \"Message in a Bottle (Taylor's Version)\" and a re-recording of the song \"Bad Blood\", \"Bad Blood (Taylor's Version)\", are also featured in the film;

The production, distribution, and possession of child pornography are considered serious crimes in most countries, and laws against it are intended to protect children from exploitation and abuse.\n\n**International Stance**\n\nThe international community has taken steps to address the issue of child pornography through various treaties and agreements. The United Nations, for example, has established Article 34 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which requires signatory countries to take measures to prevent the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.\n\nThe Council of Europe's Cybercrime Convention, adopted in 2001, requires signatory countries to criminalize all aspects of child pornography, including possession, distribution, and production. The Convention also establishes a framework for cooperation and mutual assistance between countries in investigating and prosecuting child pornography cases.\n\nThe International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC), a non-governmental organization based in the United States, has played a key role in raising awareness about the issue of child pornography and advocating for stronger laws and enforcement. ICMEC works closely with governments, law enforcement agencies, and other organizations to develop and implement effective strategies for preventing and combating child pornography.\n\n**Organizations**\n\nIn addition to ICMEC, there are several other organizations that are working to combat child pornography around the world. These include:\n\n* The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), which has a dedicated task force on combating child exploitation and pornography.\n* The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), which provides resources and support to families of missing and exploited children.\n* The Polaris Project, which works to combat human trafficking and exploitation, including child pornography.\n\nThese organizations, along with ICMEC, are working together to raise awareness about the issue of child pornography and to advocate for stronger laws and enforcement.\n\n**Treaties**\n\nThere are several major treaties in place that address the issue of child pornography. These include:\n\n* The Council of Europe's Cybercrime Convention, which requires signatory countries to criminalize all aspects of child pornography.\n* The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which requires signatory countries to take measures to prevent the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.\n* The European Union's Framework Decision on Combating the Sexual Exploitation of Children, which requires EU member states to criminalize the production, distribution, and possession of child pornography.\n\nThese treaties establish a framework for cooperation and mutual assistance between countries in investigating and prosecuting child pornography cases.\n\n**Debate**\n\nDespite the existence of laws and treaties against child pornography, the issue remains the subject of debate and controversy. Some argue that the laws against child pornography are too broad and can be used to criminalize innocent individuals who possess or distribute fictional child pornography. Others argue that the laws are not enforced effectively and that more needs to be done to protect children from exploitation and abuse.\n\n**Status by Country**\n\nThe laws and regulations regarding child pornography vary significantly from country to country. Some countries, such as the United States, have strict laws against child pornography, while others, such as some countries in Africa and Asia, have more lenient laws.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the laws regarding child pornography in various regions:\n\n* **Africa**: Most countries in Africa have laws against child pornography, but the laws are often not enforced effectively. In some countries, such as South Africa, child pornography is a serious crime that can be punished with imprisonment.\n* **Asia**: Many countries in Asia have laws against child pornography, but the laws are often not enforced effectively. In some countries, such as Japan, child pornography is a serious crime that can be punished with imprisonment.\n* **Europe**: Most countries in Europe have laws against child pornography, and the laws are often enforced effectively. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, child pornography is a serious crime that can be punished with imprisonment.\n* **North America**: The United States has strict laws against child pornography, and the laws are often enforced effectively. In Canada, child pornography is a serious crime that can be punished with imprisonment.\n* **Oceania**: Australia has strict laws against child pornography, and the laws are often enforced effectively. In New Zealand, child pornography is a serious crime that can be punished with imprisonment.\n* **South America**: Many countries in South America have laws against child pornography, but the laws are often not enforced effectively. In some countries, such as Brazil, child pornography is a serious crime that can be punished with imprisonment.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Child exploitation\n* Human trafficking\n* Internet monitoring\n* Cybercrime\n* Law enforcement\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe laws and regulations regarding child pornography are subject to change and may vary significantly from country to country.

they would not encounter each other again until 1990 [38] At the college, Tutu attained his Transvaal Bantu Teachers Diploma, having gained advice about taking exams from the activist Robert Sobukwe [39] He had also taken five correspondence courses provided by the University of South Africa (UNISA), graduating in the same class as future Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe [40]\n\n\nJoining the clergy: 1956–1966\nIn 1953, the white-minority National Party government introduced the Bantu Education Act to further their apartheid system of racial segregation and white domination Disliking the Act, Tutu and his wife left the teaching profession [47] With Huddleston's support, Tutu chose to become an Anglican priest [48] In January 1956, his request to join the Ordinands Guild was turned down due to his debts; these were then paid off by the wealthy industrialist Harry Oppenheimer [49] Tutu was admitted to St Peter's Theological College in Rosettenville, Johannesburg, which was run by the Anglican Community of the Resurrection [50] The college was residential, and Tutu lived there while his wife trained as a nurse in Sekhukhuneland; their children lived with Tutu's parents in Munsieville [51] In August 1960, his wife gave birth to another daughter, Naomi [52]\n\n\nCareer during apartheid\nIn 1966, Tutu and his family moved to East Jerusalem, where he studied Arabic and Greek for two months at St George's College [81] They then returned to South Africa, [82] settling in Alice, Eastern Cape, in 1967 The Federal Theological Seminary (Fedsem) had recently been established there as an amalgamation of training institutions from different Christian denominations [83] At Fedsem, Tutu was employed teaching doctrine, the Old Testament, and Greek; [84] Leah became its library assistant [85] Tutu was the college's first black staff-member, [86] and the campus allowed a level of racial-mixing which was rare in South Africa [87] The Tutus sent their children to a private boarding school in Swaziland, thereby keeping them from South Africa's Bantu Education syllabus [88]\n\n\nTeaching in South Africa and Lesotho: 1966–1972\nIn 1966, Tutu and his family moved to East Jerusalem, where he studied Arabic and Greek for two months at St George's College [81] They then returned to South Africa, [82] settling in Alice, Eastern Cape, in 1967 The Federal Theological Seminary (Fedsem) had recently been established there as an amalgamation of training institutions from different Christian denominations [83] At Fedsem, Tutu was employed teaching doctrine, the Old Testament, and Greek; [84] Leah became its library assistant [85] Tutu was the college's first black staff-member, [86] and the campus allowed a level of racial-mixing which was rare in South Africa [87] The Tutus sent their children to a private boarding school in Swaziland, thereby keeping them from South Africa's Bantu Education syllabus [88]\n\n\nTEF Africa director: 1972–1975\nBlack theology seeks to make sense of the life experience of the black man, which is largely black suffering at the hands of rampant white racism, and to understand this in the light of what God has said about himself, about man, and about the world in his very definite Word.. Black theology has to do with whether it is possible to be black and continue to be Christian; it is to ask on whose side is God; it is to be concerned about the humanisation of man, because those who ravage our humanity dehumanise themselves in the process;  [it says] that the liberation of the black man is the other side of the liberation of the white man—so it is concerned with human liberation.\n\n\nDean of St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg and Bishop of Lesotho: 1975–1978\nIn 1975, Tutu was nominated to be the new Bishop of Johannesburg, although he lost out to Timothy Bavin [114] Bavin suggested that Tutu take his newly vacated position, that of the dean of St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg Tutu was elected to this position—the fourth highest in South Africa's Anglican hierarchy—in March 1975, becoming the first black man to do so, an appointment making headline news in South Africa [115] Tutu was officially installed as dean in August 1975 The cathedral was packed for the event [116] Moving to the city, Tutu lived not in the official dean's residence in the white suburb of Houghton but rather in a house on a middle-class street in the Orlando West township of Soweto, a largely impoverished black area [117] Although majority white, the cathedral's congregation was racially mixed, something that gave Tutu hope that a racially equal, de-segregated future was possible for South Africa [118] He encountered some resistance to his attempts to modernise the liturgies used by the congregation, [119] including his attempts to replace masculine pronouns with gender neutral ones [120]\n\n\nGeneral-Secretary of the South African Council of Churches: 1978–1985\nWe in the SACC believe in a non-racial South Africa where people count because they are made in the image of God So the SACC is neither a black nor a white organization It is a Christian organization with a definite bias in favour of the oppressed and the exploited ones of our society.\n\n\nSACC leadership\nWe in the SACC believe in a non-racial South Africa where people count because they are made in the image of God So the SACC is neither a black nor a white organization It is a Christian organization with a definite bias in favour of the oppressed and the exploited ones of our society.\n\n\nActivism and the Nobel Peace Prize\nTutu testified on behalf of a captured cell of Umkhonto we Sizwe, an armed anti-apartheid group linked to the banned African National Congress (ANC) He stated that although he was committed to non-violence and censured all who used violence, he could understand why black Africans became violent when their non-violent tactics had failed to overturn apartheid [158] In an earlier address, he had opined that an armed struggle against South Africa's government had little chance of succeeding but also accused Western nations of hypocrisy for condemning armed liberation groups in southern Africa while they had praised similar organisations in Europe during the Second World War [159] Tutu also signed a petition calling for the release of ANC activist Nelson Mandela, [160] leading to a correspondence between the pair [161]\n\n\nBishop of Johannesburg: 1985–1986\nAfter Timothy Bavin retired as Bishop of Johannesburg, Tutu was among five replacement candidates An elective assembly met at St Barnabas' College in October 1984 and although Tutu was one of the two most popular candidates, the white laity voting bloc consistently voted against his candidature To break deadlock, a bishops' synod met and decided to appoint Tutu [197] Black Anglicans celebrated, although many white Anglicans were angry; [198] some withdrew their diocesan quota in protest [199] Tutu was enthroned as the sixth Bishop of Johannesburg in St Mary's Cathedral in February 1985 [200] The first black man to hold the role, [201] he took over the country's largest diocese, comprising 102 parishes and 300,000 parishioners, approximately 80% of whom were black [202] In his inaugural sermon, Tutu called on the international community to introduce economic sanctions against South Africa unless apartheid was not being dismantled within 18 to 24 months [203] He sought to reassure white South Africans that he was not the \"horrid ogre\" some feared; as bishop he spent much time wooing the support of white Anglicans in his diocese, [204] and resigned as patron of the UDF [205]\n\n\nArchbishop of Cape Town: 1986–1994\nAfter Philip Russell announced his retirement as the Archbishop of Cape Town, [225] in February 1986 the Black Solidarity Group formed a plan to get Tutu appointed as his replacement [226] At the time of the meeting, Tutu was in Atlanta, Georgia, receiving the Martin Luther King, Jr Nonviolent Peace Prize [227] Tutu secured a two-thirds majority from both the clergy and laity and was then ratified in a unanimous vote by the synod of bishops [228] He was the first black man to hold the post [225] Some white Anglicans left the church in protest [229] Over 1,300 people attended his enthronement ceremony at the Cathedral of St George the Martyr on 7 September 1986 [230] \nAfter the ceremony, Tutu held an open-air Eucharist for 10,000 people at the Cape Showgrounds in Goodwood, where he invited Albertina Sisulu and Allan Boesak to give political speeches [231]\n\n\nDismantling of apartheid\nIn February 1990, de Klerk lifted the ban on political parties like the ANC; Tutu telephoned him to praise the move [260] De Klerk then announced Nelson Mandela's release from prison; at the ANC's request, Mandela and his wife Winnie stayed at Bishopscourt on the former's first night of freedom [261] Tutu and Mandela met for the first time in 35 years at Cape Town City Hall, where Mandela spoke to the assembled crowds [262] Tutu invited Mandela to attend an Anglican synod of bishops in February 1990, at which the latter described Tutu as the \"people's archbishop\" [263] There, Tutu and the bishops called for an end to foreign sanctions once the transition to universal suffrage was \"irreversible\", urged anti-apartheid groups to end armed struggle, and banned Anglican clergy from belonging to political parties [264] Many clergy were angry that the latter was being imposed without consultation, although Tutu defended it, stating that priests affiliating with political parties would prove divisive, particularly amid growing inter-party violence [265]\n\n\nInternational affairs\nTutu also turned his attention to foreign events In 1987, he gave the keynote speech at the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) in Lomé, Togo, calling on churches to champion the oppressed throughout Africa; he stated that \"it pains us to have to admit that there is less freedom and personal liberty in most of Africa now then there was during the much-maligned colonial days.\" [282] Elected president of the AACC, he worked closely with general-secretary José Belo over the next decade [283] In 1989 they visited Zaire to encourage the country's churches to distance themselves from Seko's government [283] In 1994, he and Belo visited war-torn Liberia; they met Charles Taylor, but Tutu did not trust his promise of a ceasefire [284] In 1995, Mandela sent Tutu to Nigeria to meet with military leader Sani Abacha to request the release of imprisoned politicians Moshood Abiola and Olusegun Obasanjo [285] In July 1995, he visited Rwanda a year after the genocide, preaching to 10,000 people in Kigali, calling for justice to be tempered with mercy towards the Hutus who had orchestrated the genocide [286] Tutu also travelled to other parts of world, for instance spending March 1989 in Panama and Nicaragua [287]\n\n\nLater life\nIn October 1994, Tutu announced his intention of retiring as archbishop in 1996 [157] Although retired archbishops normally return to the position of bishop, the other bishops gave him a new title: \"archbishop emeritus\" [300] A farewell ceremony was held at St George's Cathedral in June 1996, attended by senior politicians like Mandela and de Klerk [300] There, Mandela awarded Tutu the Order for Meritorious Service, South Africa's highest honour [300] Tutu was succeeded as archbishop by Njongonkulu Ndungane [301]\n\n\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission: 1996–1998\nTutu popularised the term \"Rainbow Nation\" as a metaphor for post-apartheid South Africa after 1994 under ANC rule [309] He had first used the metaphor in 1989 when he described a multi-racial protest crowd as the \"rainbow people of God\" [310] Tutu advocated what liberation theologians call \"critical solidarity\", offering support for pro-democracy forces while reserving the right to criticise his allies [277] He criticised Mandela on several points, such as his tendency to wear brightly coloured Madiba shirts, which he regarded as inappropriate; [clarification needed] Mandela offered the tongue-in-cheek response that it was ironic coming from a man who wore dresses [311] More serious was Tutu's criticism of Mandela's retention of South Africa's apartheid-era armaments industry and the significant pay packet that newly elected members of parliament adopted [312] Mandela hit back, calling Tutu a \"populist\" and stating that he should have raised these issues privately rather than publicly [313]\n\n\nSocial and international issues: 1999–2009\nI would refuse to go to a homophobic heaven No, I would say sorry, I mean I would much rather go to the other place I would not worship a God who is homophobic and that is how deeply I feel about this I am as passionate about this campaign as I ever was about apartheid For me, it is at the same level.\n\n\nRetirement from public life: 2010–2021\nIn October 2010, Tutu announced his retirement from public life so that he could spend more time \"at home with my family – reading and writing and praying and thinking\" [366] In 2013, he declared that he would no longer vote for the ANC, stating that it had done a poor job in countering inequality, violence, and corruption; [367] he welcomed the launch of a new party, Agang South Africa [368] After Mandela's death in December, Tutu initially stated that he had not been invited to the funeral; after the government denied this, Tutu announced his attendance [369] He criticised the memorials held for Mandela, stating that they gave too much prominence to the ANC and marginalised Afrikaners [370]\n\n\nDeath\nTutu died from cancer at the Oasis Frail Care Centre in Cape Town on 26 December 2021, aged 90 [383] [384] South African president Cyril Ramaphosa described Tutu's death as \"another chapter of bereavement in our nation's farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa.\" [385]\n\n\nPersonal life and personality\n [Tutu's] extrovert nature conceals a private, introvert side that needs space and regular periods of quiet; his jocularity runs alongside a deep seriousness; his occasional bursts of apparent arrogance mask a genuine humility before God and his fellow men He is a true son of Africa who can move easily in European and American circles, a man of the people who enjoys ritual and episcopal splendour, a member of an established Church, in some ways a traditionalist, who takes a radical, provocative and fearless stand against authority if he sees it to be unjust It is usually the most spiritual who can rejoice in all created things and Tutu has no problem in reconciling the sacred and the secular, but critics note a conflict between his socialist ideology and his desire to live comfortably, dress well and lead a life that, while unexceptional in Europe or America, is considered affluent, tainted with capitalism, in the eyes of the deprived black community of South Africa.\n\n\nIdeology\nAllen stated that the theme running through Tutu's campaigning was that of \"democracy, human rights and tolerance, to be achieved by dialogue and accommodation between enemies.\" [429] Racial equality was a core principle, [430] and his opposition to apartheid was unequivocal [412] Tutu believed that the apartheid system had to be wholly dismantled rather than being reformed in a piecemeal fashion [431] He compared the apartheid ethos of South Africa's National Party to the ideas of the Nazi Party, and drew comparisons between apartheid policy and the Holocaust He noted that whereas the latter was a quicker and more efficient way of exterminating whole populations, the National Party's policy of forcibly relocating black South Africans to areas where they lacked access to food and sanitation had much the same result [432] In his words, \"Apartheid is as evil and as vicious as Nazism and Communism.\" [433]\n\n\nPolitical views\nAllen stated that the theme running through Tutu's campaigning was that of \"democracy, human rights and tolerance, to be achieved by dialogue and accommodation between enemies.\" [429] Racial equality was a core principle, [430] and his opposition to apartheid was unequivocal [412] Tutu believed that the apartheid system had to be wholly dismantled rather than being reformed in a piecemeal fashion [431] He compared the apartheid ethos of South Africa's National Party to the ideas of the Nazi Party, and drew comparisons between apartheid policy and the Holocaust He noted that whereas the latter was a quicker and more efficient way of exterminating whole populations, the National Party's policy of forcibly relocating black South Africans to areas where they lacked access to food and sanitation had much the same result [432] In his words, \"Apartheid is as evil and as vicious as Nazism and Communism.\" [433]\n\n\nAnti-apartheid views\nAllen stated that the theme running through Tutu's campaigning was that of \"democracy, human rights and tolerance, to be achieved by dialogue and accommodation between enemies.\" [429] Racial equality was a core principle, [430] and his opposition to apartheid was unequivocal [412] Tutu believed that the apartheid system had to be wholly dismantled rather than being reformed in a piecemeal fashion [431] He compared the apartheid ethos of South Africa's National Party to the ideas of the Nazi Party, and drew comparisons between apartheid policy and the Holocaust He noted that whereas the latter was a quicker and more efficient way of exterminating whole populations, the National Party's policy of forcibly relocating black South Africans to areas where they lacked access to food and sanitation had much the same result [432] In his words, \"Apartheid is as evil and as vicious as Nazism and Communism.\" [433]\n\n\nBroader political views\nAccording to Du Boulay, \"Tutu's politics spring directly and inevitably from his Christianity.\" [450] He believed that it was the duty of Christians to oppose unjust laws, [139] and that there could be no separation between the religious and the political just as—according to Anglican theology—there is no separation between the spiritual realm (the Holy Ghost) and the material one (Jesus Christ) [451] However, he was adamant that he was not personally a politician [450] He felt that religious leaders like himself should stay outside of party politics, citing the example of Abel Muzorewa in Zimbabwe, Makarios III in Cyprus, and Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran as examples in which such crossovers proved problematic [452] He tried to avoid alignment with any particular political party; in the 1980s, for instance, he signed a plea urging anti-apartheid activists in the United States to support both the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) [453] Du Boulay, however, noted that Tutu was \"most at home\" with the UDF umbrella organisation, [454] and that his views on a multi-racial alliance against apartheid placed him closer to the approach of the ANC and UDF than the blacks-only approach favoured by the PAC and Black Consciousness groups like AZAPO [455] When, in the late 1980s, there were suggestions that he should take political office, he rejected the idea [456]\n\n\nTheology\nTutu was attracted to Anglicanism because of what he saw as its tolerance and inclusiveness, its appeal to reason alongside scripture and tradition, and the freedom that its constituent churches had from any centralized authority [333] Tutu's approach to Anglicanism has been characterised as having been Anglo-Catholic in nature [462] He regarded the Anglican Communion as a family, replete with its internal squabbles [463]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nGish noted that by the time of apartheid's fall, Tutu had attained \"worldwide respect\" for his \"uncompromising stand for justice and reconciliation and his unmatched integrity\" [471] According to Allen, Tutu \"made a powerful and unique contribution to publicizing the antiapartheid struggle abroad\", particularly in the United States [472] In the latter country, he was able to rise to prominence as a South African anti-apartheid activist because—unlike Mandela and other members of the ANC—he had no links to the South African Communist Party and thus was more acceptable to Americans amid the Cold War anti-communist sentiment of the period [473] In the United States, he was often compared to Martin Luther King Jr., with the African-American civil rights activist Jesse Jackson referring to him as \"the Martin Luther King of South Africa\" [474]\nAfter the end of apartheid, Tutu became \"perhaps the world's most prominent religious leader advocating gay and lesbian rights\", according to Allen [332] Ultimately, Allen thought that perhaps Tutu's \"greatest legacy\" was the fact that he gave \"to the world as it entered the twenty-first century an African model for expressing the nature of human community\" [475]\n\n\nHonours\nTutu gained many international awards and honorary degrees, particularly in South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States [305] By 2003, he had approximately 100 honorary degrees; [489] he was, for example, the first person to be awarded an honorary doctorate by Ruhr University in West Germany, and the third person to whom Columbia University in the U.S agreed to award an honorary doctorate off-campus [490] Many schools and scholarships were named after him [305] Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick was the first Canadian institution to award Tutu an honorary doctorate in 1988 [491] In 2000, the Munsieville Library in Klerksdorp was renamed the Desmond Tutu Library [305] The Desmond Tutu School of Theology at Fort Hare University was launched in 2002 [305]\n\n\nWritings\nTutu is the author of seven collections of sermons in addition to other writings:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Desmond Mpilo Tutu was a South African Anglican cleric and theologian who played a significant role in the fight against apartheid and the promotion of human rights. He is widely regarded as one of the most prominent figures in the history of the anti-apartheid movement.\n\n## Early Life\n\nDesmond Mpilo Tutu was born on 7 October 1931 in Klerksdorp, Transvaal, South Africa. His mother, Allen Dorothea Mavoertsek Mathlare, was born to a Motswana family in Boksburg. His father, Zachariah Zelilo Tutu, was from the amaFengu branch of Xhosa and grew up in Gcuwa, Eastern Cape.\n\n## Childhood: 1931-1950\n\nTutu's childhood was marked by his parents' love for the Xhosa language, which they spoke at home. His father worked as the principal of a Methodist primary school, and the family lived in the mud-brick schoolmaster's house in the yard of the Methodist mission. Tutu's early life was shaped by his parents' values of compassion, kindness, and respect for others.\n\n## College and Teaching Career: 1951-1955\n\nTutu secured admission to study medicine at the University of the Witwatersrand, but his parents could not afford the tuition fees. Instead, he turned toward teaching, gaining a government scholarship for a course at Pretoria Bantu Normal College, a teacher training institution. At the college, Tutu served as treasurer of the Student Representative Council, helped to organise the Literacy and Dramatic Society, and chaired the Cultural and Debating Society. He met the lawyer—and future president of South Africa—Nelson Mandela during a debating event.\n\n## Joining the Clergy: 1956-1966\n\nTutu and his wife left the teaching profession due to their dislike of the Bantu Education Act, which was introduced by the white-minority National Party government to further their apartheid system. With the support of Huddleston, Tutu chose to become an Anglican priest. He was admitted to St Peter's Theological College in Rosettenville, Johannesburg, which was run by the Anglican Community of the Resurrection.\n\n## Career During Apartheid\n\nIn 1966, Tutu and his family moved to East Jerusalem, where he studied Arabic and Greek for two months at St George's College. They then returned to South Africa, settling in Alice, Eastern Cape. Tutu was employed teaching doctrine, the Old Testament, and Greek at the Federal Theological Seminary. His wife became the library assistant. Tutu was the first black staff-member at the college, and the campus allowed a level of racial-mixing which was rare in South Africa.\n\n## TEF Africa Director: 1972-1975\n\nTutu was a key figure in the development of Black theology, which seeks to make sense of the life experience of the black man, which is largely black suffering at the hands of rampant white racism. Black theology has to do with whether it is possible to be black and continue to be Christian; it is to ask on whose side is God; it is to be concerned about the humanisation of man, because those who ravage our humanity dehumanise themselves in the process.\n\n## Dean of St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg and Bishop of Lesotho: 1975-1978\n\nTutu was nominated to be the new Bishop of Johannesburg, but he lost out to Timothy Bavin. Bavin suggested that Tutu take his newly vacated position, that of the dean of St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg. Tutu was elected to this position—the fourth highest in South Africa's Anglican hierarchy—in March 1975, becoming the first black man to do so. He was officially installed as dean in August 1975.\n\n## General-Secretary of the South African Council of Churches: 1978-1985\n\nTutu testified on behalf of a captured cell of Umkhonto we Sizwe, an armed anti-apartheid group linked to the banned African National Congress (ANC). He stated that although he was committed to non-violence and censured all who used violence, he could understand why black Africans became violent when their non-violent tactics had failed to overturn apartheid.\n\n## Activism and the Nobel Peace Prize\n\nTutu was a vocal critic of the apartheid regime and a strong supporter of the anti-apartheid movement. He testified on behalf of a captured cell of Umkhonto we Sizwe, an armed anti-apartheid group linked to the banned African National Congress (ANC). Tutu also signed a petition calling for the release of ANC activist Nelson Mandela.\n\n## Bishop of Johannesburg: 1985-1986\n\nAfter Timothy Bavin retired as Bishop of Johannesburg, Tutu was among five replacement candidates. An elective assembly met at St Barnabas' College in October 1984, and although Tutu was one of the two most popular candidates, the white laity voting bloc consistently voted against his candidature. To break deadlock, a bishops' synod met and decided to appoint Tutu. Tutu was enthroned as the sixth Bishop of Johannesburg in St Mary's Cathedral in February 1985.\n\n## Archbishop of Cape Town: 1986-1994\n\nAfter Philip Russell announced his retirement as the Archbishop of Cape Town, Tutu was nominated to replace him. The Black Solidarity Group formed a plan to get Tutu appointed as his replacement. Tutu secured a two-thirds majority from both the clergy and laity and was then ratified in a unanimous vote by the synod of bishops. He was the first black man to hold the post.\n\n## Dismantling of Apartheid\n\nIn February 1990, de Klerk lifted the ban on political parties like the ANC. Tutu telephoned him to praise the move. De Klerk then announced Nelson Mandela's release from prison. Tutu and Mandela met for the first time in 35 years at Cape Town City Hall, where Mandela spoke to the assembled crowds.\n\n## International Affairs\n\nTutu also turned his attention to foreign events. In 1987, he gave the keynote speech at the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) in Lomé, Togo, calling on churches to champion the oppressed throughout Africa. Elected president of the AACC, Tutu worked closely with general-secretary José Belo over the next decade.\n\n## Later Life\n\nIn October 1994, Tutu announced his intention of retiring as archbishop in 1996. Although retired archbishops normally return to the position of bishop, the other bishops gave him a new title: \"archbishop emeritus\". A farewell ceremony was held at St George's Cathedral in June 1996, attended by senior politicians like Mandela and de Klerk.\n\n## Truth and Reconciliation Commission: 1996-1998\n\nTutu was a key figure in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was established to investigate human rights abuses committed during the apartheid era. He advocated for a policy of \"critical solidarity\", offering support for pro-democracy forces while reserving the right to criticise his allies.\n\n## Social and International Issues: 1999-2009\n\nTutu was a vocal critic of social and international issues, including racism, homophobia, and economic inequality. He was a strong advocate for gay and lesbian rights and was a vocal critic of the apartheid regime's treatment of gay people.\n\n## Retirement from Public Life: 2010-2021\n\nIn October 2010, Tutu announced his retirement from public life so that he could spend more time \"at home with my family – reading and writing and praying and thinking\". He declared that he would no longer vote for the ANC, stating that it had done a poor job in countering inequality, violence, and corruption.\n\n## Death\n\nTutu died from cancer at the Oasis Frail Care Centre in Cape Town on 26 December 2021, aged 90. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa described Tutu's death as \"another chapter of bereavement in our nation's farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa.\"\n\n## Personal Life and Personality\n\nTutu was a complex and multifaceted person, known for his charisma, intelligence, and compassion. He was a true son of Africa who could move easily in European and American circles, a man of the people who enjoyed ritual and episcopal splendour.\n\n## Ideology\n\nTutu's politics spring directly and inevitably from his Christianity. He believed that it was the duty of Christians to oppose unjust laws, and that there could be no separation between the religious and the political just as—according to Anglican theology—there is no separation between the spiritual realm (the Holy Ghost) and the material one (Jesus Christ).\n\n## Broader Political Views\n\nTutu's views on a multi-racial alliance against apartheid placed him closer to the approach of the ANC and UDF than the blacks-only approach favoured by the PAC and Black Consciousness groups like AZAPO.\n\n## Theology\n\nTutu's approach to Anglicanism has been characterised as having been Anglo-Catholic in nature.

they would not encounter each other again until 1990 [38] At the college, Tutu attained his Transvaal Bantu Teachers Diploma, having gained advice about taking exams from the activist Robert Sobukwe [39] He had also taken five correspondence courses provided by the University of South Africa (UNISA), graduating in the same class as future Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe [40]\n\n\nJoining the clergy: 1956–1966\nIn 1953, the white-minority National Party government introduced the Bantu Education Act to further their apartheid system of racial segregation and white domination Disliking the Act, Tutu and his wife left the teaching profession [47] With Huddleston's support, Tutu chose to become an Anglican priest [48] In January 1956, his request to join the Ordinands Guild was turned down due to his debts; these were then paid off by the wealthy industrialist Harry Oppenheimer [49] Tutu was admitted to St Peter's Theological College in Rosettenville, Johannesburg, which was run by the Anglican Community of the Resurrection [50] The college was residential, and Tutu lived there while his wife trained as a nurse in Sekhukhuneland; their children lived with Tutu's parents in Munsieville [51] In August 1960, his wife gave birth to another daughter, Naomi [52]\n\n\nCareer during apartheid\nIn 1966, Tutu and his family moved to East Jerusalem, where he studied Arabic and Greek for two months at St George's College [81] They then returned to South Africa, [82] settling in Alice, Eastern Cape, in 1967 The Federal Theological Seminary (Fedsem) had recently been established there as an amalgamation of training institutions from different Christian denominations [83] At Fedsem, Tutu was employed teaching doctrine, the Old Testament, and Greek; [84] Leah became its library assistant [85] Tutu was the college's first black staff-member, [86] and the campus allowed a level of racial-mixing which was rare in South Africa [87] The Tutus sent their children to a private boarding school in Swaziland, thereby keeping them from South Africa's Bantu Education syllabus [88]\n\n\nTeaching in South Africa and Lesotho: 1966–1972\nIn 1966, Tutu and his family moved to East Jerusalem, where he studied Arabic and Greek for two months at St George's College [81] They then returned to South Africa, [82] settling in Alice, Eastern Cape, in 1967 The Federal Theological Seminary (Fedsem) had recently been established there as an amalgamation of training institutions from different Christian denominations [83] At Fedsem, Tutu was employed teaching doctrine, the Old Testament, and Greek; [84] Leah became its library assistant [85] Tutu was the college's first black staff-member, [86] and the campus allowed a level of racial-mixing which was rare in South Africa [87] The Tutus sent their children to a private boarding school in Swaziland, thereby keeping them from South Africa's Bantu Education syllabus [88]\n\n\nTEF Africa director: 1972–1975\nBlack theology seeks to make sense of the life experience of the black man, which is largely black suffering at the hands of rampant white racism, and to understand this in the light of what God has said about himself, about man, and about the world in his very definite Word.. Black theology has to do with whether it is possible to be black and continue to be Christian; it is to ask on whose side is God; it is to be concerned about the humanisation of man, because those who ravage our humanity dehumanise themselves in the process;  [it says] that the liberation of the black man is the other side of the liberation of the white man—so it is concerned with human liberation.\n\n\nDean of St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg and Bishop of Lesotho: 1975–1978\nIn 1975, Tutu was nominated to be the new Bishop of Johannesburg, although he lost out to Timothy Bavin [114] Bavin suggested that Tutu take his newly vacated position, that of the dean of St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg Tutu was elected to this position—the fourth highest in South Africa's Anglican hierarchy—in March 1975, becoming the first black man to do so, an appointment making headline news in South Africa [115] Tutu was officially installed as dean in August 1975 The cathedral was packed for the event [116] Moving to the city, Tutu lived not in the official dean's residence in the white suburb of Houghton but rather in a house on a middle-class street in the Orlando West township of Soweto, a largely impoverished black area [117] Although majority white, the cathedral's congregation was racially mixed, something that gave Tutu hope that a racially equal, de-segregated future was possible for South Africa [118] He encountered some resistance to his attempts to modernise the liturgies used by the congregation, [119] including his attempts to replace masculine pronouns with gender neutral ones [120]\n\n\nGeneral-Secretary of the South African Council of Churches: 1978–1985\nWe in the SACC believe in a non-racial South Africa where people count because they are made in the image of God So the SACC is neither a black nor a white organization It is a Christian organization with a definite bias in favour of the oppressed and the exploited ones of our society.\n\n\nSACC leadership\nWe in the SACC believe in a non-racial South Africa where people count because they are made in the image of God So the SACC is neither a black nor a white organization It is a Christian organization with a definite bias in favour of the oppressed and the exploited ones of our society.\n\n\nActivism and the Nobel Peace Prize\nTutu testified on behalf of a captured cell of Umkhonto we Sizwe, an armed anti-apartheid group linked to the banned African National Congress (ANC) He stated that although he was committed to non-violence and censured all who used violence, he could understand why black Africans became violent when their non-violent tactics had failed to overturn apartheid [158] In an earlier address, he had opined that an armed struggle against South Africa's government had little chance of succeeding but also accused Western nations of hypocrisy for condemning armed liberation groups in southern Africa while they had praised similar organisations in Europe during the Second World War [159] Tutu also signed a petition calling for the release of ANC activist Nelson Mandela, [160] leading to a correspondence between the pair [161]\n\n\nBishop of Johannesburg: 1985–1986\nAfter Timothy Bavin retired as Bishop of Johannesburg, Tutu was among five replacement candidates An elective assembly met at St Barnabas' College in October 1984 and although Tutu was one of the two most popular candidates, the white laity voting bloc consistently voted against his candidature To break deadlock, a bishops' synod met and decided to appoint Tutu [197] Black Anglicans celebrated, although many white Anglicans were angry; [198] some withdrew their diocesan quota in protest [199] Tutu was enthroned as the sixth Bishop of Johannesburg in St Mary's Cathedral in February 1985 [200] The first black man to hold the role, [201] he took over the country's largest diocese, comprising 102 parishes and 300,000 parishioners, approximately 80% of whom were black [202] In his inaugural sermon, Tutu called on the international community to introduce economic sanctions against South Africa unless apartheid was not being dismantled within 18 to 24 months [203] He sought to reassure white South Africans that he was not the \"horrid ogre\" some feared; as bishop he spent much time wooing the support of white Anglicans in his diocese, [204] and resigned as patron of the UDF [205]\n\n\nArchbishop of Cape Town: 1986–1994\nAfter Philip Russell announced his retirement as the Archbishop of Cape Town, [225] in February 1986 the Black Solidarity Group formed a plan to get Tutu appointed as his replacement [226] At the time of the meeting, Tutu was in Atlanta, Georgia, receiving the Martin Luther King, Jr Nonviolent Peace Prize [227] Tutu secured a two-thirds majority from both the clergy and laity and was then ratified in a unanimous vote by the synod of bishops [228] He was the first black man to hold the post [225] Some white Anglicans left the church in protest [229] Over 1,300 people attended his enthronement ceremony at the Cathedral of St George the Martyr on 7 September 1986 [230] \nAfter the ceremony, Tutu held an open-air Eucharist for 10,000 people at the Cape Showgrounds in Goodwood, where he invited Albertina Sisulu and Allan Boesak to give political speeches [231]\n\n\nDismantling of apartheid\nIn February 1990, de Klerk lifted the ban on political parties like the ANC; Tutu telephoned him to praise the move [260] De Klerk then announced Nelson Mandela's release from prison; at the ANC's request, Mandela and his wife Winnie stayed at Bishopscourt on the former's first night of freedom [261] Tutu and Mandela met for the first time in 35 years at Cape Town City Hall, where Mandela spoke to the assembled crowds [262] Tutu invited Mandela to attend an Anglican synod of bishops in February 1990, at which the latter described Tutu as the \"people's archbishop\" [263] There, Tutu and the bishops called for an end to foreign sanctions once the transition to universal suffrage was \"irreversible\", urged anti-apartheid groups to end armed struggle, and banned Anglican clergy from belonging to political parties [264] Many clergy were angry that the latter was being imposed without consultation, although Tutu defended it, stating that priests affiliating with political parties would prove divisive, particularly amid growing inter-party violence [265]\n\n\nInternational affairs\nTutu also turned his attention to foreign events In 1987, he gave the keynote speech at the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) in Lomé, Togo, calling on churches to champion the oppressed throughout Africa; he stated that \"it pains us to have to admit that there is less freedom and personal liberty in most of Africa now then there was during the much-maligned colonial days.\" [282] Elected president of the AACC, he worked closely with general-secretary José Belo over the next decade [283] In 1989 they visited Zaire to encourage the country's churches to distance themselves from Seko's government [283] In 1994, he and Belo visited war-torn Liberia; they met Charles Taylor, but Tutu did not trust his promise of a ceasefire [284] In 1995, Mandela sent Tutu to Nigeria to meet with military leader Sani Abacha to request the release of imprisoned politicians Moshood Abiola and Olusegun Obasanjo [285] In July 1995, he visited Rwanda a year after the genocide, preaching to 10,000 people in Kigali, calling for justice to be tempered with mercy towards the Hutus who had orchestrated the genocide [286] Tutu also travelled to other parts of world, for instance spending March 1989 in Panama and Nicaragua [287]\n\n\nLater life\nIn October 1994, Tutu announced his intention of retiring as archbishop in 1996 [157] Although retired archbishops normally return to the position of bishop, the other bishops gave him a new title: \"archbishop emeritus\" [300] A farewell ceremony was held at St George's Cathedral in June 1996, attended by senior politicians like Mandela and de Klerk [300] There, Mandela awarded Tutu the Order for Meritorious Service, South Africa's highest honour [300] Tutu was succeeded as archbishop by Njongonkulu Ndungane [301]\n\n\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission: 1996–1998\nTutu popularised the term \"Rainbow Nation\" as a metaphor for post-apartheid South Africa after 1994 under ANC rule [309] He had first used the metaphor in 1989 when he described a multi-racial protest crowd as the \"rainbow people of God\" [310] Tutu advocated what liberation theologians call \"critical solidarity\", offering support for pro-democracy forces while reserving the right to criticise his allies [277] He criticised Mandela on several points, such as his tendency to wear brightly coloured Madiba shirts, which he regarded as inappropriate; [clarification needed] Mandela offered the tongue-in-cheek response that it was ironic coming from a man who wore dresses [311] More serious was Tutu's criticism of Mandela's retention of South Africa's apartheid-era armaments industry and the significant pay packet that newly elected members of parliament adopted [312] Mandela hit back, calling Tutu a \"populist\" and stating that he should have raised these issues privately rather than publicly [313]\n\n\nSocial and international issues: 1999–2009\nI would refuse to go to a homophobic heaven No, I would say sorry, I mean I would much rather go to the other place I would not worship a God who is homophobic and that is how deeply I feel about this I am as passionate about this campaign as I ever was about apartheid For me, it is at the same level.\n\n\nRetirement from public life: 2010–2021\nIn October 2010, Tutu announced his retirement from public life so that he could spend more time \"at home with my family – reading and writing and praying and thinking\" [366] In 2013, he declared that he would no longer vote for the ANC, stating that it had done a poor job in countering inequality, violence, and corruption; [367] he welcomed the launch of a new party, Agang South Africa [368] After Mandela's death in December, Tutu initially stated that he had not been invited to the funeral; after the government denied this, Tutu announced his attendance [369] He criticised the memorials held for Mandela, stating that they gave too much prominence to the ANC and marginalised Afrikaners [370]\n\n\nDeath\nTutu died from cancer at the Oasis Frail Care Centre in Cape Town on 26 December 2021, aged 90 [383] [384] South African president Cyril Ramaphosa described Tutu's death as \"another chapter of bereavement in our nation's farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa.\" [385]\n\n\nPersonal life and personality\n [Tutu's] extrovert nature conceals a private, introvert side that needs space and regular periods of quiet; his jocularity runs alongside a deep seriousness; his occasional bursts of apparent arrogance mask a genuine humility before God and his fellow men He is a true son of Africa who can move easily in European and American circles, a man of the people who enjoys ritual and episcopal splendour, a member of an established Church, in some ways a traditionalist, who takes a radical, provocative and fearless stand against authority if he sees it to be unjust It is usually the most spiritual who can rejoice in all created things and Tutu has no problem in reconciling the sacred and the secular, but critics note a conflict between his socialist ideology and his desire to live comfortably, dress well and lead a life that, while unexceptional in Europe or America, is considered affluent, tainted with capitalism, in the eyes of the deprived black community of South Africa.\n\n\nIdeology\nAllen stated that the theme running through Tutu's campaigning was that of \"democracy, human rights and tolerance, to be achieved by dialogue and accommodation between enemies.\" [429] Racial equality was a core principle, [430] and his opposition to apartheid was unequivocal [412] Tutu believed that the apartheid system had to be wholly dismantled rather than being reformed in a piecemeal fashion [431] He compared the apartheid ethos of South Africa's National Party to the ideas of the Nazi Party, and drew comparisons between apartheid policy and the Holocaust He noted that whereas the latter was a quicker and more efficient way of exterminating whole populations, the National Party's policy of forcibly relocating black South Africans to areas where they lacked access to food and sanitation had much the same result [432] In his words, \"Apartheid is as evil and as vicious as Nazism and Communism.\" [433]\n\n\nPolitical views\nAllen stated that the theme running through Tutu's campaigning was that of \"democracy, human rights and tolerance, to be achieved by dialogue and accommodation between enemies.\" [429] Racial equality was a core principle, [430] and his opposition to apartheid was unequivocal [412] Tutu believed that the apartheid system had to be wholly dismantled rather than being reformed in a piecemeal fashion [431] He compared the apartheid ethos of South Africa's National Party to the ideas of the Nazi Party, and drew comparisons between apartheid policy and the Holocaust He noted that whereas the latter was a quicker and more efficient way of exterminating whole populations, the National Party's policy of forcibly relocating black South Africans to areas where they lacked access to food and sanitation had much the same result [432] In his words, \"Apartheid is as evil and as vicious as Nazism and Communism.\" [433]\n\n\nAnti-apartheid views\nAllen stated that the theme running through Tutu's campaigning was that of \"democracy, human rights and tolerance, to be achieved by dialogue and accommodation between enemies.\" [429] Racial equality was a core principle, [430] and his opposition to apartheid was unequivocal [412] Tutu believed that the apartheid system had to be wholly dismantled rather than being reformed in a piecemeal fashion [431] He compared the apartheid ethos of South Africa's National Party to the ideas of the Nazi Party, and drew comparisons between apartheid policy and the Holocaust He noted that whereas the latter was a quicker and more efficient way of exterminating whole populations, the National Party's policy of forcibly relocating black South Africans to areas where they lacked access to food and sanitation had much the same result [432] In his words, \"Apartheid is as evil and as vicious as Nazism and Communism.\" [433]\n\n\nBroader political views\nAccording to Du Boulay, \"Tutu's politics spring directly and inevitably from his Christianity.\" [450] He believed that it was the duty of Christians to oppose unjust laws, [139] and that there could be no separation between the religious and the political just as—according to Anglican theology—there is no separation between the spiritual realm (the Holy Ghost) and the material one (Jesus Christ) [451] However, he was adamant that he was not personally a politician [450] He felt that religious leaders like himself should stay outside of party politics, citing the example of Abel Muzorewa in Zimbabwe, Makarios III in Cyprus, and Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran as examples in which such crossovers proved problematic [452] He tried to avoid alignment with any particular political party; in the 1980s, for instance, he signed a plea urging anti-apartheid activists in the United States to support both the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) [453] Du Boulay, however, noted that Tutu was \"most at home\" with the UDF umbrella organisation, [454] and that his views on a multi-racial alliance against apartheid placed him closer to the approach of the ANC and UDF than the blacks-only approach favoured by the PAC and Black Consciousness groups like AZAPO [455] When, in the late 1980s, there were suggestions that he should take political office, he rejected the idea [456]\n\n\nTheology\nTutu was attracted to Anglicanism because of what he saw as its tolerance and inclusiveness, its appeal to reason alongside scripture and tradition, and the freedom that its constituent churches had from any centralized authority [333] Tutu's approach to Anglicanism has been characterised as having been Anglo-Catholic in nature [462] He regarded the Anglican Communion as a family, replete with its internal squabbles [463]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nGish noted that by the time of apartheid's fall, Tutu had attained \"worldwide respect\" for his \"uncompromising stand for justice and reconciliation and his unmatched integrity\" [471] According to Allen, Tutu \"made a powerful and unique contribution to publicizing the antiapartheid struggle abroad\", particularly in the United States [472] In the latter country, he was able to rise to prominence as a South African anti-apartheid activist because—unlike Mandela and other members of the ANC—he had no links to the South African Communist Party and thus was more acceptable to Americans amid the Cold War anti-communist sentiment of the period [473] In the United States, he was often compared to Martin Luther King Jr., with the African-American civil rights activist Jesse Jackson referring to him as \"the Martin Luther King of South Africa\" [474]\nAfter the end of apartheid, Tutu became \"perhaps the world's most prominent religious leader advocating gay and lesbian rights\", according to Allen [332] Ultimately, Allen thought that perhaps Tutu's \"greatest legacy\" was the fact that he gave \"to the world as it entered the twenty-first century an African model for expressing the nature of human community\" [475]\n\n\nHonours\nTutu gained many international awards and honorary degrees, particularly in South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States [305] By 2003, he had approximately 100 honorary degrees; [489] he was, for example, the first person to be awarded an honorary doctorate by Ruhr University in West Germany, and the third person to whom Columbia University in the U.S agreed to award an honorary doctorate off-campus [490] Many schools and scholarships were named after him [305] Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick was the first Canadian institution to award Tutu an honorary doctorate in 1988 [491] In 2000, the Munsieville Library in Klerksdorp was renamed the Desmond Tutu Library [305] The Desmond Tutu School of Theology at Fort Hare University was launched in 2002 [305]\n\n\nWritings\nTutu is the author of seven collections of sermons in addition to other writings:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Cowboy_Bebop", "content": "\nPlot\nIn the year 2071, roughly fifty years after an accident with a hyperspace gateway that made Earth almost uninhabitable, humanity has colonized most of the rocky planets and moons of the Solar System Amid a rising crime rate, the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) set up a legalized contract system, in which registered bounty hunters (also referred to as \"Cowboys\") chase criminals and bring them in alive in return for a reward [15] The series' protagonists are bounty hunters working from the spaceship Bebop The original crew is Spike Spiegel, an exiled former hitman of the criminal Red Dragon Syndicate, and Jet Black, a former ISSP officer They are later joined by Faye Valentine, an amnesiac con artist; Edward, an eccentric child, skilled in hacking; and Ein, a genetically engineered Pembroke Welsh Corgi with human-like intelligence Throughout the series, the team gets involved in disastrous mishaps leaving them without money, while often confronting faces and events from their pasts: [16] These include Jet's reasons for leaving the ISSP and Faye's past as a young woman from Earth injured in an accident and cryogenically frozen to save her life.\n\n\nGenre and themes\nWatanabe created a special tagline for the series to promote it during its original presentation, calling it \"a new genre unto itself\" The line was inserted before and after commercial breaks during its Japanese and US broadcasts Later, Watanabe called the phrase an \"exaggeration\" [17] The show is a hybrid of multiple genres, including westerns and pulp fiction [18] One reviewer described it as \"space opera meets noir, meets comedy, meets cyberpunk\" [19] [6] It has also been called a \"genre-busting space Western\" [20] [21]\n\n\nCharacters\nThe characters were created by Watanabe and character designed by Toshihiro Kawamoto Watanabe envisioned each character as an extension of his own personality, or as an opposite person to himself [30] Each character, from the main cast to supporting characters, were designed to be outlaws unable to fit into society [31] Kawamoto designed the characters so they were easily distinguished from one another [17] All the main cast are characterized by a deep sense of loneliness or resignation to their fate and past [17] From the perspective of Brian Camp and Julie Davis, the main characters resemble the main characters of the anime series Lupin III, if only superficially, given their more troubled pasts and more complex personalities [29]\n\n\nProduction\nCowboy Bebop was developed by animation studio Sunrise and created by Hajime Yatate, the well-known pseudonym for the collective contributions of Sunrise's animation staff The leader of the series' creative team was director Shinichirō Watanabe, most notable at the time for directing Macross Plus and Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory Other leading members of Sunrise's creative team were screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto, character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, mechanical art designer Kimitoshi Yamane, composer Yoko Kanno, and producers Masahiko Minami and Yoshiyuki Takei Most of them had previously worked together, in addition to having credits on other popular anime titles Nobumoto had scripted Macross Plus, Kawamoto had designed the characters for Gundam, and Kanno had composed the music for Macross Plus and The Vision of Escaflowne Yamane had not worked with Watanabe yet, but his credits in anime included Bubblegum Crisis and The Vision of Escaflowne Minami joined the project as he wanted to do something different from his previous work on mecha anime [23] [33]\n\n\nConcept\nCowboy Bebop was Watanabe's first project as solo director, as he had been co-director in his previous works [36] His original concept was for a movie, and during production he treated each episode as a miniature movie [37] [38] His main inspiration for Cowboy Bebop was the first series of the anime Lupin III, a crime drama focusing on the exploits of the series' titular character [23] When developing the series' story, Watanabe began by creating the characters first He explained, \"the first image that occurred to me was one of Spike, and from there I tried to build a story around him, trying to make him cool.\" [36] While the original dialogue of the series was kept clean to avoid any profanities, its level of sophistication was made appropriate to adults in a criminal environment [23] Watanabe described Cowboy Bebop as \"80% serious story and 20% humorous touch\" [39] The comical episodes were harder for the team to write than the serious ones, and though several events in them seemed random, they were carefully planned in advance [31] Watanabe conceived the series' ending early on, and each episode involving Spike and Vicious was meant to foreshadow their final confrontation Some of the staff were unhappy about this approach as a continuation of the series would be difficult While he considered altering the ending, he eventually settled with his original idea The reason for creating the ending was that Watanabe did not want the series to become like Star Trek, with him being tied to doing it for years [31]\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe project had initially originated with Bandai's toy division as a sponsor, with the goal of selling spacecraft toys Watanabe recalled his only instruction was \"So long as there's a spaceship in it, you can do whatever you want.\" But upon viewing early footage, it became clear that Watanabe's vision for the series did not match Bandai's Believing the series would never sell toy merchandise, Bandai pulled out of the project, leaving it in development hell until sister company Bandai Visual stepped in to sponsor it Since there was no need to merchandise toys with the property any more, Watanabe had free rein in the development of the series [36] Watanabe wanted to design not just a space adventure series for adolescent boys but a program that would also appeal to sophisticated adults [23] During the making of Bebop, Watanabe often attempted to rally the animation staff by telling them that the show would be something memorable up to three decades later While some of them were doubtful of that at the time, Watanabe many years later expressed his happiness to have been proven right in retrospect He joked that if Bandai Visual had not intervened then \"you might be seeing me working the supermarket checkout counter right now.\" [36]\n\n\nMusic\nThe music for Cowboy Bebop was composed by Yoko Kanno [43] Kanno formed the blues and jazz band Seatbelts to perform the series' music [44] According to Kanno, the music was one of the first aspects of the series to begin production, before most of the characters, story, or animation had been finalized The genres she used for its composition were western, opera, and jazz [31] Watanabe noted that Kanno did not score the music exactly the way he told her to He stated, \"She gets inspired on her own, follows up on her own imagery, and comes to me saying 'this is the song we need for Cowboy Bebop', and composes something completely on her own.\" [39] Kanno herself was sometimes surprised at how pieces of her music were used in scenes, sometimes wishing it had been used elsewhere, though she also felt that none of their uses were \"inappropriate\" She was pleased with the working environment, finding the team very relaxed in comparison with other teams she had worked with [33]\n\n\nWeapons\n\nThe guns on the show were chosen by the director, Watanabe, and in discussion with set designer, Isamu Imakake, and mechanical designer, Kimitoshi Yamane Setting producer, Satoshi Toba said, \"They talked about how they didn't want common guns, because that wouldn't be very interesting, and so they decided on these guns.\" [47]\n\nDistribution\nCowboy Bebop debuted on TV Tokyo, one of the main broadcasters of anime in Japan, airing from April 3 until June 26, 1998 [48]

Valentine and Ed were ranked the fifth and ninth best female characters respectively; \"Tank!\" and \"The Real Folk Blues\" were ranked the third and fifteenth best songs respectively; and \"Ballad of Fallen Angels\", \"Speak Like a Child\", \"Jamming with Edward\" and \"Mish-Mash Blues\" were ranked the second, eighth, eighteenth and 20th best episodes respectively [117]\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe series has been subject to study and analysis since its debut, with the main focus being on its style and mixture of genres Miguel Douglas, describing the series style in a review, said that \"the series distinctly establishes itself outside the realm of conventional Japanese animation and instead chooses to forge its own path With a setting within the realm of science fiction, the series wisely offers a world that seems entirely realistic considering our present time Free from many of the elements that accompany science fiction in general—whether that be space aliens, giant robots, or laser guns—the series delegates itself towards presenting a world that is quite similar to our own albeit showcasing some technological advances.\" [129] Daryl Surat of Otaku USA, commenting on the series' appeal, said that it was \"that rare breed of science-fiction: 'accessible' Unlike many anime titles, viewers weren't expected to have knowledge of Japanese culture—character names, signs, and the like were primarily in English to begin with—or have seen any other anime series prior.\" [130] Michelle Onley Pirkle, in her book Science Fiction Film, Television, and Adaptation: Across the Screens, said that \"Cowboy Bebop is taking a new take on genre, not by creating unique images and sounds, but by playing 'freely' with, 'remixing', or adapting the images and sounds of other familiar genres in a dynamic way.\" [131]: 164  Robert Baigent, writing for the Graduate Journal of Asia-Pacific Studies, said that the series' appeal likely stemmed from the trend in anime to emulate Western fiction [27]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn March 2009, the print and web editions of The Onion's The A.V Club called Cowboy Bebop \"rightly a huge hit\", and listed it as a gateway series to understanding the medium of anime as a whole [14] Suskind said: \"It was unlike anything the genre had seen before It even approached its music differently The show kicked off with a wormhole of a theme song, and the soundtrack moves so seamlessly through genres, from rock to country to pop to jazz to funk, it's shocking to learn that one set of musicians is behind it all\" In an interview, producer Sean Akins also states that the series \"created a whole new world\" \"It's hard for me to quantify the impact that I think it has had It changed anime I think people began to think about what shows would be cool I think it redefined cool within animation, not only in Japan but in the States\" [112] One of the series' main animators, Tensai Okamura, went on to create his own anime in 2007: Darker than Black Okamura used his experience from Cowboy Bebop to write the screenplay of Darker than Black, leading to narratives composed of two episodes similar to Japanese dramas [132]\n\n\nExplanatory

Watanabe. The series is set in a futuristic universe and follows the adventures of a group of bounty hunters, known as cowboys, traveling through the solar system. The series is known for its unique blend of jazz, rock, and country music, as well as its fusion of different genres and styles, including science fiction, westerns, and drama.

Cowboy Bebop also received rankings in other categories: the series itself was awarded the second best anime series; Faye Valentine and Ed were ranked the fifth and ninth best female characters respectively; \"Tank!\" and \"The Real Folk Blues\" were ranked the third and fifteenth best songs respectively; and \"Ballad of Fallen Angels,\" \"Speak Like a Child,\" \"Jamming with Edward,\" and \"Mish-Mash Blues\" were ranked the second, eighth, eighteenth, and twentieth best episodes respectively.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nIn March 2009, the print and web editions of The Onion's The A.V Club called Cowboy Bebop \"rightly a huge hit,\" and listed it as a gateway series to understanding the medium of anime as a whole. Suskind said: \"It was unlike anything the genre had seen before. It even approached its music differently. The show kicked off with a wormhole of a theme song, and the soundtrack moves so seamlessly through genres, from rock to country to pop to jazz to funk, it's shocking to learn that one set of musicians is behind it all.\" In an interview, producer Sean Akins also states that the series \"created a whole new world.\" \"It's hard for me to quantify the impact that I think it has had. It changed anime. I think people began to think about what shows would be cool. I think it redefined cool within animation, not only in Japan but in the States.\" One of the series' main animators, Tensai Okamura, went on to create his own anime in 2007: Darker than Black. Okamura used his experience from Cowboy Bebop to write the screenplay of Darker than Black, leading to narratives composed of two episodes similar to Japanese dramas.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Cowboy_Bebop\" following this outline:\n\n\nPlot\nIn the year 2071, roughly fifty years after an accident with a hyperspace gateway that made Earth almost uninhabitable, humanity has colonized most of the rocky planets and moons of the Solar System Amid a rising crime rate, the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) set up a legalized contract system, in which registered bounty hunters (also referred to as \"Cowboys\") chase criminals and bring them in alive in return for a reward [15] The series' protagonists are bounty hunters working from the spaceship Bebop The original crew is Spike Spiegel, an exiled former hitman of the criminal Red Dragon Syndicate, and Jet Black, a former ISSP officer They are later joined by Faye Valentine, an amnesiac con artist; Edward, an eccentric child, skilled in hacking; and Ein, a genetically engineered Pembroke Welsh Corgi with human-like intelligence Throughout the series, the team gets involved in disastrous mishaps leaving them without money, while often confronting faces and events from their pasts: [16] These include Jet's reasons for leaving the ISSP and Faye's past as a young woman from Earth injured in an accident and cryogenically frozen to save her life.\n\n\nGenre and themes\nWatanabe created a special tagline for the series to promote it during its original presentation, calling it \"a new genre unto itself\" The line was inserted before and after commercial breaks during its Japanese and US broadcasts Later, Watanabe called the phrase an \"exaggeration\" [17] The show is a hybrid of multiple genres, including westerns and pulp fiction [18] One reviewer described it as \"space opera meets noir, meets comedy, meets cyberpunk\" [19] [6] It has also been called a \"genre-busting space Western\" [20] [21]\n\n\nCharacters\nThe characters were created by Watanabe and character designed by Toshihiro Kawamoto Watanabe envisioned each character as an extension of his own personality, or as an opposite person to himself [30] Each character, from the main cast to supporting characters, were designed to be outlaws unable to fit into society [31] Kawamoto designed the characters so they were easily distinguished from one another [17] All the main cast are characterized by a deep sense of loneliness or resignation to their fate and past [17] From the perspective of Brian Camp and Julie Davis, the main characters resemble the main characters of the anime series Lupin III, if only superficially, given their more troubled pasts and more complex personalities [29]\n\n\nProduction\nCowboy Bebop was developed by animation studio Sunrise and created by Hajime Yatate, the well-known pseudonym for the collective contributions of Sunrise's animation staff The leader of the series' creative team was director Shinichirō Watanabe, most notable at the time for directing Macross Plus and Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory Other leading members of Sunrise's creative team were screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto, character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, mechanical art designer Kimitoshi Yamane, composer Yoko Kanno, and producers Masahiko Minami and Yoshiyuki Takei Most of them had previously worked together, in addition to having credits on other popular anime titles Nobumoto had scripted Macross Plus, Kawamoto had designed the characters for Gundam, and Kanno had composed the music for Macross Plus and The Vision of Escaflowne Yamane had not worked with Watanabe yet, but his credits in anime included Bubblegum Crisis and The Vision of Escaflowne Minami joined the project as he wanted to do something different from his previous work on mecha anime [23] [33]\n\n\nConcept\nCowboy Bebop was Watanabe's first project as solo director, as he had been co-director in his previous works [36] His original concept was for a movie, and during production he treated each episode as a miniature movie [37] [38] His main inspiration for Cowboy Bebop was the first series of the anime Lupin III, a crime drama focusing on the exploits of the series' titular character [23] When developing the series' story, Watanabe began by creating the characters first He explained, \"the first image that occurred to me was one of Spike, and from there I tried to build a story around him, trying to make him cool.\" [36] While the original dialogue of the series was kept clean to avoid any profanities, its level of sophistication was made appropriate to adults in a criminal environment [23] Watanabe described Cowboy Bebop as \"80% serious story and 20% humorous touch\" [39] The comical episodes were harder for the team to write than the serious ones, and though several events in them seemed random, they were carefully planned in advance [31] Watanabe conceived the series' ending early on, and each episode involving Spike and Vicious was meant to foreshadow their final confrontation Some of the staff were unhappy about this approach as a continuation of the series would be difficult While he considered altering the ending, he eventually settled with his original idea The reason for creating the ending was that Watanabe did not want the series to become like Star Trek, with him being tied to doing it for years [31]\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe project had initially originated with Bandai's toy division as a sponsor, with the goal of selling spacecraft toys Watanabe recalled his only instruction was \"So long as there's a spaceship in it, you can do whatever you want.\" But upon viewing early footage, it became clear that Watanabe's vision for the series did not match Bandai's Believing the series would never sell toy merchandise, Bandai pulled out of the project, leaving it in development hell until sister company Bandai Visual stepped in to sponsor it Since there was no need to merchandise toys with the property any more, Watanabe had free rein in the development of the series [36] Watanabe wanted to design not just a space adventure series for adolescent boys but a program that would also appeal to sophisticated adults [23] During the making of Bebop, Watanabe often attempted to rally the animation staff by telling them that the show would be something memorable up to three decades later While some of them were doubtful of that at the time, Watanabe many years later expressed his happiness to have been proven right in retrospect He joked that if Bandai Visual had not intervened then \"you might be seeing me working the supermarket checkout counter right now.\" [36]\n\n\nMusic\nThe music for Cowboy Bebop was composed by Yoko Kanno [43] Kanno formed the blues and jazz band Seatbelts to perform the series' music [44] According to Kanno, the music was one of the first aspects of the series to begin production, before most of the characters, story, or animation had been finalized The genres she used for its composition were western, opera, and jazz [31] Watanabe noted that Kanno did not score the music exactly the way he told her to He stated, \"She gets inspired on her own, follows up on her own imagery, and comes to me saying 'this is the song we need for Cowboy Bebop', and composes something completely on her own.\" [39] Kanno herself was sometimes surprised at how pieces of her music were used in scenes, sometimes wishing it had been used elsewhere, though she also felt that none of their uses were \"inappropriate\" She was pleased with the working environment, finding the team very relaxed in comparison with other teams she had worked with [33]\n\n\nWeapons\n\nThe guns on the show were chosen by the director, Watanabe, and in discussion with set designer, Isamu Imakake, and mechanical designer, Kimitoshi Yamane Setting producer, Satoshi Toba said, \"They talked about how they didn't want common guns, because that wouldn't be very interesting, and so they decided on these guns.\" [47]\n\nDistribution\nCowboy Bebop debuted on TV Tokyo,

with the main focus being on its style and mixture of genres Miguel Douglas, describing the series style in a review, said that \"the series distinctly establishes itself outside the realm of conventional Japanese animation and instead chooses to forge its own path With a setting within the realm of science fiction, the series wisely offers a world that seems entirely realistic considering our present time Free from many of the elements that accompany science fiction in general—whether that be space aliens, giant robots, or laser guns—the series delegates itself towards presenting a world that is quite similar to our own albeit showcasing some technological advances.\" [129] Daryl Surat of Otaku USA, commenting on the series' appeal, said that it was \"that rare breed of science-fiction: 'accessible' Unlike many anime titles, viewers weren't expected to have knowledge of Japanese culture—character names, signs, and the like were primarily in English to begin with—or have seen any other anime series prior.\" [130] Michelle Onley Pirkle, in her book Science Fiction Film, Television, and Adaptation: Across the Screens, said that \"Cowboy Bebop is taking a new take on genre, not by creating unique images and sounds, but by playing 'freely' with, 'remixing', or adapting the images and sounds of other familiar genres in a dynamic way.\" [131]: 164  Robert Baigent, writing for the Graduate Journal of Asia-Pacific Studies, said that the series' appeal likely stemmed from the trend in anime to emulate Western fiction [27]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn March 2009, the print and

the informant was a defector from the Czechoslovak secret service, who had been debriefed by the US security services [15] At that time, Stonehouse successfully defended himself [16] In 2009, the spy allegation was substantiated in the official history of MI5, The Defence of the Realm (2009) by Cambridge historian Christopher Andrew [17] In December 2010, it was revealed that Margaret Thatcher had agreed to cover up revelations that Stonehouse had been a Czechoslovak spy in 1980, as there was insufficient evidence to bring him to trial [18] Until the 2012 exposure of Ray Mawby, briefly a member of a Conservative government, [19] Stonehouse was the only Minister known to have been an agent for the former Eastern bloc.\n\n\nBusiness interests\nHaving lost his ministerial salary in 1970, Stonehouse set up various companies in an attempt to supplement his salary as an MP By 1974 most of these companies were facing financial trouble, and Stonehouse had resorted to deceptive creative accounting Aware that the Department of Trade and Industry was looking at his affairs, Stonehouse decided that his best choice would be to flee the country Secret government documents, declassified in 2005, indicate that Stonehouse spent months rehearsing his new identity as 'Joseph Markham', the deceased husband of a constituent [20]\n\n\nDisappearance\nStonehouse maintained the pretence of normality until he faked his death on 20 November 1974, leaving a pile of clothes on a beach in Miami to make it appear that he had suffered a fatal misadventure while swimming [20] Stonehouse was presumed dead, and obituaries were published in British newspapers despite the fact that no corpse had been found In reality, Stonehouse was en route to Australia, some 9,000 miles (14,000 km) away, hoping to set up a new life with his mistress and secretary, Sheila Buckley [20]\n\n\nArrest and aftermath\nStonehouse was arrested in Melbourne on 24 December 1974 [22] He applied for the position of Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds while still in Australia (one of the ways for an MP to resign), but decided not to sign the papers On 17 July 1975, Stonehouse was extradited to the UK, escorted by Scotland Yard officers [23] He was remanded in Brixton Prison until August 1975 when he was released on bail Stonehouse continued to serve as an MP;

She had kept all these feelings to herself\" [116] Moved by her repeated wish to be an author, he began to consider having it published [117]\n\n\nReception\nThe diary has been praised for its literary merits Commenting on Anne Frank's writing style, the dramatist Meyer Levin commended Frank for \"sustaining the tension of a well-constructed novel\", [128] and was so impressed by the quality of her work that he collaborated with Otto Frank on a dramatization of the diary shortly after its publication [129] Levin became obsessed with Anne Frank, which he wrote about in his autobiography The Obsession The poet John Berryman called the book a unique depiction, not merely of adolescence but of the \"conversion of a child into a person as it is happening in a precise, confident, economical style stunning in its honesty\" [130]\n\n\nDenials of authenticity and legal action\nAfter the diary became widely known in the late 1950s, various allegations against the veracity of the diary and its contents appeared, with the earliest published criticisms occurring in Sweden and Norway [142] In 1957, Fria ord (\"Free Words\"), the magazine of the Swedish neofascist organization National League of Sweden, published an article by Danish author and critic Harald Nielsen, who had previously written antisemitic articles about the Danish-Jewish author Georg Brandes [143] Among other things, the article claimed that the diary had been written by Meyer Levin [144]\n\n\nCensored sections\nSince the original publication, several sections of Anne's diaries which were initially edited out have been revealed and included in new editions [152] These contain passages relating to her sexuality, exploration of her genitalia, and her thoughts on menstruation [153] [154] Following the conclusion of an ownership dispute in 2001, new editions have also incorporated pages removed by Otto Frank prior to publication which contain critical remarks about her parents' strained marriage and discuss her difficult relationship with her mother [126] [127] Two additional pages which Anne had pasted over with brown paper were deciphered in 2018, and contained an attempt to explain sex education and a handful of \"dirty\" jokes [154] [155]\n\n\nLegacy\nOn 3 May 1957, a group of Dutch citizens, including Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting to rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public The Anne Frank House opened on 3 May 1960 It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the Achterhuis, all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the wall where he recorded the advance of the Allied Forces, all now protected behind acrylic glass The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbors, also purchased by the Foundation These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world [156] One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received an average of 1.2 million visitors between 2011 and 2020 [157]\n\n\nSee also\nInformational notes\n\n\nReferences\nInformational notes\n\n\nBibliography\nBooks\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He was the first Indian individual to win an Olympic medal. Jadhav's life was marked by his passion for wrestling, which he inherited from his father, and his dedication to his country, which led him to participate in the Quit India Movement during the British rule.\n\n**Childhood**\n\nKD Jadhav was born in a village called Goleshwar in Karad taluka of District Satara in Maharashtra State. He was the youngest of five sons of a renowned wrestler, Dadasaheb Jadhav. Growing up in a household that lived and breathed wrestling, Jadhav was initiated into the sport at the age of five by his father. He did his schooling in Tilak High School in Karad taluka of Satara district between 1940 and 1947. During this period, Jadhav participated in the Quit India Movement, providing shelter and a hiding place to revolutionaries, and circulating letters against the British.\n\nJadhav's resolve to unfurl the tricolor flag in the Olympic on Independence Day, August 15, 1947, was a testament to his patriotism and commitment to his country. This event marked the beginning of his journey towards becoming a legendary wrestler and a symbol of India's sporting prowess.\n\n**Wrestling Career**\n\nJadhav's father, Dadasaheb, was a wrestling coach who trained his sons in the art of wrestling. Baburao Balawde and Belapuri Guruji, two renowned wrestlers, were Jadhav's mentors in college. Under their guidance, Jadhav honed his skills and developed a passion for the sport.\n\n**1948 Summer Olympics**\n\nJadhav's first experience of the big stage was at the 1948 London Olympics. His journey to London was funded by the Maharaja of Kolhapur. During his stay in London, Jadhav was trained by Rees Gardner, a former lightweight World champion from the United States. Gardner's guidance saw Jadhav finish sixth in the flyweight section, despite being unfamiliar with wrestling on the mat.\n\nJadhav stunned the audience by defeating the Australian wrestler, Bert Harris, in the first few minutes of the bout. He went on to defeat Billy Jernigan of the US but lost to Mansour Raeisi of Iran, which led to his elimination from the Games.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nFor the next four years, Jadhav trained even harder for the Helsinki Olympics. He moved up in weight and participated in the 125-pound bantamweight category, which saw wrestlers from twenty-four countries. Jadhav increased the tempo of his preparation for the next Olympics in Helsinki.\n\n**1952 Summer Olympics**\n\nAt the Helsinki Olympics, Jadhav was asked to fight against Rashid Mammadbeyov of the Soviet Union. As per the rules, a rest of at least 30 minutes was required between bouts, but no Indian official was available to press Jadhav's case. A tired Jadhav failed to inspire, and Mammadbeyov cashed in on the chance to reach the final.\n\nHowever, Jadhav's determination and perseverance paid off when he defeated the wrestlers from Canada, Mexico, and Germany, winning a bronze medal on July 23, 1952. This historic achievement made Jadhav the first individual medal winner from Independent India.\n\n**Return from the 1952 Summer Olympics**\n\nAlthough India's hockey team bagged a gold at the Helsinki games, Jadhav was the primary attraction of India's contingent that returned home after the Olympics. A huge crowd gathered at the Karad Railway Station to welcome their hero. A cavalcade of 151 bullock carts and dhols carried Jadhav for about 10 kilometers and passed through the village of Goleshwar.\n\n**Later Life and Death**\n\nIn 1955, Jadhav joined the police force as a sub-inspector. He won several competitions held within the Police department and performed national duties as a sports instructor. Despite serving the police department for twenty-seven years and retiring as an Asst. Police Commissioner, Jadhav had to fight for his pension later in life.\n\nFor years, Jadhav was neglected by the sports federation, and he had to live the final stages of his life in poverty. He died in a road accident in 1984, and his wife struggled to get any assistance from any quarter.\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\nJadhav's contributions to Indian sports and his patriotic spirit have been recognized through various awards and honors. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of Indian athletes and sports enthusiasts.\n\n**Related Pages**\n\n* List of Indian medalists at the Olympics\n* History of Indian wrestling\n* Indian sports in the 1950s\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n\n**External Links**\n\n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"K._D._Jadhav\" following this outline:\n\n\nChildhood\nBorn in a village called Goleshwar in Karad taluka of District Satara in Maharashtra State, KD Jadhav was the youngest of five sons of a renowned wrestler Dadasaheb Jadhav He did his schooling in Tilak High School in Karad taluka of Satara district between 1940 and 1947 He grew up in a household that lived and breathed wrestling [7] He participated in the Quit India Movement providing shelter and a hiding place to the revolutionaries, circulating letters  against the British were some of his contributions to the movement [7] He resolved to unfurl the tricolor flag in Olympic on Independence Day 15 August 1947 [citation needed]\n\n\nWrestling career\nHis father Dadasaheb was a wrestling coach and he initiated Khashaba into wrestling at the age of five His wrestling mentors in college were Baburao Balawde and Belapuri Guruji.\n\n\n1948 Summer Olympics\nJadhav's first feel of the big stage was at the 1948 London Olympics; his journey was funded by the Maharaja of Kolhapur [8] During his stay in London, he was trained by Rees Gardner, a former lightweight World champion from the United States It was Gardner's guidance that saw Jadhav finish sixth in the flyweight section, despite being unfamiliar with wrestling on the mat [9] He stunned the audience by defeating the  Australian wrestler Bert Harris in the first few minutes of the bout [7] He went on to defeat Billy Jernigan of the US, but lost to Mansour Raeisi of Iran, to be eliminated from the Games.\n\n\nAftermath\nFor the next four years, Jadhav trained even harder for the Helsinki Olympics where he moved up in weight and participated in the 125 lb bantamweight category which saw wrestlers from twenty-four countries, he increased the tempo of his preparation for the next Olympics in Helsinki [10]\n\n\n1952 Summer Olympics\nAfter the marathon bout, he was asked to fight Soviet Union's Rashid Mammadbeyov As per the rules a rest of at least 30 minutes were required between bouts, but no Indian official was available to press his case, a tired Jadhav, failed to inspire and Mammadbeyov cashed in on the chance to reach the final Defeating the wrestlers from Canada, Mexico and Germany, he won bronze medal on 23 July 1952 thereby creating history by becoming Independent India's  first individual medal winner [4] Khashaba's colleague, Krishnarao  Mangave a wrestler, also participated in the same Olympics in another category but missed the bronze medal by just one point.\n\n\nReturn from the 1952 Summer Olympics\nAlthough India's hockey team bagged a gold at the Helsinki games, Jadhav was the primary attraction of India's contingent that returned home after the Olympics Crowd gathered at the Karad Railway Station to welcome their hero, [3] a cavalcade of 151 bullock carts and dhols, carried their hero for about 10 km and passed through the village of Goleshwar.\n\n\nLater life and death\nIn 1955, he joined the police force as a sub-inspector where he won several competitions held within the Police department and also performed National duties as a sports instructor Despite serving the police department for twenty-seven years and retiring as an Asst Police Commissioner, Jadhav had to fight for pension later on in his life For years, he was neglected by the sports federation and had to live the final stages of his life in poverty He died in a road accident in 1984, his wife struggled to get any assistance from any quarter [11]\n\n\nAwards and honours\n\n\nRelated pages\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

positions and disables each laser At his wits' end, Mason is talked into buying the TT-15, a scorpion-like mobile assault robot by Traptech For the next several days, the TT-15 does its job gruesomely well; much to Mason's growing discomfort, especially at all the damage the robot leaves in its wake to his property After one of its laser shots destroys his mug, narrowly missing his head, a furious Mason storms into the barn; only to see the interior destroyed and the rats mounting a heroic final stand against the mech They manage to severely damage it using one of his tractors outfitted with

high-tech Traptech pest control company, Mason installs five TT-6 pulse lasers into his barn The lasers are effective until the leader of the rats discovers their positions and disables each laser At his wits' end, Mason is talked into buying the TT-15, a scorpion-like mobile assault robot by Traptech For the next several days, the TT-15 does its job gruesomely well; much to Mason's growing discomfort, especially at all the damage the robot leaves in its wake to his property After one of its laser shots destroys his mug, narrowly missing his head, a furious Mason storms into the barn; only to see the interior destroyed and the rats mounting a heroic final stand against the mech They manage to severely damage it using one of his tractors outfitted with the missing pulse laser as a tank Mason, impressed by the rats' courage and upset with the TT-15 now destroying his property, finishes the mech off with a shotgun blast to the CPU He makes peace with the rats; the group raises a glass of brandy, distilled from Mason's grain, and watches the sunset together as he cancels a check for Traptech.\n\n\nProduction\nThe project evolved from a late 2000s meeting whereby David Fincher

{"title": "Cat", "content": "\nEtymology and naming\nThe origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century [4] The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African language [5] The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates [6]\n\n\nTaxonomy\nThe scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat [1] [2] Felis catus domesticus was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777 [3] Felis daemon proposed by Konstantin Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the Transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat [19] [20]\n\n\nEvolution\nThe domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 10 to 15 million years ago [26] The evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia during the Miocene around 8.38 to 14.45 million years ago [27] Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at 6.46 to 16.76 million years ago [28] The genus Felis genetically diverged from other Felidae around 6 to 7 million years ago [27] Results of phylogenetic research shows that the wild members of this genus evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection [29] The domestic cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes [30] and roughly 20,000 genes [31]\n\n\nDomestication\nIt was long thought that the domestication of the cat began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC [33] [34] However, the earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 BC Since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland [35] Scientists therefore assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, in particular the house mouse (Mus musculus), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers This mutual relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years As agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats [32] [36] Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time [37]\n\n\nCharacteristics\nThe domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat [49] It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails Males are larger than females [50] Adult domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb) [29]\n\n\nSize\nThe domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat [49] It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails Males are larger than females [50] Adult domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb) [29]\n\n\nSkeleton\nCats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx) [51]: 11  The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis [51]: 16  Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head [52]\n\n\nSkull\nThe cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw [53]: 35  Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death [54] Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae [54]\n\n\nClaws\nCats have protractible and retractable claws [56] In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows for the silent stalking of prey The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hindfeet [57] Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces [58]\n\n\nAmbulation\nThe cat is digitigrade It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible leg [61] Unlike most mammals, it uses a \"pacing\" gait and moves both legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks This also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain As it speeds up from walking to trotting, its gait changes to a \"diagonal\" gait: The diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously [62]\n\n\nBalance\nCats are generally fond of sitting in high places or perching A higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory A cat falling from heights of up to 3 m (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws [63]\n\n\nCoats\nThe cat family (Felidae) can pass down many colors and patterns to their offspring The domestic cat genes MC1R and ASIP allow color variety in their coats The feline ASIP gene consists of three coding exons [67] Three novel microsatellite markers linked to ASIP were isolated from a domestic cat BAC clone containing this gene to perform linkage analysis on 89 domestic cats segregated for melanism The domestic cat family demonstrated a cosegregation between the ASIP allele and coat black coloration [68]\n\n\nSenses\nCats have excellent night vision and can see at one sixth the light level required for human vision [53]: 43  This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light [69] Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration [70] At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes [71] The domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited [72] A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision [73] Cats also have a nictitating membrane, allowing them to blink without hindering their vision.\n\n\nVision\nCats have excellent night vision and can see at one sixth the light level required for human vision [53]: 43  This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light [69] Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration [70] At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes [71] The domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited [72] A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision [73] Cats also have a nictitating membrane, allowing them to blink without hindering their vision.\n\n\nHearing\nThe domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz [74] It can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only detect frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz It can hear a range of 10.5 octaves, while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9 octaves [75] [76] Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large movable outer ears, the pinnae, which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise It can detect ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey [77] [78] Recent research has shown that cats have socio-spatial cognitive abilities to create mental maps of owners' locations based on hearing owners' voices [79]\n\n\nSmell\nCats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about 5.8 cm2 (0.90 in2) in area, which is about twice that of humans [80] Cats and many other animals have a Jacobson's organ in their mouths that is used in the behavioral process of flehmening It allows them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans cannot Cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol, [81] which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands [82] Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion [83] About 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone [84] This response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine (Actinidia polygama) and the herb valerian; it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors [85]\n\n\nTaste\nCats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so, compared to more than 9,000 on the human tongue) [86] Domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness [87] They, however, possess taste bud receptors specialized for acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastes [88]\n\n\nWhiskers\nTo aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage [53]: 47 \n\n\nBehavior\nOutdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night [91] Domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes but can range many hundreds of meters from this central point They establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging 7–28 ha (17–69 acres) [92] The timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied but being low-light predators, they are generally crepuscular, which means they tend to be more active near dawn and dusk However, house cats' behavior is also influenced by human activity and they may adapt to their owners' sleeping patterns to some extent [93] [94]\n\n\nSociability\nThe social behavior of the domestic cat ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that gather around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females [97] [98] Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others [99] Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories These territories are marked by urine spraying, rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation [82] Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling, and, if that does not work, by short and violent, noisy attacks Though cats do not have a social survival strategy or herd behavior, they always hunt alone [100]\n\n\nCommunication\nDomestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing [107] Their body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms; a raised tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicate hostility Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate ones [108] Feral cats are generally silent [109]: 208  Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head [97]\n\n\nGrooming\nCats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean [119] [120] The cat's tongue has backward-facing spines about 0.5 millimeter long, called lingual papillae, which contain keratin making them rigid [121] The papillae act like a hairbrush, and some cats, particularly long-haired cats, occasionally regurgitate sausage-shaped 2–3 cm (0.79–1.18 in) long hairballs of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming Hairballs can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the gut, as well as regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush [119]\n\n\nFighting\nAmong domestic cats, males are more likely to fight than females [122] Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male [123] Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home [122] Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones [124]\n\n\nHunting and feeding\nThe shape and structure of cats' cheeks is insufficient to allow them to take in liquids using suction Therefore, when drinking, they lap with the tongue to draw liquid upward into their mouths Lapping at a rate of four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the surface of the water, and quickly retracts it like a corkscrew, drawing water upward [130] [131]\n\n\nPlay\nDomestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of play This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey [147] Cats also engage in play fighting, both with each other and with humans This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and it might also reduce the fear that they associate with launching attacks on other animals [148]\n\n\nReproduction\nThe cat secretes and perceives pheromones [152] Female cats, called queens, are polyestrous with several estrus cycles during a year, lasting usually 21 days They are usually ready to mate between early February and August [153] in northern temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions [154]\n\n\nLifespan and health\nThe average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades In the early 1980s, it was about seven years, [165]: 33  [166] rising to 9.4 years in 1995 [165]: 33  and an average of about 13 years as of 2014 and 2023 [167] [168]\n\n\nDisease\nAbout 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats; many are similar to human inborn errors of metabolism [176] The high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the human diseases [177] [178] Diseases affecting domestic cats include acute infections, parasitic infestations, injuries, and chronic diseases such as kidney disease, thyroid disease, and arthritis Vaccinations are available for many infectious diseases, as are treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms, ticks, and fleas [179]\n\n\nEcology\nThe domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of the world [48] It is adaptable and now present on all continents except Antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands, even on the isolated Kerguelen Islands [180] [181] Due to its ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat, it is among the world's most invasive species [182] It lives on small islands with no human inhabitants [183] Feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands [184]\n\n\nHabitats\nThe domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of the world [48] It is adaptable and now present on all continents except Antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands, even on the isolated Kerguelen Islands [180] [181] Due to its ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat, it is among the world's most invasive species [182] It lives on small islands with no human inhabitants [183] Feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands [184]\n\n\nFerality\nFeral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas [187] The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the United States feral population range from 25 to 60 million [187] Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food [188] Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers [189]\n\n\nImpact on wildlife\nOn islands, birds can contribute as much as 60% of a cat's diet [191] In nearly all cases, the cat cannot be identified as the sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds, and in some instances, eradication of cats has caused a \"mesopredator release\" effect; [192] where the suppression of top carnivores creates an abundance of smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared prey Domestic cats are a contributing factor to the decline of many species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, to extinction The South Island piopio, Chatham rail, [143] and the New Zealand merganser [193] are a few from a long list, with the most extreme case being the flightless Lyall's wren, which was driven to extinction only a few years after its discovery [194] [195] One feral cat in New Zealand killed 102 New Zealand lesser short-tailed bats in seven days [196] In the United States, feral and free-ranging domestic cats kill an estimated 6.3–22.3 billion mammals annually [141]\n\n\nInteraction with humans\nCats are common pets throughout the world, and their worldwide population as of 2007 exceeded 500 million [198] As of 2017, [update] the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned [199] [200] and around 42 million households owning at least one cat [201] In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020 [update] [202] As of 2021, [update] there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world [203]\n\n\nShows\nA cat show is a judged event in which the owners of cats compete to win titles in various cat-registering organizations by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard [224] It is often required that a cat must be healthy and vaccinated to participate in a cat show [224] Both pedigreed and non-purebred companion (\"moggy\") cats are admissible, although the rules differ depending on the organization Competing cats are compared to the applicable breed standard, and assessed for temperament [224]\n\n\nInfection\nCats can be infected or infested with viruses, bacteria, fungus, protozoans, arthropods or worms that can transmit diseases to humans [225] In some cases, the cat exhibits no symptoms of the disease [226] The same disease can then become evident in a human [227] The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and immune status of the person Humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected Others might also acquire infections from cat feces and parasites exiting the cat's body [225] [228] Some of the infections of most concern include salmonella, cat-scratch disease, and toxoplasmosis [226]\n\n\nHistory and mythology\nIn ancient Egypt, cats were revered, and the goddess Bastet often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the war-like aspect of a lioness The Greek historian Herodotus reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrows Families took their dead cats to the sacred city of Bubastis, where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories Herodotus expressed astonishment at the domestic cats in Egypt, because he had only ever seen wildcats [229]\n\n\nSuperstitions and rituals\nMany cultures have negative superstitions about cats An example would be the belief that encountering a black cat (\"crossing one's path\") leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' familiars used to augment a witch's powers and skills The killing of cats in Medieval Ypres, Belgium, is commemorated in the innocuous present-day Kattenstoet (cat parade) [241] In mid-16th century France, cats would allegedly be burnt alive as a form of entertainment, particularly during midsummer festivals According to Norman Davies, the assembled people \"shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized\" [242] The remaining ashes were sometimes taken back home by the people for good luck [243]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**The Domestic Cat**\n\nThe domestic cat is a widely distributed species of cat that has been domesticated by humans for thousands of years. It is a member of the Felidae family and is closely related to the wildcat. The domestic cat is known for its small size, agility, and ability to adapt to a wide range of environments. It is a popular pet throughout the world and is known for its affectionate and playful nature.\n\n**Etymology and Naming**\n\nThe origin of the English word \"cat\" is thought to be the Late Latin word \"cattus\", which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century. The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African language, with possible sources or cognates including the Nubian word \"kaddîska\" meaning \"wildcat\" and the Nobiin word \"kadīs\". The domestic cat has undergone various name changes throughout history, with different cultures and languages adopting their own unique names for the species.\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\nThe scientific name \"Felis catus\" was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat. Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben later proposed the name \"Felis daemon\" for a black cat from the Transcaucasus, which was later identified as a domestic cat. The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae family, with a common ancestor that lived around 10-15 million years ago.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nThe domestic cat is a member of the Felidae family, which had a common ancestor around 10-15 million years ago. The evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia during the Miocene around 8.38-14.45 million years ago. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at 6.46-16.76 million years ago. The genus Felis genetically diverged from other Felidae around 6-7 million years ago. The domestic cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes.\n\n**Domestication**\n\nThe domestication of the cat is thought to have begun in ancient Egypt around 3100 BC, where cats were revered and protected. However, recent research has suggested that the earliest known indication of the taming of an African wildcat was in Shillourokambos, Cyprus, dating back to around 7500-7200 BC. It is believed that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, which were in turn attracted to agricultural crops.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nThe domestic cat has a number of distinctive characteristics that set it apart from its wild ancestors. These include a smaller skull and shorter bones, with an average length of around 46 cm (18 in) and a height of around 23-25 cm (9.1-9.8 in). Adult domestic cats typically weigh around 4-5 kg (8.8-11.0 lb). The cat's tail is long and slender, with around 30 cm (12 in) of length.\n\n**Size**\n\nThe domestic cat's size can vary depending on the breed, with some breeds being much larger or smaller than others. The average length of a domestic cat is around 46 cm (18 in), with a height of around 23-25 cm (9.1-9.8 in).\n\n**Skeleton**\n\nThe domestic cat's skeleton is similar to that of other mammals, with seven cervical vertebrae, 13 thoracic vertebrae, seven lumbar vertebrae, and three sacral vertebrae.

13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx) [51]: 11  The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis [51]: 16  Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head [52]\n\n\nSkull\nThe cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw [53]: 35  Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death [54] Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae [54]\n\n\nClaws\nCats have protractible and retractable claws [56] In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows for the silent stalking of prey The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hindfeet [57] Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces [58]\n\n\nAmbulation\nThe cat is digitigrade It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible leg [61] Unlike most mammals, it uses a \"pacing\" gait and moves both legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks This also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain As it speeds up from walking to trotting, its gait changes to a \"diagonal\" gait: The diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously [62]\n\n\nBalance\nCats are generally fond of sitting in high places or perching A higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory A cat falling from heights of up to 3 m (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws [63]\n\n\nCoats\nThe cat family (Felidae) can pass down many colors and patterns to their offspring The domestic cat genes MC1R and ASIP allow color variety in their coats The feline ASIP gene consists of three coding exons [67] Three novel microsatellite markers linked to ASIP were isolated from a domestic cat BAC clone containing this gene to perform linkage analysis on 89 domestic cats segregated for melanism The domestic cat family demonstrated a cosegregation between the ASIP allele and coat black coloration [68]\n\n\nSenses\nCats have excellent night vision and can see at one sixth the light level required for human vision [53]: 43  This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light [69] Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration [70] At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes [71] The domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited [72] A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision [73] Cats also have a nictitating membrane, allowing them to blink without hindering their vision.\n\n\nVision\nCats have excellent night vision and can see at one sixth the light level required for human vision [53]: 43  This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light [69] Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration [70] At low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes [71] The domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited [72] A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision [73] Cats also have a nictitating membrane, allowing them to blink without hindering their vision.\n\n\nHearing\nThe domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz [74] It can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only detect frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz It can hear a range of 10.5 octaves, while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9 octaves [75] [76] Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large movable outer ears, the pinnae, which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise It can detect ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey [77] [78] Recent research has shown that cats have socio-spatial cognitive abilities to create mental maps of owners' locations based on hearing owners' voices [79]\n\n\nSmell\nCats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about 5.8 cm2 (0.90 in2) in area, which is about twice that of humans [80] Cats and many other animals have a Jacobson's organ in their mouths that is used in the behavioral process of flehmening It allows them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans cannot Cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol, [81] which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands [82] Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion [83] About 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone [84] This response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine (Actinidia polygama) and the herb valerian; it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors [85]\n\n\nTaste\nCats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so, compared to more than 9,000 on the human tongue) [86] Domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness [87] They, however, possess taste bud receptors specialized for acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastes [88]\n\n\nWhiskers\nTo aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage [53]: 47 \n\n\nBehavior\nOutdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night [91] Domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes but can range many hundreds of meters from this central point They establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging 7–28 ha (17–69 acres) [92] The timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied but being low-light predators, they are generally crepuscular, which means they tend to be more active near dawn and dusk However, house cats' behavior is also influenced by human activity and they may adapt to their owners' sleeping patterns to some extent [93] [94]\n\n\nSociability\nThe social behavior of the domestic cat ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that gather around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females [97] [98] Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others [99] Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories These territories are marked by urine spraying, rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation [82] Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling, and, if that does not work, by short and violent, noisy attacks Though cats do not have a social survival strategy or herd behavior, they always hunt alone [100]\n\n\nCommunication\nDomestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing [107] Their body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms; a raised tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicate hostility Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate ones [108] Feral cats are generally silent [109]: 208  Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head [97]\n\n\nGrooming\nCats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean [119] [120] The cat's tongue has backward-facing spines about 0.5 millimeter long, called lingual papillae, which contain keratin making them rigid [121] The papillae act like a hairbrush, and some cats, particularly long-haired cats, occasionally regurgitate sausage-shaped 2–3 cm (0.79–1.18 in) long hairballs of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming Hairballs can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the gut, as well as regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush [119]\n\n\nFighting\nAmong domestic cats, males are more likely to fight than females [122] Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male [123] Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home [122] Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones [124]\n\n\nHunting and feeding\nThe shape and structure of cats' cheeks is insufficient to allow them to take in liquids using suction Therefore, when drinking, they lap with the tongue to draw liquid upward into their mouths Lapping at a rate of four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the surface of the water, and quickly retracts it like a corkscrew, drawing water upward [130] [131]\n\n\nPlay\nDomestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of play This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey [147] Cats also engage in play fighting, both with each other and with humans This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and it might also reduce the fear that they associate with launching attacks on other animals [148]\n\n\nReproduction\nThe cat secretes and perceives pheromones [152] Female cats, called queens, are polyestrous with several estrus cycles during a year, lasting usually 21 days They are usually ready to mate between early February and August [153] in northern temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions [154]\n\n\nLifespan and health\nThe average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades In the early 1980s, it was about seven years, [165]: 33  [166] rising to 9.4 years in 1995 [165]: 33  and an average of about 13 years as of 2014 and 2023 [167] [168]\n\n\nDisease\nAbout 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats; many are similar to human inborn errors of metabolism [176] The high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the human diseases [177] [178] Diseases affecting domestic cats include acute infections, parasitic infestations, injuries, and chronic diseases such as kidney disease, thyroid disease, and arthritis Vaccinations are available for many infectious diseases, as are treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms, ticks, and fleas [179]\n\n\nEcology\nThe domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of the world [48] It is adaptable and now present on all continents except Antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands, even on the isolated Kerguelen Islands [180] [181] Due to its ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat, it is among the world's most invasive species [182] It lives on small islands with no human inhabitants [183] Feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands [184]\n\n\nHabitats\nThe domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of the world [48] It is adaptable and now present on all continents except Antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands, even on the isolated Kerguelen Islands [180] [181] Due to its ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat, it is among the world's most invasive species [182] It lives on small islands with no human inhabitants [183] Feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands [184]\n\n\nFerality\nFeral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas [187] The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the United States feral population range from 25 to 60 million [187] Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food [188] Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum, with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers [189]\n\n\nImpact on wildlife\nOn islands, birds can contribute as much as 60% of a cat's diet [191] In nearly all cases, the cat cannot be identified as the sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds, and in some instances, eradication of cats has caused a \"mesopredator release\" effect; [192] where the suppression of top carnivores creates an abundance of smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared prey Domestic cats are a contributing factor to the decline of many species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, to extinction The South Island piopio, Chatham rail, [143] and the New Zealand merganser [193] are a few from a long list, with the most extreme case being the flightless Lyall's wren, which was driven to extinction only a few years after its discovery [194] [195] One feral cat in New Zealand killed 102 New Zealand lesser short-tailed bats in seven days [196] In the United States, feral and free-ranging domestic cats kill an estimated 6.3–22.3 billion mammals annually [141]\n\n\nInteraction with humans\nCats are common pets throughout the world, and their worldwide population as of 2007 exceeded 500 million [198] As of 2017, [update] the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned [199] [200] and around 42 million households owning at least one cat [201] In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020 [update] [202] As of 2021, [update] there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world [203]\n\n\nShows\nA cat show is a judged event in which the owners of cats compete to win titles in various cat-registering organizations by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard [224] It is often required that a cat must be healthy and vaccinated to participate in a cat show [224] Both pedigreed and non-purebred companion (\"moggy\") cats are admissible, although the rules differ depending on the organization Competing cats are compared to the applicable breed standard, and assessed for temperament [224]\n\n\nInfection\nCats can be infected or infested with viruses, bacteria, fungus, protozoans, arthropods or worms that can transmit diseases to humans [225] In some cases, the cat exhibits no symptoms of the disease [226] The same disease can then become evident in a human [227] The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and immune status of the person Humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected Others might also acquire infections from cat feces and parasites exiting the cat's body [225] [228] Some of the infections of most concern include salmonella, cat-scratch disease, and toxoplasmosis [226]\n\n\nHistory and mythology\nIn ancient Egypt, cats were revered, and the goddess Bastet often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the war-like aspect of a lioness The Greek historian Herodotus reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrows Families took their dead cats to the sacred city of Bubastis, where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories Herodotus expressed astonishment at the domestic cats in Egypt, because he had only ever seen wildcats [229]\n\n\nSuperstitions and rituals\nMany cultures have negative superstitions about cats An example would be the belief that encountering a black cat (\"crossing one's path\") leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' familiars used to augment a witch's powers and skills The killing of cats in Medieval Ypres, Belgium, is commemorated in the innocuous present-day Kattenstoet (cat parade) [241] In mid-16th century France, cats would allegedly be burnt alive as a form of entertainment, particularly during midsummer festivals According to Norman Davies, the assembled people \"shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized\" [242] The remaining ashes were sometimes taken back home by the people for good luck [243]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.
