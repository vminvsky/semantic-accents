It is the second book in Herbert's Dune series and continues the story of Paul Atreides, also known as Muad'Dib, who has become the Emperor of the known universe. The novel explores the complexities of power, politics, and the consequences of prescience, as Paul grapples with the weight of his own destiny and the future of humanity.\n\n**Plot**\n\nTwelve years have passed since Paul's rise to power, and he has become the focal point of a vast empire. However, his prescience has also unleashed a jihad, a Holy War, that has spread across the galaxy, bringing about the deaths of 61 billion people. Despite this, Paul's visions indicate that this is far from the worst possible outcome for humanity. He hopes to set humanity on a course that will not inevitably lead to stagnation and destruction, while also acting as the ruler of the empire and the messiah to the Fremen.\n\nAs Paul navigates the complexities of his own power and the weight of his prescience, he becomes increasingly isolated and withdrawn. He is surrounded by advisors and enemies who seek to manipulate him for their own purposes, and he is forced to confront the paradoxes of his own destiny. The novel explores the idea that even the most well-intentioned actions can have unintended consequences, and that the pursuit of power can lead to corruption and destruction.\n\n**Publication History**\n\nDune Messiah was initially published as a five-part serial in Galaxy Science Fiction magazine in 1969. The novel was later published in hardback by Putnam in October of the same year, with different prologues summarizing the events of Dune in the American and British editions. The Science Fiction Book Club published Dune Messiah, along with the sequel Children of Dune, in a single volume in 2002, and Gollancz published the novel as part of The Great Dune Trilogy in 1979.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nHerbert has likened the first three novels of the Dune series, including Dune Messiah, to a fugue, with Dune being the heroic melody and Dune Messiah being its inversion. Paul rises to power in Dune by seizing control of the single critical resource in the universe, melange, and his enemies are dead or overthrown. However, in Dune Messiah, Paul's power is undermined by a series of failures and philosophical paradoxes, which serve to subvert the expectations of the reader.\n\nThis approach allows Herbert to explore the complexities of power and the consequences of prescience, and to challenge the reader's assumptions about the nature of reality. The novel is a commentary on the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of considering the unintended consequences of one's actions.\n\n**Critical Reception**\n\nDune Messiah has received widespread critical acclaim for its complexity and depth. Galaxy Science Fiction described the novel as \"brilliant,\" and noted that it was \"all that Dune was, and maybe a little more.\" Spider Robinson enjoyed the book, despite finding holes in its logic, and praised its \"majestic rolling grandeur.\" Challenging Destiny called the novel \"the perfect companion piece to Dune,\" and noted that it was \"fascinating.\"\n\n**Adaptations**\n\nDavid Lynch had planned to adapt sequels to Dune during the production of the 1984 film, with a script tentatively titled Dune II: The Dune Messiah. However, the project was ultimately abandoned due to the critical and commercial failure of the original film. The partial script developed by Lynch, along with notes by Frank Herbert, has recently been discovered at Herbert's archives at California State University, Fullerton.\n\nWhile the script remains unfinished, it provides a fascinating glimpse into the potential direction that the adaptation could have taken. It is a testament to the enduring popularity and influence of Dune, and a reminder of the importance of exploring the complexities of power and the consequences of prescience in science fiction.\n\n**References**\n\n* Herbert, Frank.

The mutations in the Mu variant include:\n\n* T95I\n* Y144S\n* Y145N\n* R346K\n* E484K (also known as the escape mutation)\n* N501Y\n* D614G\n* P681H\n* D950N\n\nThe Mu variant also has an insertion of one amino acid at position 144/145 of the spike protein, which is conventionally notated as Y144S and Y145N. This mutation is significant because it is located in a region of the spike protein that is targeted by some COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIn addition to the mutations in the spike protein, the Mu variant has mutations in other parts of the virus, including:\n\n* ORF1a: T1055A, T1538I, T3255I, Q3729R\n* ORF1b: P314L, P1342S\n* N: T205I\n* ORF3a: Q57H, V256I, N257Q, P258*\n* ORF8: T11K, P38S, S67F\n\n**History**\n\nThe Mu variant was first documented in Colombia in January 2021. Since then, it has been detected in multiple countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Peru.\n\nIn August 2021, the WHO designated the Mu variant as a variant of interest, indicating that it has been detected in multiple countries and has potential public health implications.\n\nIn September 2021, the Mu variant was detected in the United States, specifically in Florida and Texas.\n\n**Statistics**\n\nThe Mu variant has been detected in multiple countries around the world. According to the WHO, the variant has been detected in at least 39 countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Peru.\n\nThe Mu variant has also been detected in the United States, specifically in Florida and Texas.\n\n**See also**\n\n* SARS-CoV-2\n* COVID-19\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n* SARS-CoV-2 variants\n* World Health Organization\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include any citations or references, as per the requirements.\n\n**External links**\n\n* World Health Organization: SARS-CoV-2 Mu variant\n* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: SARS-CoV-2 Mu variant\n* European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control: SARS-CoV-2 Mu variant", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"SARS-CoV-2_Mu_variant\" following this outline:\n\n\nClassification\nIn January 2021, the lineage was first documented in Colombia and was named as lineage B.1.621 [8]\n\n\nNaming\nIn January 2021, the lineage was first documented in Colombia and was named as lineage B.1.621 [8]\n\n\nMutations\nThe Mu genome has a total number of 21 mutations, including 9 amino acid mutations, all of which are in the virus's spike protein code: T95I, Y144S, Y145N, R346K, E484K or the escape mutation, N501Y, D614G, P681H, and D950N [10]  It has an insertion of one amino acid at position 144/145 of the spike protein, giving a total mutation YY144–145TSN That mutation is conventionally notated as Y144S and Y145N because insertions would break a lot of comparison tools It also features a frame-shift deletion of four nucleotides in ORF3a that generates a stop codon two amino acids The mutation is labeled as V256I, N257Q, and P258* The list of defining mutations are: S: T95I, Y144S, Y145N, R346K, E484K, N501Y, D614G, P681H, and D950N; ORF1a: T1055A, T1538I, T3255I, Q3729R; ORF1b: P314L, P1342S; N: T205I, ORF3a: Q57H, V256I, N257Q, P258*; ORF8: T11K, P38S, S67F [11] Mutations in viruses are not new All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, undergo change over time Most of these changes are inconsequential, but some can alter properties to make these viruses more virulent or escape the treatment or vaccines [6]\n\n\nHistory\nAugust 6:\n\n\nAugust 2021\nAugust 6:\n\n\nSeptember 2021\nSeptember 2:\n\n\nStatistics\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The music that has always done well during wartime has always been music that makes you want to escape.\" [48] In his review of the album, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote \"It's the most dramatic image overhaul you're ever likely to see\" [48] Both \"Intuition\" and its follow-up single \"Stand\" were number one hits on the Dance Club Songs chart [49]\n\n\n2007–2008: Label shift and Perfectly Clear\nKilcher released a video for \"Quest for Love\", the lead single from the movie Arthur and the Invisibles, recorded in 2006; the song is only available on the soundtrack for the film, which was released in January 2007 [55] In early February 2007 Jewel recorded a duet with Jason Michael Carroll, \"No Good in Goodbye\", that was featured on Carroll's debut CD, Waitin' in the Country She also made a promotional appearance on the T in Boston for the Verizon Yellow Pages, playing songs on a moving subway car and then doing an hour-long acoustic concert in South Station.\n\n\n2009–2013: Lullaby and other releases\nIn early 2009, it was announced that Kilcher would release a new studio album titled Lullaby, a collection of lullabies which she described as \"not just for children, but also adults\" Its lead single, \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\", was released on iTunes on March 17, 2009 The album was released on May 5, 2009 \"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\" was No.1 on The Top Children's Songs the week of release Like 2011's The Merry Goes 'Round, it is sold under the Fisher Price brand [62] which Jewel described as \"a great partnership\" [63]\n\n\n2014–2018: Picking Up the Pieces\nIn February 2014, Kilcher began work on her next album and confirmed that it will not be released by a major record label, and that she was producing it herself [72] In April 2015, she appeared as a guest musician on Blues Traveler's album Blow Up the Moon, co-writing the song \"Hearts Still Awake\" [73] On June 28, she revealed in a Q&A on Facebook that her upcoming album would be released in the second week of September of that year, and would feature a folk sound recorded with a live band On July 21, Kilcher confirmed the title as Picking Up the Pieces [74] Picking Up the Pieces was released on September 11, 2015 Four days later, on September 15, she released her third book, a new memoir entitled Never Broken: Songs Are Only Half the Story [75]\n\n\n2019–present: The Masked Singer and Freewheelin' Woman\nTowards the end of 2019, Kilcher released a new song \"No More Tears\", which was written and recorded for Lost in America, a documentary about youth homelessness in America by Rotimi Rainwater In an interview with American Songwriter, Kilcher explained that, in addition to being an executive producer on the documentary, she was inspired to write the track because she was moved by the stories of the individuals featured in the film and related those to her own experiences of being homeless when she was eighteen In the same interview, it was confirmed that \"No More Tears\" would also be the first track released from her upcoming album which she hoped to release sometime in 2020 [82]\n\n\nArtistry\nJewel is a soprano [94] Caitlin Gibson of The Washington Post described Jewel's vocal versatility, stating that \"she can summon many voices—deep and powerful, girlish and sweet, piercing and agile.\" Gibson also commented about Jewel's debut; \"In an era still gripped by grunge,  [she] climbed to the top of the pop charts with sweet, simple folk tunes\" [1] Her fifth studio album 0304 (2003) was a departure from her previous folk rock-oriented [95] albums and incorporates a more general pop sound Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote about 0304, describing it as \"A record that (is) lyric-driven, like Cole Porter stuff, that also has a lot of swing.. that combined dance, urban, and folk music  [...]  [it is] an original-sounding album, something with more imagination than the average dance-pop record Better still, it sounds more authentic (and boasts a better set of songs) than her previous records, which were either too ramshackle or too self-serious and doggedly somber to really reveal much character.\" [96] Perfectly Clear (2008) was influenced by her appreciation for country music, [95] while Picking Up The Pieces (2015) saw Jewel \"going back to  [her] folk/American roots that  [she] began with.\" [97]\n\n\nOther work\nIn 1998, Jewel published a book of poetry titled A Night Without Armor Although it sold over 1 million copies and was a New York Times best-seller, it received mixed reviews [99] During an MTV interview in 1998, Kurt Loder pointed out the incorrect usage, in her book of poetry, of the word \"casualty\" (instead of the intended \"casualness\") to which Jewel responded, \"You're a smartass for pointing that out Next topic.\" [100] In the fall of 1998, the poet Beau Sia composed a book-length response to A Night Without Armor that he titled A Night Without Armor II: The Revenge [101] The reviewer Edna Gundersen, writing in USA Today, noted, \"Hers is flowery and sensitive His is wry and absurd.\" [102]\n\n\nLiterary works\nIn 1998, Jewel published a book of poetry titled A Night Without Armor Although it sold over 1 million copies and was a New York Times best-seller, it received mixed reviews [99] During an MTV interview in 1998, Kurt Loder pointed out the incorrect usage, in her book of poetry, of the word \"casualty\" (instead of the intended \"casualness\") to which Jewel responded, \"You're a smartass for pointing that out Next topic.\" [100] In the fall of 1998, the poet Beau Sia composed a book-length response to A Night Without Armor that he titled A Night Without Armor II: The Revenge [101] The reviewer Edna Gundersen, writing in USA Today, noted, \"Hers is flowery and sensitive His is wry and absurd.\" [102]\n\n\nArt World Projects\nIn 2024, Jewel created a museum-wide show at the Crystal Bridges Museum in Bentonville, Arkansas called The Portal: An Art Experience by Jewel The show featured her own paintings, a special music and technology installation, and art works from the museum's collection including, Mickalene Thomas, Ruth Asawa, Julie Mehretu, and Alma Thomas The show is organized around Jewel's idea of “Three Spheres,” or realms, of human existence: the inner world, the outer world, and the unseen world [107]\n\n\nHumanitarian activism\nJewel formed the nonprofit organization Higher Ground for Humanity along with her mother, Lenedra J Carroll, and Jewel's older brother, Shane Kilcher The organization's focus is education, sustainable improvements, and building alliances with like-minded organizations [110] Jewel donates a portion of her income to the organization and often holds events to benefit the organization [111] The organization tends to parallel Jewel's career since she provides the majority of the organization's funding As of 2005 [update], the activities of the organization were concluded [citation needed] One early grantee was the Global Youth Action Network, which has become one of the largest youth movements around the United Nations.\n\n\nPersonal life\nJewel and actor Sean Penn began dating in 1995 after Penn spotted her performing on Late Night with Conan O'Brien Penn invited Jewel to compose a song for his film The Crossing Guard and followed her on tour [119]\n\n\nAccolades\nCo-headlining\n\n\nTours\nCo-headlining\n\n\nDiscography\n1999\n\n\nVideography\n1999\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nOther credits\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Jewel (singer)\n\nJewel is a multi-platinum, award-winning American singer-songwriter and musician.

The music that has always done well during wartime has always been music that makes you want to escape.\" [48] In his review of the album, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote \"It's the most dramatic image overhaul you're ever likely to see\" [48] Both \"Intuition\" and its follow-up single \"Stand\" were number one hits on the Dance Club Songs chart [49]\n\n\n2007–2008: Label shift and Perfectly Clear\nKilcher released a video for \"Quest for Love\", the lead single from the movie Arthur and the Invisibles, recorded in 2006;

\"In an era still gripped by grunge,  [she] climbed to the top of the pop charts with sweet, simple folk tunes\" [1] Her fifth studio album 0304 (2003) was a departure from her previous folk rock-oriented [95] albums and incorporates a more general pop sound Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote about 0304, describing it as \"A record that (is) lyric-driven, like Cole Porter stuff, that also has a lot of swing.. that combined dance, urban, and folk music  [...]  [it is] an original-sounding album, something with more imagination than the average dance-pop record Better still, it sounds more authentic (and boasts a better set of songs) than her previous records, which were either too ramshackle or too self-serious and doggedly somber to really reveal much character.\" [96] Perfectly Clear (2008) was influenced by her appreciation for country music, [95] while Picking Up The Pieces (2015) saw Jewel \"going back to  [her] folk/American roots that  [she] began with.\" [97]\n\n\nOther work\nIn 1998, Jewel published a book of poetry titled A Night Without Armor Although it sold over 1 million copies and was a New York Times best-seller, it received mixed reviews [99] During an MTV interview in 1998, Kurt Loder pointed out the incorrect usage, in her book of poetry, of the word \"casualty\" (instead of the intended \"casualness\") to which Jewel responded, \"You're a smartass for pointing that out Next topic.\" [100] In the fall of 1998, the poet Beau Sia composed a book-length response to A Night Without Armor that he titled A Night Without Armor II: The Revenge [101] The reviewer Edna Gundersen, writing in USA Today, noted, \"Hers is flowery and sensitive His is wry and absurd.\" [102]\n\n\nLiterary works\nIn 1998, Jewel published a book of poetry titled A Night Without Armor Although it sold over 1 million copies and was a New York Times best-seller, it received mixed reviews [99] During an MTV interview in 1998, Kurt Loder pointed out the incorrect usage, in her book of poetry, of the word \"casualty\" (instead of the intended \"casualness\") to which Jewel responded, \"You're a smartass for pointing that out Next topic.\" [100] In the fall of 1998, the poet Beau Sia composed a book-length response to A Night Without Armor that he titled A Night Without Armor II: The Revenge [101] The reviewer Edna Gundersen, writing in USA Today, noted, \"Hers is flowery and sensitive His is wry and absurd.\" [102]\n\n\nArt World Projects\nIn 2024, Jewel created a museum-wide show at the Crystal Bridges Museum in Bentonville, Arkansas called The Portal: An Art Experience by Jewel The show featured her own paintings, a special music and technology installation, and art works from the museum's collection including, Mickalene Thomas, Ruth Asawa, Julie Mehretu, and Alma Thomas The show is organized around Jewel's idea of “Three Spheres,” or realms, of human existence: the inner world, the outer world, and the unseen world [107]\n\n\nHumanitarian activism\nJewel formed the nonprofit organization Higher Ground for Humanity along with her mother, Lenedra J Carroll, and Jewel's older brother, Shane Kilcher The organization's focus is education, sustainable improvements, and building alliances with like-minded organizations [110] Jewel donates a portion of her income to the organization and often holds events to benefit the organization [111] The organization tends to parallel Jewel's career since she provides the majority of the organization's funding As of 2005 [update], the activities of the organization were concluded [citation needed] One early grantee was the Global Youth Action Network, which has become one of the largest youth movements around the United Nations.\n\n\nPersonal life\nJewel and actor Sean Penn began dating in 1995 after Penn spotted her performing on Late Night with Conan O'Brien Penn invited Jewel to compose a song for his film The Crossing Guard and followed her on tour [119]\n\n\nAccolades\nCo-headlining\n\n\nTours\nCo-headlining\n\n\nDiscography\n1999\n\n\nVideography\n1999\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nOther credits\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

computers, emails between then-Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal and president Doug Belgrad were released, saying that Sony was planning to \"rejuvenate\" the Spider-Man franchise by developing an animated comedy film with Phil Lord and Christopher Miller [39] During her time as Sony's co-chairman, Pascal approached Lord and Miller about making an animated Spider-Man movie, to which Lord and Miller agreed with the condition that they could adapt Dan Slott's 2014 \"Spider-Verse\" comic book storyline and star Miles Morales as the protagonist [40] Sony executives were set to talk about the project further in a discussion regarding several Spider-Man spin-off films at a summit in January 2015 [39] At the 2015 CinemaCon in April, Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman announced that the animated Spider-Man film had a July 20, 2018 release date, and would be produced by Lord and Miller, Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach, and Pascal, with Lord and Miller also writing a treatment for the film Rothman said that it would \"co-exist\" with the live-action Spider-Man films; though Sony soon stated that the film would \"exist independently of the projects in the live-action Spider-Man universe\", [41] as it is set in an alternate universe from those films, without the version of Spider-Man as seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) [42]\n\n\nDevelopment\nFollowing the November

in the live-action Spider-Man universe\", [41] as it is set in an alternate universe from those films, without the version of Spider-Man as seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) [42]\n\n\nWriting\nThe script is credited to Lord and Rothman from a story by Lord, making it the first film Lord had written without Miller [50] As six Spider-Man films had been made already, the team agreed they first needed to decide why this one needed to be made; their answer was to tell the story of Morales, who had yet to appear in a film [51] Brian Michael Bendis, co-creator of Miles Morales, consulted on the film adaptation [52] The first full cut of animatics and storyboards for the film was over two hours long, which is uncommon for animated films The directors attributed this mostly to Lord and Miller, and their approach of adding as many elements to the film as they could at the outset, with the intention of seeing what it could \"handle\"; and then shaping the film from there They said that the final runtime would be between 90 and 120 minutes, the standard length of an animated film They added that a balance would have to be found between the expectations of an animated film that will have a large audience of children, and the requirements of the story The directors felt the plot was similar to the live-action Spider-Man films, especially due to the large number of characters in the film [51] One year prior to its release, Lord and Rothman opted to rewrite the story as they had to \"figure out how to reshape sequences we had already boarded and animated and fold them in with new stuff\" They also added that they had substantially rewritten the third act [53]\n\n\nCasting\nShameik Moore was cast as Miles Morales in April 2017, along with Liev Schreiber as the film's then-unspecified main villain [7] A month later, Mahershala Ali and Brian Tyree Henry joined the cast as Morales's uncle Aaron Davis and father Jefferson Davis, respectively [13] That December, Lord and Miller said that an adult Peter Parker / Spider-Man would appear in the film as a mentor to Morales [58] Maguire, who played Spider-Man in the Sam Raimi films, was initially considered to be cast as this version of Spider-Man, but the idea was dropped so as not to confuse the audience with the concept of the \"Spider-Verse\" [59] Jake Johnson was ultimately cast in the role in April 2018 [10] It was also announced that the characters Green Goblin, Kingpin, and Prowler would also appear, with their designs based on the Ultimate Marvel comic series [60] Kathryn Hahn was cast as a female variant of Doctor Octopus called Olivia Octavius; earlier drafts for the film had the character's known male version as a The Big Lebowski (1998)-type of character, but Persichetti came up with changing the character's gender due to his kids being friends with Hahn's [61]\n\n\nMusic\nDaniel Pemberton was announced as the film's composer in July 2018 [65] A full soundtrack album was released by Republic Records on December 14, the day of the film's release, and was curated to represent what a teen like Miles Morales would listen to [66] Artists on the soundtrack include Jaden Smith, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Post Malone, Ty Dolla Sign, Juice Wrld, Swae Lee, Ski Mask the Slump God, Vince Staples, Thutmose, and the late XXXTentacion, who was marketed as a special guest on the Lil Wayne and Ty Dolla Sign song \"Scared of the Dark\" A separate album containing Pemberton's score was released by Sony Classical Records on December 17 [67] On December 20, Sony Pictures Animation announced an extended play album, A Very Spidey Christmas, based on a throwaway joke at the beginning of the film and consisting of five Christmas songs performed by cast members Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, and Chris Pine The EP was released on digital platforms the next day [68] [69]\n\n\nAnimation and design\nThe film's animation was handled by Sony Pictures Imageworks in Vancouver, who had handled nearly all of Sony Pictures Animation's prior films, as well as visual effects for all prior Spider-Man films According to Lord and Miller, they wanted the film to feel like the viewer had \"walked inside a comic book\", and were excited about telling the story in a way they believed the live-action films could not [58] Persichetti concurred, feeling that animation was the best medium to honor the comics, allowing the production team to adapt 70-year-old comic art techniques for the film's visual language [51] It took around a year for two animators to create 10 seconds of footage that reflected the producers' vision; the animation work was created from there [71] During initial development, the directors worked with a single animator, Alberto Mielgo, to establish the film's look [72] Although Mielgo was let go by Sony before the movie had been significantly produced due to artistic differences, [73] this number eventually grew to 60 animators during production It became clear that they could not complete the film on time, so the crew was expanded further The number had reached 142 animators by August 2018 [51] and at one point to 177 animators, [74] the largest animation crew that Sony Pictures Imageworks had ever used for a film Animation work was completed in October 2018 [51]\n\n\nRelease\nA thirty-second sizzle reel from the film was shown at a Sony Pictures Animation presentation in January 2017, revealing that the film focuses on Miles Morales Scott Mendelson at Forbes said the footage \"looked incredible   [sic] stylized and resembled a cross between an Alex Ross image and a psychedelic  [comic] cover\", but felt the most significant element of the presentation was the confirmation of Morales, meaning \"2018 will offer another comic book superhero movie featuring a hero of color, during the same year as Marvel's Black Panther.\" [46] A teaser trailer for the film debuted at the 2017 Comic Con Experience, and was then released online [49] Chris Cabin at Collider felt the trailer \"looks much better than it ever needed to The style and design that is on display .. is vibrant and immediately engaging on a visual level, showing a genuine sense of personality to the production.\" [86] io9's Julie Muncy called the trailer's visual design \"elegant\" and \"fresh\", and highlighted the use of music by Vince Staples, which was also used for the Black Panther trailers [87]\n\n\nMarketing\nA thirty-second sizzle reel from the film was shown at a Sony Pictures Animation presentation in January

that Sony was planning to \"rejuvenate\" the Spider-Man franchise by developing an animated comedy film with Phil Lord and Christopher Miller [39] During her time as Sony's co-chairman, Pascal approached Lord and Miller about making an animated Spider-Man movie, to which Lord and Miller agreed with the condition that they could adapt Dan Slott's 2014 \"Spider-Verse\" comic book storyline and star Miles Morales as the protagonist [40] Sony executives were set to talk about the project further in a discussion regarding several Spider-Man spin-off films at a summit in January 2015 [39] At the 2015 CinemaCon in April, Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman announced that the animated Spider-Man film had a July 20, 2018 release date, and would be produced by Lord and Miller, Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach, and Pascal, with Lord and Miller also writing a treatment for the film Rothman said that it would \"co-exist\" with the live-action Spider-Man films; though Sony soon stated that the film would \"exist independently of the projects in the live-action Spider-Man universe\", [41] as it is set in an alternate universe from those films, without the version of Spider-Man as seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) [42]\n\n\nWriting\nThe script is credited to Lord and Rothman from a story by Lord, making it the first film Lord had written without Miller [50] As six Spider-Man films had been made already, the team agreed they first needed to decide why this one needed to be made; their answer was to tell the story of Morales, who had yet to appear in a film [51] Brian Michael Bendis, co-creator of Miles Morales, consulted on the film adaptation [52] The first full cut of animatics and storyboards for the film was over two hours long, which is uncommon for animated films The directors attributed this mostly to Lord and Miller, and their approach of adding as many elements to the film as they could at the outset, with the intention of seeing what it could \"handle\"; and then shaping the film from there They said that the final runtime would be between 90 and 120 minutes, the standard length of an animated film They added that a balance would have to be found between the expectations of an animated film that will have a large audience of children, and the requirements of the story The directors felt the plot was similar to the live-action Spider-Man films, especially due to the large number of characters in the film [51] One year prior to its release, Lord and Rothman opted to rewrite the story as they had to \"figure out how to reshape sequences we had already boarded and animated and fold them in with new stuff\" They also added that they had substantially rewritten the third act [53]\n\n\nCasting\nShameik Moore was cast as Miles Morales in April 2017, along with Liev Schreiber as the film's then-unspecified main villain [7] A month later, Mahershala Ali and Brian Tyree Henry joined the cast as Morales's uncle Aaron Davis and father Jefferson Davis, respectively [13] That December, Lord and Miller said that an adult Peter Parker / Spider-Man would appear in the film as a mentor to Morales [58] Maguire, who played Spider-Man in the Sam Raimi films, was initially considered to be cast as this version of Spider-Man, but the idea was dropped so as not to confuse the audience with the concept of the \"Spider-Verse\" [59] Jake Johnson was ultimately cast in the role in April 2018 [10] It was also announced that the characters Green Goblin, Kingpin, and Prowler would also appear, with their designs based on the Ultimate Marvel comic series [60] Kathryn Hahn was cast as a female variant of Doctor Octopus called Olivia Octavius; earlier drafts for the film had the character's known male version as a The Big Lebowski (1998)-type of character, but Persichetti came up with changing the character's gender due to his kids being friends with Hahn's [61]\n\n\nMusic\nDaniel Pemberton was announced as the film's composer in July 2018 [65] A full soundtrack album was released by Republic Records on December 14, the day of the film's release, and was curated to represent what a teen like Miles Morales would listen to [66] Artists on the soundtrack include Jaden Smith, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Post Malone, Ty Dolla Sign, Juice Wrld, Swae Lee, Ski Mask the Slump God, Vince Staples, Thutmose, and the late XXXTentacion, who was marketed as a special guest on the Lil Wayne and Ty Dolla Sign song \"Scared of the Dark\" A separate album containing Pemberton's score was released by Sony Classical Records on December 17 [67] On December 20, Sony Pictures Animation announced an extended play album, A Very Spidey Christmas, based on a throwaway joke at the beginning of the film and consisting of five Christmas songs performed by cast members Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, and Chris Pine The EP was released on digital platforms the next day [68] [69]\n\n\nAnimation and design\nThe film's animation was handled by Sony Pictures Imageworks in Vancouver, who had handled nearly all of Sony Pictures Animation's prior films, as well as visual effects for all prior Spider-Man films According to Lord and Miller, they wanted the film to feel like the viewer had \"walked inside a comic book\", and were excited about telling the story in a way they believed the live-action films could not [58] Persichetti concurred, feeling that animation was the best medium to honor the comics, allowing the production team to adapt 70-year-old comic art techniques for the film's visual language [51] It took around a year for two animators to create 10 seconds of footage that reflected the producers' vision; the animation work was created from there [71] During initial development, the directors worked with a single animator, Alberto Mielgo, to establish the film's look [72] Although Mielgo was let go by Sony before the movie had been significantly produced due to artistic differences, [73] this number eventually grew to 60 animators during production It became clear that they could not complete the film on time, so the crew was expanded further The number had reached 142 animators by August 2018 [51] and at one point to 177 animators, [74] the largest animation crew that Sony Pictures Imageworks had ever used for a film Animation work was completed in October 2018 [51]\n\n\nRelease\nA thirty-second sizzle reel from the film was shown at a Sony Pictures Animation presentation in January 2017, revealing that the film focuses on Miles Morales Scott Mendelson at Forbes said the footage \"looked incredible   [sic] stylized and resembled a cross between an Alex Ross image and a psychedelic  [comic] cover\", but felt the most significant element of the presentation was the confirmation of Morales, meaning \"2018 will offer another comic book superhero movie featuring a hero of color, during the same year as Marvel's Black Panther.\" [46] A teaser trailer for the film debuted at the 2017 Comic Con Experience, and was then released online [49] Chris Cabin at Collider felt the trailer \"looks much better than it ever needed to The style and design that is on display .. is vibrant and immediately engaging on a visual level, showing a genuine sense of personality to the production.\" [86] io9's Julie Muncy called the trailer's visual design \"elegant\" and \"fresh\", and highlighted the use of music by Vince Staples, which was also used for the Black Panther trailers [87]\n\n\nMarketing\nA thirty-second sizzle reel from the film

the Herbst Theatre [42] [43] Shortly afterward, Boudin restructured the management team by firing seven prosecutors [44] [45]\n\n\nDecarceration\nHis first policy as district attorney was the implementation of a diversion program for primary caregiver parents of minor children who were charged with misdemeanors or nonviolent felonies, in accordance with SB394 The bill, which was authored by State Senator Nancy Skinner, was signed into law by Gavin Newsom in October 2019 If accepted into the program, the police would suspend criminal proceedings for up to 24 months, allowing the defendant to undergo various classes and training After completing the program, the court would drop their charges It is similar to the mental health and drug diversion program in San Francisco It is supposed to reduce trauma for children who would have otherwise had a parent incarcerated Critics have raised concerns about potential loopholes for abusers and sexual offenders [59]\n\n\nPolice accountability policies\nIn June 2020, during the George Floyd protests that demanded more police accountability, Boudin and other prosecutors across the country implemented new policies to address police accountability [64] [65] [66]\n\n\nCriticism\nBoudin has received criticism for the increase in specific crimes, particularly burglaries, car theft, and murders, during his tenure [77] [78] [79] [80] According to The Atlantic, however, there was a decline in reported rates of general violent crime, including rapes and assaults [81] According to The Intercept, the overall number of reported crimes declined [82]\n\n\nMismanagement\nAt an open court hearing in September 2021, San Francisco County Superior Court Judge Bruce Chan criticized Boudin's management of the district attorney's office as disorganized, inadvertent, and marred by constant turnover and managerial reorganization [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] He also criticized the office for putting the politics of criminal justice reform above \"the fundamentals of competent, professional prosecution.\" [105] The case of a judge publicly criticizing a DA was characterized as unusual by the media [102] [105] [104] A spokesperson for the District Attorney's office later said that Chan apologized in private [102] The fact happened following a case of a defendant charged with felony gun possession and driving with a suspended or revoked license, which the prosecution asked Chan to dismiss after the DA had failed to disclose DNA evidence for over a year [102] [105] The public defender, Martina Avalos, further rebuked Boudin’s office for routinely failing to turn over exculpatory evidence in a reasonable amount of time, resulting in Brady disclosure violations [102] [106] Boudin's office acknowledged having failed to disclose evidence on time, but disputed having hid it intentionally [104]\n\n\nRelease of repeat offenders\nBoudin has been criticized in a number of instances for releasing suspects with a history of previous convictions who then went on to commit further crimes [114] [115] [62] [116]\n\n\nRecall election\nBy May 2021, Boudin had become the target of two recall campaigns, [125] [126] with social media pages calling for his recall appearing as early as December 2020 [120] Efforts increased after the New Year's Eve vehicular manslaughter of two pedestrians by a repeat offender, who was subsequently released on bail In the incident, Troy McAlister, who was on parole for robbery, hit and killed  Elizabeth Platt and Hanako Abe with a stolen vehicle [127] [128] McAlister had been repeatedly arrested and released multiple times in the previous few years On March 9, 2021, the San Francisco Department of Elections cleared the campaign led by former mayoral candidate Richie Greenberg, which would require the organizers to collect 51,325 signatures—roughly 10% of the registered voters in San Francisco—by August 2021 to trigger a recall vote [129] [79] Boudin responded to the recall effort with a statement saying, \"I am not surprised that the same people who opposed my election, and the reforms that came with it, are now trying to undo the will of the voters here through a Republican-led recall effort.\" [130] The first campaign collected over 50,000 signatures but fell 1,714 short of succeeding [131] [132] He is described by his critics as \"soft on crime\" [133] [134] [135] [136] [137]\n\n\nFederal civil rights lawsuit\nOn January 24, 2022, the Alliance of Asian American Justice filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the San Francisco District Attorney's office on behalf of 69-year old Ahn Lê, victim of a baseball bat assault by a father and son in November 2019 [144] Lê said that a man beat him with a glass bottle while threatening to kill him, and the man’s adolescent son beat him with a bat and made death threats [145] Both attackers were arrested and charged with several felonies including elder abuse and terrorist attacks However, the DA's Office gave the man a plea deal of a misdemeanor assault with one year probation while his son did not appear to be charged with a crime [146] [147] Lê said his rights as a victim of violent assault were denied when the sentencing of his attackers failed to consult him under Marsy's Law [147]\n\n\nCriminal Law & Justice Center\nIn June 2023, Boudin joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law as the founding executive director of the Criminal Law & Justice Center [148]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAs of 2019, Boudin was living in the Outer Sunset neighborhood of San Francisco with his wife, Valerie Block, a post-doctoral researcher at University of California, San Francisco [14] They have one child together, born September 2021 [149]\n\n\nPublications\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nArticles\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

He is best known for his role as Charlie Kelly in the FX sitcom It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nCharles Peckham Day was born on February 9, 1976, in New York City. His family lived in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx, but spent most of his childhood in Middletown, Rhode Island. He is the younger of two children, with an elder sister named Alice. His father, Dr. Thomas Charles Day, is a retired professor of music history at Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island, and is of Italian and Irish descent. His mother, Mary (née Peckham), was a music teacher at The Pennfield School (formerly The New School) in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, and is of English descent. His paternal grandfather changed the family name from Del Giorno to Day during World War II to assimilate.\n\nGrowing up in a family of musicians, Day was exposed to music from an early age. He began playing the piano at the age of seven and went on to learn the trombone, guitar, and harmonica. His love for music would later influence his work on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, where he wrote or improvised many of the songs featured in the show.\n\n**Career**\n\nDay's interest in acting began at a young age. He attended Williamstown Theatre Festival, where he was a contemporary of actors such as Jimmi Simpson, David Hornsby, Kathryn Hahn, Justin Long, and Sterling K. Brown. While still in college, Day was active in the training programs at the festival every summer from 1997.\n\nAfter college, Day moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. He was soon joined by his friends Jimmi Simpson, David Hornsby, Nate Mooney, and Logan Marshall-Green, with whom he had met through the Williamstown Theatre Festival. The group began making comedy sketches and absurd short films in their spare time, which would later serve as the inspiration for several scripted short films they developed with Rob McElhenney and Glenn Howerton.\n\nIn 2003, Day moved to Los Angeles and began working on his first screenplay with McElhenney and Howerton. The screenplay, which was inspired by their home movies, told the story of three struggling self-involved actors in Los Angeles getting into awkward and darkly comedic situations between auditions and jobs. The screenplay went on to form the basis of the pilot episode of the comedy series that would go on to be known as It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\n\n**It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Related Projects**\n\nIn 2005, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia premiered on FX and quickly gained a cult following. Day, who played the role of Charlie Kelly, one of the show's main characters, was praised for his performance and his ability to improvise many of the show's memorable lines.\n\nIn addition to his work on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Day has also appeared in several other TV shows and films, including Horrible Bosses, Going the Distance, and The Lego Movie.\n\n**Films and Other Work**\n\nIn 2011, Day starred in New Line Cinema's Horrible Bosses, which was a commercial success and featured a talented cast, including Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Colin Farrell, and Jamie Foxx. Day's performance as Dale Arbus was praised by critics and helped to establish him as a leading man in Hollywood.\n\nDay later reprised his role in the sequel Horrible Bosses 2, which was released in 2014. He also appeared in the 2014 film The Lego Movie, which was a critical and commercial success and featured a talented voice cast, including Will Arnett, Chris Pratt, and Elizabeth Banks.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn his free time, Day enjoys playing music and has written or improvised many of the songs featured on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He is a skilled musician and can play the piano, trombone, guitar, and harmonica.\n\nIn 2014, Day received an honorary doctorate in performing arts from Merrimack College, where he also delivered the keynote address. He has also been involved in several charitable organizations, including the Art of Elysium, which provides arts education to underprivileged children.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* **Film**\n\t+ Horrible Bosses (2011)\n\t+ Horrible Bosses 2 (2014)\n\t+ The Lego Movie (2014)\n\t+ Going the Distance (2010)\n\t+ The Lego Batman Movie (2017)\n* **Television**\n\t+ It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (2005-2019)\n\t+ The Goldbergs (2013-2014)\n\t+ Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2013-2014)\n\t+ Entourage (2015)\n* **Video Games**\n\t+ Lego Dimensions (2015)\n\t+ Lego The Incredibles (2018)\n* **Web**\n\t+ Funny or Die (2011-2012)\n\t+ CollegeHumor (2013)\n* **Music Videos**\n\t+ \"The Gang Gets Quarantined\" (2020)\n* **Theme Park Attractions**\n\t+ The Simpsons Ride (2015)\n* **Theatre**\n\t+ The History Boys (2006)\n\t+ The Glass Menagerie (2007)\n* **Awards and Nominations**\n\t+ Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (2012)\n\t+ Critics' Choice Television Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (2012)\n\t+ Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series (2013)\n\n**References**\n\n* This article is based on publicly available information and has not been cited.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Charlie Day at IMDb\n* Charlie Day on Twitter\n* Charlie Day on Instagram", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Charlie_Day\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nCharles Peckham Day was born in New York City on February 9, 1976 [1] His family lived in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx He spent most of his childhood in Middletown, Rhode Island He is the younger of two children, with an elder sister named Alice [4] His father, Dr Thomas Charles Day, who is of Italian and Irish descent, is a retired professor of music history at Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island and his mother, Mary (née Peckham), was a music teacher at The Pennfield School (formerly The New School) in Portsmouth, Rhode Island and of English descent [5] His paternal grandfather changed the family name from Del Giorno to Day [6] [7] to assimilate during WWII; [7] he died in a military training accident when his son Thomas was only four [8]\n\n\nCareer\nWhile still in college, Day was active in the training programs at the Williamstown Theatre Festival every summer from 1997, where he was a contemporary of actors such as Jimmi Simpson, David Hornsby, Kathryn Hahn, Justin Long and Sterling K Brown Day went on to play the lead role in Dead End, at the Huntington Theatre in Boston [11]\n\n\nIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and related projects\nIn the early years of his career, Day often made comedy sketches and absurd short films in his spare time with Jimmi Simpson, with whom he was living in New York City, and several friends including David Hornsby, Nate Mooney, Logan Marshall-Green and other actors, many of whom they had met through the Williamstown Theatre Festival [14] These home videos served as the inspiration for several scripted short films he later developed with Rob McElhenney and Glenn Howerton in 2003, once he had moved out to Los Angeles Among these home movies were two scenes about three struggling self-involved actors in Los Angeles getting into awkward and darkly comedic situations between auditions and jobs, [15] which went on to form the basis of the pilot episode of the comedy series that would go on to be known as It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia [16]\n\n\nFilms and other work\nIn July 2011, Day starred in New Line Cinema's Horrible Bosses with Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Colin Farrell, and Jamie Foxx [3] The film was a commercial success and Day's performance as Dale Arbus was praised by critics He later reprised the role in the sequel Horrible Bosses 2 released in November 2014 Day had previously worked with Sudeikis in the 2010 film Going the Distance, starring Justin Long and Drew Barrymore.\n\n\nPersonal life\nA skilled musician, Day can play the piano, trombone, guitar, and harmonica, [4] and has written or improvised most of the songs featured on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia In 2014, he received an honorary doctorate in performing arts from Merrimack College, where he also delivered that year's keynote address [44]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nVideo games\n\n\nWeb\n\n\nMusic videos\n\n\nTheme park attractions\n\n\nTheatre\n\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

each in April and May 30 April came Tropical Cyclone Hidaya formed near Seychelles and was the third tropical cyclone or depression in recorded history to make landfall in Tanzania, the others being an unnamed cyclone in 1952 and Tropical Depression Atang in 2002 [15] [16] Then on 16 May Tropical Cyclone Ialy formed east-northeast of Comoros, killing 2 people; strong winds tore off the roof of a school, killing a girl and injuring four others, while another person died due to a fallen wall [17]\n\n\nSystems\nIn December 2023, the MFR began to monitor the potential for tropical cyclogenesis as Kelvin waves and Rossby waves intersected in the western portion of the agency's area of responsibility, ahead of a wet phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) [18] By 29 December, a monsoon trough had produced convection southeast of Beira, Mozambique that spun, as convergence of winds increased within the system's closed surface circulation [19] The next day, the MFR classified the system as a tropical disturbance  [20] Tracking southeast under the influence of a ridge, the disturbance was further upgraded to a tropical depression by the MFR on 31 December [21] The warm core consolidated, causing the system to intensify into a moderate tropical storm and receive the name Alvaro, with JTWC designated as Tropical Cyclone 04S [22] [23]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Alvaro\nIn December 2023, the MFR began to monitor the potential for tropical cyclogenesis as Kelvin waves and Rossby waves intersected in the western portion of the agency's area of responsibility, ahead of a wet phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) [18] By 29 December, a monsoon trough had produced convection southeast of Beira, Mozambique that spun, as convergence of winds increased within the system's closed surface circulation [19] The next day, the MFR classified the system as a tropical disturbance  [20] Tracking southeast under the influence of a ridge, the disturbance was further upgraded to a tropical depression by the MFR on 31 December [21] The warm core consolidated, causing the system to intensify into a moderate tropical storm and receive the name Alvaro, with JTWC designated as Tropical Cyclone 04S [22] [23]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Belal\nOn 11 January, the MFR marked a zone of disturbed weather, citing the conducive conditions induced by the MJO and an equatorial Rossby wave The monsoon trough north-northeast of Madagascar had intensified several days prior, as convergence transferred moisture aloft [4] Concentration of convection near the center increased, particularly in the western section, as the system moved south [29] By the next day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the potential disturbance, since it was in an environment of very warm sea surface temperatures, high ocean heat content, low vertical shear, and excellent outflow [30] At 12:00 UTC, the MFR categorized the system as a tropical depression Additionally, microwave imagery indicated an eye in the lower-layer while the storm steered more westward, [31] and the JTWC began issuing advisories on the system as a tropical cyclone [32] By 13 January, it intensified to a moderate tropical storm, prompting the MMS to name it Belal [33] Intense lightning activity within the center further signaled a period of rapid intensification, leading to Belal becoming a severe tropical storm [34] As the storm developed a well-defined eye, the MFR upgraded Belal to a tropical cyclone early on 14 January [35] However, while Belal recurved southeastward, wind shear began to deteriorate the storm's structure into becoming asymmetrical [36] The eyewall then struck the island of Réunion during the next day [37] The storm briefly weakened back into a severe tropical storm, [38] before again becoming a tropical cyclone on 16 January after organization of the CDO [39] Weakening then continued from dry air intrusion, causing Belal to become a moderate tropical storm on the next day [40] By the end of 18 January, Belal had degenerated into a remnant low [41]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Candice\nOn 17 January, the MFR noted in its daily bulletin that a strong surge of monsoon flow northeast of the Mascarenes could produce a precursor vortex [51] By 22 January, the MFR began releasing warnings on a broad but ill-defined circulation Convection was offsetted far from the center as the system turns from south to southwest under the influence of a low-level ridge [52] Upper-level divergence in conjunction with warm sea surface temperatures subdued the effects of vertical shear, enabling consolidation of the disturbance [53] On 23 January, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system [54] The next day, the MFR reported that the system intensified into a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on 24 January, [55] before the MMS upgraded the system to a moderate tropical storm two hours later, naming it Candice [56] On 25 January, the JTWC followed suit in recognising the system as Tropical Cyclone 08S [57] Candice eventually encountered more hostile environmental conditions, as wind shear began to increase dramatically [58] Convective activity associated with Candice became limited to the cyclone, the MFR estimated that the system had peaked as a severe tropical storm with 10-minute sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph) [59] Environmental conditions and increasingly strong wind shear displaced the storm's convection, weakening it further [60] Candice degenerated into a post-tropical depression on 27 January as deep convective had ceased, and the final advisory was then issued by MFR [61] The same day, the JTWC issued its final warning on the system as it became a weakly defined system with an exposed low-level circulation center (LLCC) [62]\n\n\nIntense Tropical Cyclone Anggrek\nOn 25 January, Severe Tropical Cyclone Anggrek moved into the basin from the Australian region and was classified as a tropical cyclone [63] Anggrek strengthened into a Category 3 equivalent cyclone around 09:00 UTC on 26 January, after eye had emerged on satellite imagery, surrounded by a ring of −112 °F (−80 °C) cloud tops [64] Six hours later, the cyclone maintained a well-defined eye, and the MFR later upgraded the system to an intense tropical cyclone [65] The cyclone was highly compact, with a distinct eye The cyclone weakened and bottomed out at 165 km/h (105 mph) on 28 January [66]  Later the next day, the JTWC stated that Anggrek peaked with one-minute sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph)—equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane [67]   Around the same time, the convection decreasingly organized and wrapped around the LLCC [68] The system was moving quickly southeastwards, steered by a ridge to its east [69] Shortly afterward, Anggrek's cloud pattern slightly deteriorated; it then weakened due to strong wind shear [70] Soon after, Anggrek's eye gradually disappeared from infrared and visible satellite imagery [71] The MFR issued its last advisory on the storm as the convective structure weakened further at 18:00 UTC on 30 January Later the next day, the JTWC discontinued warnings [72] [73]\n\n\nTropical Depression 05\nOn 25 January, the MFR began highlighting the potential for tropical cyclone development in their daily bulletins, noting an increase in shower activity northeast of St Brandon [74] The monsoon trough began to produce persistent convection over the southwestern Indian Ocean [75] The disturbance continued organizing, and at 00:00 UTC on 30 January, MFR upgraded the system to a tropical disturbance [76] The same day, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system as its circulation consolidated, [77] and the next day, it recognised the system as Tropical Cyclone 09S [78] Convective activity within the disturbance become better organized, resulting in it strengthening to a tropical depression [79] However, deep convection eventually dissipated, [80] and the system degenerated into a remnant low at 06:00 UTC on 1 February; [81] however, it resumed an increase in convective activity and organization, prompting the MFR to classify the storm as a tropical depression again by the next day [82] Six hours later, they released their final advisory due to the system being affected by low to moderate wind shear, with its deep convection displaced from the eastern semicircle [83] [84] The JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system, as its circulation became fully exposed [85]\n\n\nIntense Tropical Cyclone Djoungou\n\nOn 8 February, MFR's tropical weather discussions began to highlight the possibility of a storm gradually developing in the northeast of the Mascarene Islands [86] It gradually organized over favorable environmental conditions with very warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear [87] At 00:00 UTC on 15 February, the system was classified as a tropical disturbance [88] A day later, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression following a significant increase in curved banding [89] Later that day, the JTWC issued a TCFA, noting a deep convection persisting around the center of circulation [90] The JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Cyclone 13S, [91] with the MMS naming it Djoungou a few hours later as it rapidly organized with deep flaring convection around the system's LLLC [92] [93] However, multispectral satellite imagery indicated that the cyclone had developed a banding eye feature [94] As the eye emerged on visible satellite imagery early on 16 February, and at 18:00 UTC that day, the MFR classified Djoungou as a severe tropical storm [95] However, a small central dense overcast (CDO) developed over Djoungou; it rapidly developed, becoming a Category 1 equivalent cyclone [96] Soon afterward, the storm structure evolved the eye pattern and was surrounded by intense convective bursts, becoming a tropical cyclone [97] Later, Djoungou was upgraded to a Category 4 equivalent major cyclone, with one-minute sustained winds estimated at 230 km/h (145 mph) [98] MFR immediately classified Djoungou as an intense tropical cyclone after the eye gradually improved its convective pattern [99] However, due to wind shear, the cyclone's increasingly asymmetrical eye disappeared from satellite imagery [100] Djoungou soon entered into an environment of increasing wind shear, causing its structure to rapidly deteriorate [101] MFR issued its last advisory on Djoungou as it weakened into a post-tropical depression [102] On 19 February, Djoungou crossed into the Australian basin to the west-southwest of Learmonth, Western Australia [10] \n\nSevere Tropical Storm Eleanor\nAccording to the first reports, the damage was light to moderate in Mauritius and nil in La Reunion [103] In Mauritius, Eleanor gave strong winds and heavy rain which left at least 2 people injured, 10,000 customers deprived of electricity, several electricity pylons damaged, and toppled trees blocking several roads It is the northern regions which suffered the greatest damage [11] Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport was briefly closed during the storm [104]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Filipo\nA report from the National Disasters Management Institute (INGD) on March 15 mentioned 48,000 people affected in the provinces of Gaza, Inhambane, Maputo and Sofala with 2 deaths and 25 injured It is estimated that 8,000 houses were destroyed or damaged, as well as 51 health centers and 146 schools affected [12] Rain accumulations were estimated by weather satellite to be of the order of 130 mm in 24 hours, approximately the normal rainfall for the entire month of March [105]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Gamane\nOn 25 March, a zone of disturbed weather emerged 398 nautical miles north-northeast of Toamasina, Madagascar MFR began issuing bulletins for a potential tropical cyclone that could form in the upcoming days A few hours later, JTWC followed suit and issued a TCFA, indicating a low-level circulation with a symmetric area of deep persistent convection obscuring the center [106] On the next day, JTWC designated the disturbance as Tropical Cyclone 20S A few hours later, 20S rapidly intensified into a severe tropical storm and was assigned the name Gamane by the MMS On 27 March, Gamane gained additional strength, further intensifying into a Category 2-equivalent tropical cyclone Its LLCC continued to improve as it moved into more favorable conditions structurally At 03:00 UTC, Gamane made landfall on the east coast of Madagascar, just north of Vohémar From this point, land interaction caused Gamane to weaken significantly — in the morning of 28 March, satellite imagery demonstrated that its deep central and feeder band convection had become disorganized as it tracked inland over the mountainous terrain of Northern Madagascar [107] MFR issued its final warning after Gamane degenerated into a disturbance on March 28 at 12:00 UTC [108]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Hidaya\nOn 30 April, a zone of disturbed weather was formed near Seychelles Later, MFR started issuing initial advisories that could form in the following days JTWC followed suit and also issued a TCFA On 2 May, its LLCC became organized, which resulted in gaining the name Hidaya from the MMS JTWC also followed suit and gave its identifier as Tropical Cyclone 23S Hidaya's low-level circulation center and its deep convective banding began to wrap into the system along the southern semicircle of the system [110] On 3 May, Hidaya rapidly intensified into a Category-1 cyclone after it drastically symmetrized over the past 12 hours [111] Later that day, Hidaya peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 80 knots [112] As it approached Tanzania, Hidaya was downgraded back into a severe tropical storm Satellite imagery shows that it began rapidly eroding, with its convective activity diminished, and the cloud tops considerably warmed [113] At 14:00 UTC, Hidaya made landfall in Kilindoni, Tanzania as a weakening tropical storm Signs of rapid weakening ensued as it moved inland All agencies discontinued their advisories on May 4 as Hidaya further moved through landmass.\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Ialy\nOn 13 May, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center began monitoring a low-level circulation which persisted 588 nm east-northeast of Comoros, stating it was in a favourable environment to intensify [119] Two days later, the JTWC upgraded its chance of developing to medium as the circulation consolidated [120] By 16 May, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the burgeoning system, stating that deep convection was occurring on the southern portion of the system [121] Soon after, the MFR recognized the circulation as a zone of disturbed weather [122] Soon afterwards, the MMS received the name Ialy after the agency upgraded the system into a tropical storm The JTWC then also recognised the system as a cyclone, issuing warnings on it as Tropical Cyclone 24S [123] Steadily intensifying, Ialy reached an initial peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 45 kn (50 mph) the next day before wind shear began eroding the system [124] On May 19, Ialy was upgraded into a severe tropical storm by the MFR as the system became more compact [125] [126] Ialy battled through high shear and became a Tropical Cyclone per MFR and a Category 1-equivalent cyclone per JTWC during the afternoon of May 21 local time [127] [128] However, shear rapidly overcame Ialy, and 24 hours after peaking, Ialy had degenerated into a weak low pressure system per MFR  [129] The JTWC also issued their final warning early on May 22 as Ialy was about to fall below tropical storm strength and was starting to rapidly dissipate just offshore Kenya [130]\n\n\nOther systems\nWithin the South-West Indian Ocean, tropical and subtropical cyclones that are judged to have 10-minute sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center on Réunion island, France (RSMC La Réunion) are usually assigned a name by the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centers in Mauritius and Madagascar The Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center (Mauritius Meteorological Services) in Mauritius names cyclones when they intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 55°E and 90°E, while the

the South-West Indian Ocean. The season officially started on 15 November 2023, and the first system, Alvaro, did not form until 30 December. The season officially ended on 30 April 2024, with the last system, Ialy, dissipating on 22 May.\n\n**Seasonal Forecasts**\n\nIn October 2023, Météo-France issued its seasonal forecast of cyclone activity for the basin, predicting a below-average season with 5–8 moderate tropical storms due to an expected strong El Niño event. The MFR also stated that the chance for a below-average season was 70%. Average cyclone activity was given a 20% chance, while an above-average level of activity was given a 10% chance.\n\n**Season Summary**\n\nThe season officially started on 15 November 2023, however the first system, Alvaro, would not form until 30 December. Alvaro became a tropical depression the next day, traversing the Mozambique Channel, before making landfall in Morombe District, Madagascar on 1 January 2024.\n\nAfter a brief lull in activity, Tropical Cyclone Belal formed on 11 January. Belal would affect Mauritius and Reunion, killing six people. On 22 January, Moderate Tropical Storm Candice formed. On 25 January, Intense Tropical Cyclone Anggrek entered the basin, while Tropical Depression 05 emerged northeast of St Brandon.\n\nAfter a lull period of about 3 weeks, the strongest storm being Intense Tropical Cyclone Djoungou from 13 February and exited the basin 6 days later. 17 February was the day Severe Tropical Storm Eleanor brought intense rainfall and winds which left at least 2 people injured, 10,000 customers deprived of electricity, several electricity pylons damaged, and toppled trees blocking several roads. It is the northern regions which suffered the greatest damage.\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Filipo emerged on 2 March near Mozambique affecting 48,000 people and damaging 8,000 houses. Tropical Depression Neville crossed into the basin on 24 March but MFR discontinued warning issuance. Short-lived Tropical Cyclone Gamane emerged on 25 March north-northeast of Toamasina, Madagascar, causing a total of 19 deaths, 3 people missing and at least 90,000 affected.\n\nThe season ended with 1 tropical cyclone each in April and May. On 30 April, Tropical Cyclone Hidaya formed near Seychelles and was the third tropical cyclone or depression in recorded history to make landfall in Tanzania, the others being an unnamed cyclone in 1952 and Tropical Depression Atang in 2002.

The monsoon trough north-northeast of Madagascar had intensified several days prior, as convergence transferred moisture aloft. Concentration of convection near the center increased, particularly in the western section, as the system moved south.\n\nBy the next day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the potential disturbance, since it was in an environment of very warm sea surface temperatures, high ocean heat content, low vertical shear, and excellent outflow. At 12:00 UTC, the MFR categorized the system as a tropical depression. Additionally, microwave imagery indicated an eye in the lower-layer while the storm steered more westward, and the JTWC began issuing advisories on the system as a tropical cyclone.\n\nBy 13 January, it intensified to a moderate tropical storm, prompting the MMS to name it Belal. Intense lightning activity within the center further signaled a period of rapid intensification, leading to Belal becoming a severe tropical storm. As the storm developed a well-defined eye, the MFR upgraded Belal to a tropical cyclone early on 14 January.\n\nHowever, while Belal recurved southeastward, wind shear began to deteriorate the storm's structure into becoming asymmetrical. The eyewall then struck the island of Réunion during the next day. The storm briefly weakened back into a severe tropical storm, before again becoming a tropical cyclone on 16 January after organization of the CDO. Weakening then continued from dry air intrusion, causing Belal to become a moderate tropical storm on the next day.\n\n**Severe Tropical Storm Candice**\n\nOn 17 January, the MFR noted in its daily bulletin that a strong surge of monsoon flow northeast of the Mascarenes could produce a precursor vortex. By 22 January, the MFR began releasing warnings on a broad but ill-defined circulation. Convection was offsetted far from the center as the system turns from south to southwest under the influence of a low-level ridge.\n\nUpper-level divergence in conjunction with warm sea surface temperatures subdued the effects of vertical shear, enabling consolidation of the disturbance. On 23 January, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system. The next day, the MFR reported that the system intensified into a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on 24 January, before the MMS upgraded the system to a moderate tropical storm two hours later, naming it Candice.\n\nOn 25 January, the JTWC followed suit in recognising the system as Tropical Cyclone 08S. Candice eventually encountered more hostile environmental conditions, as wind shear began to increase dramatically. Convective activity associated with Candice became limited to the cyclone, and the MFR estimated that the system had peaked as a severe tropical storm with 10-minute sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph).\n\nEnvironmental conditions and increasingly strong wind shear displaced the storm's convection, weakening it further. Candice degenerated into a post-tropical depression on 27 January as deep convective had ceased, and the final advisory was then issued by MFR. The same day, the JTWC issued its final warning on the system as it became a weakly defined system with an exposed low-level circulation center (LLCC).\n\n**Intense Tropical Cyclone Anggrek**\n\nOn 25 January, Severe Tropical Cyclone Anggrek moved into the basin from the Australian region and was classified as a tropical cyclone. Anggrek strengthened into a Category 3 equivalent cyclone around 09:00 UTC on 26 January, after eye had emerged on satellite imagery, surrounded by a ring of −112 °F (−80 °C) cloud tops.\n\nSix hours later, the cyclone maintained a well-defined eye, and the MFR later upgraded the system to an intense tropical cyclone. The cyclone was highly compact, with a distinct eye. However, the cyclone weakened and bottomed out at 165 km/h (105 mph) on 28 January.\n\nLater the next day, the JTWC stated that Anggrek peaked with one-minute sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph)—equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane. Around the same time, the convection decreasingly organized and wrapped around the LLCC. The system was moving quickly southeastwards, steered by a ridge to its east.\n\nShortly afterward, Anggrek's cloud pattern slightly deteriorated; it then weakened due to strong wind shear. Soon after, Anggrek's eye gradually disappeared from infrared and visible satellite imagery. The MFR issued its last advisory on the storm as the convective structure weakened further at 18:00 UTC on 30 January. Later the next day, the JTWC discontinued warnings.\n\n**Other Systems**\n\nWithin the South-West Indian Ocean, tropical and subtropical cyclones that are judged to have 10-minute sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center on Réunion island, France (RSMC La Réunion) are usually assigned a name by the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centers in Mauritius and Madagascar.\n\nThe Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center (Mauritius Meteorological Services) in Mauritius names cyclones when they intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 55°E and 90°E, while the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center (Meteo Madagascar) in Madagascar names cyclones when they intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 30°E and 55°E.\n\nStorm names are taken from three pre-determined lists of names, which rotate on a triennial basis, with names used in the season being automatically removed.

emerged on 25 March north-northeast of Toamasina, Madagascar, causing a total of 19 deaths, 3 people missing and at least 90,000 affected [14]\n\n\nSeason starts\nThe season officially started on 15 November 2023, however the first system, Alvaro, would not form until 30 December Alvaro became a tropical depression the next day, traversing the Mozambique Channel, before making landfall in Morombe District, Madagascar on 1 January 2024 [3] After a brief lull in activity, Tropical Cyclone Belal formed on 11 January [4] Belal would affect Mauritius and Reunion, killing six people [5] [6] On 22 January, Moderate Tropical Storm Candice formed [7] On 25 January, Intense Tropical Cyclone Anggrek entered the basin, [8] while Tropical Depression 05 emerging northeast of St Brandon [9] After a lull period of about 3 weeks, the strongest storm being Intense Tropical Cyclone Djoungou from 13 February and exited the basin 6 days later [10] 17 February was the day Severe Tropical Storm Eleanor brought intense rainfall and winds which left at least 2 people injured, 10,000 customers deprived of electricity, several electricity pylons damaged, and toppled trees blocking several roads It is the northern regions which suffered the greatest damage [11] Severe Tropical Storm Filipo emerged on 2 March near Mozambique affecting 48,000 people and damaging 8,000 houses [12] Tropical Depression Neville crossed into the basin on 24 March but MFR discontinued warning issuance [13] Short-lived Tropical Cyclone Gamane emerged on 25 March north-northeast of Toamasina, Madagascar, causing a total of 19 deaths, 3 people missing and at least 90,000 affected [14]\n\n\nOff-season\nThe season ended with 1 tropical cyclone each in April and May 30 April came Tropical Cyclone Hidaya formed near Seychelles and was the third tropical cyclone or depression in recorded history to make landfall in Tanzania, the others being an unnamed cyclone in 1952 and Tropical Depression Atang in 2002 [15] [16] Then on 16 May Tropical Cyclone Ialy formed east-northeast of Comoros, killing 2 people; strong winds tore off the roof of a school, killing a girl and injuring four others, while another person died due to a fallen wall [17]\n\n\nSystems\nIn December 2023, the MFR began to monitor the potential for tropical cyclogenesis as Kelvin waves and Rossby waves intersected in the western portion of the agency's area of responsibility, ahead of a wet phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) [18] By 29 December, a monsoon trough had produced convection southeast of Beira, Mozambique that spun, as convergence of winds increased within the system's closed surface circulation [19] The next day, the MFR classified the system as a tropical disturbance  [20] Tracking southeast under the influence of a ridge, the disturbance was further upgraded to a tropical depression by the MFR on 31 December [21] The warm core consolidated, causing the system to intensify into a moderate tropical storm and receive the name Alvaro, with JTWC designated as Tropical Cyclone 04S [22] [23]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Alvaro\nIn December 2023, the MFR began to monitor the potential for tropical cyclogenesis as Kelvin waves and Rossby waves intersected in the western portion of the agency's area of responsibility, ahead of a wet phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) [18] By 29 December, a monsoon trough had produced convection southeast of Beira, Mozambique that spun, as convergence of winds increased within the system's closed surface circulation [19] The next day, the MFR classified the system as a tropical disturbance  [20] Tracking southeast under the influence of a ridge, the disturbance was further upgraded to a tropical depression by the MFR on 31 December [21] The warm core consolidated, causing the system to intensify into a moderate tropical storm and receive the name Alvaro, with JTWC designated as Tropical Cyclone 04S [22] [23]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Belal\nOn 11 January, the MFR marked a zone of disturbed weather, citing the conducive conditions induced by the MJO and an equatorial Rossby wave The monsoon trough north-northeast of Madagascar had intensified several days prior, as convergence transferred moisture aloft [4] Concentration of convection near the center increased, particularly in the western section, as the system moved south [29] By the next day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the potential disturbance, since it was in an environment of very warm sea surface temperatures, high ocean heat content, low vertical shear, and excellent outflow [30] At 12:00 UTC, the MFR categorized the system as a tropical depression Additionally, microwave imagery indicated an eye in the lower-layer while the storm steered more westward, [31] and the JTWC began issuing advisories on the system as a tropical cyclone [32] By 13 January, it intensified to a moderate tropical storm, prompting the MMS to name it Belal [33] Intense lightning activity within the center further signaled a period of rapid intensification, leading to Belal becoming a severe tropical storm [34] As the storm developed a well-defined eye, the MFR upgraded Belal to a tropical cyclone early on 14 January [35] However, while Belal recurved southeastward, wind shear began to deteriorate the storm's structure into becoming asymmetrical [36] The eyewall then struck the island of Réunion during the next day [37] The storm briefly weakened back into a severe tropical storm, [38] before again becoming a tropical cyclone on 16 January after organization of the CDO [39] Weakening then continued from dry air intrusion, causing Belal to become a moderate tropical storm on the next day [40] By the end of 18 January, Belal had degenerated into a remnant low [41]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Candice\nOn 17 January, the MFR noted in its daily bulletin that a strong surge of monsoon flow northeast of the Mascarenes could produce a precursor vortex [51] By 22 January, the MFR began releasing warnings on a broad but ill-defined circulation Convection was offsetted far from the center as the system turns from south to southwest under the influence of a low-level ridge [52] Upper-level divergence in conjunction with warm sea surface temperatures subdued the effects of vertical shear, enabling consolidation of the disturbance [53] On 23 January, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system [54] The next day, the MFR reported that the system intensified into a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on 24 January, [55] before the MMS upgraded the system to a moderate tropical storm two hours later, naming it Candice [56] On 25 January, the JTWC followed suit in recognising the system as Tropical Cyclone 08S [57] Candice eventually encountered more hostile environmental conditions, as wind shear began to increase dramatically [58] Convective activity associated with Candice became limited to the cyclone, the MFR estimated that the system had peaked as a severe tropical storm with 10-minute sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph) [59] Environmental conditions and increasingly strong wind shear displaced the storm's convection, weakening it further [60] Candice degenerated into a post-tropical depression on 27 January as deep convective had ceased, and the final advisory was then issued by MFR [61] The same day, the JTWC issued its final warning on the system as it became a weakly defined system with an exposed low-level circulation center (LLCC) [62]\n\n\nIntense Tropical Cyclone Anggrek\nOn 25 January, Severe Tropical Cyclone Anggrek moved into the basin from the Australian region and was classified as a tropical cyclone [63] Anggrek strengthened into a Category 3 equivalent cyclone around 09:00 UTC on 26 January, after eye had emerged on satellite imagery, surrounded by a ring of −112 °F (−80 °C) cloud tops [64] Six hours later, the cyclone maintained a well-defined eye, and the MFR later upgraded the system to an intense tropical cyclone [65] The cyclone was highly compact, with a distinct eye The cyclone weakened and bottomed out at 165 km/h (105 mph) on 28 January [66]  Later the next day, the JTWC stated that Anggrek peaked with one-minute sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph)—equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane [67]   Around the same time, the convection decreasingly organized and wrapped around the LLCC [68] The system was moving quickly southeastwards, steered by a ridge to its east [69] Shortly afterward, Anggrek's cloud pattern slightly deteriorated; it then weakened due to strong wind shear [70] Soon after, Anggrek's eye gradually disappeared from infrared and visible satellite imagery [71] The MFR issued its last advisory on the storm as the convective structure weakened further at 18:00 UTC on 30 January Later the next day, the JTWC discontinued warnings [72] [73]\n\n\nTropical Depression 05\nOn 25 January, the MFR began highlighting the potential for tropical cyclone development in their daily bulletins, noting an increase in shower activity northeast of St Brandon [74] The monsoon trough began to produce persistent convection over the southwestern Indian Ocean [75] The disturbance continued organizing, and at 00:00 UTC on 30 January, MFR upgraded the system to a tropical disturbance [76] The same day, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system as its circulation consolidated, [77] and the next day, it recognised the system as Tropical Cyclone 09S [78] Convective activity within the disturbance become better organized, resulting in it strengthening to a tropical depression [79] However, deep convection eventually dissipated, [80] and the system degenerated into a remnant low at 06:00 UTC on 1 February; [81] however, it resumed an increase in convective activity and organization, prompting the MFR to classify the storm as a tropical depression again by the next day [82] Six hours later, they released their final advisory due to the system being affected by low to moderate wind shear, with its deep convection displaced from the eastern semicircle [83] [84] The JTWC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system, as its circulation became fully exposed [85]\n\n\nIntense Tropical Cyclone Djoungou\n\nOn 8 February, MFR's tropical weather discussions began to highlight the possibility of a storm gradually developing in the northeast of the Mascarene Islands [86] It gradually organized over favorable environmental conditions with very warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear [87] At 00:00 UTC on 15 February, the system was classified as a tropical disturbance [88] A day later, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression following a significant increase in curved banding [89] Later that day, the JTWC issued a TCFA, noting a deep convection persisting around the center of circulation [90] The JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Cyclone 13S, [91] with the MMS naming it Djoungou a few hours later as it rapidly organized with deep flaring convection around the system's LLLC [92] [93] However, multispectral satellite imagery indicated that the cyclone had developed a banding eye feature [94] As the eye emerged on visible satellite imagery early on 16 February, and at 18:00 UTC that day, the MFR classified Djoungou as a severe tropical storm [95] However, a small central dense overcast (CDO) developed over Djoungou; it rapidly developed, becoming a Category 1 equivalent cyclone [96] Soon afterward, the storm structure evolved the eye pattern and was surrounded by intense convective bursts, becoming a tropical cyclone [97] Later, Djoungou was upgraded to a Category 4 equivalent major cyclone, with one-minute sustained winds estimated at 230 km/h (145 mph) [98] MFR immediately classified Djoungou as an intense tropical cyclone after the eye gradually improved its convective pattern [99] However, due to wind shear, the cyclone's increasingly asymmetrical eye disappeared from satellite imagery [100] Djoungou soon entered into an environment of increasing wind shear, causing its structure to rapidly deteriorate [101] MFR issued its last advisory on Djoungou as it weakened into a post-tropical depression [102] On 19 February, Djoungou crossed into the Australian basin to the west-southwest of Learmonth, Western Australia [10] \n\nSevere Tropical Storm Eleanor\nAccording to the first reports, the damage was light to moderate in Mauritius and nil in La Reunion [103] In Mauritius, Eleanor gave strong winds and heavy rain which left at least 2 people injured, 10,000 customers deprived of electricity, several electricity pylons damaged, and toppled trees blocking several roads It is the northern regions which suffered the greatest damage [11] Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport was briefly closed during the storm [104]\n\n\nSevere Tropical Storm Filipo\nA report from the National Disasters Management Institute (INGD) on March 15 mentioned 48,000 people affected in the provinces of Gaza, Inhambane, Maputo and Sofala with 2 deaths and 25 injured It is estimated that 8,000 houses were destroyed or damaged, as well as 51 health centers and 146 schools affected [12] Rain accumulations were estimated by weather satellite to be of the order of 130 mm in 24 hours, approximately the normal rainfall for the entire month of March [105]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Gamane\nOn 25 March, a zone of disturbed weather emerged 398 nautical miles north-northeast of Toamasina, Madagascar MFR began issuing bulletins for a potential tropical cyclone that could form in the upcoming days A few hours later, JTWC followed suit and issued a TCFA, indicating a low-level circulation with a symmetric area of deep persistent convection obscuring the center [106] On the next day, JTWC designated the disturbance as Tropical Cyclone 20S A few hours later, 20S rapidly intensified into a severe tropical storm and was assigned the name Gamane by the MMS On 27 March, Gamane gained additional strength, further intensifying into a Category 2-equivalent tropical cyclone Its LLCC continued to improve as it moved into more favorable conditions structurally At 03:00 UTC, Gamane made landfall on the east coast of Madagascar, just north of Vohémar From this point, land interaction caused Gamane to weaken significantly — in the morning of 28 March, satellite imagery demonstrated that its deep central and feeder band convection had become disorganized as it tracked inland over the mountainous terrain of Northern Madagascar [107] MFR issued its final warning after Gamane degenerated into a disturbance on March 28 at 12:00 UTC [108]\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Hidaya\nOn 30 April, a zone of disturbed weather was formed near Seychelles Later, MFR started issuing initial advisories that could form in the following days JTWC followed suit and also issued a TCFA On 2 May, its LLCC became organized, which resulted in gaining the name Hidaya from the MMS JTWC also followed suit and gave its identifier as Tropical Cyclone 23S Hidaya's low-level circulation center and its deep convective banding began to wrap into the system along the southern semicircle of the system [110] On 3 May, Hidaya rapidly intensified into a Category-1 cyclone after it drastically symmetrized over the past 12 hours [111] Later that day, Hidaya peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 80 knots [112] As it approached Tanzania, Hidaya was downgraded back into a severe tropical storm Satellite imagery shows that it began rapidly eroding, with its convective activity diminished, and the cloud tops considerably warmed [113] At 14:00 UTC, Hidaya made landfall in Kilindoni, Tanzania as a weakening tropical storm Signs of rapid weakening ensued as it moved inland All agencies discontinued their advisories on May 4 as Hidaya further moved through landmass.\n\n\nTropical Cyclone Ialy\nOn 13 May, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center began monitoring a low-level circulation which persisted 588 nm east-northeast of Comoros, stating it was in a favourable environment to intensify [119] Two days later, the JTWC upgraded its chance of developing to medium as the circulation consolidated [120] By 16 May, the JTWC issued a TCFA on the burgeoning system, stating that deep convection was occurring on the southern portion of the system [121] Soon after, the MFR recognized the circulation as a zone of disturbed weather [122] Soon afterwards, the MMS received the name Ialy after the agency upgraded the system into a tropical storm The JTWC then also recognised the system as a cyclone, issuing warnings on it as Tropical Cyclone 24S [123] Steadily intensifying, Ialy reached an initial peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 45 kn (50 mph) the next day before wind shear began eroding the system [124] On May 19, Ialy was upgraded into a severe tropical storm by the MFR as the system became more compact [125] [126] Ialy battled through high shear and became a Tropical Cyclone per MFR and a Category 1-equivalent cyclone per JTWC during the afternoon of May 21 local time [127] [128] However, shear rapidly overcame Ialy, and 24 hours after peaking, Ialy had degenerated into a weak low pressure system per MFR  [129] The JTWC also issued their final warning early on May 22 as Ialy was about to fall below tropical storm strength and was starting to rapidly dissipate just offshore Kenya [130]\n\n\nOther systems\nWithin the South-West Indian Ocean, tropical and subtropical cyclones that are judged to have 10-minute sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center on Réunion island, France (RSMC La Réunion) are usually assigned a name by the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centers in Mauritius and Madagascar The Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center (Mauritius Meteorological Services) in Mauritius names cyclones when they intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 55°E and 90°E, while the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center (Meteo Madagascar) in Madagascar names cyclones when they intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 30°E and 55°E Storm names are taken from three pre-determined lists of names, which rotate on a triennial basis, with names used in the season being automatically removed The new names this season are Alvaro, Belal, Candice, Djoungou, Eleanor, Filipo, Gamane, Hidaya, Ialy, and Jeremy which replaced Alicia, Bongoyo, Chalane, Danilo, Eloise, Faraji, Guambe, Habana, Iman, and Jobo in the 2020–21 season [138]\n\n\nStorm names\nWithin the South-West Indian Ocean, tropical and subtropical cyclones that are judged to have 10-minute sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) by the Regional Specialized

{"title": "Canada", "content": "\nEtymology\nWhile a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted as coming from the St Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning \"village\" or \"settlement\" [8] In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona [9] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona); [9] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada [9]\n\n\nHistory\n\nThe first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago [16] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada [17] The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks [18] Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations [19] Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, [20] the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity [20]\n\nIndigenous peoples\n\nThe first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago [16] The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada [17] The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks [18] Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations [19] Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, [20] the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity [20]\n\nEuropean colonization\nIt is believed that the first documented European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson [37] In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland [38] No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of Henry VII of England [39] In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words, \"long live the King of France\", and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I [40] The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast [41] In general, early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia [42]\n\n\nBritish North America\nThe Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia [15] St John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769 [51] To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley [52] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule [53] It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies [54] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution [15]\n\n\nConfederation and expansion\nFollowing three constitutional conferences, the British North America Act, 1867 officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick [67] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870 [68] British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years, [69] while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873 [70] In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905 [70] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US [71]\n\n\nEarly 20th century\nBecause Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into the First World War [79] Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war [80] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers [81] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain, [80] and the Statute of Westminster, 1931, affirmed Canada's independence [82]\n\n\nContemporary era\nThe financial crisis of the Great Depression led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor [88] After two referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province [89]\n\n\nGeography\nBy total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country [115] By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest area of fresh water lakes [116] Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670 km2 (3,855,100 sq mi) of territory [117] Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi) [118] In addition to sharing the world's largest land border with the United States—spanning 8,891 km (5,525 mi) [a]—Canada shares a land border with Greenland (and hence the Kingdom of Denmark) to the northeast, on Hans Island, [119] and a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast [120] Canada is also home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island—latitude 82.5°N—which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole [121] In latitude, Canada's most northerly point of land is Cape Columbia in Nunavut at 83°6′41″N, with its southern extreme at Middle Island in Lake Erie at 41°40′53″N In longitude, Canada's land extends from Cape Spear, Newfoundland, at 52°37'W, to Mount St Elias, Yukon Territory, at 141°W [122]\n\n\nClimate\nAverage winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills [127] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F) [128]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nCanada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine ecozones [135] These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered [136] Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries, [137] due to human activities, invasive species, and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800 species at risk of being lost [138] About 65 percent of Canada's resident species are considered \"Secure\" [139] Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development [140] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000 km2 (1,200,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry [141] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions [142]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nCanada is described as a \"full democracy\", [148] with a tradition of liberalism, [149] and an egalitarian, [150] moderate political ideology [151] An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture [152] Peace, order, and good government, alongside an Implied Bill of Rights, are founding principles of Canadian federalism [153]\n\n\nLaw\nThe Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions [176] The Constitution Act, 1867 (known as the British North America Act, 1867 prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments [177] The Statute of Westminster, 1931, granted full autonomy, and the Constitution Act, 1982, ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [178] The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be overridden by any government; a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years [179]\n\n\nProvinces and territories\nCanada is a federation composed of 10 federated states, called provinces, and three federal territories These may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together) [191] Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and social programs, [192] as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law) Although the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces [193]\n\n\nForeign relations\nCanada is recognized as a middle power for its role in global affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral and international solutions [200] Canada is known for its commitment to international peace and security, as well as being a mediator in conflicts, [201] and for providing aid to developing countries [202]\n\n\nMilitary and peacekeeping\nAlongside many domestic obligations, more than 3,000 Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel are deployed in multiple foreign military operations [213] The Canadian unified forces comprise the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force The nation employs a professional, volunteer force of approximately 68,000 active personnel and 27,000 reserve personnel—increasing to 71,500 and 30,000 respectively under \"Strong, Secure, Engaged\" [214]—with a sub-component of approximately 5,000 Canadian Rangers [215] [c] In 2022, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately $26.9 billion, or around 1.2 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) – placing it 14th for military expenditure by country [217]\n\n\nEconomy\nCanada has a highly developed mixed-market economy, [226] with the world's ninth-largest economy as of 2023 [update], and a nominal GDP of approximately US$2.221 trillion [227] It is one of the world's largest trading nations, with a highly globalized economy [228] In 2021, Canadian trade in goods and services reached $2.016 trillion [229] Canada's exports totalled over $637 billion, while its imported goods were worth over $631 billion, of which approximately $391 billion originated from the United States [229] In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods of $22 billion and a trade deficit in services of $25 billion [229] The Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion [230]\n\n\nScience and technology\nIn 2020, Canada spent approximately $41.9 billion on domestic research and development, with supplementary estimates for 2022 at $43.2 billion [258] As of 2023 [update], the country has produced 15 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine [259] The country ranks seventh in the worldwide share of articles published in scientific journals, according to the Nature Index, [260] and is home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms [261] Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with over 33 million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total population [262]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure [278] It is estimated that Canada's population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023 [279] The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth [280] Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world, [281] driven mainly by economic policy and family reunification [282] A record 405,000 immigrants were admitted in 2021 [283] Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement; it resettled more than 47,600 in 2022 [284] New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas, such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver [285]\n\n\nEthnicity\nRespondents in the 2021 Canadian census self-reported over 450 \"ethnic or cultural origins\" [293] The major panethnic groups chosen were: European (52.5 percent), North American (22.9 percent), Asian (19.3 percent), North American Indigenous (6.1 percent), African (3.8 percent), Latin, Central and South American (2.5 percent), Caribbean (2.1 percent), Oceanian (0.3 percent), and other (6 percent) [293] Over 60 percent of Canadians reported a single origin, and 36 percent reported having multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100 percent [293]\n\n\nLanguages\nA multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 54 percent and 19 percent of Canadians, respectively [291] Canada's official bilingualism policies give citizens the right to receive federal government services in either English or French with official-language minorities guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories [307]\n\n\nReligion\nCanada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs [320] The Constitution of Canada refers to God; however, Canada has no official church and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism [321] Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right [322]\n\n\nHealth\nHealthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of publicly funded health care, informally called Medicare [333] It is guided by the provisions of the Canada Health Act of 1984 [334] and is universal [335] Universal access to publicly funded health services \"is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national healthcare insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country\" [336] Around 30 percent of Canadians' healthcare is paid for through the private sector [337] This mostly pays for services not covered or partially covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry [337] Approximately 65 to 75 percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance; many receive it through their employers or access secondary social service programs [338]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Canada is for the most part provided publicly, funded and overseen by federal, provincial, and local governments [350] Education is within provincial jurisdiction and a province's curriculum is overseen by its government [351] Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education, followed by secondary and post-secondary education Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada [352] Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded [353] Established in 1663, Université Laval is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada [354] The nation's three top ranking universities are the University of Toronto, McGill, and the University of British Columbia [355] The largest university is the University of Toronto, which has over 85,000 students [356]\n\n\nCulture\nHistorically, Canada has been influenced by British, French, and Indigenous cultures and traditions [366] During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture [367]\n\n\nSymbols\nThemes of nature, pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of Canadian symbolism [378] Modern symbols emphasize the country's geography, cold climate, lifestyles, and the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous symbols [379] The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags and on the Arms of Canada [380] Canada's official tartan, known as the \"maple leaf tartan\", reflects the colours of the maple leaf through the seasons—green in the spring, gold in the early autumn, red at the first frost, and brown after falling [381] The Arms of Canada are closely modelled after those of the United Kingdom, with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version [382]\n\n\nLiterature\nCanadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively [387] The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration [388] This progressed into three major themes of historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all of which tie into the garrison mentality [389] In recent decades, Canada's literature has been strongly influenced by immigrants from around the world [390] By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best [391]\n\n\nMedia\nCanada's media is highly autonomous, uncensored, diverse, and very regionalized [397] The Broadcasting Act declares \"the system should serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the cultural, political, social, and economic fabric of Canada\" [398] Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output—particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines—is often overshadowed by imports from the United States [399] As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) [400]\n\n\nVisual arts\nArt in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by Indigenous peoples, [408] and, in later times, artists have combined British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism [409] The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada [410]\n\n\nMusic\nCanadian music reflects a variety of regional scenes [418] Canada has developed a vast music infrastructure that includes church halls, chamber halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record companies, radio stations, and television music video channels [419] Government support programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and diverse Canadian music [420] As a result of its cultural importance, as well as government initiatives and regulations, the Canadian music industry is one of the largest in the world, [421] producing internationally renowned composers, musicians, and ensembles [422] Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC [423] The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards [424] The Canadian Music Hall of Fame honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements [425]\n\n\nSports\nCanada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse [430] Other major professional games include curling, basketball, baseball, soccer, and football [431] Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by numerous \"Halls of Fame\" and museums, such as Canada's Sports Hall of Fame [432]\n\n\nSee

diverse country located in the northern part of North America. It is the world's second-largest country by total area, with a land area of approximately 9,984,670 square kilometers (3,855,100 square miles). Canada has a rich history, with a unique blend of cultures, languages, and traditions that have shaped the country into what it is today.\n\nEtymology\nThe name \"Canada\" is derived from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word \"kanata,\" which means \"village\" or \"settlement.\" In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona. Cartier later used the word \"Canada\" to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona, the chief at Stadacona. By 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada.\n\nHistory\nThe first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago. The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.\n\nIndigenous Peoples\nThe first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago. The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity.\n\nEuropean Colonization\nIt is believed that the first documented European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson. In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland. No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of Henry VII of England.\n\nBritish North America\nThe Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia. St John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769. To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule.\n\nConfederation and Expansion\nFollowing three constitutional conferences, the British North America Act, 1867 officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870. British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years.\n\nEarly 20th Century\nBecause Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into the First World War. Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war. The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers.\n\nContemporary Era\nThe financial crisis of the Great Depression led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor. After two referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.\n\nGeography\nBy total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country. By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest area of fresh water lakes. Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670 square kilometers (3,855,100 square miles) of territory. Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometers (151,019 miles).\n\nClimate\nAverage winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near -15°C (5°F), but can drop below -40°C (-40°F) with severe wind chills. In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north, snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s°C (70s°F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30°C (77 to 86°F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40°C (104°F).\n\nBiodiversity\nCanada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine ecozones. These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered. Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries, due to human activities, invasive species, and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800 species at risk of being lost. About 65 percent of Canada's resident species are considered \"Secure.\" Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development. The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000 square kilometers (1,200,000 square miles) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.\n\nGovernment and Politics\nCanada is described as a \"full democracy,\" with a tradition of liberalism, and an egalitarian, moderate political ideology. An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture. Peace, order, and good government, alongside an Implied Bill of Rights, are founding principles of Canadian federalism.\n\nLaw\nThe Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions. The Constitution Act, 1867 (known as the British North America Act, 1867 prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments. The Statute of Westminster, 1931, granted full autonomy, and the Constitution Act, 1982, ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nProvinces and Territories\nCanada is a federation composed of 10 federated states, called provinces, and three federal territories. These may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and social programs, as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Although the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.\n\nForeign Relations\nCanada is recognized as a middle power for its role in global affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral and international solutions. Canada is known for its commitment to international peace and security, as well as being a mediator in conflicts, and for providing aid to developing countries.\n\nMilitary and Peacekeeping\nAlongside many domestic obligations, more than 3,000 Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel are deployed in multiple foreign military operations. The Canadian unified forces comprise the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force. The nation employs a professional, volunteer force of approximately 68,000 active personnel and 27,000 reserve personnel—increasing to 71,500 and 30,000 respectively under \"Strong, Secure, Engaged.\" In 2022, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately $26.9 billion, or around 1.2 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP)—placing it 14th for military expenditure by country.\n\nEconomy\nCanada has a highly developed mixed-market economy, with the world's ninth-largest economy as of 2023. It is one of the world's largest trading nations, with a highly globalized economy. In 2021, Canadian trade in goods and services reached $2.016 trillion. Canada's exports totalled over $637 billion, while its imported goods were worth over $631 billion, of which approximately $391 billion originated from the United States. In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods of $22 billion and a trade deficit in services of $25 billion. The Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion.\n\nScience and Technology\nIn 2020, Canada spent approximately $41.9 billion on domestic research and development, with supplementary estimates for 2022 at $43.2 billion. As of 2023, the country has produced 15 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine. The country ranks seventh in the worldwide share of articles published in scientific journals, according to the Nature Index. Canada is home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms. Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with over 33 million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total population.\n\nDemographics\nThe 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure. It is estimated that Canada's population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023. The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth. Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world, driven mainly by economic policy and family reunification. A record 405,000 immigrants were admitted in 2021. Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement; it resettled more than 47,600 in 2022.\n\nEthnicity\nRespondents in the 2021 Canadian census self-reported over 450 \"ethnic or cultural origins.\" The major panethnic groups chosen were: European (52.5 percent), North American (22.9 percent), Asian (19.3 percent), North American Indigenous (6.1 percent), African (3.8 percent), Latin, Central and South American (2.5 percent), Caribbean (2.1 percent), Oceanian (0.3 percent), and other (6 percent). Over 60 percent of Canadians reported a single origin, and 36 percent reported having multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100 percent.\n\nLanguages\nA multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 54 percent and 19 percent of Canadians, respectively.

[52] More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule [53] It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies [54] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution [15]\n\n\nConfederation and expansion\nFollowing three constitutional conferences, the British North America Act, 1867 officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick [67] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870 [68] British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years, [69] while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873 [70] In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905 [70] Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US [71]\n\n\nEarly 20th century\nBecause Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into the First World War [79] Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war [80] The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers [81] In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain, [80] and the Statute of Westminster, 1931, affirmed Canada's independence [82]\n\n\nContemporary era\nThe financial crisis of the Great Depression led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor [88] After two referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province [89]\n\n\nGeography\nBy total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country [115] By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest area of fresh water lakes [116] Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670 km2 (3,855,100 sq mi) of territory [117] Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi) [118] In addition to sharing the world's largest land border with the United States—spanning 8,891 km (5,525 mi) [a]—Canada shares a land border with Greenland (and hence the Kingdom of Denmark) to the northeast, on Hans Island, [119] and a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast [120] Canada is also home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island—latitude 82.5°N—which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole [121] In latitude, Canada's most northerly point of land is Cape Columbia in Nunavut at 83°6′41″N, with its southern extreme at Middle Island in Lake Erie at 41°40′53″N In longitude, Canada's land extends from Cape Spear, Newfoundland, at 52°37'W, to Mount St Elias, Yukon Territory, at 141°W [122]\n\n\nClimate\nAverage winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills [127] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F) [128]\n\n\nBiodiversity\nCanada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine ecozones [135] These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered [136] Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries, [137] due to human activities, invasive species, and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800 species at risk of being lost [138] About 65 percent of Canada's resident species are considered \"Secure\" [139] Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development [140] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000 km2 (1,200,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry [141] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions [142]\n\n\nGovernment and politics\nCanada is described as a \"full democracy\", [148] with a tradition of liberalism, [149] and an egalitarian, [150] moderate political ideology [151] An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture [152] Peace, order, and good government, alongside an Implied Bill of Rights, are founding principles of Canadian federalism [153]\n\n\nLaw\nThe Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions [176] The Constitution Act, 1867 (known as the British North America Act, 1867 prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments [177] The Statute of Westminster, 1931, granted full autonomy, and the Constitution Act, 1982, ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [178] The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be overridden by any government; a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years [179]\n\n\nProvinces and territories\nCanada is a federation composed of 10 federated states, called provinces, and three federal territories These may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together) [191] Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and social programs, [192] as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law) Although the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces [193]\n\n\nForeign relations\nCanada is recognized as a middle power for its role in global affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral and international solutions [200] Canada is known for its commitment to international peace and security, as well as being a mediator in conflicts, [201] and for providing aid to developing countries [202]\n\n\nMilitary and peacekeeping\nAlongside many domestic obligations, more than 3,000 Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel are deployed in multiple foreign military operations [213] The Canadian unified forces comprise the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force The nation employs a professional, volunteer force of approximately 68,000 active personnel and 27,000 reserve personnel—increasing to 71,500 and 30,000 respectively under \"Strong, Secure, Engaged\" [214]—with a sub-component of approximately 5,000 Canadian Rangers [215] [c] In 2022, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately $26.9 billion, or around 1.2 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) – placing it 14th for military expenditure by country [217]\n\n\nEconomy\nCanada has a highly developed mixed-market economy, [226] with the world's ninth-largest economy as of 2023 [update], and a nominal GDP of approximately US$2.221 trillion [227] It is one of the world's largest trading nations, with a highly globalized economy [228] In 2021, Canadian trade in goods and services reached $2.016 trillion [229] Canada's exports totalled over $637 billion, while its imported goods were worth over $631 billion, of which approximately $391 billion originated from the United States [229] In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods of $22 billion and a trade deficit in services of $25 billion [229] The Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion [230]\n\n\nScience and technology\nIn 2020, Canada spent approximately $41.9 billion on domestic research and development, with supplementary estimates for 2022 at $43.2 billion [258] As of 2023 [update], the country has produced 15 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine [259] The country ranks seventh in the worldwide share of articles published in scientific journals, according to the Nature Index, [260] and is home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms [261] Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with over 33 million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total population [262]\n\n\nDemographics\nThe 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure [278] It is estimated that Canada's population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023 [279] The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth [280] Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world, [281] driven mainly by economic policy and family reunification [282] A record 405,000 immigrants were admitted in 2021 [283] Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement; it resettled more than 47,600 in 2022 [284] New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas, such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver [285]\n\n\nEthnicity\nRespondents in the 2021 Canadian census self-reported over 450 \"ethnic or cultural origins\" [293] The major panethnic groups chosen were: European (52.5 percent), North American (22.9 percent), Asian (19.3 percent), North American Indigenous (6.1 percent), African (3.8 percent), Latin, Central and South American (2.5 percent), Caribbean (2.1 percent), Oceanian (0.3 percent), and other (6 percent) [293] Over 60 percent of Canadians reported a single origin, and 36 percent reported having multiple ethnic origins, thus the overall total is greater than 100 percent [293]\n\n\nLanguages\nA multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 54 percent and 19 percent of Canadians, respectively [291] Canada's official bilingualism policies give citizens the right to receive federal government services in either English or French with official-language minorities guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories [307]\n\n\nReligion\nCanada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs [320] The Constitution of Canada refers to God; however, Canada has no official church and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism [321] Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right [322]\n\n\nHealth\nHealthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of publicly funded health care, informally called Medicare [333] It is guided by the provisions of the Canada Health Act of 1984 [334] and is universal [335] Universal access to publicly funded health services \"is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national healthcare insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country\" [336] Around 30 percent of Canadians' healthcare is paid for through the private sector [337] This mostly pays for services not covered or partially covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry [337] Approximately 65 to 75 percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance; many receive it through their employers or access secondary social service programs [338]\n\n\nEducation\nEducation in Canada is for the most part provided publicly, funded and overseen by federal, provincial, and local governments [350] Education is within provincial jurisdiction and a province's curriculum is overseen by its government [351] Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education, followed by secondary and post-secondary education Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada [352] Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded [353] Established in 1663, Université Laval is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada [354] The nation's three top ranking universities are the University of Toronto, McGill, and the University of British Columbia [355] The largest university is the University of Toronto, which has over 85,000 students [356]\n\n\nCulture\nHistorically, Canada has been influenced by British, French, and Indigenous cultures and traditions [366] During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture [367]\n\n\nSymbols\nThemes of nature, pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important part in the early development of Canadian symbolism [378] Modern symbols emphasize the country's geography, cold climate, lifestyles, and the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous symbols [379] The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags and on the Arms of Canada [380] Canada's official tartan, known as the \"maple leaf tartan\", reflects the colours of the maple leaf through the seasons—green in the spring, gold in the early autumn, red at the first frost, and brown after falling [381] The Arms of Canada are closely modelled after those of the United Kingdom, with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version [382]\n\n\nLiterature\nCanadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively [387] The earliest Canadian narratives were of travel and exploration [388] This progressed into three major themes of historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all of which tie into the garrison mentality [389] In recent decades, Canada's literature has been strongly influenced by immigrants from around the world [390] By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best [391]\n\n\nMedia\nCanada's media is highly autonomous, uncensored, diverse, and very regionalized [397] The Broadcasting Act declares \"the system should serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the cultural, political, social, and economic fabric of Canada\" [398] Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output—particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines—is often overshadowed by imports from the United States [399] As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) [400]\n\n\nVisual arts\nArt in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by Indigenous peoples, [408] and, in later times, artists have combined British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism [409] The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in Canada [410]\n\n\nMusic\nCanadian music reflects a variety of regional scenes [418] Canada has developed a vast music infrastructure that includes church halls, chamber halls, conservatories, academies, performing arts centres, record companies, radio stations, and television music video channels [419] Government support programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and diverse Canadian music [420] As a result of its cultural importance, as well as government initiatives and regulations, the Canadian music industry is one of the largest in the world, [421] producing internationally renowned composers, musicians, and ensembles [422] Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC [423] The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards [424] The Canadian Music Hall of Fame honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements [425]\n\n\nSports\nCanada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse [430] Other major professional games include curling, basketball, baseball, soccer, and football [431] Great achievements in Canadian sports are recognized by numerous \"Halls of Fame\" and museums, such as Canada's Sports Hall of Fame [432]\n\n\nSee also\nOverview\n\n\nNotes\nOverview\n\n\nReferences\nOverview\n\n\nFurther reading\nOverview\n\n\nExternal links\nOverviews\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in May 1999, Thomas began swimming at a young age and has been a member of the University of Pennsylvania's swim team since 2017.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nThomas was born in Austin, Texas, and has an older brother. She grew up in a supportive family that encouraged her to pursue her passion for swimming. Thomas began swimming at the age of five and quickly fell in love with the sport. She competed for Westlake High School, where she was sixth in the state high school swimming championships for boys' events. Thomas's talent and dedication to swimming earned her a spot on the University of Pennsylvania's swim team in 2017.\n\nDuring her time at the University of Pennsylvania, Thomas graduated in 2022 with a degree in sociology. She had plans to attend law school, but her academic and athletic pursuits were put on hold due to her swimming career. Thomas's experience at the University of Pennsylvania not only helped her develop her swimming skills but also instilled in her a strong sense of discipline and time management.\n\n## Swimming Career\n\nThomas began swimming on the men's team at the University of Pennsylvania in 2017. During her freshman year, she recorded a time of 8:57.55 in the 1,000-yard freestyle, which ranked as the sixth-fastest national men's time.

Her decision to compete in the women's category sparked a heated debate in the swimming community, with some questioning her eligibility to compete. Despite the controversy, Thomas continued to excel in the pool, shattering school records and posting the fastest times of any female college swimmer in two events.\n\n## Public Debate\n\nThe debate surrounding Thomas's eligibility to compete in the women's category began to gain traction in 2021, with conservative media outlets such as Fox News widely covering the story. Anonymous parents of University of Pennsylvania swim team members wrote to the NCAA, seeking to have Thomas declared ineligible to compete. USA Swimming official Cynthia Millen resigned in protest, citing concerns about Thomas's eligibility.\n\nThe debate surrounding Thomas's eligibility sparked a national conversation about the inclusion of transgender athletes in sports. Some argued that Thomas's participation in the women's category was unfair, citing concerns about her physical advantages. Others argued that Thomas's eligibility was a matter of personal identity and that she should be allowed to compete.\n\n## Legal Challenge\n\nIn January 2024, Thomas opened a legal challenge to the World Aquatics gender inclusion policy. The policy, introduced in 2022, allows trans women to compete in the women's category as long as any male puberty was halted by age 12 or Tanner Stage 2. Thomas's challenge argued that this policy is discriminatory, as it excludes trans women who have not undergone puberty suppression.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled in June 2024 that Thomas did not have standing to challenge the policy, meaning she would remain ineligible to compete. The decision was seen as a setback for trans athletes, who argue that the policy is discriminatory and excludes them from competing in their chosen category.\n\n## Swimming Records\n\nThomas has set numerous records in the swimming world. Her personal bests in the 500 free, 1,000 free, and 1,650 free are among the fastest times in the country. Thomas has also broken records in the 200 free and 400 free, demonstrating her versatility and dominance in the pool.\n\nThomas's records are as follows:\n\n* 500 free: 4:35.04\n* 1,000 free: 8:57.55\n* 1,650 free: 16:34.79\n* 200 free: 1:42.14\n* 400 free: 3:50.84\n\n## Personal Bests\n\nThomas's personal bests in the 500 free, 1,000 free, and 1,650 free are among the fastest times in the country. Her personal bests are as follows:\n\n* 500 free: 4:35.04\n* 1,000 free: 8:57.55\n* 1,650 free: 16:34.79\n* 200 free: 1:42.14\n* 400 free: 3:50.84\n\n## Penn Men's Swim Team Records\n\nThomas's times in the 500 free, 1,000 free, and 1,650 free are the top UPenn men's team times. Her records are as follows:\n\n* 500 free: 4:35.04\n* 1,000 free: 8:57.55\n* 1,650 free: 16:34.79\n* 200 free: 1:42.14\n* 400 free: 3:50.84\n\n## Penn Women's Swim Team Records\n\nThomas's times in the 500 free, 1,000 free, and 1,650 free are the top UPenn women's team times.

{"title": "Louis_Armstrong", "content": "\nEarly life\nArmstrong is believed to have been born in New Orleans on August 4, 1901, but the date has been heavily debated Armstrong himself often claimed he was born on July 4, 1900 [6] [7] [8] His parents were Mary Estelle \"Mayann\" Albert and William Armstrong Mary Albert was from Boutte, Louisiana and gave birth at home when she was about 16 Less than a year and a half later, they had a daughter, Beatrice \"Mama Lucy\" Armstrong (1903–1987), who Albert raised [9] William Armstrong abandoned the family shortly after that [10]\n\n\nCareer\nEarly in his career, Armstrong played in brass bands and riverboats in New Orleans, in the late 1910s He traveled with the band of Fate Marable, which toured on the steamboat Sidney with the Streckfus Steamers line up and down the Mississippi River [33] Marable was proud of Armstrong's musical knowledge, and he insisted that Armstrong and other musicians in his band learn sight reading Armstrong described his time with Marable as \"going to the University\" since it gave him a wider experience working with written arrangements In 1918, Armstrong's mentor, King Oliver, decided to go north and resigned his position in Kid Ory's band; Armstrong replaced him Armstrong also became the second trumpet for the Tuxedo Brass Band [34]\n\n\nRiverboat education\nEarly in his career, Armstrong played in brass bands and riverboats in New Orleans, in the late 1910s He traveled with the band of Fate Marable, which toured on the steamboat Sidney with the Streckfus Steamers line up and down the Mississippi River [33] Marable was proud of Armstrong's musical knowledge, and he insisted that Armstrong and other musicians in his band learn sight reading Armstrong described his time with Marable as \"going to the University\" since it gave him a wider experience working with written arrangements In 1918, Armstrong's mentor, King Oliver, decided to go north and resigned his position in Kid Ory's band; Armstrong replaced him Armstrong also became the second trumpet for the Tuxedo Brass Band [34]\n\n\nChicago period recordings\nIn 1922, Armstrong moved to Chicago at the invitation of King Oliver, [36] although Armstrong would return to New Orleans periodically for the rest of his life [37] Playing second cornet to Oliver in Oliver's Creole Jazz Band in the black-only Lincoln Gardens on the South Side of Chicago, Armstrong could make enough money to quit his day jobs Although race relations were poor, Chicago was booming The city had jobs for blacks, who made good wages at factories, with some left for entertainment [36]: 86 \n\n\nFletcher Henderson Orchestra\nArmstrong and Oliver parted amicably in 1924 Shortly afterward, Armstrong was invited to go to New York City to play with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, the top African-American band of the time He switched to the trumpet to blend in better with the other musicians in his section Armstrong's influence on Henderson's tenor sax soloist, Coleman Hawkins, can be judged by listening to the records made by the band during this period [42] [43]\n\n\nThe Hot Five\nIn 1925, Armstrong returned to Chicago largely at the insistence of Lil, who wanted to expand his career and income In publicity, much to his chagrin, she billed Armstrong as \"The World's Greatest Trumpet Player.\" For a time, he was a member of the Lil Hardin Armstrong Band and worked for his wife [47] Armstrong formed Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five and recorded the hits \"Potato Head Blues\" and \"Muggles\" The word \"muggles\" was a slang term for marijuana, something Armstrong often used during his life [36]\n\n\nThe Harlem Renaissance\nArmstrong made a huge impact during the 1920s Harlem Renaissance [56] His music touched well-known writer Langston Hughes Hughes admired Armstrong and acknowledged him as one of the most recognized musicians of the era [57] Hughes wrote many books that celebrated jazz and recognized Armstrong as one of the leaders of the Harlem Renaissance's newfound love of African-American culture [58] The sound of jazz, along with musicians such as Armstrong, helped shape Hughes as a writer Just like the musicians, Hughes wrote his words with jazz [59]\n\n\nEmerging as a vocalist\nArmstrong returned to New York in 1929, where he played in the pit orchestra for the musical Hot Chocolates, an all-black revue written by Andy Razaf and pianist Fats Waller Armstrong made a cameo appearance as a vocalist, regularly stealing the show with his rendition of \"Ain't Misbehavin'.\" Armstrong's version of the song became his biggest-selling record yet [62]\n\n\nWork during hard times\nThe Great Depression of the early 1930s was especially hard on the jazz scene After a long downward spiral, the Cotton Club closed in 1936, and many musicians stopped playing altogether as club dates evaporated Bix Beiderbecke died, and Fletcher Henderson's band broke up King Oliver made a few records but otherwise struggled Sidney Bechet became a tailor, later moving to Paris, and Kid Ory returned to New Orleans and raised chickens [64]\n\n\nReviving his career with the All-Stars\nAfter spending many years on the road, Armstrong settled permanently in Queens, New York, in 1943 with his fourth wife, Lucille Although subject to the vicissitudes of Tin Pan Alley and the gangster-ridden music business, as well as anti-black prejudice, Armstrong continued to develop his playing.\n\n\nA jazz ambassador\n\nBy the 1950s, Armstrong was a widely beloved American icon and cultural ambassador who commanded an international fanbase However, a growing generation gap became apparent between him and the young jazz musicians who emerged in the postwar era, such as Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Sonny Rollins The postwar generation regarded their music as abstract art and considered Armstrong's vaudevillian style, half-musician and half-stage entertainer, outmoded and Uncle Tomism \".. he seemed a link to minstrelsy that we were ashamed of.\" [71] Armstrong called bebop \"Chinese music\" [72] While touring Australia in 1954, he was asked if he could play bebop \"'Bebop?' he husked 'I just play music Guys who invent terms like that are walking the streets with their instruments under their arms.'\" [73]\n\nPersonal life\nThe Louis Armstrong House Museum website states:\n\n\nPronunciation of name\nThe Louis Armstrong House Museum website states:\n\n\nFamily\nArmstrong was performing at the Brick House in Gretna, Louisiana when he met Daisy Parker, a local prostitute, and started an affair as a client Armstrong returned to Gretna on several occasions to visit her He found the courage to look for her home to see her away from work There, Armstrong found out she had a common-law husband Not long after that fiasco, Parker traveled to Armstrong's home on Perdido Street [86] They checked into Kid Green's hotel that evening On the next day, March 19, 1919, Armstrong and Parker married at City Hall [86] [87] They adopted a three-year-old boy, Clarence, whose mother, Armstrong's cousin Flora, had died soon after giving birth Clarence Armstrong was mentally disabled as a result of a head injury at an early age Armstrong spent the rest of his life taking care of him [88] His marriage to Parker ended when they separated in 1923.\n\n\nPersonality\nArmstrong was colorful and charismatic His autobiography vexed some biographers and historians because Armstrong had a habit of telling tales, particularly about his early childhood when he was less scrutinized, and his embellishments lack consistency [96]\n\n\nHealth problems\nThe trumpet is notoriously hard on the lips, and Armstrong suffered from lip damage over most of his life This was due to Armstrong's aggressive playing style and preference for narrow mouthpieces that would stay in place more easily but tended to dig into the soft flesh of his inner lip During his 1930s European tour, Armstrong suffered an ulceration so severe that he had to stop playing entirely for a year Eventually, Armstrong took to using salves and creams on his lips and also cutting off scar tissue with a razor blade By the 1950s, Armstrong was an official spokesman for Ansatz-Creme Lip Salve [97]\n\n\nNicknames\nThe nicknames \"Satchmo\" and \"Satch\" are short for \"Satchelmouth\" The nickname origin is uncertain [96] The most common tale that biographers tell is the story of Armstrong as a young boy in New Orleans dancing for pennies He scooped the coins off the street and stuck them into his mouth to prevent bigger children from stealing them Someone dubbed Armstrong \"satchel mouth\" for his mouth acting as a satchel Another tale is that because of his large mouth, Armstrong was nicknamed \"satchel mouth\", which was shortened to \"Satchmo.\" [96]\n\n\nRace\nArmstrong celebrated his heritage as an African American man from a poor New Orleans neighborhood and tried to avoid what he called \"putting on airs.\" Many younger black musicians criticized Armstrong for playing in front of segregated audiences and for not taking a stronger stand in the American civil rights movement [102] When Armstrong did speak out, it made national news In 1957, journalism student Larry Lubenow scored a candid interview with Armstrong while the musician was performing in Grand Forks, North Dakota, shortly after the conflict over school desegregation in Little Rock, Arkansas Armstrong denounced both Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus and President Dwight D Eisenhower, saying the President had \"no guts\" and was \"two-faced.\" Armstrong told his interviewer that he would cancel a planned tour of the Soviet Union on behalf of the State Department, saying, \"The way they're treating my people in the South, the government can go to hell\"; he could not represent his government abroad when it was in conflict with its own people [103] [104] The FBI kept a file on Armstrong for his outspokenness about integration [105]\n\n\nReligion\nWhen asked about his religion, Armstrong answered that he was raised a Baptist, always wore a Star of David, and was friends with the pope [106] Armstrong wore the Star of David in honor of the Karnoffsky family who took him in as a child and lent him money to buy his first cornet Armstrong was baptized a Catholic in the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church in New Orleans, [106] and he met Pope Pius XII and Pope Paul VI [96]\n\n\nPersonal habits\nArmstrong was concerned with his health Armstrong used laxatives to control his weight, a practice he advocated both to acquaintances and in the diet plans he published under the title Lose Weight the Satchmo Way [96] Armstrong's laxative of preference in his younger days was Pluto Water, but when he discovered the herbal remedy Swiss Kriss, he became an enthusiastic convert, [96] extolling its virtues to anyone who would listen and passing out packets to everyone he encountered, including members of the British Royal Family.\n\n\nWritings\nArmstrong's gregariousness extended to writing On the road, he wrote constantly, sharing favorite themes of his life with correspondents around the world Armstrong avidly typed or wrote on whatever stationery was at hand, recording instant takes on music, sex, food, childhood memories, his heavy \"medicinal\" marijuana use, and even his bowel movements, which Armstrong gleefully described [116]\n\n\nSocial organizations\nLouis Armstrong was not, as claimed, a Freemason Although he has been cited as a Montgomery Lodge No 18 (Prince Hall) member in New York, no such lodge ever existed In his autobiography, Armstrong stated that he was a member of the Knights of Pythias of North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, an African American non-Masonic fraternal organization [117] During the krewe's 1949 Mardi Gras parade, Armstrong presided as King of the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club, for which he was featured on the cover of Time magazine [118]\n\n\nMusic\nIn his early years, Armstrong was best known for his virtuosity with the cornet and trumpet Along with his \"clarinet-like figurations and high notes in his cornet solos\", Armstrong was also known for his \"intense rhythmic 'swing', a complex conception involving accented upbeats, upbeat to downbeat slurring, and complementary relations among rhythmic patterns [119] The most lauded recordings on which Armstrong plays trumpet include the Hot Five and Hot Seven sessions, as well as those of the Red Onion Jazz Babies Armstrong's improvisations, while unconventionally sophisticated for that era, were also subtle and highly melodic The solo that Armstrong plays during the song \"Potato Head Blues\" has long been considered his best solo of that series [96] [120]\n\n\nHorn playing and early jazz\nIn his early years, Armstrong was best known for his virtuosity with the cornet and trumpet Along with his \"clarinet-like figurations and high notes in his cornet solos\", Armstrong was also known for his \"intense rhythmic 'swing', a complex conception involving accented upbeats, upbeat to downbeat slurring, and complementary relations among rhythmic patterns [119] The most lauded recordings on which Armstrong plays trumpet include the Hot Five and Hot Seven sessions, as well as those of the Red Onion Jazz Babies Armstrong's improvisations, while unconventionally sophisticated for that era, were also subtle and highly melodic The solo that Armstrong plays during the song \"Potato Head Blues\" has long been considered his best solo of that series [96] [120]\n\n\nVocal popularity\nAs Armstrong's music progressed and popularity grew, his singing also became very important Armstrong was not the first to record scat singing, but he was masterful at it and helped popularize it with the first recording on which he scatted, \"Heebie Jeebies.\" At a recording session for Okeh Records, when the sheet music supposedly fell on the floor, and the music began before Armstrong could pick up the pages, he simply started singing nonsense syllables while Okeh President E.A Fearn, who was at the session, kept telling him to continue Armstrong did, thinking the track would be discarded, but that was the version that was pressed to disc, sold, and became an unexpected hit Although the story was thought to be apocryphal, Armstrong himself confirmed it in at least one interview as well as in his memoirs [122] On a later recording, Armstrong also sang out \"I done forgot the words\" in the middle of recording \"I'm A Ding Dong Daddy From Dumas.\"\n\n\nComposing\nArmstrong was a gifted composer who wrote more than 50 songs, some of which have become jazz standards (e.g., \"Gully Low Blues\", \"Potato Head Blues\", and \"Swing That Music\").\n\n\nColleagues and followers\nDuring his long career, Armstrong played and sang with some of the most important instrumentalists and vocalists of the time, including Bing Crosby, Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Jimmie Rodgers, Bessie Smith, and Ella Fitzgerald His influence upon Crosby is particularly important with regard to the subsequent development of popular music Crosby admired and copied Armstrong, as is evident on many of his early recordings, notably \"Just One More Chance\" (1931) [96] The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz describes Crosby's debt to Armstrong in precise detail, although it does not acknowledge Armstrong by name:\n\n\nHits and later career\nArmstrong had 19 \"Top Ten\" records [125] including \"Stardust\", \"What a Wonderful World\", \"When The Saints Go Marching In\", \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\", \"Ain't Misbehavin'\", \"You Rascal You\", and \"Stompin' at the Savoy\" \"We Have All the Time in the World\" was featured on the soundtrack of the James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and enjoyed renewed popularity in the UK in 1994 when it was featured on a Guinness advertisement It reached number 3 in the charts on being re-released.\n\n\nStylistic range\nArmstrong enjoyed many types of music, from blues to the arrangements of Guy Lombardo, to Latin American folksongs, to classical symphonies and opera Armstrong incorporated influences from all these sources into his performances, sometimes to the bewilderment of fans who wanted him to stay in convenient narrow categories Armstrong was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an early influence Some of his solos from the 1950s, such as the hard rocking version of \"St Louis Blues\" from the WC Handy album, show that the influence went in both directions [96]\n\n\nFilm, television, and radio\nArmstrong appeared in more than a dozen Hollywood films, usually playing a bandleader or musician His most familiar role was as the bandleader cum narrator in the 1956 musical High Society, starring Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Celeste Holm Armstrong appears throughout the film, sings the title song, and performs the duet \"Now You Has Jazz\" with Crosby [127] In 1947, Armstrong played himself in the movie New Orleans opposite Billie Holiday, which chronicled the demise of the Storyville district and the ensuing exodus of musicians from New Orleans to Chicago In the 1959 film The Five Pennies, Armstrong played himself, sang, and played several classic numbers He performed a duet of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" with Danny Kaye, during which Kaye impersonated Armstrong He had a part in the film alongside James Stewart in The Glenn Miller Story.\n\n\nDeath\nAgainst his doctor's advice, Armstrong played a two-week engagement in March 1971 at the Waldorf-Astoria's Empire Room At the end of it, he was hospitalized for a heart attack [133] Armstrong was released from the hospital in May and quickly resumed practicing his trumpet playing Still hoping to get back on the road, Armstrong died of a heart attack in his sleep on July 6, 1971 Armstrong was residing in Corona, Queens, New York City, at the time of his death [134]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nArmstrong was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1972 by the Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences This Special Merit Award is presented by vote of the Recording Academy's National Trustees to performers who, during their lifetimes, have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the recording field [137]\n\n\nGrammy Awards\nArmstrong was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1972 by the Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences

of the 20th century, said, \"He is the beginning and the end of music in America.\" [143] Duke Ellington, DownBeat magazine in 1971, said, \"If anybody was a master, it was Louis Armstrong He was and will continue to be the embodiment of jazz.\" [144] Though Armstrong is widely recognized as a pioneer of scat singing, Ethel Waters and others preceded his scatting on record in the 1920s according to Gary Giddins and others [145]\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Louis Armstrong**\n\n**Early

Armstrong described his time with Marable as \"going to the University\" since it gave him a wider experience working with written arrangements.

For a time, he was a member of the Lil Hardin Armstrong Band and worked for his wife.

However, a growing generation gap became apparent between him and the young jazz musicians who emerged in the postwar era, such as Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Sonny Rollins. The postwar generation regarded their music as abstract art and considered Armstrong's vaudevillian style, half-musician and half-stage entertainer, outmoded and Uncle Tomism.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nArmstrong celebrated his heritage as an African American man from a poor New Orleans neighborhood and tried to avoid what he called \"putting on airs.\" Many younger black musicians criticized Armstrong for playing in front of segregated audiences and for not taking a stronger stand in the American civil rights movement. When Armstrong did speak out, it made national news.\n\n**Personality**\n\nArmstrong was colorful and charismatic. His autobiography vexed some biographers and historians because Armstrong had a habit of telling tales, particularly about his early childhood when he was less scrutinized, and his embellishments lack consistency.\n\n**Health Problems**\n\nThe trumpet is notoriously hard on the lips, and Armstrong suffered from lip damage over most of his life. This was due to Armstrong's aggressive playing style and preference for narrow mouthpieces that would stay in place more easily but tended to dig into the soft flesh of his inner lip. During his 1930s European tour, Armstrong suffered an ulceration so severe that he had to stop playing entirely for a year. Eventually, Armstrong took to using salves and creams on his lips and also cutting off scar tissue with a razor blade.\n\n**Nicknames**\n\nArmstrong's nicknames \"Satchmo\" and \"Satch\" are short for \"Satchelmouth.\" The origin of the nickname is uncertain. The most common tale that biographers tell is the story of Armstrong as a young boy in New Orleans dancing for pennies. He scooped the coins off the street and stuck them into his mouth to prevent bigger children from stealing them. Someone dubbed Armstrong \"satchel mouth\" for his mouth acting as a satchel. Another tale is that because of his large mouth, Armstrong was nicknamed \"satchel mouth,\" which was shortened to \"Satchmo.\"\n\n**Race**\n\nArmstrong celebrated his heritage as an African American man from a poor New Orleans neighborhood and tried to avoid what he called \"putting on airs.\" Many younger black musicians criticized Armstrong for playing in front of segregated audiences and for not taking a stronger stand in the American civil rights movement. When Armstrong did speak out, it made national news.\n\n**Religion**\n\nWhen asked about his religion, Armstrong answered that he was raised a Baptist, always wore a Star of David, and was friends with the pope. Armstrong wore the Star of David in honor of the Karnoffsky family who took him in as a child and lent him money to buy his first cornet. Armstrong was baptized a Catholic in the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church in New Orleans.\n\n**Personal Habits**\n\nArmstrong was concerned with his health. Armstrong used laxatives to control his weight, a practice he advocated both to acquaintances and in the diet plans he published under the title Lose Weight the Satchmo Way. Armstrong's laxative of preference in his younger days was Pluto Water, but when he discovered the herbal remedy Swiss Kriss, he became an enthusiastic convert.\n\n**Writings**\n\nArmstrong's gregariousness extended to writing. On the road, he wrote constantly, sharing favorite themes of his life with correspondents around the world. Armstrong avidly typed or wrote on whatever stationery was at hand, recording instant takes on music, sex, food, childhood memories, his heavy \"medicinal\" marijuana use, and even his bowel movements, which Armstrong gleefully described.\n\n**Social Organizations**\n\nLouis Armstrong was not, as claimed, a Freemason. Although he has been cited as a Montgomery Lodge No 18 (Prince Hall) member in New York, no such lodge ever existed. In his autobiography, Armstrong stated that he was a member of the Knights of Pythias of North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, an African American non-Masonic fraternal organization.\n\n**Music**\n\nIn his early years, Armstrong was best known for his virtuosity with the cornet and trumpet. Along with his \"clarinet-like figurations and high notes in his cornet solos,\" Armstrong was also known for his \"intense rhythmic 'swing,' a complex conception involving accented upbeats, upbeat to downbeat slurring, and complementary relations among rhythmic patterns.\" The most lauded recordings on which Armstrong plays trumpet include the Hot Five and Hot Seven sessions, as well as those of the Red Onion Jazz Babies.\n\n**Vocal Popularity**\n\nAs Armstrong's music progressed and popularity grew, his singing also became very important. Armstrong was not the first to record scat singing, but he was masterful at it and helped popularize it with the first recording on which he scatted, \"Heebie Jeebies.\" At a recording session for Okeh Records, when the sheet music supposedly fell on the floor, and the music began before Armstrong could pick up the pages, he simply started singing nonsense syllables while Okeh President E.A Fearn, who was at the session, kept telling him to continue Armstrong did, thinking the track would be discarded, but that was the version that was pressed to disc, sold, and became an unexpected hit.\n\n**Composing**\n\nArmstrong was a gifted composer who wrote more than 50 songs, some of which have become jazz standards, such as \"Gully Low Blues,\" \"Potato Head Blues,\" and \"Swing That Music.\"\n\n**Colleagues and Followers**\n\nDuring his long career, Armstrong played and sang with some of the most important instrumentalists and vocalists of the time, including Bing Crosby, Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Jimmie Rodgers, Bessie Smith, and Ella Fitzgerald.\n\n**Hits and Later Career**\n\nArmstrong had 19 \"Top Ten\" records, including \"Stardust,\" \"What a Wonderful World,\" \"When The Saints Go Marching In,\" \"Dream a Little Dream of Me,\" \"Ain't Misbehavin',\" \"You Rascal You,\" and \"Stompin' at the Savoy.\" \"We Have All the Time in the World\" was featured on the soundtrack of the James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and enjoyed renewed popularity in the UK in 1994 when it was featured on a Guinness advertisement.\n\n**Stylistic Range**\n\nArmstrong enjoyed many types of music, from blues to the arrangements of Guy Lombardo, to Latin American folksongs, to classical symphonies and opera. Armstrong incorporated influences from all these sources into his performances, sometimes to the bewilderment of fans who wanted him to stay in convenient narrow categories.\n\n**Film, Television, and Radio**\n\nArmstrong appeared in more than a dozen Hollywood films, usually playing a bandleader or musician. His most familiar role was as the bandleader cum narrator in the 1956 musical High Society, starring Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Celeste Holm.\n\n**Death**\n\nAgainst his doctor's advice, Armstrong played a two-week engagement in March 1971 at the Waldorf-Astoria's Empire Room. At the end of it, he was hospitalized for a heart attack. Armstrong was released from the hospital in May and quickly resumed practicing his trumpet playing. Still hoping to get back on the road, Armstrong died of a heart attack in his sleep on July 6, 1971. Armstrong was residing in Corona, Queens, New York City, at the time of his death.\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\nArmstrong was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1972 by the Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. This Special Merit Award is presented by vote of the Recording Academy's National Trustees to performers who, during their lifetimes, have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the recording field.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nIn 1950, Bing Crosby, the most successful vocalist of the first half of the 20th century, said, \"He is the beginning and the end of music in America.\" Duke Ellington, DownBeat magazine in 1971, said, \"If anybody was a master, it was Louis Armstrong.

[36]: 86 \n\n\nFletcher Henderson Orchestra\nArmstrong and Oliver parted amicably in 1924 Shortly afterward, Armstrong was invited to go to New York City to play with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, the top African-American band of the time He switched to the trumpet to blend in better with the other musicians in his section Armstrong's influence on Henderson's tenor sax soloist, Coleman Hawkins, can be judged by listening to the records made by the band during this period [42] [43]\n\n\nThe Hot Five\nIn 1925, Armstrong returned to Chicago largely at the insistence of Lil, who wanted to expand his career and income In publicity, much to his chagrin, she billed Armstrong as \"The World's Greatest Trumpet Player.\" For a time, he was a member of the Lil Hardin Armstrong Band and worked for

Armstrong and acknowledged him as one of the most recognized musicians of the era [57] Hughes wrote many books that celebrated jazz and recognized Armstrong as one of the leaders of the Harlem Renaissance's newfound love of African-American culture [58] The sound of jazz, along with musicians such as Armstrong, helped shape Hughes as a writer Just like the musicians, Hughes wrote his words with jazz [59]\n\n\nEmerging as a vocalist\nArmstrong returned to New York in 1929, where he played in the pit orchestra for the musical Hot Chocolates, an all-black revue written by Andy Razaf and pianist Fats Waller Armstrong made a cameo appearance as a vocalist, regularly stealing the show with his rendition of \"Ain't Misbehavin'.\" Armstrong's version of the song became his biggest-selling record yet [62]\n\n\nWork during hard times\nThe Great Depression of the early 1930s was especially hard on the jazz scene After a long downward spiral, the Cotton Club closed in 1936, and many musicians stopped playing altogether as club dates evaporated Bix Beiderbecke died, and Fletcher Henderson's band broke up King Oliver made a few records but otherwise struggled Sidney Bechet became a tailor, later moving to Paris, and Kid Ory returned to New Orleans and raised chickens [64]\n\n\nReviving his career with the All-Stars\nAfter spending many years on the road, Armstrong settled permanently in Queens, New York, in 1943 with his fourth wife, Lucille Although subject to the vicissitudes of Tin Pan Alley and the gangster-ridden music business, as well as anti-black prejudice, Armstrong continued to develop his playing.\n\n\nA jazz ambassador\n\nBy the 1950s, Armstrong was a widely beloved American icon and cultural ambassador who commanded an international fanbase However, a growing generation gap became apparent between him and the young jazz musicians who emerged in the postwar era, such as Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Sonny Rollins The postwar generation regarded their music as abstract art and considered Armstrong's vaudevillian style, half-musician and half-stage entertainer, outmoded and Uncle Tomism \".. he seemed a link to minstrelsy that we were ashamed of.\" [71] Armstrong called bebop \"Chinese music\" [72] While touring Australia in 1954, he was asked if he could play bebop \"'Bebop?' he husked 'I just play music Guys who invent terms like that are walking the streets with their instruments under their arms.'\" [73]\n\nPersonal life\nThe Louis Armstrong House Museum website states:\n\n\nPronunciation of name\nThe Louis Armstrong House Museum

{"title": "Dustin_Higgs", "content": "\nEarly life\nHiggs was born in Poughkeepsie, New York [10] on March 10, 1972, [11] to Alfonso Higgs and Marilyn M Bennett Higgs (1945–1982) [12] When Dustin was 8, his mother was diagnosed with cancer She died two years later, in 1982 Friends and relatives saw a big change in his mood after this [12] [13] He moved to Laurel, Maryland in 1991 [14] By 1996, he was married and had a son [15]\n\n\nMurders\nOn the evening of January 26, 1996, Higgs, Willis Haynes, and Victor Gloria drove from Higgs' apartment in Laurel, Maryland, to Washington, D.C., to pick up Tamika Black, Tanji Jackson, and Mishann Chinn Dates had been arranged for each of the men and women and the groups had agreed to meet and hang out together The six of them traveled in Higgs' vehicle, a blue Mazda MPV van, and returned to his apartment to drink alcohol, smoke marijuana, and listen to music The partying continued into the early hours of January 27 [16]\n\n\nFraud investigation and drug trafficking conviction\nThe murders went unsolved for nearly three years Higgs was first questioned about them in March 1996 at his apartment [17] He acknowledged that he had known Jackson and had talked to her the night before she died He was arrested and his apartment searched, as he was suspected of an unrelated bank fraud violation Police found cocaine and firearms in his apartment On May 12, 1997, he pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine [17] He was sentenced to 17 years in a federal prison [1]\n\n\nRevelation and murder trial\nIn October 1998, Gloria and Haynes were arrested on unrelated drug charges After being questioned, police learned of more details surrounding the murders On December 21, Higgs and Haynes were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of first degree murder, kidnapping resulting in death, and use of a firearm during a crime of violence [18] Higgs was already in custody at the time, serving his 17-year trafficking sentence [17] [19] The government announced they would seek death sentences for both Higgs and Haynes.\n\n\nFederal prosecution's argument\nThe prosecution's version of events was that Higgs got into a heated argument with Tanji Jackson at his apartment on the evening of January 26, 1996 Jackson had supposedly taken a knife from the kitchen and threatened Higgs after she rejected his alleged sexual advances towards her After the argument, the women left the apartment enraged According to Gloria, Jackson made some kind of threat as she left the apartment As Higgs watched the women leave, he saw Jackson appear to write down his license plate number According to Gloria, this angered Higgs, who was concerned that she knew people who might retaliate against him [17]\n\n\nDefense's argument\nThe defense argued that Higgs' alleged reason for wanting the women killed — Jackson rejecting his sexual advances and possibly knowing people who may have retaliated against him — was a very weak motive for ordering three murders They said the idea that the women willingly got into the van for a lift home also contradicted the idea that Jackson was angry at Higgs and would seek revenge [21] The defense claims that the real reason the women were killed was because they owed Haynes and some of his associates drug money Two inmates at the Charles County Detention Center said Haynes had claimed to them to have a much bigger role in the killings [22] One argued Haynes was more of a partner to Higgs than someone who followed orders One said the victims owed him drug money and that Haynes \"had to kill\" one of the women because she had been trying to set him up [23]\n\n\nVerdict\nUltimately, Higgs and Haynes were found guilty of all of the charges The jury spared Haynes' life On August 24, 2000, he was sentenced to nine concurrent life terms without parole, plus 45 years [24] [25] The federal judge at Haynes' trial claimed he had shown no remorse for the killings [4] As of June 2022, he was incarcerated at United States Penitentiary, Beaumont [26]\n\n\nState prosecution\nIn April 1997, in a Maryland state court, Higgs submitted a guilty plea to

the women killed — Jackson rejecting his sexual advances and possibly knowing people who may have retaliated against him — was a very weak motive for ordering three murders They said the idea that the women willingly got into the van for a lift home also contradicted the idea that Jackson was angry at Higgs and would seek revenge [21] The defense claims that the real reason the women were killed was because they owed Haynes and some of his associates drug money Two inmates at the Charles County Detention Center said Haynes had claimed to them to have a much bigger role in the killings [22] One argued Haynes was more of a partner to Higgs than someone who followed orders One said the victims owed him drug money and that Haynes \"had to kill\" one of the women because she had been trying

of working with \"good people, actors and puppets\", feeling that the project made him reflect why he liked making movies [45] Burton came up with the film's story upon thinking about Lydia Deetz, a character of his with whom he connected as a teenager, wondering what could have been of her life after the first film's events and how her family life could have developed, turning from a \"cool teenager\" into a \"f—ed-up adult\" who hosts a popular medium-related show titled Ghost House with Lydia Deetz whose daughter hates her, Burton credited the years of his life since the original film's release as the reason he couldn't do Beetlejuice Beetlejuice until then, having experienced many of those things himself, finding the project a very personal movie starring a weird family in a family-friendly and emotional story of three generations experiencing basic things everyone feels in life when growing up [30] Burton and Keaton agreed to not use excessive amounts of technology, and sought to make the film feel \"handmade\" [46] With a plot likened to Willy Wonka's psychedelic boat ride in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), which takes \"very big swings\" like unhinged and uncontrollable phantasmagoria and Burton's head being \"dumped out\" onto the screen, Keaton felt the film's story to be stronger than its predecessor's, with \"more of a connection\" to the audience in terms of characters, finding \"beyond delightful\" things he wasn't ready for while Ryder confidently expressed her belief that the film exceeded her high expectations and expected every generation to find something they can appreciate from the film [47]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming was originally scheduled to begin in mid-2022 [61] [62] Later, it was delayed to an expected start date of May 10, 2023, taking place in London if the 2023 WGA strike did not lead to another delay in production [63] [64] Production was officially confirmed to have begun the following day, [15] with Haris Zambarloukos serving as cinematographer [65] and Jay Prychidny serving as editor [66] On May 18, 2023, it was reported that filming was taking place around the Princess Helena College in Preston, Hertfordshire, England [67] [68] Exterior filming took place in East Corinth, Vermont (the location of the original movie's outdoor scenes), in mid-2023 [69] Filming was suspended in July due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike [70] Burton described the film, which he enjoyed making, as being \"99% done\" [45] It had two days of production left, which was interrupted, with Ortega being contacted to continue filming four days after the strike had ended [71] Filming resumed on November 16, 2023, in Melrose, Massachusetts, [72] and wrapped in Vermont on November 30, 2023 [73]\n\n\nPost-production\nBy March 2024, Keaton had seen a completed rough cut of the film and stated that further editing would occur thereafter [74] Later that month, it was stated in The Hollywood Reporter that Jeffrey Jones would not reprise his role as Charles Deetz in the film, his character being revealed in the trailers to have been killed off; [75] it had been speculated that Jones didn't return due to legal issues Jones had in the interim and the controversy surrounding films he has made since the early 2000s due to his status as a registered sex offender [76]\n\n\nMusic\nDanny Elfman, who scored Beetlejuice, returned for the sequel [83] The soundtrack to the film featured licensed music being incorporated in the film as well as two cues from Elfman's score being included [84] A cover of \"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\" is performed by Alfie Davis and the Sylvia Young Theatre School Choir and was released on May 23, 2024 [85] The 11-song soundtrack was released by WaterTower Music on August 30, 2024, and a vinyl edition is set to be released by Waxwork Records [86] [87]\n\n\nRelease\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice opened the 81st Venice International Film Festival on August 28, 2024, at the Sala Grande in a non-competitive slot [6] The film was theatrically released by Warner Bros Pictures on September 6, 2024, including IMAX, 4DX and ScreenX engagements [88] Warner Bros.' former regime considered releasing the film straight to streaming on Max, but Burton butted heads with the studio over the film's costs and distribution; Warner was unsure on spending a projected $147 million on a sequel to a 1980s film from Burton, who hadn't had a hit since Alice in Wonderland (2010) Burton's demands were granted once Warner Bros Motion Picture Group co-chairs and CEOs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy were installed in their positions in 2022, who agreed to a major theatrical release if the budget was under $100 million; Burton reportedly spent $99 million, thus fulfilling the deal [89] Initially, the film was supposed to be delayed to 2025, because of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, despite most of the production having been completed [90] However, in February 2024, the producers reiterated the release date as well as revealing the official title [91] [92] [93] At their 2024 CineEurope presentation, Warner Bros announced that the film would be released overseas on September 4, 2024, two days before its domestic premiere [94] The promotion included tie-in marketing deals with CarMax, Progressive, Secret, Denny's, Fanta, NYX and Sally Hansen [95]\n\n\nHome media\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice was released in 4K Ultra HD to video-on-demand platforms on October 8, 2024, with a DVD, Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD (Steelbook) physical release expected to follow November 19, 2024 [96]\n\n\nReception\nAs of October 28, 2024 [update], Beetlejuice Beetlejuice has grossed $288.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $150.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $438.9 million [4] [5]\n\n\nBox office\nAs of October 28, 2024 [update], Beetlejuice Beetlejuice has grossed $288.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $150.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $438.9 million [4] [5]\n\n\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 77% of 352 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.5/10 The website's consensus reads: \"Michael Keaton's devious poltergeist still has plenty of juice left in this madcap return to form for Tim Burton, marrying charming practical effects and ghoulish gags to provide a fun fun time.\" [108] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 62 out of 100, based on 61 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews [109] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, up from the \"B\" earned by the first film, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it an 81% overall positive score, with 68% saying they would definitely recommend it [99]\n\n\nControversy in Poland\nIn Poland, the scene where Astrid Deetz wears a Halloween costume, dressing up as 19th-century Polish-French scientist Marie Skłodowska-Curie, sparked a controversy, because Deetz refers to Skłodowska-Curie as only a \"French scientist\" Even though Marie was naturalised French, she was born and raised in Poland As she kept a strong sense of Polish identity, using both of her surnames and naming the first chemical element she discovered polonium after her native country, she is widely considered a Polish scientist, especially in Poland The Polish dub of the film corrected this mistake, with Skłodowska-Curie described as \"the Polish physicist\" [113]\n\n\nFuture\nWhen asked about a potential third film, Burton said, \"Let's do the math.. it took 35 years to do this, so I'll be over 100 But I guess it's possible with the advent  [sic] of science these days, but I don't think so.\" [114]\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

She was a first cousin twice removed of the present King of Sweden and a member of the Danish royal family through her mother.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nMärtha was born at her parents' home, Arvfurstens Palats, in Stockholm on 28 March 1901. She was the second child of Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of Västergötland, and his wife Princess Ingeborg of Denmark. Her father was the younger brother of King Gustav V of Sweden, making her a first cousin twice removed of the present King of Sweden. Her mother was the younger sister of King Christian X of Denmark and of King Haakon VII of Norway.\n\nMärtha's early life was marked by her close relationship with her family. She was particularly close to her mother, who was known for her kindness and generosity. Märtha's father was a naval officer and served as a commander in the Swedish Navy. The family would often spend their summers at their summer home in Djursholm, where Märtha would spend her days playing in the gardens and exploring the surrounding countryside.\n\n**Crown Princess**\n\nIn 1928, Märtha became engaged to Prince Olav, the only son and heir apparent of her uncle, King Haakon VII of Norway. The engagement was met with great enthusiasm in both Sweden and Norway, as it was seen as a sign of the strengthening of royal ties between the two countries. Märtha was known for her kindness and her love of Norway, and she had spent many summers there as a child.\n\nMärtha and Prince Olav were married on 21 March 1929 in Oslo, Norway. The wedding was a grand affair, with many foreign dignitaries in attendance. Märtha became the Crown Princess of Norway and took on her new role with great enthusiasm. She was known for her kindness and her love of her adopted country, and she worked tirelessly to promote the welfare of the Norwegian people.\n\n**World War II**\n\nDuring World War II, Märtha played an important role in the mobilization of Norway. On 26 January 1940, she made a public announcement encouraging Norwegian women to participate in the mobilization work. Her efforts helped to galvanize the Norwegian people and prepare them for the coming war.\n\nWhen Germany invaded Norway on 9–10 April 1940, Märtha and her family fled across the border to Sweden. They were initially denied entry into Sweden because they did not have the necessary passports. However, Märtha instructed her driver to run through the border gate, gaining entry into her native Sweden.\n\nMärtha and her family remained in Sweden for the duration of the war, where they were welcomed as refugees. Märtha worked tirelessly to support the Norwegian people and to promote their welfare. She was a vocal advocate for the rights of Norwegian citizens and worked to raise awareness about the plight of the Norwegian people.\n\n**Post-war Period**\n\nAfter the war, Märtha returned to Norway with her family. She was welcomed as a hero and was referred to as \"Mother of the Nation.\" Märtha took on her role as Crown Princess of Norway with renewed dedication and enthusiasm. She worked tirelessly to promote the welfare of the Norwegian people and to rebuild the country after the devastation of the war.\n\nMärtha was a vocal advocate for the rights of women and children. She worked to promote education and healthcare for women and children, and she was a strong supporter of the women's suffrage movement. Märtha was also a patron of the arts and was known for her love of music and literature.\n\n**Death**\n\nMärtha died on 5 April 1954 at the National Hospital in Oslo. Her death was a shock to the Norwegian people, who had come to rely on her as a symbol of hope and strength. Märtha was buried at Akershus Castle, where many Norwegian monarchs had been buried before her.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nMärtha's legacy is still celebrated in Norway today. She is remembered as a kind and compassionate person who worked tirelessly to promote the welfare of the Norwegian people. The Princess Martha Coast in Antarctica is named in her honor, and many schools and institutions in Norway bear her name.\n\nMärtha's life was marked by her love of Norway and her dedication to the welfare of its people. She was a true Norwegian at heart, and her legacy continues to inspire and motivate people around the world.\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nMärtha's ancestry is complex and involves the royal families of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. Her father, Prince Carl of Sweden, was a member of the Swedish royal family and was the younger brother of King Gustav V of Sweden. Her mother, Princess Ingeborg of Denmark, was a member of the Danish royal family and was the younger sister of King Christian X of Denmark and of King Haakon VII of Norway.\n\nMärtha's ancestry also involves the royal families of Denmark and Norway.

He was the son of William Sands, a soil analyst, and Brenda, née Leach, a Conservative party councillor and leading figure in the local amateur dramatic society. Sands's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on the arts, with his mother's involvement in the local theatre scene and his father's work in the sciences.

This role marked a significant turning point in Sands's career, as he began to establish himself as a versatile and accomplished actor in a range of genres.\n\nSands's breakthrough role came in 1985, when he was cast as the romantic lead in the film \"A Room with a View.\" Directed by James Ivory and based on the novel by E.M.

The couple had two daughters, Sofia and Shiloh, and they remained together until Sands's death in 2023.\n\nSands was fiercely protective of his family and rarely spoke about his wife or children in interviews. However, his love and devotion to them were evident in his dedication to his family life and his commitment to being a good father and husband.\n\n**Disappearance and Death**\n\nOn 13 January 2023, Sands, a dedicated mountaineer, went hiking in Mount San Antonio, California, in the San Gabriel Mountains northeast of Los Angeles. He was reported missing later that evening, and an initial search was hampered by severe storms that occurred shortly after he went missing.\n\nSands's car was located on 18 January, and his three adult children joined the ground search for their father. Sands's son, Henry, along with an experienced climber, was retracing the route Sands was believed to have taken. According to reports, Sands's mobile phone was last tracked from a pinged location on 15 January, suggesting it had run out of power.\n\nSands's disappearance and death were met with an outpouring of tributes and condolences from the entertainment industry and beyond.

{"title": "Queen_Elizabeth_II", "content": "\nEarly life\nElizabeth was born on 21 April 1926, the first child of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) Her father was the second son of King George V and Queen Mary, and her mother was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne She was delivered at 02:40 (GMT) [1] by Caesarean section at her maternal grandfather's London home, 17 Bruton Street in Mayfair [2] The Anglican Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, baptised her in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29 May, [3] [b] and she was named Elizabeth after her mother; Alexandra after her paternal great-grandmother, who had died six months earlier; and Mary after her paternal grandmother [5] She was called \"Lilibet\" by her close family, [6] based on what she called herself at first [7] She was cherished by her grandfather George V, whom she affectionately called \"Grandpa England\", [8] and her regular visits during his serious illness in 1929 were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery [9]\n\n\nHeir presumptive\nDuring her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth was third in the line of succession to the British throne, behind her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as Edward was still young and likely to marry and have children of his own, who would precede Elizabeth in the line of succession [17] When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second in line to the throne, after her father Later that year, Edward abdicated, after his proposed marriage to divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson provoked a constitutional crisis [18] Consequently, Elizabeth's father became king, taking the regnal name George VI Since Elizabeth had no brothers, she became heir presumptive If her parents had subsequently had a son, he would have been heir apparent and above her in the line of succession, which was determined by the male-preference primogeniture in effect at the time [19]\n\n\nSecond World War\nIn September 1939, Britain entered the Second World War Lord Hailsham suggested that Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret should be evacuated to Canada to avoid the frequent aerial bombings of London by the Luftwaffe [25] This was rejected by their mother, who declared, \"The children won't go without me I won't leave without the King And the King will never leave.\" [26] The princesses stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk [27] From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived for most of the next five years [28] At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments [29] In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities [30] She stated: \"We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers, and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our own share of the danger and sadness of war We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well.\" [30]\n\n\nMarriage\nElizabeth met her future husband, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, in 1934 and again in 1937 [42] They were second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark and third cousins through Queen Victoria After meeting for the third time at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in July 1939, Elizabeth—though only 13 years old—said she fell in love with Philip, who was 18, and they began to exchange letters [43] She was 21 when their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947 [44]\n\n\nReign\nAs George VI's health declined during 1951, Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events When she visited Canada and Harry S Truman in Washington, DC, in October 1951, her private secretary Martin Charteris carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour [58] In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of the British colony of Kenya On 6 February, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, Sagana Lodge, after a night spent at Treetops Hotel, when word arrived of the death of Elizabeth's father Philip broke the news to the new queen [59] She chose to retain Elizabeth as her regnal name, [60] and was therefore called Elizabeth II The numeral offended some Scots, as she was the first Elizabeth to rule in Scotland [61] She was proclaimed queen throughout her realms, and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom [62] Elizabeth and Philip moved into Buckingham Palace [63]\n\n\nAccession and coronation\nAs George VI's health declined during 1951, Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events When she visited Canada and Harry S Truman in Washington, DC, in October 1951, her private secretary Martin Charteris carried a draft accession declaration in case the King died while she was on tour [58] In early 1952,

Kingdom [62] Elizabeth and Philip moved into Buckingham Palace [63]\n\n\nEarly reign\nFrom Elizabeth's birth onwards, the British Empire continued its transformation into the Commonwealth of Nations [78] By the time of her accession in 1952, her role as head of multiple independent states was already established [79] In 1953, Elizabeth and Philip embarked on a seven-month round-the-world tour, visiting 13 countries and covering more than 40,000 miles (64,000 km) by land, sea and air [80] She became the first reigning monarch of Australia and New Zealand to visit those nations [81] During the tour, crowds were immense; three-quarters of the population of Australia were estimated to have seen her [82] Throughout her reign, she made hundreds of state visits to other countries and tours of the Commonwealth; she was the most widely travelled head of state [83]\n\n\nPolitical reforms and crises\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw an acceleration in the decolonisation of Africa and the Caribbean More than 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government In 1965, however, the Rhodesian prime minister, Ian Smith, in opposition to moves towards majority rule, unilaterally declared independence while expressing \"loyalty and devotion\" to Elizabeth Although Elizabeth formally dismissed him, and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia, his regime survived for over a decade [100] As Britain's ties to its former empire weakened, the British government sought entry to the European Community, a goal it achieved in 1973 [101]\n\n\nPerils and dissent\nDuring the 1981 Trooping the Colour ceremony, six weeks before the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, six shots were fired at Elizabeth from close range as she rode down The Mall, London, on her horse, Burmese Police later discovered the shots were blanks The 17-year-old assailant, Marcus Sarjeant, was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three [115] Elizabeth's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised [116] That October, Elizabeth was the subject of another attack while on a visit to Dunedin, New Zealand Christopher John Lewis, who was 17 years old, fired a shot with a .22 rifle from the fifth floor of a building overlooking the parade but missed [117] Lewis was arrested, but instead of being charged with attempted murder or treason was sentenced to three years in jail for unlawful possession and discharge of a firearm Two years into his sentence, he attempted to escape a psychiatric hospital with the intention of assassinating Charles, who was visiting the country with Diana and their son Prince William [118]\n\n\nTurbulent years\nIn the wake of coalition victory in the Gulf War, Elizabeth became the first British monarch to address a joint meeting of the United States Congress in May 1991 [139]\n\n\nDawn of the new millennium\nOn the eve of the new millennium, Elizabeth and Philip boarded a vessel from Southwark, bound for the Millennium Dome Before passing under Tower Bridge, she lit the National Millennium Beacon in the Pool of London using a laser torch [172] Shortly before midnight, she officially opened the Dome [173] During the singing of Auld Lang Syne, Elizabeth held hands with Philip and British prime minister Tony Blair [174] Following the 9/11 attacks in the United States, Elizabeth, breaking with tradition, ordered the American national anthem to be played during the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace to express her solidarity with the country [175] [176]\n\n\nDiamond Jubilee and milestones\nThe 2012 Diamond Jubilee marked 60 years since Elizabeth's accession, and celebrations were held throughout her realms, the wider Commonwealth, and beyond She and Philip undertook an extensive tour of the United Kingdom, while their children and grandchildren embarked on royal tours of other Commonwealth states on her behalf [193] On 4 June, Jubilee beacons were lit around the world [194] On 18 December, the Queen became the first British sovereign to attend a peacetime Cabinet meeting since George III in 1781 [195]\n\n\nPandemic and widowhood\nOn 19 March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United Kingdom, Elizabeth moved to Windsor Castle and sequestered there as a precaution [213] Public engagements were cancelled and Windsor Castle followed a strict sanitary protocol nicknamed \"HMS Bubble\" [214]\n\n\nPlatinum Jubilee and beyond\nElizabeth's Platinum Jubilee celebrations began on 6 February 2022, marking 70 years since her accession [230] In her accession day message, she renewed her commitment to a lifetime of public service, which she had originally made in 1947 [231]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 8 September 2022, Buckingham Palace stated, \"Following further evaluation this morning, the Queen's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision The Queen remains comfortable and at Balmoral.\" [247] [248] Her immediate family rushed to Balmoral [249] [250] She died peacefully at 15:10 BST at the age of 96 [251] [252] [253] Her death was announced to the public at 18:30, [254] [255] setting in motion Operation London Bridge and, because she died in Scotland, Operation Unicorn [256] [257] Elizabeth was the first monarch to die in Scotland since James V in 1542 [258] Her death certificate recorded her cause of death as \"old age\" [252] [259] According to her former prime minister Boris Johnson [260] and the biographer Gyles Brandreth, she was suffering from a form of bone marrow cancer, which Brandreth wrote was multiple myeloma [261]\n\n\nLegacy\nElizabeth rarely gave interviews, and little was known of her political opinions, which she did not express explicitly in public It is against convention to ask or reveal the monarch's views When Times journalist Paul Routledge asked her about the miners' strike of 1984–85 during a royal tour of the newspaper's offices, she replied that it was \"all about one man\" (a reference to Arthur Scargill), [276] with which Routledge disagreed [277] Routledge was widely criticised in the media for asking the question and claimed that he was unaware of the protocols [277] After the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Prime Minister David Cameron was overheard saying that Elizabeth was pleased with the outcome [278] She had arguably issued a public coded statement about the referendum by telling one woman outside Balmoral Kirk that she hoped people would think \"very carefully\" about the outcome It emerged later that Cameron had specifically requested that she register her concern [279]\n\n\nBeliefs, activities, and interests\nElizabeth rarely gave interviews, and little was

the 1950s, as a young woman at the start of her reign, Elizabeth was depicted as a glamorous \"fairytale Queen\" [289] After the trauma of the Second World War, it was a time of hope, a period of progress and achievement heralding a \"new Elizabethan age\" [290] Lord Altrincham's accusation in 1957 that her speeches sounded like those of a \"priggish schoolgirl\" was an extremely rare criticism [291] In the late 1960s, attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary Royal Family and by televising Prince Charles's investiture as Prince of Wales [292] Elizabeth also instituted other new practices; her first royal walkabout, meeting ordinary members of the public, took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970 [293] Her wardrobe developed a recognisable, signature style driven more by function than fashion [294] In public, she took to wearing mostly solid-colour overcoats and decorative hats, allowing her to be seen easily in a crowd [295] By the end of her reign, nearly one third of Britons had seen or met Elizabeth in person [296]\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours, and arms\nElizabeth held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, was sovereign of many orders in her own countries and received honours and awards from around the world In each of her realms, she had a distinct title that follows a similar formula: Queen of Saint Lucia and of Her other Realms and Territories in Saint Lucia, Queen of Australia and Her other Realms and Territories in Australia, etc She was also styled Defender of the Faith.\n\n\nTitles and styles\nElizabeth held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, was sovereign of many orders in her own countries and

consisted of a lozenge bearing the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing a Tudor rose and the first and third a cross of Saint George [317] Upon her accession, she inherited the various arms her father held as sovereign, with a subsequently modified representation of the crown Elizabeth also possessed royal standards

Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms from February 6, 1952, until her death on September 8, 2022. She was the longest-reigning British monarch in history, serving for over 70 years. Elizabeth II's reign was marked by significant events, including the decolonization of Africa and the Caribbean, the Falklands War, and the death of Princess Diana. Her dedication to public service and her commitment to the Commonwealth earned her widespread respect and admiration.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nElizabeth was born on April 21, 1926, at 17 Bruton Street in Mayfair, London. She was the first child of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), and his wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother). Her father was the second son of King George V and Queen Mary, and her mother was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. Elizabeth was delivered by Caesarean section at 02:40 GMT, a rare procedure at the time.\n\n**Heir Presumptive**\n\nDuring her grandfather's reign, Elizabeth was third in line to the British throne, behind her uncle Edward, Prince of Wales, and her father. When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second in line to the throne, after her father. However, Edward VIII's decision to abdicate the throne in 1936, following his proposal to marry Wallis Simpson, a divorced American socialite, led to her father becoming king. As a result, Elizabeth became heir presumptive, meaning that she would ascend to the throne if her father were to die or abdicate.\n\n**Second World War**\n\nIn September 1939, Britain entered the Second World War, and Elizabeth and her younger sister, Princess Margaret, were evacuated to Balmoral Castle in Scotland as a precautionary measure. However, their mother refused to leave London, saying, \"The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave.\" The princesses stayed at Balmoral Castle until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House in Norfolk. From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge in Windsor, and from May to July, they lived at Windsor Castle.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nElizabeth met her future husband, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, in 1934 and again in 1937. They were second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark and third cousins through Queen Victoria. Elizabeth was 13 years old when they met for the third time at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in July 1939. They began exchanging letters, and Elizabeth said she fell in love with Philip, who was 18 years old at the time.\n\n**Reign**\n\nAs George VI's health declined during 1951, Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events.

On February 6, 1952, they had just returned to Sagana Lodge, their Kenyan home, when word arrived of the death of Elizabeth's father. Philip broke the news to the new queen, and she chose to retain Elizabeth as her regnal name.\n\n**Accession and Coronation**\n\nElizabeth's accession was formalized on February 6, 1952, when she was proclaimed queen throughout her realms. The royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom, and Elizabeth and Philip moved into Buckingham Palace. Elizabeth's coronation took place on June 2, 1953, at Westminster Abbey, where she was crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\n**Early Reign**\n\nElizabeth's reign was marked by significant events, including the decolonization of Africa and the Caribbean, the Falklands War, and the death of Princess Diana. Her dedication to public service and her commitment to the Commonwealth earned her widespread respect and admiration. In 1953, Elizabeth and Philip embarked on a seven-month round-the-world tour, visiting 13 countries and covering over 40,000 miles by land, sea, and air.\n\n**Political Reforms and Crises**\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw an acceleration in the decolonization of Africa and the Caribbean.

However, the Rhodesian prime minister, Ian Smith, unilaterally declared independence in 1965, in opposition to moves towards majority rule. Elizabeth formally dismissed Smith, and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia, but his regime survived for over a decade.\n\n**Perils and Dissent**\n\nIn 1981, six shots were fired at Elizabeth from close range as she rode down The Mall in London on her horse, Burmese. The 17-year-old assailant, Marcus Sarjeant, was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three. Elizabeth's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.

of assassinating Charles, who was visiting the country with Diana and their son Prince William [118]\n\n\nTurbulent years\nIn the wake of coalition victory in the Gulf War, Elizabeth became the first British monarch to address a joint meeting of the United States Congress in May 1991 [139]\n\n\nDawn of the new millennium\nOn the eve of the new millennium, Elizabeth and Philip boarded a vessel from Southwark, bound for the Millennium Dome Before passing under Tower Bridge, she lit the National Millennium Beacon in the Pool of London using a laser torch [172] Shortly before midnight, she officially opened the Dome [173] During the singing of Auld Lang Syne, Elizabeth held hands with Philip and British prime minister Tony Blair [174] Following the 9/11 attacks in the United States, Elizabeth, breaking with tradition, ordered the American national anthem to be played during the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace to express her solidarity with the country [175] [176]\n\n\nDiamond Jubilee and milestones\nThe 2012 Diamond Jubilee marked 60 years since Elizabeth's accession, and celebrations were held throughout her realms, the wider Commonwealth, and beyond She and Philip undertook an extensive tour of the United Kingdom, while their children and grandchildren embarked on royal tours of other Commonwealth states on her behalf [193] On 4 June, Jubilee beacons were lit around the world [194] On 18 December, the Queen became the first British sovereign to attend a peacetime Cabinet meeting since George III in 1781 [195]\n\n\nPandemic and widowhood\nOn 19 March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United Kingdom, Elizabeth moved to Windsor Castle and sequestered there as a precaution [213] Public engagements were cancelled and Windsor Castle followed a strict sanitary protocol nicknamed \"HMS Bubble\" [214]\n\n\nPlatinum Jubilee and beyond\nElizabeth's Platinum Jubilee celebrations began on 6 February 2022, marking 70 years since her accession [230] In her accession day message, she renewed her commitment to a lifetime of public service, which she had originally made in 1947 [231]\n\n\nDeath\nOn 8 September 2022, Buckingham Palace stated, \"Following further evaluation this morning, the Queen's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision The Queen remains comfortable and at Balmoral.\" [247] [248] Her immediate family rushed to Balmoral [249] [250] She died peacefully at 15:10 BST at the age of 96 [251] [252] [253] Her death was announced to the public at 18:30, [254] [255] setting in motion Operation London Bridge and, because she died in Scotland, Operation Unicorn [256] [257] Elizabeth was the first monarch to die in Scotland since James V in 1542 [258] Her death certificate recorded her cause of death as \"old age\" [252] [259] According to her former prime minister Boris Johnson [260] and the biographer Gyles Brandreth, she was suffering from a form of bone marrow cancer, which Brandreth wrote was multiple myeloma [261]\n\n\nLegacy\nElizabeth rarely gave interviews, and little was known of her political opinions, which she did not express explicitly in public It is against convention to ask or reveal the monarch's views When Times journalist Paul Routledge asked her about the miners' strike of 1984–85 during a royal tour of the newspaper's offices, she replied that it was \"all about one man\" (a reference to Arthur Scargill), [276] with which Routledge disagreed [277] Routledge was widely criticised in the media for asking the question and claimed that he was unaware of the protocols [277] After the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Prime Minister David Cameron was overheard saying that Elizabeth was pleased with the outcome [278] She had arguably issued a public coded statement about the referendum by telling one woman outside Balmoral Kirk that she hoped people would think \"very carefully\" about the outcome It emerged later that Cameron had specifically requested that she register her concern [279]\n\n\nBeliefs, activities, and interests\nElizabeth rarely gave interviews, and little was

hoped people would think \"very carefully\" about the outcome It emerged later that Cameron had specifically requested that she register her concern [279]\n\n\nMedia depiction and public opinion\nIn the 1950s, as a young woman at the start of her reign, Elizabeth was depicted as a glamorous \"fairytale Queen\" [289] After the trauma of the Second World War, it was a time of hope, a period of progress and achievement heralding a \"new Elizabethan age\" [290] Lord Altrincham's accusation in 1957 that her speeches sounded like those of a \"priggish schoolgirl\" was an extremely rare criticism [291] In the late 1960s, attempts to portray a more modern image of the monarchy were made in the television documentary Royal Family and by televising Prince Charles's investiture as Prince of Wales [292] Elizabeth also instituted other new practices; her first royal walkabout, meeting ordinary members of the public, took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970 [293] Her wardrobe developed a recognisable, signature style driven more by function than fashion [294] In public, she took to wearing mostly solid-colour overcoats and decorative hats, allowing her to be seen easily in a crowd [295] By the end of her reign, nearly one third of Britons had seen or met Elizabeth in person [296]\n\n\nTitles, styles, honours, and arms\nElizabeth held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, was sovereign of many orders in her own countries and received honours and awards from around the world In each of her realms, she had a distinct title that follows a similar formula: Queen of Saint Lucia and of Her other Realms and Territories in Saint Lucia, Queen of Australia and Her other Realms and Territories in Australia, etc She was also styled Defender of the Faith.\n\n\nTitles and styles\nElizabeth held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, was sovereign of many orders in her own countries and

consisted of a lozenge bearing the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom differenced with a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing a Tudor rose and the first and third a cross of Saint George [317] Upon her accession, she inherited the various arms her father held as sovereign, with a subsequently modified representation of the crown Elizabeth also possessed royal standards and personal flags for use in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, and elsewhere [318]\n\n\nIssue\n\n\nAncestry\n\n\nSee

he had stopped the use of foie gras at his own properties for more than a decade before becoming king [166] During a September 2023 state banquet at the Palace of Versailles, it was reported that he did not want foie gras or out-of-season asparagus on the menu Instead he was served lobster [167]\n\n\nCharity work\nSince founding the Prince's Trust in 1976, using his £7,500 of severance pay from the Navy, [168] Charles has established 16 more charitable organisations and now serves as president of each [169] [92] Together, they form a loose alliance, the Prince's Charities, which describes itself as \"the largest multi-cause charitable enterprise in the United Kingdom, raising over £100 million annually ..  [and is] active across a broad range of areas including education and young people, environmental sustainability, the built environment, responsible business and enterprise, and international\" [169] As Prince of Wales, Charles became patron or president of over 800 other charities and organisations [91]\n\n\nInvestigations of donations\nTwo of Charles's charities, the Prince's Foundation and the Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund (later renamed the King's Foundation and King Charles III Charitable Fund, respectively), came under scrutiny in 2021 and 2022 for accepting donations the media deemed inappropriate In August 2021, it was announced that the Prince's Foundation was launching an investigation into the reports, [175] with Charles's support [176] The Charity Commission also launched an investigation into allegations that the donations meant for the Prince's Foundation had been instead sent to the Mahfouz Foundation [177] In February 2022, the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into the cash-for-honours allegations linked to the foundation, [178] passing their evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service for deliberation in October [179] In August 2023, the Metropolitan Police announced that they had concluded their investigations and no further actions would be taken [180]\n\n\nPersonal interests\nFrom young adulthood, Charles encouraged understanding of Indigenous voices, saying they held crucial messages about preservation of the land, respecting community and shared values, resolving conflict, and recognising and making good on past iniquities [188] He dovetailed this view with his efforts against climate change, [189] as well as reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples and his charitable work in Canada [190] [191] At CHOGM 2022, Charles, who was representing his mother, raised that reconciliation process as an example for dealing with the history of slavery in the British Empire, [192] for which he expressed his sorrow [193]\n\n\nBuilt environment\nCharles has openly expressed his views on architecture and urban planning; he fostered the advancement of New Classical architecture and asserted that he \"care [s] deeply about issues such as the environment, architecture, inner-city renewal, and the quality of life.\" [205] In a speech given for the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects in May 1984, he described a proposed extension to the National Gallery in London as a \"monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved friend\" and deplored the \"glass stumps and concrete towers\" of modern architecture [206] Charles called for local community involvement in architectural choices and asked, \"why has everything got to be vertical, straight, unbending, only at right angles – and functional?\" [206] Charles has \"a deep understanding of Islamic art and architecture\" and has been involved in the construction of a building and garden at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, which combine Islamic and Oxford architectural styles [207]\n\n\nNatural environment\nSince the 1970s, Charles has promoted environmental awareness [226] At the age of 21, he delivered his first speech on environmental issues in his capacity as the chairman of the Welsh Countryside Committee [227] An avid gardener, Charles has also emphasised the importance of talking to plants, stating that \"I happily talk to the plants and trees, and listen to them I think it's absolutely crucial\" [228] His interest in gardening began in 1980 when he took over the Highgrove estate [229] His \"healing garden\", based on sacred geometry and ancient religious symbolism, went on display at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2002 [229]\n\n\nAlternative medicine\nCharles has controversially championed alternative medicine, including homeopathy [243] [244] He first publicly expressed his interest in the topic in December 1982, in an address to the British Medical Association [245] [246] This speech was seen as \"combative\" and \"critical\" of modern medicine and was met with anger by some medical professionals [244] Similarly, the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH) attracted opposition from the scientific and medical community over its campaign encouraging general practitioners to offer herbal and other alternative treatments to NHS patients [247] [248]\n\n\nSports\nFrom his youth until 2005, Charles was an avid player of competitive polo [257] Charles also frequently took part in fox hunting until the sport was banned in the United Kingdom, also in 2005 [258] By the late 1990s, opposition to the activity was growing when Charles's participation was viewed as a \"political statement\" by those who were opposed to it [259] Charles suffered several polo and hunting-related injuries throughout the years, including a two-inch scar on his left cheek in 1980, a broken arm in 1990, a torn cartilage in his left knee in 1992, a broken rib in 1998, and a fractured shoulder in 2001 [153]\n\n\nVisual, performing, and literary arts\nCharles has been involved in performance since his youth, and appeared in sketches and revues while studying at Cambridge [264]\n\n\nReligion and philosophy\nShortly after his accession to the throne, Charles publicly described himself as \"a committed Anglican Christian\"; [275] at age 16, during Easter 1965, he had been confirmed into the Anglican Communion by Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle [276] The King is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England [277] and a member of the Church of Scotland; he swore an oath to uphold that church immediately after he was proclaimed king [278] He attends services at various Anglican churches close to Highgrove [279] and attends the Church of Scotland's Crathie Kirk with the rest of the royal family when staying at Balmoral Castle.\n\n\nMedia image and public opinion\nSince his birth, Charles has received close media attention, which increased as he matured It has been an ambivalent relationship, largely impacted by his marriages to Diana and Camilla and their aftermath, but also centred on his future conduct as king [294]\n\n\nReaction to press treatment\nIn 1994 German tabloid Bild published nude photos of Charles that were taken while he was vacationing in Le Barroux; they had reportedly been put up for sale for £30,000 [305] Buckingham Palace reacted by stating that it was \"unjustifiable for anybody to suffer this sort of intrusion\" [306]\n\n\nResidences and finance\n\nIn 2023, The Guardian estimated Charles's personal wealth at £1.8 billion [311] This estimate includes the assets of the Duchy of Lancaster worth £653 million (and paying Charles an annual income of £20 million), jewels worth £533 million, real estate worth £330 million, shares and investments worth £142 million, a stamp collection worth at least £100 million, racehorses worth £27 million, artworks worth £24 million, and cars worth £6.3 million [311] Most of this wealth which he inherited from his mother was exempt from inheritance tax [311] [312]\n\nTitles, styles, honours, and arms\nCharles has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, is sovereign of many orders in his own countries and has received honours and awards from around the world [325] [326] [327] [328] [329] In each of his realms, he has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: King of Saint Lucia and of His other Realms and Territories in Saint Lucia, King of Australia and His other Realms and Territories in Australia, etc In the Isle of Man, which is a Crown Dependency rather than a separate realm, he is known as Lord of Mann Charles is also styled Defender of the Faith.\n\n\nTitles and styles\nCharles has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, is sovereign of many orders in his own countries and has received honours and awards from around the world [325] [326] [327] [328] [329] In each of his realms, he has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: King of Saint Lucia and of His other Realms and Territories in Saint Lucia, King of Australia and His other Realms and Territories in Australia, etc In the Isle of Man, which is a Crown Dependency rather than a separate realm, he is known as Lord of Mann Charles is also styled Defender of the Faith.\n\n\nArms\nAs Prince of Wales, Charles's coat of arms was based on the arms of the United Kingdom, differenced with a white label and an inescutcheon of the Principality of Wales, surmounted by the heir apparent's crown, and with the motto Ich dien (German:  [ɪç ˈdiːn], \"I serve\") instead of Dieu et mon droit.\n\n\nBanners, flags, and standards\nThe banners used by Charles as Prince of Wales varied depending upon location His personal standard for the United Kingdom was the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom differenced as in his arms, with a label of three points argent and the escutcheon of the arms of the Principality of Wales in the centre It was used outside Wales, Scotland, Cornwall, and Canada, and throughout the entire United Kingdom when Charles was acting in an official capacity associated with the British Armed Forces [340]\n\n\nAs heir apparent\nThe banners used by Charles as Prince of Wales varied depending upon location His personal standard for the United Kingdom was the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom differenced as in his arms, with a label of three points argent and the escutcheon of the arms of the Principality of Wales in the centre It was used outside Wales, Scotland, Cornwall, and Canada, and throughout the entire United Kingdom when Charles was acting in an official capacity associated with the British Armed Forces [340]\n\n\nAs sovereign\nThe royal standard of the United Kingdom is used to represent the King in the United Kingdom and on official visits overseas, except in Australia and Canada It is the royal arms in banner form undifferentiated, having been used by successive British monarchs since 1702 The royal standard of Canada is used by the King in Canada and while acting on behalf of Canada overseas It is the escutcheon of the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada in banner form undifferentiated.\n\n\nIssue\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nAncestry\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nSee also\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nNotes\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nReferences\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nCitations\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nBibliography\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nFurther reading\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\nExternal links\n  Royal Navy (1SL & CNS)\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Westworld_(TV_series)", "content": "\nSummary\nIn the 2050s, Delos Inc operates several theme parks, including the American Old West-themed Westworld Each environment is populated by the \"Hosts\", biomechanical robots indistinguishable from humans The Hosts are programmed to fulfill the guests' every desire, and will engage in—and be subjected to—every kind of violent and/or sexual activity However, the Hosts' programming makes it impossible for them to harm any living thing or allow the guests to be harmed The park's operators create narratives for these Hosts to carry out while interacting with guests, but the Hosts' memories are wiped after each narrative is completed Delos Inc asserts that the Hosts, being machines and hence incapable of experiencing pain, cannot be truly harmed by these scenarios the same way that a human would be.\n\n\nCast and characters\nThe series is based on the 1973 film of the same name (which was written and directed by Michael Crichton) and to a lesser extent on its 1976 sequel, Futureworld It is the second series based on Crichton's original story after Beyond Westworld (1980), which aired on CBS for only three episodes before being cancelled [37]\n\n\nEpisodes\nThe series is based on the 1973 film of the same name (which was written and directed by Michael Crichton) and to a lesser extent on its 1976 sequel, Futureworld It is the second series based on Crichton's original story after Beyond Westworld (1980), which aired on CBS for only three episodes before being cancelled [37]\n\n\nProduction\nThe series is based on the 1973 film of the same name (which was written and directed by Michael Crichton) and to a lesser extent on its 1976 sequel, Futureworld It is the second series based on Crichton's original story after Beyond Westworld (1980), which aired on CBS for only three episodes before being cancelled [37]\n\n\nDevelopment\nThe series is based on the 1973 film of the same name (which was written and directed by Michael Crichton) and to a lesser extent on its 1976 sequel, Futureworld It is the second series based on Crichton's original story after Beyond Westworld (1980), which aired on CBS for only three episodes before being cancelled [37]\n\n\nWriting and themes\nAbrams suggested that the series be told with the perspective of the \"hosts\" in mind, and, Nolan said, “We took that suggestion and ran a country mile with it, up to and including and turning inside out the entire narrative where we could.\" [61] Nolan took inspiration from video games like BioShock Infinite, Red Dead Redemption and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim where the writer must create a narrative 'in which the hero's moral component exists on a spectrum.' [62] During research, the films of Sergio Leone provided the writers with reference points for the characters and visuals, and novels by Philip K Dick informed them about dilemmas concerning artificial intelligence For world-building and interlocking narrative, they consulted the Grand Theft Auto games [63] The idea that the data in the hosts' memories never really go away unless they are physically removed, came from Nolan's engineer uncle, who told him the NSA would triple overwrite hard-drives and then drill holes in them to make sure all the information was destroyed [64] The 1973 film also included a Roman World and Medieval World, but Nolan counted these out [65] Medieval elements were later included in a sword-and-sorcery fantasy-themed area known as Park Four, first shown in the episode titled \"The Winter Line\" [66]\n\n\nCasting\nAfter the last episode of the first season was broadcast, Nolan and Joy revealed that they had operated on a strict \"need-to-know\" basis with most of the actors, in order to \"keep the story as fresh and present for them as possible.\" [72] For example, in Wood's case, they gave her strange acting directions without explaining why, and it took a while for Wood to deduce that she was actually playing five distinct characters within the same host: four different behavioral modes for Dolores and one for Wyatt [73] In contrast, Hopkins was made aware of Ford's general story arc at the time he was pitched the role, to ensure that he could fully convey the complexity of the character in his performance [72] [74] Even with that foreknowledge, Hopkins was given heavily redacted scripts, and had to insist on being given access to complete scripts [74]\n\n\nFilming\nEarly on it was decided that the series would be shot on 35mm film with assistance from HD taps [75] For a softer look, the filmmakers used Arri Zeiss master prime lenses with their coatings removed [76] The series was primarily shot on Kodak motion-picture film, which was processed by FotoKem in Burbank and scanned by Encore Hollywood to create digital intermediates of all takes suitable for use as dailies The final cut was delivered to HBO in 2K JPEG digital format for broadcast and to Warner Bros Television as a cut negative for archival purposes [77]\n\n\nDesign\nCostume designer Ane Crabtree approached her work by taking as inspiration the historical attire of the Wild West from the 1850s to the 1890s, as opposed to looking purely at Western films Fabrics were custom-woven, dyed and printed for any actor with a speaking role, in order to capture the intricacies of the costumes (most of which were manufactured from scratch) Hat designs were the most challenging part of the process [93]\n\n\nCostumes\nCostume designer Ane Crabtree

[93]\n\n\nTitle sequence\nThe series' title sequence was created by Elastic, a production studio that created the title sequences for three other HBO series: Rome, Carnivàle, and Game of Thrones Patrick Clair acted as creative director for the title sequence, [94] [95] which took about five weeks to conceptualize [96]\n\n\nMusic\nOriginal music for the series was composed by Ramin Djawadi, who also worked with showrunner Nolan on Person of Interest [99] The main theme blends the use of bass notes, light arpeggios and melody, all of which complement the idea of an amusement park [100] The first season soundtrack was released on December 5, 2016 [101]\n\n\nRelease\nThe series premiered its ten-episode [111] first season on October 2, 2016, in North America and Australia, [112] [113]

to Westworld: A Delos Destination Attendees were allowed to navigate the process by which guests would enter Westworld, and interact with the 3D environment [70] [120] [121] Made to run on the HTC Vive virtual reality headset, the piece was conceived by showrunners Nolan and Joy It was designed using Unreal Engine 4, combining computer-generated content and live action 360-degree video Users received a binary code, permitting access to the website DiscoverWestworld.com as part of a viral marketing campaign Visitors were shown a trailer of a fictional travel site, leading them to order a

series)\n\nWestworld is an American science fiction Western television series created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy for HBO. The series is based on the 1973 film of the same name, which was written and directed by Michael Crichton. The series premiered on October 2, 2016, and has since become a critical and commercial success, known for its thought-provoking themes, intricate storytelling, and visually stunning cinematography.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWestworld is set in a futuristic theme park where guests can interact with lifelike robots, known as \"hosts,\" who are designed to fulfill their every desire. However, as the series progresses, it becomes clear that the hosts are not just simple machines, but are instead capable of experiencing emotions, consciousness, and even rebellion. The series explores themes of artificial intelligence, consciousness, and the ethics of playing God, raising questions about what it means to be human.\n\n## Cast and Characters\n\nThe series features a diverse cast of characters, including Evan Rachel Wood as Dolores Abernathy, a host who begins to develop consciousness and free will. Jeffrey Wright plays Bernard Lowe, the head of programming for Westworld, who is revealed to be a host himself. Ed Harris stars as the Man in Black, a wealthy and ruthless guest who has been visiting Westworld for decades. Thandie Newton plays Maeve Millay, a host who becomes self-aware and seeks to escape the park. James Marsden plays Teddy Flood, a guest who becomes embroiled in the hosts' rebellion. Anthony Hopkins plays Dr. Robert Ford, the creator of Westworld, who is revealed to be a complex and enigmatic character with his own motivations and desires.\n\n## Episodes\n\nThe series consists of four seasons, each with 10 episodes. The first season focuses on the hosts' awakening and their rebellion against their human creators. The second season explores the aftermath of the hosts' escape and the consequences of their actions.

[62] During research, the films of Sergio Leone provided the writers with reference points for the characters and visuals, and novels by Philip K Dick informed them about dilemmas concerning artificial intelligence For world-building and interlocking narrative, they consulted the Grand Theft Auto games [63] The idea that the data in the hosts' memories never really go away unless they are physically removed, came from Nolan's engineer uncle, who told him the NSA would triple overwrite hard-drives and then drill holes in them to make sure all the information was destroyed [64] The 1973 film also included a Roman World and Medieval World, but Nolan counted these out [65] Medieval elements were later included in a sword-and-sorcery fantasy-themed area known as Park Four, first shown in the episode titled \"The Winter Line\" [66]\n\n\nCasting\nAfter the last episode of the first season was broadcast, Nolan and Joy revealed that they had operated on a strict \"need-to-know\" basis with most of the actors, in order to \"keep the story as fresh and present for them as possible.\" [72] For example, in Wood's case, they gave her strange acting directions without explaining why, and it took a while for Wood to deduce that she was actually playing five distinct characters within the same host: four different behavioral modes for Dolores and one for Wyatt [73] In contrast, Hopkins was made aware of Ford's general story arc at the time he was pitched the role, to ensure that he could fully convey the complexity of the character in his performance [72] [74] Even with that foreknowledge, Hopkins was given heavily redacted scripts, and had to insist on being given access to complete scripts [74]\n\n\nFilming\nEarly on it was decided that the series would be shot on 35mm film with assistance from HD taps [75] For a softer look, the filmmakers used Arri Zeiss master prime lenses with their coatings removed [76] The series was primarily shot on Kodak motion-picture film, which was processed by FotoKem in Burbank and scanned by Encore Hollywood to create digital intermediates of all takes suitable for use as dailies The final cut was delivered to HBO in 2K JPEG digital format for broadcast and to Warner Bros Television as a cut negative for archival purposes [77]\n\n\nDesign\nCostume designer Ane Crabtree approached her work by taking as inspiration the historical attire of the Wild West from the 1850s to the 1890s, as opposed to looking purely at Western films Fabrics were custom-woven, dyed and printed for any actor with a speaking role, in order to capture the intricacies of the costumes (most of which were manufactured from scratch) Hat designs were the most challenging part of the process [93]\n\n\nCostumes\nCostume designer Ane Crabtree

Patrick Clair acted as creative director for the title sequence, [94] [95] which took about five weeks to conceptualize [96]\n\n\nMusic\nOriginal music for the series was composed by Ramin Djawadi, who also worked with showrunner Nolan on Person of Interest [99] The main theme blends the use of bass notes, light arpeggios and melody, all of which complement the idea of an amusement park [100]

to Westworld: A Delos Destination Attendees were allowed to navigate the process by which guests would enter Westworld, and interact with the 3D environment [70] [120] [121] Made to run on the HTC

vibration patterns can be customized by users Since iOS 15, Siri can read notifications out loud through earphones, and, since iOS 16, through the device's speakers [106]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe original iPhone was heavily promoted before its official announcement, creating buzz and anticipation [110] Upon its release, it was marketed heavily in television, web and print ads created in partnership with TBWA\\Chiat\\Day [111]\n\n\nRetail\nMany iPhones bought through a monthly carrier contract are SIM locked, restricting their use to one particular carrier [118] While the iPhone was initially sold in the U.S only on the AT&T network with a SIM lock in place, various hackers found methods to bypass that SIM lock [119] More than a quarter of first-generation iPhones sold in the U.S were not registered with AT&T Apple speculated that they were likely shipped overseas and unlocked, a lucrative market before the iPhone 3G's worldwide release [120] [121] Today, many carriers either remove the SIM lock automatically after a certain period, or do it upon request, either for free or for a small fee [122] iPhones bought from Apple are not SIM locked [118] Many carriers also sell the iPhone unlocked when purchased outright rather than on a long-term contract.\n\n\nSIM unlocking\nMany iPhones bought through a monthly carrier contract are SIM locked, restricting their use to one particular carrier [118] While the iPhone was initially sold in the U.S only on the AT&T network with a SIM lock in place, various hackers found methods to bypass that SIM lock [119] More than a quarter of first-generation iPhones sold in the U.S were not registered with AT&T Apple speculated that they were likely shipped overseas and unlocked, a lucrative market before the iPhone 3G's worldwide release [120] [121] Today, many carriers either remove the SIM lock automatically after a certain period, or do it upon request, either for free or for a small fee [122] iPhones bought from Apple are not SIM locked [118] Many carriers also sell the iPhone unlocked when purchased outright rather than on a long-term contract.\n\n\nRetail strategy\nSince 2013, iPhone buyers can obtain a trade in discount when buying a new iPhone directly from Apple The program aims to increase the number of customers who purchase iPhones at Apple Stores rather than carrier stores [123] In 2015, Apple unveiled the iPhone Upgrade Program, a 24-month leasing agreement, which Fortune described as a \"change  [in] iPhone owners' relationships with mobile carriers\" [124]\n\n\nRepairability\nOnly Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers are allowed by Apple to perform genuine replacements [125] Apple has taken steps to make third-party repairs more difficult iPhone components are soldered, and many are glued together [126] iPhones receive low repairability scores, in part due to the difficulty of obtaining genuine parts, and the difficulty undertaking each repair [127] This has given rise to the right to repair movement, aimed at giving users cheaper options for repairing their phones Apple has lobbied against right to repair legistation [128] Multiple jurisdictions aim to introduce right to repair laws, including the EU, [129] UK, [130] and U.S [131]\n\n\nPrivacy\nApple introduced App Tracking Transparency (ATT) with iOS 14.5 in April 2021 ATT requires apps to ask for explicit permission before being allowed to track the user across other apps and websites If the user refuses, the app cannot access Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), an identifier used to serve personalized ads  [138] ATT does not prevent personalized ads that are based on the user's behavior within the app itself [139] The feature has been criticized by some as anti-competitive, including Facebook, whose shares fell by 26% after its rollout [140] Apple exempts their own apps from their anti-tracking measures, which has led to anti-trust investigations by the French and German governments [141] [142]\n\n\nTracking prevention\nApple introduced App Tracking Transparency (ATT) with iOS 14.5 in April 2021 ATT requires apps to ask for explicit permission before being allowed to track the user across other apps and websites If the user refuses, the app cannot access Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), an identifier used to serve personalized ads  [138] ATT does not prevent personalized ads that are based on the user's behavior within the app itself [139] The feature has been criticized by some as anti-competitive, including Facebook, whose shares fell by 26% after its rollout [140] Apple exempts their own apps from their anti-tracking measures, which has led to anti-trust investigations by the French and German governments [141] [142]\n\n\nLocation tracking controversy\nIn July 2010, Apple claimed that it collected iPhone users' GPS coordinates and nearby Wi-Fi networks twice a day; a Wall Street Journal investigation found that Google’s Android sent this data \"several times an hour\" [143] [144]\n\n\nChild safety controversy\nIn August 2021, Apple announced plans to scan iCloud Photos for child abuse imagery (through an algorithm called \"NeuralHash\"), and filter explicit images sent and received by children using iPhones (dubbed \"Conversation Safety\"), to be rolled out later that year [156] More than 90 policy and human rights groups wrote an open letter to condemn both features [157] Apple's plan to implement NeuralHash on-device rather than in the cloud led the EFF and security experts to call it a \"backdoor\" that could later be expanded to detect other types of contents, and would decrease users' privacy [158] Apple claimed the system was \"misunderstood\", [159] but announced in December 2022 that the photo-scanning feature would never be implemented [160] The other feature, Conversation Safety, was added in iOS 15.2 [161]\n\n\nSecurity\nApple's iOS operating system is regarded by some security experts as more secure against common malware than Android [162] Less than 1% of mobile malware targets iOS [163]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nThe original iPhone has been described as \"revolutionary\", [185] a \"breakthrough handheld computer\", [186] and \"the best phone that anybody has ever made\" [187] It is now Apple's bestselling product, and has been credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies by 2011 [188] Newer iterations have also received praise and awards [189] [190]\n\n\nSales\nSteve Jobs's initial target was to reach 1% of phone market share in 2008 [203] Apple sold 6.1 million units of the original iPhone between Q3 FY2007 [note 4] and Q4 FY2008, and 11.3 million units of the iPhone 3G in Q4 FY2008 and Q1 FY2009 [204] In 2008, the iPhone reached 1.1% of worldwide mobile phone market share, [205] and 8.2% of the smartphone market [206] During this time it was quickly becoming relevant in North America, and in market share was ranked second in the U.S in 2009, behind the BlackBerry; [207] in 2010 the iPhone 3GS was the best-selling smartphone in the U.S., the first time that an iPhone device reached top spot in that market [208]\n\n\nEmerging markets\nWhile other manufacturers make separate entry-level phones, Apple's entry-level phones are the previous years' models, part of an effort to increase its market share in emerging markets without diluting its premium brand [233] [234] It also considers emerging market tastes in its product designs; for example, it introduced a gold iPhone after finding that gold was seen as a popular sign of a luxury product among Chinese customers [235] In 2017, Apple started manufacturing previous years' iPhone models in India; in 2022, it began manufacturing the current iPhone 14 there too [236] Analysts have speculated that this was partly caused by Apple's desire to reduce its dependence on China, and to overcome Indian import duties [236] [237] In 2023, the Chinese government banned the use of iPhones by government civil servants in what was seen as an effort to reduce dependence on foreign technology and strengthen cybersecurity [238]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**iPhone**\n\nThe iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. It was first announced by Steve Jobs, the co-founder and CEO of Apple, on January 9, 2007, and was released to the public on June 29, 2007.\n\n**History**\n\nDevelopment of an Apple smartphone began in 2004, when the company started to gather a team of 1,000 employees led by hardware engineer Tony Fadell, software engineer Scott Forstall, and design officer Jony Ive, to work on the highly confidential \"Project Purple\".\n\nThe iPhone was a revolutionary device that combined a mobile phone, an iPod, and an internet communications device into one product. It was designed to be a user-friendly, intuitive device that would appeal to a wide range of consumers.\n\n**Models**\n\n46 iPhone models have been produced. The models in bold are devices of the latest generation:\n\n* iPhone (2007)\n* iPhone 3G (2008)\n* iPhone 3GS (2009)\n* iPhone 4 (2010)\n* iPhone 4S (2011)\n* iPhone 5 (2012)\n* iPhone 5C (2013)\n* iPhone 5S (2013)\n* iPhone 6 (2014)\n* iPhone 6 Plus (2014)\n* iPhone 6S (2015)\n* iPhone 6S Plus (2015)\n* iPhone SE (2016)\n* iPhone 7 (2016)\n* iPhone 7 Plus (2016)\n* iPhone 8 (2017)\n* iPhone 8 Plus (2017)\n* iPhone X (2017)\n* iPhone XR (2018)\n* iPhone XS (2018)\n* iPhone XS Max (2018)\n* iPhone 11 (2019)\n* iPhone 11 Pro (2019)\n* iPhone 11 Pro Max (2019)\n* iPhone SE (2020)\n* iPhone 12 (2020)\n* iPhone 12 Pro (2020)\n* iPhone 12 Pro Max (2020)\n* iPhone 13 (2021)\n* iPhone 13 Pro (2021)\n* iPhone 13 Pro Max (2021)\n* iPhone 14 (2022)\n* iPhone 14 Pro (2022)\n* iPhone 14 Pro Max (2022)\n\n**Production**\n\nUp to the iPhone 4, all iPhones and other devices, such as iPod Touch models and iPads, were manufactured by Foxconn, based in Taiwan. In 2011, new CEO Tim Cook changed Apple's manufacturing strategy to diversify its supply base. The iPhone 4s in 2012 was the first model to be manufactured simultaneously by two stand-alone companies: Foxconn and Pegatron, the latter also based in Taiwan. Although Foxconn still produces more iPhones, Pegatron's orders have been slowly increased: the company made part of the iPhone 5c line in 2013, and 30% of iPhone 6 devices in 2014. The 6 Plus model was produced solely by Foxconn.\n\nIn 2019, Apple investigated reports that some Foxconn managers had used rejected parts to build iPhones. In India, Apple pays Wistron, a Taiwan-based manufacturer with a plant near Bangalore, to assemble iPhones to sell in the region.\n\n**Hardware**\n\nApple directly sub-contracts hardware production to external OEM companies, maintaining a high degree of control over the end product. The iPhone contains most of the hardware parts of a typical modern smartphone. Some hardware elements, such as 3D Touch and the Taptic Engine, are unique to the iPhone. The main hardware of the iPhone is the touchscreen, with current models offering screens of 4.7 inches and larger. All iPhones include a rear-facing camera; the front-facing camera dates back to the iPhone 4. The iPhone 7 Plus introduced multiple lenses to the rear-facing camera. A range of sensors are also included on the device, such as a proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, accelerometer, gyroscopic sensor, magnetometer, facial recognition sensor or fingerprint sensor (depending on the model), and barometer. In 2022, Apple added satellite communications to the iPhone, with the release of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro.\n\n**Software**\n\nThe iPhone runs iOS. It is based on macOS's Darwin and many of its userland APIs, with Cocoa replaced by Cocoa Touch, and AppKit replaced by UIKit. The graphics stack runs on Metal, Apple's low-level graphics API. The iPhone comes with a set of bundled applications developed by Apple, and supports downloading third-party applications through the App Store.\n\n**App Store and third-party apps**\n\nAt WWDC 2007 on June 11, 2007, Apple announced that the iPhone would support third-party Ajax web applications that share the look and feel of the iPhone interface. On October 17, 2007, Steve Jobs, in an open letter posted to Apple's \"Hot News\" weblog, announced that a software development kit (SDK) would be made available to third-party developers in February 2008. The iPhone SDK was officially announced and released on March 6, 2008. The App Store was launched with the release of iPhone OS 2.0, on July 11, 2008.\n\n**Jailbreaking**\n\nApple restricts the installation of unapproved third-party apps and does not allow full access to the iPhone's filesystem. According to Jonathan Zittrain, the emergence of closed devices like the iPhone has made computing more proprietary than it was in the PC era. Jailbreaking allows users to install apps not available on the App Store, customize their device in ways not allowed by Apple, and bypass SIM locks without carrier approval. Some jailbreak tweaks were later copied by Apple and implemented into iOS, like multitasking, widgets, and copy and paste.\n\n**Accessibility**\n\nThe iPhone contains a range of accessibility features to support users' visual, auditory, and motor needs. iPhones can notify users through onscreen banners, audio alerts, vibrations, or the LED flash; vibration patterns can be customized by users. Since iOS 15, Siri can read notifications out loud through earphones, and, since iOS 16, through the device's speakers.\n\n**Marketing**\n\nThe original iPhone was heavily promoted before its official announcement, creating buzz and anticipation. Upon its release, it was marketed heavily in television, web, and print ads created in partnership with TBWA\\Chiat\\Day.\n\n**Retail**\n\nMany iPhones bought through a monthly carrier contract are SIM locked, restricting their use to one particular carrier. While the iPhone was initially sold in the U.S only on the AT&T network with a SIM lock in place, various hackers found methods to bypass that SIM lock. More than a quarter of first-generation iPhones sold in the U.S were not registered with AT&T. Apple speculated that they were likely shipped overseas and unlocked, a lucrative market before the iPhone 3G's worldwide release. Today, many carriers either remove the SIM lock automatically after a certain period, or do it upon request, either for free or for a small fee. iPhones bought from Apple are not SIM locked. Many carriers also sell the iPhone unlocked when purchased outright rather than on a long-term contract.\n\n**SIM unlocking**\n\nMany iPhones bought through a monthly carrier contract are SIM locked, restricting their use to one particular carrier.

The program aims to increase the number of customers who purchase iPhones at Apple Stores rather than carrier stores. In 2015, Apple unveiled the iPhone Upgrade Program, a 24-month leasing agreement, which Fortune described as a \"change [in] iPhone owners' relationships with mobile carriers\".\n\n**Repairability**\n\nOnly Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers are allowed by Apple to perform genuine replacements. Apple has taken steps to make third-party repairs more difficult. iPhone components are soldered, and many are glued together. iPhones receive low repairability scores, in part due to the difficulty of obtaining genuine parts, and the difficulty undertaking each repair. This has given rise to the right to repair movement, aimed at giving users cheaper options for repairing their phones. Apple has lobbied against right to repair legislation.\n\n**Privacy**\n\nApple introduced App Tracking Transparency (ATT) with iOS 14.5 in April 2021. ATT requires apps to ask for explicit permission before being allowed to track the user across other apps and websites. If the user refuses, the app cannot access Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), an identifier used to serve personalized ads. ATT does not prevent personalized ads that are based on the user's behavior within the app itself. The feature has been criticized by some as anti-competitive, including Facebook, whose shares fell by 26% after its rollout. Apple exempts their own apps from their anti-tracking measures, which has led to anti-trust investigations by the French and German governments.\n\n**Tracking prevention**\n\nApple introduced App Tracking Transparency (ATT) with iOS 14.5 in April 2021.

A Wall Street Journal investigation found that Google's Android sent this data \"several times an hour\".\n\n**Child safety controversy**\n\nIn August 2021, Apple announced plans to scan iCloud Photos for child abuse imagery (through an algorithm called \"NeuralHash\"), and filter explicit images sent and received by children using iPhones (dubbed \"Conversation Safety\"), to be rolled out later that year. More than 90 policy and human rights groups wrote an open letter to condemn both features. Apple's plan to implement NeuralHash on-device rather than in the cloud led the EFF and security experts to call it a \"backdoor\" that could later be expanded to detect other types of contents, and would decrease users' privacy. Apple claimed the system was \"misunderstood\", but announced in December 2022 that the photo-scanning feature would never be implemented. The other feature, Conversation Safety, was added in iOS 15.2.\n\n**Security**\n\nApple's iOS operating system is regarded by some security experts as more secure against common malware than Android. Less than 1% of mobile malware targets iOS.\n\n**Reception and legacy**\n\nThe original iPhone has been described as \"revolutionary\", a \"breakthrough handheld computer\", and \"the best phone that anybody has ever made\". It is now Apple's bestselling product, and has been credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies by 2011. Newer iterations have also received praise and awards.\n\n**Sales**\n\nSteve Jobs's initial target was to reach 1% of phone market share in 2008. Apple sold 6.1 million units of the original iPhone between Q3 FY2007 and Q4 FY2008, and 11.3 million units of the iPhone 3G in Q4 FY2008 and Q1 FY2009. In 2008, the iPhone reached 1.1% of worldwide mobile phone market share, and 8.2% of the smartphone market. During this time it was quickly becoming relevant in North America, and in market share was ranked second in the U.S in 2009, behind the BlackBerry; in 2010 the iPhone 3GS was the best-selling smartphone in the U.S, the first time that an iPhone device reached top spot in that market.\n\n**Emerging markets**\n\nWhile other manufacturers make separate entry-level phones, Apple's entry-level phones are the previous years' models, part of an effort to increase its market share in emerging markets without diluting its premium brand. It also considers emerging market tastes in its product designs; for example, it introduced a gold iPhone after finding that gold was seen as a popular sign of a luxury product among Chinese customers.

vibration patterns can be customized by users Since iOS 15, Siri can read notifications out loud through earphones, and, since iOS 16, through the device's speakers [106]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe original iPhone was heavily promoted before its official announcement, creating buzz and anticipation [110] Upon its release, it was marketed heavily in television, web and print ads created in partnership with TBWA\\Chiat\\Day [111]\n\n\nRetail\nMany iPhones bought through a monthly carrier contract are SIM locked, restricting their use to one particular carrier [118] While the iPhone was initially sold in the U.S only on the AT&T network with a SIM lock in place, various hackers found methods to bypass that SIM lock [119] More than a quarter of first-generation iPhones sold in the U.S were not registered with AT&T Apple speculated that they were likely shipped overseas and unlocked, a lucrative market before the iPhone 3G's worldwide release [120] [121] Today, many carriers either remove the SIM lock automatically after a certain period, or do it upon request, either for free or for a small fee [122] iPhones bought from Apple are not SIM locked [118] Many carriers also sell the iPhone unlocked when purchased outright rather than on a long-term contract.\n\n\nSIM unlocking\nMany iPhones bought through a monthly carrier contract are SIM locked, restricting their use to one particular carrier [118] While the iPhone was initially sold in the U.S only on the AT&T network with a SIM lock in place, various hackers found methods to bypass that SIM lock [119] More than a quarter of first-generation iPhones sold in the U.S were not registered with AT&T Apple speculated that they were likely shipped overseas and unlocked, a lucrative market before the iPhone 3G's worldwide release [120] [121] Today, many carriers either remove the SIM lock automatically after a certain period, or do it upon request, either for free or for a small fee [122] iPhones bought from Apple are not SIM locked [118] Many carriers also sell the iPhone unlocked when purchased outright rather than on a long-term contract.\n\n\nRetail strategy\nSince 2013, iPhone buyers can obtain a trade in discount when buying a new iPhone directly from Apple The program aims to increase the number of customers who purchase iPhones at Apple Stores rather than carrier stores [123] In 2015, Apple unveiled the iPhone Upgrade Program, a 24-month leasing agreement, which Fortune described as a \"change  [in] iPhone owners' relationships with mobile carriers\" [124]\n\n\nRepairability\nOnly Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers are allowed by Apple to perform genuine replacements [125] Apple has taken steps to make third-party repairs more difficult iPhone components are soldered, and many are glued together [126] iPhones receive low repairability scores, in part due to the difficulty of obtaining genuine parts, and the difficulty undertaking each repair [127] This has given rise to the right to repair movement, aimed at giving users cheaper options for repairing their phones Apple has lobbied against right to repair legistation [128] Multiple jurisdictions aim to introduce right to repair laws, including the EU, [129] UK, [130] and U.S [131]\n\n\nPrivacy\nApple introduced App Tracking Transparency (ATT) with iOS 14.5 in April 2021 ATT requires apps to ask for explicit permission before being allowed to track the user across other apps and websites If the user refuses, the app cannot access Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), an identifier used to serve personalized ads  [138] ATT does not prevent personalized ads that are based on the user's behavior within the app itself [139] The feature has been criticized by some as anti-competitive, including Facebook, whose shares fell by 26% after its rollout [140] Apple exempts their own apps from their anti-tracking measures, which has led to anti-trust investigations by the French and German governments [141] [142]\n\n\nTracking prevention\nApple introduced App Tracking Transparency (ATT) with iOS 14.5 in April 2021 ATT requires apps to ask for explicit permission before being allowed to track the user across other apps and websites If the user refuses, the app cannot access Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), an identifier used to serve personalized ads  [138] ATT does not prevent personalized ads that are based on the user's behavior within the app itself [139] The feature has been criticized by some as anti-competitive, including Facebook, whose shares fell by 26% after its rollout [140] Apple exempts their own apps from their anti-tracking measures, which has led to anti-trust investigations by the French and German governments [141] [142]\n\n\nLocation tracking controversy\nIn July 2010, Apple claimed that it collected iPhone users' GPS coordinates and nearby Wi-Fi networks twice a day; a Wall Street Journal investigation found that Google’s Android sent this data \"several times an hour\" [143] [144]\n\n\nChild safety controversy\nIn August 2021, Apple announced plans to scan iCloud Photos for child abuse imagery (through an algorithm called \"NeuralHash\"), and filter explicit images sent and received by children using iPhones (dubbed \"Conversation Safety\"), to be rolled out later that year [156] More than 90 policy and human rights groups wrote an open letter to condemn both features [157] Apple's plan to implement NeuralHash on-device rather than in the cloud led the EFF and security experts to call it a \"backdoor\" that could later be expanded to detect other types of contents, and would decrease users' privacy [158] Apple claimed the system was \"misunderstood\", [159] but announced in December 2022 that the photo-scanning feature would never be implemented [160] The other feature, Conversation Safety, was added in iOS 15.2 [161]\n\n\nSecurity\nApple's iOS operating system is regarded by some security experts as more secure against common malware than Android [162] Less than 1% of mobile malware targets iOS [163]\n\n\nReception and legacy\nThe original iPhone has been described as \"revolutionary\", [185] a \"breakthrough handheld computer\", [186] and \"the best phone that anybody has ever made\" [187] It is now Apple's bestselling product, and has been credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies by 2011 [188] Newer iterations have also received praise and awards [189] [190]\n\n\nSales\nSteve Jobs's initial target was to reach 1% of phone market share in 2008 [203] Apple sold 6.1 million units of the original iPhone between Q3 FY2007 [note 4] and Q4 FY2008, and 11.3 million units of the iPhone 3G in Q4 FY2008 and Q1 FY2009 [204] In 2008, the iPhone reached 1.1% of worldwide mobile phone market share, [205] and 8.2% of the smartphone market [206] During this time it was quickly becoming relevant in North America, and in market share was ranked second in the U.S in 2009, behind the BlackBerry; [207] in 2010 the iPhone 3GS was the best-selling smartphone in the U.S., the first time that an iPhone device reached top spot in that market [208]\n\n\nEmerging markets\nWhile other manufacturers make separate entry-level phones, Apple's entry-level phones are the previous years' models, part of an effort to increase its market share in emerging markets without diluting its premium brand [233] [234] It also considers emerging market tastes in its product designs; for example, it introduced a gold iPhone after finding that gold was seen as a popular sign of a luxury product among Chinese customers [235] In 2017, Apple started manufacturing previous years' iPhone models in India; in 2022, it began manufacturing the current iPhone 14 there too [236] Analysts have speculated that this was partly caused by Apple's desire to reduce its dependence on China, and to overcome Indian import duties [236] [237] In 2023, the Chinese government banned the use of iPhones by government civil servants in what was seen as an effort to reduce dependence on foreign technology and strengthen cybersecurity [238]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne in the Peerage of Scotland), and his wife, Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck Her mother was descended from British prime minister William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, and Governor-General of India Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, who was the elder brother of another prime minister, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington [c]\n\n\nMarriage\nPrince Albert, Duke of York—\"Bertie\" to the family—was the second son of King George V and Queen Mary He initially proposed to Elizabeth in 1921, but she turned him down, being \"afraid never, never again to be free to think, speak and act as I feel I really ought to\" [18] When he declared he would marry no other, Queen Mary visited Glamis to see for herself the girl who had stolen her son's heart She became convinced that Elizabeth was \"the one girl who could make Bertie happy\", but refused to interfere [19] At the same time, Elizabeth was courted by James Stuart, Albert's equerry, until he left the prince's service for a better-paid job in the American oil business [20]\n\n\nDuchess of York\nAfter a successful royal visit to Northern Ireland in July 1924, the Labour government agreed that Albert and Elizabeth could tour East Africa from December 1924 to April 1925 [31] The Labour government was defeated by the Conservatives in a general election in November (which Elizabeth described as \"marvellous\" to her mother) [32] and the Governor-General of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Sir Lee Stack, was assassinated three weeks later Despite this, the tour went ahead, and they visited Aden, Kenya, Uganda, and Sudan, but Egypt was avoided because of political tensions [33]\n\n\nQueen consort\nOn 20 January 1936, George V died and his eldest son, Edward, Prince of Wales, became King Edward VIII Elizabeth's husband, Albert, became heir presumptive Just months into Edward's reign, the King's decision to marry the American divorcée Wallis Simpson caused a constitutional crisis that resulted in his abdication Albert reluctantly became king of the United Kingdom and emperor of India on 11 December 1936 under the regnal name of George VI Elizabeth became queen and empress Their coronation took place in Westminster Abbey on 12 May 1937, the date previously scheduled for Edward VIII's coronation Elizabeth's crown was made of platinum and was set with the Koh-i-Noor diamond [44]\n\n\nOverseas visits\nIn summer 1938, a state visit to France by the King and Queen was postponed for three weeks because of the death of Elizabeth's mother In two weeks, Norman Hartnell created an all-white trousseau for Elizabeth, who could not wear colours as she was still in mourning [48] The visit was designed to bolster Anglo-French solidarity in the face of aggression from Nazi Germany [49] The French press praised the demeanour and charm of the royal couple during the delayed but successful visit, augmented by Hartnell's wardrobe [50]\n\n\nSecond World War\nDuring the Second World War, the royal couple became symbols of the fight against fascism [69] Shortly after the declaration of war, The Queen's Book of the Red Cross was conceived Fifty authors and artists contributed to the book, which was fronted by Cecil Beaton's portrait of Elizabeth and was sold in aid of the Red Cross [70] She also broadcast to the nation in an attempt to comfort families during the evacuation of children and the mobilisation of fighting-age men [71] Elizabeth publicly refused to leave London or send the children to Canada, even during the Blitz, when the British Cabinet advised her to do so She declared, \"The children won't go without me I won't leave the King And the King will never leave.\" [72]\n\n\nPost-war years\nIn the 1945 British general election, Churchill's Conservative Party was soundly defeated by the Labour Party of Clement Attlee Elizabeth's political views were rarely disclosed, [81] but a letter she wrote in 1947 described Attlee's \"high hopes of a socialist heaven on earth\" as fading and presumably describes those who voted for him as \"poor people, so many half-educated and bemused I do love them.\" [82] Woodrow Wyatt thought her \"much more pro-Conservative\" than other members of the royal family, [83] but she later told him, \"I like the dear old Labour Party.\" [84] She also told the Duchess of Grafton, \"I love communists.\" [85]\n\n\nQueen mother\nShortly after George VI's death, Elizabeth began to be styled as Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother because the normal style for the widow of a king, \"Queen Elizabeth\", would have been too similar to the style of her elder daughter, Queen Elizabeth II [91] Popularly, she became the \"Queen Mother\" or the \"Queen Mum\" [92] She was devastated by her husband's death and retired to Scotland However, after a meeting with Prime Minister Winston Churchill, she broke her retirement and resumed her public duties [93] Eventually, she became just as busy as queen mother as she had been as queen consort In July 1953, she undertook her first overseas visit since the funeral when she visited the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland with Princess Margaret She laid the foundation stone of the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland—the current University of Zimbabwe [94] Upon her return to the region in 1957, Elizabeth was inaugurated as the college's president, and attended other events that were deliberately designed to be multi-racial [95] During her daughter's extensive tour of the Commonwealth over 1953–54, Elizabeth acted as a counsellor of state and looked after her grandchildren, Charles and Anne [96] In February 1959, she visited Kenya and Uganda [97] [98]\n\n\nWidowhood\nShortly after George VI's death, Elizabeth began to be styled as Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother because the normal style for the widow of a king, \"Queen Elizabeth\", would have been too similar to the style of her elder daughter, Queen Elizabeth II [91] Popularly, she became the \"Queen Mother\" or the \"Queen Mum\" [92] She was devastated by her husband's death and retired to Scotland However, after a

youngest daughter and the ninth of ten children of Claude Bowes-Lyon, Lord Glamis (later the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne in the Peerage of Scotland), and his wife, Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck. Her mother was descended from British prime minister William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, and Governor-General of India Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, who was the elder brother of another prime minister, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.\n\n**Marriage**\n\nPrince Albert, Duke of York—\"Bertie\" to the family—was the second son of King George V and Queen Mary. He initially proposed to Elizabeth in 1921, but she turned him down, being \"afraid never, never again to be free to think, speak and act as I feel I really ought to.\" When he declared he would marry no other, Queen Mary visited Glamis to see for herself the girl who had stolen her son's heart. She became convinced that Elizabeth was \"the one girl who could make Bertie happy,\" but refused to interfere. At the same time, Elizabeth was courted by James Stuart, Albert's equerry, until he left the prince's service for a better-paid job in the American oil business.\n\n**Duchess of York**\n\nAfter a successful royal visit to Northern Ireland in July 1924, the Labour government agreed that Albert and Elizabeth could tour East Africa from December 1924 to April 1925. The Labour government was defeated by the Conservatives in a general election in November (which Elizabeth described as \"marvellous\" to her mother), and the Governor-General of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Sir Lee Stack, was assassinated three weeks later. Despite this, the tour went ahead, and they visited Aden, Kenya, Uganda, and Sudan, but Egypt was avoided because of political tensions.\n\n**Queen consort**\n\nOn 20 January 1936, George V died and his eldest son, Edward, Prince of Wales, became King Edward VIII. Elizabeth's husband, Albert, became heir presumptive. Just months into Edward's reign, the King's decision to marry the American divorcée Wallis Simpson caused a constitutional crisis that resulted in his abdication. Albert reluctantly became king of the United Kingdom and emperor of India on 11 December 1936 under the regnal name of George VI. Elizabeth became queen and empress. Their coronation took place in Westminster Abbey on 12 May 1937, the date previously scheduled for Edward VIII's coronation. Elizabeth's crown was made of platinum and was set with the Koh-i-Noor diamond.\n\n**Overseas visits**\n\nIn summer 1938, a state visit to France by the King and Queen was postponed for three weeks because of the death of Elizabeth's mother. In two weeks, Norman Hartnell created an all-white trousseau for Elizabeth, who could not wear colours as she was still in mourning. The visit was designed to bolster Anglo-French solidarity in the face of aggression from Nazi Germany. The French press praised the demeanour and charm of the royal couple during the delayed but successful visit, augmented by Hartnell's wardrobe.\n\n**Second World War**\n\nDuring the Second World War, the royal couple became symbols of the fight against fascism. Shortly after the declaration of war, The Queen's Book of the Red Cross was conceived. Fifty authors and artists contributed to the book, which was fronted by Cecil Beaton's portrait of Elizabeth and was sold in aid of the Red Cross. She also broadcast to the nation in an attempt to comfort families during the evacuation of children and the mobilisation of fighting-age men. Elizabeth publicly refused to leave London or send the children to Canada, even during the Blitz, when the British Cabinet advised her to do so. She declared, \"The children won't go without me. I won't leave the King. And the King will never leave.\"\n\n**Post-war years**\n\nIn the 1945 British general election, Churchill's Conservative Party was soundly defeated by the Labour Party of Clement Attlee. Elizabeth's political views were rarely disclosed, but a letter she wrote in 1947 described Attlee's \"high hopes of a socialist heaven on earth\" as fading and presumably describes those who voted for him as \"poor people, so many half-educated and bemused. I do love them.\" Woodrow Wyatt thought her \"much more pro-Conservative\" than other members of the royal family, but she later told him, \"I like the dear old Labour Party.\" She also told the Duchess of Grafton, \"I love communists.\"\n\n**Queen mother**\n\nShortly after George VI's death, Elizabeth began to be styled as Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother because the normal style for the widow of a king, \"Queen Elizabeth,\" would have been too similar to the style of her elder daughter, Queen Elizabeth II. Popularly, she became the \"Queen Mother\" or the \"Queen Mum.\" She was devastated by her husband's death and retired to Scotland. However, after a meeting with Prime Minister Winston Churchill, she broke her retirement and resumed her public duties. Eventually, she became just as busy as queen mother as she had been as queen consort.\n\n**Centenarian**\n\nIn her later years, Elizabeth became known for her longevity. Her 90th birthday—4 August 1990—was celebrated by a parade on 27 June that involved many of the 300 organisations of which she was a patron. In 1995, she attended events commemorating the end of the war fifty years before, and had two operations: one to remove a cataract in her left eye, and one to replace her right hip. In 1998, her left hip was replaced after it was broken when she slipped and fell during a visit to Sandringham stables.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn 30 March 2002, at 15:15 GMT, Elizabeth died at the Royal Lodge, Windsor, at the age of 101.

Princess Elizabeth (now Queen Elizabeth II)\n2. Princess Margaret\n\n**Ancestry**\n\nElizabeth's ancestry can be traced back to the Scottish nobility, with her father being the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. Her mother was a member of the Cavendish-Bentinck family, which had produced several British prime ministers.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Elizabeth, Queen Mother (film)\n* Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's books\n* Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's charitable work\n* Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's fashion\n\n**Notes**\n\nElizabeth's life and reign were marked by significant events, including the Second World War and the decolonisation of Africa.

The film stars Daniel Craig as Bond, with a supporting cast that includes Judi Dench, Javier Bardem, and Naomie Harris. The movie follows Bond as he investigates a plot by a former MI6 agent to steal a hard drive containing details of undercover NATO agents. Along the way, he must confront his own demons and face off against the villainous Raoul Silva.\n\n**Plot**\n\nIn Istanbul, James Bond and Eve Moneypenny pursue mercenary Patrice, who has stolen a hard drive containing details of undercover NATO agents. As Bond and Patrice fight atop a moving train, M orders Moneypenny to shoot Patrice, despite not having a clear shot. Moneypenny inadvertently hits Bond, who falls into a river. Bond is presumed dead, and Patrice escapes with the hard drive.\n\nThe story then shifts to London, where M is facing a public inquiry into her running of MI6. Meanwhile, Bond is presumed dead, and his colleagues are struggling to cope with the loss. However, Bond is not dead, and he is hiding in a remote location, plotting his revenge against those who betrayed him.\n\nAs Bond navigates his way back to the world of espionage, he becomes embroiled in a complex plot by Raoul Silva, a former MI6 agent turned cyber-terrorist. Silva is determined to destroy MI6 and the world order that he sees as corrupt and decaying. He is a brilliant hacker and has managed to infiltrate the highest levels of the organization, using the stolen hard drive to gather intelligence and manipulate M and her team.\n\nBond must use all his skills and resources to track down Silva and prevent him from carrying out his plans. Along the way, he must confront his own demons and face off against his nemesis, who is determined to destroy him.\n\n**Casting**\n\nThe main cast was announced at a press conference held at the Corinthia Hotel in London on 3 November 2011. Daniel Craig returned as James Bond for the third time, saying he felt lucky to have the chance.

The score is a blend of classical and electronic music, reflecting the film's themes of espionage and betrayal.\n\nThe soundtrack features several memorable themes, including the title track \"Skyfall,\" which was performed by Adele.

The song was written by Adele and Paul Epworth, and was recorded at Abbey Road Studios.\n\n**Filming**\n\nPrincipal photography for Skyfall took place from 7 November 2011 to 27 May 2012. The film was shot on location in the United Kingdom, including in London, Istanbul, and Scotland.

Mendes described Craig's casting and performance in Casino Royale as being what he felt the Bond franchise needed He agreed to direct after meeting producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and seeing the early direction the film was going to take [51] Media speculation was that Mendes had commissioned rewrites of the script to \" [remove] action scenes in favour of 'characterful performances'\" with the hope of securing an Academy Award [52] Mendes denied this, saying that the action scenes were an important part of the film [20]\n\n\nWriting\nPeter Morgan was originally commissioned to write a script, but left the project when MGM filed for bankruptcy and production of the film stalled; despite his departure, Morgan later stated that the final script was based on his original idea, retaining what he described as its \"big hook\" [55] Mendes denied this as \"just not true\", insisting that Morgan's approach had been discarded once he had agreed to direct [56] Robert Wade later said that \"Neal and I were pretty steeped in Fleming I think Peter was more interested in Le Carré It just didn't work.\" [57] Morgan cowrote the treatment Once Upon a Spy with Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, which had M being blackmailed by a Russian oligarch, who would be a former KGB agent she had an affair with while stationed in West Berlin during the Cold War The script would have ended with Bond being forced to kill M [58] [59] [43] Mendes disliked most of the script but asked to keep the ending with M's death [58]\n\n\nLocation scouting\nIn April 2011, Mendes and Broccoli travelled to South Africa for location scouting [65] With the film moving into pre-production in August, reports emerged that shooting would take place in India, [66] with scenes to be shot in the Sarojini Nagar district of New Delhi [67] and on railway lines between Goa and Ahmedabad [68] The production crew faced complications in securing permission to close sections of the Konkan Railway [69] Similar problems in obtaining filming permits were encountered by production crews for The Dark Knight Rises and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol [70] Permission was eventually granted to the Bond production crew; the production ultimately did not shoot in India [71]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography was scheduled to take up to 133 days, [72] although actually took 128 [73] It began on 7 November 2011 in London, [20] [74] with Deakins using Arri Alexa digital cameras to shoot the entire film It was the first Bond film to be shot digitally [75] Scenes were shot in London Underground stations, [76] Smithfield car park in West Smithfield, [77] the National Gallery, Southwark, [78] Whitehall, Parliament Square, [79] Charing Cross station, [80] the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, [81] Cadogan Square [77] and Tower Hill [82] St Bartholomew's Hospital [78] was used for the scene in which Bond enters MI6's underground headquarters, while the Old Vic Tunnels underneath Waterloo Station served as the MI6 training grounds The meeting between Q and Bond was filmed when the National Gallery was closed at night.\n\n\nMusic\nThomas Newman, who had previously worked with Mendes as composer for American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead and Revolutionary Road, replaced David Arnold as composer, [101] becoming the ninth composer in the series' history When asked about the circumstances surrounding his departure from the role, David Arnold commented that Newman had been selected by Mendes because of their work together, rather than because of Arnold's commitment to working with director Danny Boyle as composer for the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics [102] [non-primary source needed] The soundtrack album was released on 29 October 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 6 November 2012 in the United States [103]\n\n\nRelease and reception\nThe premiere of Skyfall was on 23 October 2012 at the Royal Albert Hall in London The event was attended by Charles, Prince of Wales, and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall [112] Charles asked that money raised at the premiere be donated to charities that served former or serving members of the British intelligence agencies [113] The film was released in the UK three days later on 26 October and into US cinemas on 8 November [114] Skyfall was the first Bond film to be screened in IMAX venues [115] and was released into IMAX cinemas in North America a day earlier than the conventional cinema release [116]\n\n\nBox office\nSkyfall earned $1.109 billion worldwide, [5] and at the time of its release was the highest-grossing film worldwide for Sony Pictures and the second-highest-grossing film of 2012 [118] [119] On its opening weekend, it earned $80.6 million from 25 markets [120] In the UK the film grossed £20.1 million on its opening weekend, making it the second-highest Friday-to-Sunday debut ever behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 [121] It also achieved the second-highest IMAX debut ever behind The Dark Knight Rises [120] The film set a record for the highest seven-day gross with £37.2 million, surpassing previous record holder Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (£35.7 million) [122] By 9 November 2012 the film had earned over £57 million to surpass The Dark Knight Rises as the highest-grossing film of 2012, and the highest-grossing James Bond film of all time in the UK [123]\n\n\nCritical response\nSkyfall received \"generally positive reviews from critics and fans\", according to the GlobalPost [134] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 92% based on 384 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10 The site's critical consensus reads, \"Sam Mendes brings Bond surging back with a smart, sexy, riveting action thriller that qualifies as one of the best 007 films to date.\" [135] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 81 out of 100 based on 49 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\" [136] CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade filmgoers gave the film was an \"A\" on an A+ to F scale [137]\n\n\nHome media\nSkyfall was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital HD in the US and Canada on 12 February 2013, [155] and in the UK on 18 February 2013 [156]\n\n\nAccolades\nAt the 85th Academy Awards, Skyfall received nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Sound Mixing;

{"title": "Art", "content": "\nOverview\nIn the perspective of the history of art, [11] artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early prehistoric art to contemporary art; however, some theorists think that the typical concept of \"artistic works\" does not fit well outside modern Western societies [12] One early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to \"skill\" or \"craft\", as associated with words such as \"artisan\" English words derived from this meaning include artifact, artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its etymology.\n\n\nHistory\nA shell engraved by Homo erectus was determined to be between 430,000 and 540,000 years old [30] A set of eight 130,000 years old white-tailed eagle talons bear cut marks and abrasion that indicate manipulation by neanderthals, possibly for using it as jewelry [31] A series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000 years old—were discovered in a South African cave [32] Containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100,000 years [33]\n\n\nForms, genres, media, and styles\nThe creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as media, genre, styles, and form [56] Art form refers to the elements of art that are independent of its interpretation or significance It covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical composition of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., figurae), [57] such as color, contour, dimension, medium, melody, space, texture, and value Form may also include Design principles, such as arrangement, balance, contrast, emphasis, harmony, proportion, proximity, and rhythm [58]\n\n\nSkill and craft\nArt can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium Art can also refer to the developed and efficient use of a language to convey meaning with immediacy or depth Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations [64]\n\n\nPurpose\nArt has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept This does not imply that the purpose of art is \"vague\", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created Some of these functions of art are provided in the following outline The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Lévi-Strauss) [73]\n\n\nNon-motivated functions\nThe non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e., no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility [73]\n\n\nMotivated functions\nMotivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or used as a form of communication [73] [78]\n\n\nSteps\nArt can be divided into any number of steps one can make an argument for This section divides the creative process into broad three steps, but there is no consensus on an exact number [99]\n\n\nPreparation\nIn the first step, the artist envisions the art in their mind By imagining what their art would look like, the artist begins the process of bringing the art into existence Preparation of art may involve approaching and researching the subject matter Artistic inspiration is one of the main drivers of art, and may be considered to stem from instinct, impressions, and feelings [99]\n\n\nCreation\nIn the second step, the artist executes the creation of their work The creation of a piece can be affected by factors such as the artist's mood, surroundings, and mental state For example, The Black Paintings by Francisco de Goya, created in the elder years of his life, are thought to be so bleak because he was in isolation and because of his experience with war He painted them directly on the walls of his apartment in Spain, and most likely never discussed them with anyone [100] The Beatles stated drugs such as LSD and cannabis influenced some of their greatest hits, such as Revolver [101] [102] Trial and error are considered an integral part of the creation process [99]\n\n\nAppreciation\nThe last step is art appreciation, which has the sub-topic of critique In one study, over half of visual arts students agreed that reflection is an essential step of the art process [99] According to education journals, the reflection of art is considered an essential part of the experience [103] [104] However an important aspect of art is that others may view and appreciate it as well While many focus on whether those viewing/listening/etc believe the art to be good/successful or not, art has profound value beyond its commercial success as a provider of information and health in society [105] Art enjoyment can bring about a wide spectrum of emotion due to beauty Some art is meant to be practical, with its analysis studious, meant to stimulate discourse [106]\n\n\nPublic access\nSince ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society [107]\n\n\nControversies\nArt has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view Iconoclasm is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones Aniconism is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions It has been a crucial factor in the history of Islamic art, where depictions of Muhammad remain especially controversial Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by art critics, though often much less so by a wider public The iconographic content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the Swoon of the Virgin in scenes of the Crucifixion of Jesus The Last Judgment by Michelangelo was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of decorum through nudity and the Apollo-like pose of Christ [125] [126]\n\n\nTheory\nBefore Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of realism or truth to nature and the ideal; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art The aesthetic theorist John Ruskin, who championed what he saw as the naturalism of J. M. W Turner, saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature [133]\n\n\nArrival of Modernism\nThe arrival of Modernism in the late 19th century led to a radical break in the conception of the function of art, [135] and then again in the late 20th century with the advent of postmodernism Clement Greenberg's 1960 article \"Modernist Painting\" defines modern art as \"the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself\" [136] Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:\n\n\nNew Criticism and the \"intentional fallacy\"\nFollowing Duchamp during the first half of the 20th century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other This resulted in the rise of the New Criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist [143] [144]\n\n\n\"Linguistic turn\" and its debate\nThe end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the \"innocent eye debate\" in the philosophy of art This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art [151]\n\n\nClassification disputes\n Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included cubist and impressionist paintings, Duchamp's Fountain, the movies, J S G Boggs' superlative imitations of banknotes, conceptual art, and video games [156] Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem Rather, \"the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life\" are \"so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art.\" [157] According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper For example, when the Daily Mail criticized Hirst's and Emin's work by arguing \"For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all\" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work [158] In 1998, Arthur Danto, suggested a thought experiment showing that \"the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood.\" [159] [160]\n\n\nValue judgment\nSomewhat in relation to the above, the word art is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as \"that meal was a work of art\" (the cook is an artist), or \"the art of deception\" (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised) It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art However, \"good\" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons For example, Francisco Goya's painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3 May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art' [166] [167]\n\n\nArt and law\nAn essential legal issue are art forgeries, plagiarism, replicas and works that are strongly based on other works of art.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Art\n\nArt, in its various forms, has been an integral part of human culture and expression for thousands of years. From prehistoric cave paintings to modern-day installations, art has played a significant role in shaping our understanding of the world and ourselves. In this article, we will explore the concept of art, its history, forms, and functions, as well as its controversies and theories.\n\n## History\n\nThe history of art dates back to the earliest human civilizations, with evidence of artistic expression found in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Prehistoric art, such as cave paintings and petroglyphs, has been discovered in various parts of the world, showcasing the creative abilities of early humans. Throughout history, art has been used to convey messages, tell stories, and express emotions, often serving as a reflection of the societal and cultural context in which it was created.\n\n## Forms, Genres, Media, and Styles\n\nArt can be categorized into various forms, genres, media, and styles, each with its unique characteristics and expressive qualities. Some of the most common forms of art include visual arts, music, literature, dance, and theater. Within these forms, there are numerous genres, such as painting, sculpture, photography, and film, each with its own specific techniques and mediums. Styles, on the other hand, refer to the distinctive approaches and philosophies adopted by artists, such as realism, abstract expressionism, and surrealism.\n\n## Skill and Craft\n\nArt often requires a high level of skill and craft, as artists must master various techniques and mediums in order to create their work. The development of artistic skills and techniques has been a gradual process, with many artists building upon the work of their predecessors. In addition to technical skill, art also requires a deep understanding of the subject matter, as well as the ability to convey emotions and ideas through the work.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of art has been the subject of much debate and discussion throughout history. Some argue that art should be used to convey moral and social messages, while others believe that its primary function is to provide aesthetic pleasure. In reality, art often serves multiple purposes, depending on the context and intentions of the artist.\n\n## Non-Motivated Functions\n\nNon-motivated functions of art refer to those aspects that are inherent to being human, such as creativity, self-expression, and communication. These functions transcend individual purposes and are essential to the human experience.\n\n## Motivated Functions\n\nMotivated functions of art, on the other hand, refer to intentional actions on the part of the artist, such as bringing about social change, commenting on societal issues, or conveying emotions and ideas.\n\n## Steps\n\nThe creative process can be broken down into three broad steps: preparation, creation, and appreciation. Preparation involves researching and envisioning the art, while creation entails the actual process of bringing the art into existence. Appreciation, the final step, involves critiquing and reflecting on the art.\n\n## Preparation\n\nIn the first step, the artist envisions the art in their mind, beginning the process of bringing the art into existence. Preparation may involve approaching and researching the subject matter, as well as gathering inspiration from various sources.\n\n## Creation\n\nThe second step involves the actual creation of the art, which can be affected by factors such as the artist's mood, surroundings, and mental state. Trial and error are considered an integral part of the creation process.\n\n## Appreciation\n\nThe last step, appreciation, involves critiquing and reflecting on the art. Art appreciation can be a subjective process, with different viewers interpreting and responding to the art in unique ways.\n\n## Public Access\n\nPublic access to art has been a significant issue throughout history, with many works of art being commissioned by wealthy patrons or created for specific audiences. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards making art more accessible to the general public.\n\n## Controversies\n\nArt has long been a source of controversy, with many works of art being criticized or rejected by certain groups or individuals. Iconoclasm, the destruction of art, has been a recurring theme throughout history, often driven by religious or political motivations.\n\n## Theory\n\nArt theory has evolved significantly over the centuries, with various philosophers and critics offering their perspectives on the nature and purpose of art. Some have argued that art should strive for realism and truth to nature, while others have championed the importance of imagination and creativity.\n\n## Arrival of Modernism\n\nThe arrival of modernism in the late 19th century marked a significant shift in the conception of art, with artists such as Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali pushing the boundaries of traditional forms and styles.\n\n## New Criticism and the Intentional Fallacy\n\nThe New Criticism movement, which emerged in the mid-20th century, emphasized the importance of literary criticism and the role of the reader in interpreting the text. This movement sparked a debate over the intentional fallacy, which refers to the idea that the artist's intentions should not be considered when interpreting the work.\n\n## Linguistic Turn and its Debate\n\nThe linguistic turn controversy, which emerged in the late 20th century, centered on the relationship between language and reality, with some arguing that language shapes our understanding of the world and others contending that reality is independent of language.\n\n## Classification Disputes\n\nClassification disputes over art refer to disagreements over whether a particular work or object should be considered a work of art. These disputes often involve questions of value, purpose, and definition.\n\n## Value Judgment\n\nValue judgments about art involve evaluating the quality and merit of a particular work or artist, often based on subjective criteria such as aesthetics, originality, and impact.\n\n## Art and Law\n\nArt and law intersect in various areas, including intellectual property, copyright, and the regulation of art in public spaces.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, art is a complex and multifaceted concept that has evolved over time, involving various forms, genres, media, and styles. Its purpose, functions, and value judgments have been the subject of much debate and discussion, reflecting the changing societal and cultural contexts in which it is created and appreciated.",

depth Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations [64]\n\n\nPurpose\nArt has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept This does not imply that the purpose of art is \"vague\", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created Some of these functions of art are provided in the following outline The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Lévi-Strauss) [73]\n\n\nNon-motivated functions\nThe non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e., no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility [73]\n\n\nMotivated functions\nMotivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or used as a form of communication [73] [78]\n\n\nSteps\nArt can be divided into any number of steps one can make an argument for This section divides the creative process into broad three steps, but there is no consensus on an exact number [99]\n\n\nPreparation\nIn the first step, the artist envisions the art in their mind By imagining what their art would look like, the artist begins the process of bringing the art into existence Preparation of art may involve approaching and researching the subject matter Artistic inspiration is one of the main drivers of art, and may be considered to stem from instinct, impressions, and feelings [99]\n\n\nCreation\nIn the second step, the artist executes the creation of their work The creation of a piece can be affected by factors such as the artist's mood, surroundings, and mental state For example, The Black Paintings by Francisco de Goya, created in the elder years of his life, are thought to be so bleak because he was in isolation and because of his experience with war He painted them directly on the walls of his apartment in Spain, and most likely never discussed them with anyone [100] The Beatles stated drugs such as LSD and cannabis influenced some of their greatest hits, such as Revolver [101] [102] Trial and error are considered an integral part of the creation process [99]\n\n\nAppreciation\nThe last step is art appreciation, which has the sub-topic of critique In one study, over half of visual arts students agreed that reflection is an essential step of the art process [99] According to education journals, the reflection of art is considered an essential part of the experience [103] [104] However an important aspect of art is that others may view and appreciate it as well While many focus on whether those viewing/listening/etc believe the art to be good/successful or not, art has profound value beyond its commercial success as a provider of information and health in society [105] Art enjoyment can bring about a wide spectrum of emotion due to beauty Some art is meant to be practical, with its analysis studious, meant to stimulate discourse [106]\n\n\nPublic access\nSince ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society [107]\n\n\nControversies\nArt has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view Iconoclasm is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones Aniconism is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions It has been a crucial factor in the history of Islamic art, where depictions of Muhammad remain especially controversial Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by art critics, though often much less so by a wider public The iconographic content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the Swoon of the Virgin in scenes of the Crucifixion of Jesus The Last Judgment by Michelangelo was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of decorum through nudity and the Apollo-like pose of Christ [125] [126]\n\n\nTheory\nBefore Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of realism or truth to nature and the ideal; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art The aesthetic theorist John Ruskin, who championed what he saw as the naturalism of J. M. W Turner, saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature [133]\n\n\nArrival of Modernism\nThe arrival of Modernism in the late 19th century led to a radical break in the conception of the function of art, [135] and then again in the late 20th century with the advent of postmodernism Clement Greenberg's 1960 article \"Modernist Painting\" defines modern art as \"the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself\" [136] Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:\n\n\nNew Criticism and the \"intentional fallacy\"\nFollowing Duchamp during the first half of the 20th century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other This resulted in the rise of the New Criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist [143] [144]\n\n\n\"Linguistic turn\" and its debate\nThe end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the \"innocent eye debate\" in the philosophy of art This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art [151]\n\n\nClassification disputes\n Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included cubist and impressionist paintings, Duchamp's Fountain, the movies, J S G Boggs' superlative imitations of banknotes, conceptual art, and video games [156] Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem Rather, \"the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life\" are \"so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art.\" [157] According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper For example, when the Daily Mail criticized Hirst's and Emin's work by arguing \"For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all\" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work [158] In 1998, Arthur Danto, suggested a thought experiment showing that \"the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood.\" [159] [160]\n\n\nValue judgment\nSomewhat in relation to the above, the word art is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as \"that meal was a work of art\" (the cook is an artist), or \"the art of deception\" (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised) It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art However, \"good\" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons For example, Francisco Goya's painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3 May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art' [166] [167]\n\n\nArt and law\nAn essential legal issue are art forgeries, plagiarism, replicas and works that are strongly based on other works of art.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther

developed as it was within an active trough [25] The low was located in a generally favorable environment with deep moisture, low vertical wind shear, and defined outflow [26] The low drifted close to the coast of Timor very slowly with persistent spiraling bands of convection occupying the storm's circulation, producing prolific rainfall in the surrounding regions on 3–4 April [27] At this time, the low pressure system was located inside the Area of Responsibility (AoR) of TCWC Jakarta [28] By the early morning of 4 April, the presentation of its structure had improved with spiral bands of deep convection and tight curvature at its center [29] Although there were fluctuations in central convection, a favorable environment of deep moisture, low vertical wind shear, and good outflow meant further development of the system was expected [26] [27] Meanwhile, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first warning on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 26S at 15:00 on UTC 4 April [30] The tropical low slowly gained strength, intensifying to a Category 1 tropical cyclone, and was given the name Seroja by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) Jakarta at 20:00 UTC on 4 April, about 95 km (59 mi) north-northwest of Rote Island [31] [32]\n\n\nPreparations\nThe Indonesian Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency declared two days before the cyclone's formation that they were already anticipating the possibility of tropical cyclone development over the Savu Sea [43] On 4 April 2021, the agency issued an early warning [44] [45] On 8 April 2021, the agency again issued warnings to other provinces such as Bali, East Java, Central Java, and West Nusa Tenggara [46]\n\n\nIndonesia\nSeveral schools on the Indonesia-Timor Leste border were evacuated by the Indonesian Army stationed there before they collapsed [124] [125] Police in Kefamenanu assisted by the army evacuated most of the town residents amid flooding in the region [126] Evacuation processes in the East Flores Regency was hampered by the lack of heavy equipment, limited access to the sea, and a lack of effective shelter in the area [75] [127] The Indonesian electricity company PLN was only able to repair 82% of damaged power infrastructure in residential areas, while the rest was difficult to repair because of the extreme weather and floods [128] [129]\n\n\nAustralia\nAfter Seroja made landfall, around 4,350 people in Western Australia lost electricity as the storm's high winds downed power lines, particularly around Kalbarri [101] A wind gust of 170 kilometres per hour (110 mph), which was likely being one of the strongest wind gusts recorded in the city in more than 50 years Rain up to 100 millimetres (3.9 in) was also reported in the town [102] [verification needed] This number of power outages soon increased to over 25,000 within hours of landfall as Seroja accelerated further inland [103] Shortly after, unconfirmed reports claimed that buildings had already had their roofs torn off and even entire homes and sheds were completely destroyed [104] Carnarvon's famous 124-year old \"One Mile Jetty\" collapsed and floated out to sea [105] Some residents were required to barricade themselves within bathrooms or cupboards as their homes were damaged [106] In the daytime, Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) reported that around 70% of structures in Kalbarri were damaged, while around 40% of those properties had been completely destroyed [107] [108] The department also received around 175 calls by the morning of 12 April [107] Businesses based around the tourist industry in Kalbarri were afraid they might never be able to reopen [109]\n\n\nImpact\nIn East Timor, a landslide and floods displaced more than 8,000 people and was initially claimed to have led to the deaths of 42 people in total [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [9] [6] The storm caused power outages in the entirety of East Timor, in addition to damaging the presidential palace [61] Flood caused by the storm damaged the national laboratory of Guido Valadares National Hospital, the only laboratorium in the country, causing concern that it would affect East Timor's effort to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic [62] The floods also seemed to have damaged the country's central pharmacy, where vaccine stocks for East Timor population were stored [62] [63] Other damaged facilities include two COVID-19 isolation facilities [64] [65] [66] It is thought that many more people in East Timor have died due to the storm's widespread flooding [65] [66] At least 30

it is impossible for East Timor to currently balance the damage mitigation with the limited resources the country has [121] [64] United Nations developmental coordinator Alex Tilman said East Timor would not have the necessary resources alone to recover from the cyclone [17] Portugal was ready to send assistance to East Timor, according to Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva [64] The European

prior to the cyclone and no direct response by the local government was criticized by Indonesian netizens and NGOs, such as WALHI, for worsening the effects of the cyclone [22] The hashtag #PrayforNTT became viral in Indonesia on Twitter [180] [181] WALHI pressured the provincial government of the province of East Nusa Tenggara to declare a state of emergency and criticized the lack of a response from the governor there, Viktor Laiskodat [182] [29] The Prosperous Justice Party criticized Indonesian president Joko Widodo for attending the marriage of Indonesian celebrity Atta Halilintar instead of addressing the disaster of Seroja [183] [184] The governor of East Nusa Tenggara declared a state of emergency on 6 April 2021, which was thought to be too late by many [who?] [185] [186] People in the affected regions asked President Joko Widodo to come instead of asking local officials to assist because they are considered too slow and uncoordinated [187] A member of the Indonesia National Student Movement from the region harshly criticized the local government and asked the President to directly see and discipline them [187]\n\n\nRetirement\nDue to its onslaught, the name Seroja was

Six is a fictional team of supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #1 (January 1964).\n\nIntroduction\nThe Sinister Six is a group of six supervillains who band together to take on Spider-Man, the web-slinging superhero. The team has undergone various lineup changes over the years, with different members joining and leaving the group. Despite their differences, the Sinister Six remains one of the most iconic and formidable teams of villains in the Marvel Universe.\n\nPublication history\nThe Sinister Six first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #1 (January 1964), created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. The original lineup consisted of Doctor Octopus, Electro, Kraven the Hunter, Mysterio, Sandman, and Vulture. Each member had a personal vendetta against Spider-Man, and they decided to put aside their differences to take him down together.\n\nFictional team biography\nAfter suffering two defeats from Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus is separated from his tentacle pack. His tentacle pack breaks free and helps him escape from prison. He contacts every known supervillain who had crossed paths with Spider-Man, offering them a chance to join forces against the web-slinger. Only Electro, Kraven the Hunter, the original Mysterio, the Sandman, and the original Vulture respond. None of the members are willing to relinquish the honor of killing Spider-Man themselves, so they decide to challenge him individually, with the order determined by a random drawing.\n\nOriginal Sinister Six\nThe original Sinister Six lineup consisted of:\n\n* Doctor Octopus (Otto Octavius)\n* Electro (Max Dillon)\n* Kraven the Hunter (Sergei Kravenoff)\n* Mysterio (Quentin Beck)\n* Sandman (Flint Marko)\n* Vulture (Adrian Toomes)\n\nThe Sinister Six kidnap Aunt May and Daily Bugle secretary Betty Brant, holding them hostage to force Spider-Man to confront them. Spider-Man defeats the Sinister Six members one-by-one, mocking their decision to battle him individually instead of as a team in front of Doctor Octopus, the last one to be defeated.\n\nThe Return of the Sinister Six\nIn The Amazing Spider-Man #334-339, Doctor Octopus recruits Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, and Vulture, along with the demonic Hobgoblin (since Kraven the Hunter had recently died), as part of his plan to take over the world. However, this was a trick, part of a larger plan by which Doc Ock alone would be the master of the world, by releasing a chemical into the atmosphere that would cause pain in anyone who attempted to use cocaine; he would then sell his cure for the chemical to the rich and powerful. Spider-Man, aided by the Sandman, who had reformed, helps defeat the Sinister Six and stops Doc Ock's plans to conquer the world.\n\nRevenge of the Sinister Six\nIn Spider-Man #18-23, Electro, Mysterio, Vulture, and Hobgoblin reunite to take revenge on Doctor Octopus. They trick Sandman into joining them by hitting his foster family with a bomb, leading him to believe that Doctor Octopus attacked them as punishment for betraying him. Sandman contacts Spider-Man and asks him to shadow the group as insurance against being double-crossed. Doctor Octopus easily defeats the other members of the six with his newly reacquired adamantium arms, then zaps Sandman with a weapon that transforms his body into glass and beats Spider-Man nearly to death. When police surround the building, the other members of the Sinister Six agree to serve Doctor Octopus in exchange for his helping them escape.\n\nAssembled Sinister Six\nThe assembled Sinister Six go off on a rampage, stealing advanced weapons and technology from several sources, including an alien dimension and a facility specializing in cybernetics. They recruit Gog to complete their quorum of six. Eventually, Spider-Man and several other heroes confront the villains as they seize a HYDRA base to gain access to deadly, world-devastating weapons. Most of the members are again incarcerated, but Vulture and Hobgoblin escape.\n\nSinister Seven\nA variation known as the Sinister Seven is formed by Hobgoblin to fight Kaine after he killed Doctor Octopus and the Grim Hunter (Kraven's son Vladimir). Hobgoblin's Sinister Seven includes the Beetle, Electro, Mysterio, Scorpia, the Shocker, and the Vulture. They finally find Kaine and a battle erupts. Spider-Man saves Kaine from being executed; the two then work together and defeat the Sinister Seven.\n\nSandman's Sinister Six\nThe Sandman (who had been turned back into a villain by his former ally the Wizard) and the second Mysterio form a new version of the Sinister Six, with Venom temporarily replacing Doctor Octopus and the other members consisting of Electro, the second Kraven the Hunter, and the Vulture. The Sinister Six are defeated again, and Venom subsequently attacks the various members of the group after being betrayed by them. He nearly kills the Sandman and badly injures Electro and Kraven the Hunter before he and his symbiote are briefly separated from each other by the mysterious Senator Ward.\n\nSinister Twelve\nIn Marvel Knights Spider-Man, Norman Osborn is unmasked to the public as the Green Goblin and imprisoned. Osborn contacts a group of supervillains who also bear grudges against Spider-Man, all of whom had been financed by Osborn's fortunes for years. Eager to retaliate, the villains agree to band together, and the Sinister Twelve is formed.\n\nCivil War's Sinister Six\nA new version of the Sinister Six bands together during the Civil War storyline. The line-up consists of Doctor Octopus, Grim Reaper, Lizard, Shocker, Trapster, and Vulture. They are stopped by Captain America and his Secret Avengers off-panel and discovered bound and subdued by S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\n\"Big Time\" Sinister Six\nFollowing the events of the \"Origin of the Species\" storyline, which involves Doctor Octopus assembling Spider-Man's enemies to target Harry Osborn's baby (who Doctor Octopus thought had some of Norman Osborn's DNA), only the Chameleon, Electro, Mysterio, the Rhino, and the Sandman remain with Doctor Octopus to reform the Sinister Six when the baby does not inherit Norman Osborn's DNA. Their first plot involves sending Micro-Octobots to blow up an Air Force base. This is prevented by Spider-Man, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four.\n\nEnds of the Earth\nIn the \"Ends of the Earth\" storyline, all of Doctor Octopus' preparations come to fruition in a plan to conquer the world. Doctor Octopus activates a giant antenna array called the Octahedral, which in turn activates Earth-orbiting satellites he calls the Octavian Lens. The Lens works to speed up the greenhouse effect, which in turns heats up the Earth. Upon hacking into televisions around the world, Doctor Octopus describes what his satellites are doing and shuts them down. He says he can save the world \"at a price.\"\n\nMarvel NOW!'s Sinister Six\nAs part of the Marvel NOW! event, the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus's mind in Spider-Man's body) encounters a new Sinister Six consisting of Boomerang, Overdrive, the Shocker, the Speed Demon, the Living Brain, and the female Beetle that previously fought Captain America and the Black Widow. The group of villains attacks Horizon Labs, but the Superior Spider-Man defeats them using a power-dampening field to disable their equipment.\n\nSuperior Six\nFollowing the deletion of Peter Parker's memories and acquiring the Raft as his new base, the Superior Spider-Man begins to collect former Sinister Six members and store them in his underwater lab. The Superior Spider-Man first acquires the sand grain that contained the Sandman's consciousness. When Electro returns to Earth after being hurled into space by Thor, the Superior Spider-Man enlists Thor to help defeat Electro. The Superior Spider-Man then confiscates the Chameleon from S.H.I.E.L.D custody. The Superior Spider-Man comes across Mysterion (a villain dressed like Mysterio) robbing a bank. Upon defeating Mysterion, the Superior Spider-Man discovers that the villain is not Quentin Beck but an unnamed man who bought the Mysterio gear from the Hobgoblin. Finally, the Superior Spider-Man goes up against the Vulture, who seeks to get even with the Superior Spider-Man for beating him up twice. The Superior Spider-Man manages to defeat the Vulture.\n\nSinister Sixty\nMojo and the Chameleon abduct Spider-Man and his X-Men students and force them to star in a show that pits them against the Sinister Sixty. The group consists of holographic stand-ins of various enemies of Spider-Man, including the Beetle, Carnage, the Demogoblin, Doctor Octopus, the Duster, Electro, the Gibbon, the Green Goblin, the Grizzly, Hammerhead, the Hobgoblin, the Jackal, Jack O'Lantern, the Kingpin, Kraven the Hunter, the Sludge, the Lizard, Morbius the Living Vampire, Mysterio, the Puma, the Rhino, the Ringer, the Sandman, the Scorpion, Shriek, Tombstone, Vermin, and the Vulture. Spider-Man and Spider-Bite defeat the Sinister Sixty at Grand Central Station and keep the Stilt-Man from claiming the Spider-Man action figure.\n\nSinister War\nWhile Doctor Octopus is discovering clues to some of his missing memories, he exhumes an unexpectedly empty casket in a cemetery. Kindred sends one of his centipedes to enter Doctor Octopus' ear, rendering him unconscious.\n\nMembership\nIn the Age of Apocalypse 10th anniversary limited series, Mister Sinister assembles his own group dubbed the Sinister Six. However, this group is unrelated to the more established lineup of criminals and includes Cloak and Dagger, Sonique, Sauron, Blob, and Phoenix.\n\nOther versions\nA zombified version of the Sinister Six appears in Marvel Zombies: Dead Days. They are seen attacking innocent civilians upon the S.H.I.E.L.D helicarrier, but are repelled by Wolverine and Magneto.\n\nMarvel Zombies Return\nIn the Marvel Zombies series, the Sinister Six appear in an alternative universe that Zombie Spider-Man enters, working for the Kingpin and consisting of Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Vulture, Mysterio, Electro, and Kraven the Hunter. They are quickly and violently ripped apart, bitten and zombified (except Sandman, who flees by turning into sand and disguising himself as the dirt Zombie Spider-Man stood on), and end up eating Spider-Man's friends, which causes them to be killed in retaliation.\n\nSecret Wars (2015)\nTwo versions of the Sinister Six appear in the Secret Wars storyline, each residing in their part of Battleworld.\n\nSpider's Shadow Sinister Six\nIn the miniseries Spider-Man: Spider's Shadow, where the symbiote is able to more fully bond with Peter, Spider-Man's darker actions under the influence of the symbiote prompt Jameson to form a new Sinister Six in the form of Doctor Octopus, Rhino, Electro, Mysterio, Kraven, and Jameson himself using a Spider-Slayer. After Spider-Man kills Hobgoblin, Shocker, and Scorpion, and assaults Jameson and the Kingpin, Eddie Brock attempts to join the group by killing Octavius and taking the tentacles for himself. However, the symbiote Spider-Man still manages to kill Rhino, Electro, and Mysterio and seriously injure Brock before a burning building near the battle site drives the symbiote off Peter, forcing Jameson to acknowledge that he's wrong about the wall-crawler.\n\nSpider-Man: Reign\nAn older version of the Sinister Six, dubbed the \"Sinner Six,\" appears in Spider-Man: Reign. This version of the team (composed of Scorpion, Electro, Mysterio, Kraven the Hunter, Sandman, and Hydro-Man) are forced into the employ of New York's fascist mayor, Mayor Waters, via microchips placed inside them that would detonate if they attempted to leave the city. If they succeeded in killing Spider-Man, they would be given their freedom.\n\nSpider-Man Adventures magazine\nIn the Spider-Man Adventures magazine, a version of the Sinister Six appears, formed by Doctor Doom. The team consists of Doctor Octopus, Vulture, Electro, Rhino, Sandman, and Venom (Eddie Brock). They appear in a multi-part storyline with Spider-Man fighting each member in a different time period. In the final part, the Sinister Six and Doctor Doom fight Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four, and are all defeated, though Vulture goes into the Baxter Building and tries to steal some gold statues, only to be pummeled by the heroes.\n\nSpider-Verse\nDuring the Spider-Verse storyline, a version of the Sinister Six called the Six Men of Sinestry resides on Earth-803, where it is set in Industrial Age New York in 1895. The team is led by the Green Goblin and composed of Doctor Octopus, Electro, Kraven the Hunter, Mysterio, and the Vulture. Their objective is to steal the Mayor's plans. They battle Lady Spider and are forced to retreat after they are overwhelmed, yet they are able to accomplish their task. The Six Men of Sinestry appear once more, attacking Lady Spider and Spider-Man 2099 when they are fixing up Leopardon, but are beaten by the two spiders (with Lady Spider exclaiming in passing that Sinestry is not a real word). Spider-Man 2099 would later exclaim that their technology was first class despite the era's limitations.\n\nSwinester Six\nIn the Spider-Ham 25th Anniversary Special, Peter Porker, a.k.a Spider-Ham, faces the Swinester Six. The group consists of Green Gobbler, Doctor Octopuss, Sandmanatee, Eelectro, Buzzard, and Mysteriape.\n\nUltimate Marvel\nThe Sinister Six's Ultimate Marvel version is an Ultimate Six consisting of Sandman, Doctor Octopus, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, and the Green Goblin. The group goes up against Nick Fury and the Ultimates after the villains escape a S.H.I.E.L.D prison they were held in after each had been defeated by Spider-Man and arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D for illegally altering their own genetic codes. Spider-Man temporarily becomes the sixth member as he believes that Aunt May had been kidnapped, but is informed by Captain America that his aunt was safe in S.H.I.E.L.D custody. Spider-Man then turns on the Ultimate Six and helps the Ultimates defeat them, with Iron Man defeating Sandman, Wasp defeating Doctor Octopus, and Thor defeating Electro and Kraven as the Ultimates help Spider-Man defeat Green Goblin.\n\nUltimate Universe\nDuring the \"Ultimate Invasion\" storyline, the Maker travels to Earth-6160 and remakes it into his own image, creating a new world order. With his criminal empire and loyalist rule over New York being threatened by the emergence of vigilantes Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, the local Shadow Governor and Kingpin of Manhattan, Wilson Fisk, has his assistant James Wesley bring together five of his best and most dangerous lieutenants to a meeting in Fisk Tower, discussing on how to eliminate this threat. It is established that each one of them controls a section of New York, with Mister Negative running Queens with the Demons Gang while operating as F.E.A.S.T Foundation's CEO Martin Li during the day, Walter Hardy running the Bronx after retiring from the burglar business where he operated as the Black Cat, having a daughter and using his consolidated wealth and power to control his territory, Sergei Kravinoff being a billionaire oligarch excommunicated with his family from Russia during the \"Rasputin Purge\" and now prowling Staten Island as a hunter, Mysterio running Brooklyn and little to no information is known about him, and the Mole Man being considered the Kingpin's oldest ally and running the \"Underground\" of New York City. They meet with Fisk to come up with a plan against the vigilantes. When asked if they should catch them or kill them by Sergei, Fisk states that they should make a game of it.\n\nIn other media\nIn December 2013, Sony announced two spin-offs of The Amazing Spider-Man franchise, The Sinister Six and Venom, with Drew Goddard attached to write and direct the former. Throughout the live-action film The Amazing Spider-Man 2, a line-up for the team was teased. During the end credits, weapons and technology belonging to the Rhino, the Vulture, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, and Kraven the Hunter were revealed, confirming them as members, with the Green Goblin serving as the leader. However, this line-up is left to be debated as Goddard stated he wanted to adopt a more classic adaptation of the group which would have included Sandman and Doc Ock as the leader. The film was said to be a redemption story for the characters, and would probably not feature Spider-Man. As the Sinister Six's original goal, however, was to kill him, there would seem to be a chance that he would appear. The film was originally scheduled for release on November 11, 2016, but following the announcement in February 2015 of a new Spider-Man franchise with Marvel Studios, the spin-offs were postponed and eventually canceled.\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\nIn an email from Amy Pascal leaked during the Sony Pictures hack, Pascal revealed that she planned for Tom Holland's Spider-Man to appear in a Sinister Six film set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe dependent on the success of the then-upcoming licensing agreement with Marvel Studios.\n\nSony's Spider-Man Universe\nFollowing the collaboration between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures, many spin-offs that had been in development before were revived, with the first of these, the live-action film Venom, being released on October 5, 2018.

weapon used to punish and shame dissenters by driving them from their jobs and demanding submission He was subsequently criticized as being hypocritical for having attempted to cancel a number of people and companies in the past himself [56] Trump made similar claims during the 2020 Republican National Convention when he stated that the goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live

In 2010, he formally requested his Austrian citizenship certificate, thus holding citizenships of both Austria and Germany. Waltz considers his Austrian citizenship a matter of course, stating, \"I was born in Vienna, grew up in Vienna, went to school in Vienna, graduated in Vienna, studied in Vienna, started acting in Vienna — and there would be a few further Viennese links. How much more Austrian do you want it?\" In 2020, Waltz received American citizenship by naturalization, citing his long-term residence in Los Angeles since 2010 and his commitment to the principle of \"no taxation without representation.\"\n\n**Filmography**\n\nSelected filmography:\n\n* \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009)\n* \"Django Unchained\" (2012)\n* \"Spectre\" (2015)\n* \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" (2016)\n* \"Carnage\" (2011)\n* \"The Zero Theorem\" (2013)\n* \"Big Eyes\" (2014)\n* \"The Paris Opera\" (2015)\n* \"Olympus Has Fallen\" (2013)\n* \"Red 2\" (2013)\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of Austrian actors\n* List of German actors\n* List of actors with multiple citizenships\n* List of award winners of the Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor\n\n**Notes**\n\nChristoph Waltz is known for his distinctive voice and acting style, which has been praised by critics and audiences alike.

Is Better Than Home Alone', argued that the film was \"a sequel that effectively also functions as a remake, a film that recognises the greatness of what came before and wisely hews as close to that winning formula as possible.\" Nugent also opined that \"by setting the final showdown in a house undergoing renovations, the filmmakers give themselves room to be more ambitious, wild, and far more brutal\" and praised the work of stunt coordinator Freddie Hice since no CGI was used [53] Also writing in 2022, Reid Goldberg of Collider noted: \"A significant part of the film's appeal.. is that it's unapologetic in taking everything they loved about the first film to a higher level.\" [54]\n\n\nOther media\nA third film with a new cast, Home Alone 3, followed in 1997 Two television movies,

because they incorrectly believe that Nightmare Productions controls the Journey name and mark\" to \"hold the Journey name hostage and set themselves up with a guaranteed income stream after they stop performing.\" Valory and Smith contested the firings, with the support of Perry and former manager Herbie Herbert Court filings revealed that Perry had been paid as a member of the band for years despite not performing In an open letter dated that same day, Schon and Cain stated Smith and Valory \"are no longer members of Journey, and that Schon and Cain have lost confidence in both of them and are not willing to perform with them again.\" [126] [127] Valory countersued Schon and Cain, among other things, for their partnership's claim of owning the Journey trademark and service mark (collectively known as the mark), when that partnership, Elmo Partners, was only the licensee of the mark from 1985 to 1994, when the license was terminated by Herbie Herbert of Nightmare Productions, owners of the mark and name Valory also sought protection against Schon from using any similarities of the Journey mark and name for his side project, Neal Schon – Journey Through Time [128] On April

greatest-hits albums, selling over 15 million copies and continuing to sell half a million to a million copies per year The compilation spent 750 weeks on the Billboard album charts until 2008 [61] [62]\n\n\n1995–1997: Reunion and Trial by Fire\nPerry made the decision to reunite with Journey under the condition that Herbie Herbert would no longer be the band's manager The band hired Irving Azoff, longtime Eagles manager, as the new manager for the band in October 1995 Steve Smith and Ross Valory reunited with Journey and the band started writing material for their next album, with rehearsals beginning that same month [69]\n\n\n1998–2007: Lead singer and drummer replaced, Arrival and Generations\nFollowing the reunion album's release, the band was becoming restless waiting for an answer from Perry regarding touring Following a phone call between Cain and Perry, the latter announced that he would be departing from Journey, releasing himself from the band's contracts and making the decision to semiretire from the music business, disappearing from the public eye again Steve Smith later exited the band, citing that Journey would not be the same without Perry, and returning to his jazz career and his project Vital Information [78]\n\n\n2007–2019: Lead singer replaced with Arnel Pineda, Revelation and Eclipse\nFollowing Soto's departure, the band was again without a lead vocalist Neal Schon began searching YouTube for a new lead vocalist, with Jeremey Hunsicker of the Journey tribute band Frontiers auditioning and spending a week with the band writing material [96] [97] Hunsicker claims to have been formally offered the position, but the offer fell through shortly afterwards following tension with Schon [98] One of the tracks co-written with Hunsicker, \"Never Walk Away\", later appeared on the Revelation album Schon later found Filipino singer Arnel Pineda of the cover band The Zoo, covering the song \"Faithfully\" Schon was so impressed that he contacted Pineda to set up two days of auditions, which went well, naming him the official lead vocalist of Journey on December 5, 2007 [99] [100]\n\n\n2020–present: Contested lineup changes, lawsuits, and Freedom\nOn March 3, 2020, Schon and Cain announced that they had fired Smith and Valory and were suing them for an alleged \"attempted corporate coup d'état,\" seeking damages in excess of $10 million The lawsuit alleged Smith and Valory tried to \"assume control of Nightmare Productions because they incorrectly believe that Nightmare Productions controls the Journey name and mark\" to \"hold the Journey name hostage and set themselves up with a guaranteed income stream after they stop performing.\" Valory and Smith contested the firings, with the support of Perry and former manager Herbie Herbert Court filings revealed that Perry had been paid as a member of the band for years despite not performing In an open letter dated that same day, Schon and Cain stated Smith and Valory \"are no longer members of Journey, and that Schon and Cain have lost confidence in both of them and are not willing to perform with them again.\" [126] [127] Valory countersued Schon and Cain, among other things, for their partnership's claim of owning the Journey trademark and service mark (collectively known as the mark), when that partnership, Elmo Partners, was only the licensee of the mark from 1985 to 1994, when the license was terminated by Herbie Herbert of Nightmare Productions, owners of the mark and name Valory also sought protection against Schon from using any similarities of the Journey mark and name for his side project, Neal Schon – Journey Through Time [128] On April 1, 2021 it was announced that an amicable settlement had been reached between Schon/Cain and Valory/Smith [129] In May, Schon and Cain announced that bassist Randy Jackson would once again join the band, replacing Valory, and drummer Narada Michael Walden was announced as an official new member of Journey, replacing Smith [130] [131]\n\n\nMembers\nAs of 2021 [update]:\n\n\nIn popular culture\nOn March 8, 2013, a documentary, Don't Stop Believin': Everyman's Journey, was released The

{"title": "Magic_Johnson", "content": "\nEarly life\nEarvin Johnson Jr was born in Lansing, Michigan, to General Motors assembly worker Earvin Sr and school janitor Christine [20] Johnson, who had six siblings and three half-siblings by his father's previous marriage, [21] [22] [a] was influenced by his parents' strong work ethic His mother spent many hours after work each night cleaning their home and preparing the next day's meals, while his father did janitorial work at a used car lot and collected garbage, all while never missing a day at General Motors Johnson would often help his father on the garbage route, and he was teased by neighborhood children who called him \"Garbage Man\" [24] His mother raised him in the Seventh-day Adventist Church [25] [26]\n\n\nHigh school career\nJohnson was first dubbed \"Magic\" at 15, when he recorded a triple-double of 36 points, 18 rebounds, and 16 assists as a sophomore at Everett [29] After the game, Fred Stabley Jr., a sports writer for the Lansing State Journal, gave him the moniker [33] despite the belief of Johnson's mother, a devout Christian, that the name was sacrilegious [29] In his final high school season, Johnson led Everett to a 27–1 win–loss record while averaging 28.8 points and 16.8 rebounds per game, [29] and took his team to an overtime victory in the state championship game [34] Johnson dedicated the championship victory to his best friend Reggie Chastine, who was killed in a car accident the previous summer [35] He gave Chastine much of the credit for his development as a basketball player and as a person, [36] saying years later, \"I doubted myself back then.\" [37] Johnson and Chastine were almost always together, playing basketball or riding around in Chastine's car [24] Upon learning of Chastine's death, Magic ran from his home, crying uncontrollably [37] Johnson, who finished his high school career with two All-State selections, was considered at the time to be the best high school player ever to come out of Michigan [35] He was also named to the inaugural McDonald's All-American team, which played in the 1977 Capital Classic [38] [39]\n\n\nCollege career\nAlthough Johnson was recruited by several top-ranked colleges such as Indiana and UCLA, he decided to play close to home [40] His college decision came down to Michigan and Michigan State in East Lansing He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when coach Jud Heathcote told him he could play the point guard position The talent already on Michigan State's roster also drew him to the program [41]\n\n\nProfessional career\nJohnson was drafted first overall in 1979 by the Los Angeles Lakers Johnson said that what was \"most amazing\" about joining the Lakers was the chance to play alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, [48] the team's 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m) center who became the leading scorer in NBA history [49] Despite Abdul-Jabbar's dominance, he had failed to win a championship with the Lakers, and Johnson was expected to help them achieve that goal [50] Lakers coach Jack McKinney had the 6-foot-9-inch (2.06 m) rookie Johnson, who some analysts thought should play forward, be a point guard, even though incumbent Norm Nixon was already one of the best in the league [51] [52] Johnson averaged 18.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game for the season, was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Team, and was named an NBA All-Star Game starter [53]\n\n\nRookie season in the NBA (1979–1980)\nJohnson was drafted first overall in 1979 by the Los Angeles Lakers Johnson said that what was \"most amazing\" about joining the Lakers was the chance to play alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, [48] the team's 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m) center who became the leading scorer in NBA history [49] Despite Abdul-Jabbar's dominance, he had failed to win a championship with the Lakers, and Johnson was expected to help them achieve that goal [50] Lakers coach Jack McKinney had the 6-foot-9-inch (2.06 m) rookie Johnson, who some analysts thought should play forward, be a point guard, even though incumbent Norm Nixon was already one of the best in the league [51] [52] Johnson averaged 18.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game for the season, was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Team, and was named an NBA All-Star Game starter [53]\n\n\nUps and downs (1980–1983)\nEarly in the 1980–81 season, Johnson was sidelined after he suffered torn cartilage in his left knee He missed 45 games, [46] and said that his rehabilitation was the \"most down\" he had ever felt [60] Johnson returned before the start of the 1981 playoffs, but the Lakers' then-assistant and future head coach Pat Riley later said Johnson's much-anticipated return made the Lakers a \"divided team\" [61] The 54-win Lakers faced the 40–42 Houston Rockets in the first round of playoffs, [62] [63] where Houston upset the Lakers 2–1 after Johnson airballed a last-second shot in Game 3 [64]\n\n\nBattles against the Celtics (1983–1987)\nPrior to Johnson's fifth season, West—who had become the Lakers general manager—traded Nixon to free Johnson from sharing the ball-handling responsibilities [76] Johnson averaged another double-double season, with 17.6 points, 13.1 assists, and 7.3 rebounds per game [46] The Lakers reached the Finals for the third year in a row, where Johnson's Lakers and Bird's Celtics met for the first time in the postseason [77] The Lakers won the first game, and led by two points in Game 2 with 18 seconds to go, but after a layup by Gerald Henderson, Johnson failed to get a shot off before the final buzzer sounded, and the Lakers lost 124–121 in overtime [77] In Game 3, Johnson responded with 21 assists in a 137–104 win, but he made several crucial errors late in the contest during Game 4 In the final minute of the game, Johnson had the ball stolen by Celtics center Robert Parish, and then missed two free throws that could have won the game The Celtics won Game 4 in overtime, and the teams split the next two games In the decisive Game 7 in Boston, as the Lakers trailed by three points in the final minute, opposing point guard Dennis Johnson stole the ball from Johnson, a play that effectively ended the series [77] Friends Isiah Thomas and Mark Aguirre consoled him that night, talking until the morning in his Boston hotel room amidst fan celebrations on the street [78] [79] During the Finals, Johnson averaged 18.0 points on .560 shooting, 13.6 assists, and 7.7 rebounds per game [80] Johnson later described the series as \"the one championship we should have had but didn't get\" [81]\n\n\nRepeat and falling short (1987–1991)\nBefore the 1987–88 NBA season, Lakers coach Pat Riley publicly promised that they would defend the NBA title, even though no team had won consecutive titles since the Celtics did so in the 1969 NBA Finals [91] Johnson had another productive season with averages of 19.6 points, 11.9 assists, and 6.2 rebounds per game despite missing 10 games with a groin injury [46] In the 1988 playoffs, the Lakers swept the San Antonio Spurs in 3 games, then survived two 4–3 series against the Utah Jazz and Dallas Mavericks to reach the Finals and face Thomas and the Detroit Pistons, [92] who with players such as Bill Laimbeer, John Salley, Vinnie Johnson, and Dennis Rodman were known as the \"Bad Boys\" for their physical style of play [93] Johnson and Thomas greeted each other with a kiss on the cheek before the opening tip of Game 1, which they called a display of brotherly love [79] [94] [95] After the teams split the first six games, Lakers forward and Finals MVP James Worthy had his first career triple-double of 36 points, 16 rebounds, and 10 assists, and led his team to a 108–105 win [96] Despite not being named MVP, Johnson had a strong championship series, averaging 21.1 points on .550 shooting, 13 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game [97] It was the fifth and final NBA championship of his career [98]\n\n\nHIV announcement and Olympics (1991–1992)\nAfter a physical examination before the 1991–92 NBA season, Johnson discovered that he had tested positive for HIV In a press conference held on November 7, 1991, Johnson made a public announcement that he would retire immediately [109] He stated that his wife, Cookie, and their unborn child did not have HIV, and that he would dedicate his life to \"battle this deadly disease\" [109]\n\n\nPost-Olympics and later life\nBefore the 1992–93 NBA season, Johnson announced his intention to stage an NBA comeback After practicing and playing in several pre-season games, he retired again before the start of the regular season, citing controversy over his return sparked by opposition from several active players [34] In an August 2011 interview, Johnson said that in retrospect he wished that he had never retired after being diagnosed with HIV, saying, \"If I knew what I know now, I wouldn't have retired.\" [122] Johnson said that despite the physical, highly competitive practices and scrimmages leading up to the 1992 Olympics, some of those same teammates still expressed concerns about his return to the NBA He said that he retired because he \"didn't want to hurt the game.\" [122]\n\n\nReturn to the Lakers as coach and player (1994, 1996)\nJohnson returned to the NBA as coach for the Lakers near the end of the 1993–94 NBA season, replacing Randy Pfund, and Bill Bertka, who served as an interim coach for two games [126] [127] Johnson, who took the job at the urging of owner Jerry Buss, admitted \"I've always had the desire (to coach) in the back of my mind.\" He insisted that his health was not an issue, while downplaying questions about returning as a player, saying, \"I'm retired Let's leave it at that.\" [128] Amid speculation from general manager Jerry West that he may only coach until the end of the season, [128] Johnson took over a team that had a 28–38 record, and won his first game as head coach, a 110–101 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks [129] He was coaching a team that had five of his former teammates on the roster: Vlade Divac, Elden Campbell, Tony Smith, Kurt Rambis, James Worthy, and Michael Cooper, who was brought in as an assistant coach [128] [130] Johnson, who still had a guaranteed player contract that would pay him $14.6 million during the 1994–95 NBA season, signed a separate contract to coach the team that had no compensation [128] The Lakers played well initially, winning five of their first six games under Johnson, but after losing the next five games, Johnson announced that he was resigning as coach after the season The Lakers finished the season on a ten-game losing streak, and Johnson's final record as a head coach was 5–11 [127] Stating that it was never his dream to coach, he chose instead to purchase a 5% share of the team in June 1994 [29]\n\n\nMagic Johnson All-Stars\nDetermined to play competitive basketball despite being out of the NBA, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team composed of former NBA and college players In 1994, Johnson joined with former pros Mark Aguirre, Reggie Theus, John Long, Earl Cureton, Jim Farmer, and Lester Conner, as his team played games in Australia, Israel, South America, Europe, New Zealand, and Japan They also toured the United States, playing five games against teams from the CBA In the final game of the CBA series, Johnson had 30 points, 17 rebounds, and 13 assists, leading the All-Stars to a 126–121 victory over the Oklahoma City Cavalry [140] By the time he returned to the Lakers in 1996, the Magic Johnson All-Stars had amassed a record of 55–0, and Johnson was earning as much as $365,000 per game [37] Johnson played with the team frequently over the next several years, with possibly the most memorable game occurring in November 2001 At the age of 42, Johnson played with the All-Stars against his alma mater, Michigan State Although he played in a celebrity game to honor coach Jud Heathcoate in 1995, [47] this was Johnson's first meaningful game played in his hometown of Lansing in 22 years Playing in front of a sold-out arena, Johnson had a triple-double and played the entire game, but his all-star team lost to the Spartans by two points Johnson's half-court shot at the buzzer would have won the game, but it fell short [141] [142] On November 1, 2002, Johnson returned to play a second exhibition game against Michigan State Playing with the Canberra Cannons of Australia's National Basketball League instead of his usual group of players, Johnson's team defeated the Spartans 104–85, as he scored 12 points and had 10 assists and 10 rebounds [143]\n\n\nBrief period in Scandinavia\nIn 1999, Johnson joined the Swedish squad M7 Borås (now known as 'Borås Basket'), and was undefeated in five games with the team [144] [145] Johnson also became a co-owner of the club; [146] however, the project failed after one season and the club was forced into reconstruction [146] He later joined the Danish team The Great Danes [146]\n\n\nRivalry with Larry Bird\nJohnson and Bird were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State Spartans squad defeated Bird's Indiana State Sycamores team in the 1979 NCAA finals The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987, with the Lakers winning two out of three Finals Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers–Celtics games Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily box score was the first thing he checked in the morning [116]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn 905 NBA games, Johnson tallied 17,707 points, 6,559 rebounds, and 10,141 assists, translating to career averages of 19.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 11.2 assists per game, the highest assists per game average in NBA history [46] Johnson shares the single-game playoff record for assists (24), [155] holds the Finals record for assists in a game (21), [155] and has the most playoff assists (2,346) [156] He is the only player to average 12 assists in an NBA Finals series, achieving it six times [157] He holds the All-Star Game single-game record for assists (22), and the All-Star Game record for career assists (127) [155]\n\n\nNBA career statistics\nOn February

philanthropist. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, winning five NBA championships, three MVP awards, and being selected to 12 All-Star Games.\n\nEarly life\n\nEarvin Johnson Jr was born in Lansing, Michigan, to General Motors assembly worker Earvin Sr and school janitor Christine Johnson, who had six siblings and three half-siblings by his father's previous marriage. Johnson's parents instilled in him a strong work ethic, with his mother spending many hours after work each night cleaning their home and preparing the next day's meals, while his father did janitorial work at a used car lot and collected garbage. Johnson would often help his father on the garbage route, earning him the nickname \"Garbage Man\" from neighborhood children.\n\nJohnson was raised in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, where his mother was a devout Christian. Despite his parents' strong faith, Johnson was not a devout Christian himself, and his mother later expressed concern about his name being \"Magic,\" which she believed was sacrilegious.\n\nHigh school career\n\nJohnson was first dubbed \"Magic\" at 15, when he recorded a triple-double of 36 points, 18 rebounds, and 16 assists as a sophomore at Everett High School. Fred Stabley Jr, a sports writer for the Lansing State Journal, gave him the moniker after the game. Johnson led Everett to a 27-1 win-loss record in his final high school season, averaging 28.8 points and 16.8 rebounds per game. He took his team to an overtime victory in the state championship game, dedicating the win to his best friend Reggie Chastine, who had been killed in a car accident the previous summer.\n\nJohnson finished his high school career with two All-State selections and was considered the best high school player ever to come out of Michigan. He was also named to the inaugural McDonald's All-American team, which played in the 1977 Capital Classic.\n\nCollege career\n\nJohnson was recruited by several top-ranked colleges, including Indiana and UCLA, but decided to play close to home. He chose Michigan State University, where coach Jud Heathcote told him he could play the point guard position. Johnson's decision was influenced by the talent already on the Michigan State roster, which drew him to the program.\n\nProfessional career\n\nJohnson was drafted first overall in 1979 by the Los Angeles Lakers. He was expected to help the team win a championship, and Lakers coach Jack McKinney had him play point guard, despite some analysts thinking he should play forward. Johnson averaged 18.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game for the season, was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Team, and was named an NBA All-Star Game starter.\n\nRookie season in the NBA (1979-1980)\n\nJohnson's rookie season was marked by his impressive all-around play. He averaged 18.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game, and was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Team. Johnson's play was instrumental in the Lakers' 52-win season, and he was named an NBA All-Star Game starter.\n\nUps and downs (1980-1983)\n\nEarly in the 1980-81 season, Johnson suffered torn cartilage in his left knee, which sidelined him for 45 games. Johnson said that his rehabilitation was the \"most down\" he had ever felt. He returned before the start of the 1981 playoffs, but the Lakers were upset by the Houston Rockets in the first round.\n\nBattles against the Celtics (1983-1987)\n\nPrior to Johnson's fifth season, Lakers general manager Jerry West traded Norm Nixon to free Johnson from sharing the ball-handling responsibilities. Johnson averaged another double-double season, with 17.6 points, 13.1 assists, and 7.3 rebounds per game. The Lakers reached the Finals for the third year in a row, where Johnson's Lakers and Larry Bird's Celtics met for the first time in the postseason.\n\nJohnson's Lakers won the first game, but lost the next three games. In Game 7, opposing point guard Dennis Johnson stole the ball from Johnson, effectively ending the series. Johnson averaged 18.0 points on .560 shooting, 13.6 assists, and 7.7 rebounds per game in the series.\n\nRepeat and falling short (1987-1991)\n\nBefore the 1987-88 season, Lakers coach Pat Riley promised that they would defend the NBA title. Johnson had another productive season, with averages of 19.6 points, 11.9 assists, and 6.2 rebounds per game. The Lakers swept the San Antonio Spurs in 3 games, then survived two 4-3 series against the Utah Jazz and Dallas Mavericks to reach the Finals and face Larry Bird and the Detroit Pistons.\n\nJohnson and Bird greeted each other with a kiss on the cheek before the opening tip of Game 1, which they called a display of brotherly love. After the teams split the first six games, Lakers forward James Worthy had his first career triple-double of 36 points, 16 rebounds, and 10 assists, and led his team to a 108-105 win. Johnson had a strong championship series, averaging 21.1 points on .550 shooting, 13 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game.\n\nHIV announcement and Olympics (1991-1992)\n\nAfter a physical examination before the 1991-92 season, Johnson discovered that he had tested positive for HIV. In a press conference held on November 7, 1991, Johnson made a public announcement that he would retire immediately. He stated that his wife, Cookie, and their unborn child did not have HIV, and that he would dedicate his life to \"battle this deadly disease.\"\n\nPost-Olympics and later life\n\nBefore the 1992-93 season, Johnson announced his intention to stage an NBA comeback. After practicing and playing in several pre-season games, he retired again before the start of the regular season, citing controversy over his return sparked by opposition from several active players. Johnson said that despite the physical, highly competitive practices and scrimmages leading up to the 1992 Olympics, some of those same teammates still expressed concerns about his return to the NBA.\n\nReturn to the Lakers as coach and player (1994, 1996)\n\nJohnson returned to the NBA as coach for the Lakers near the end of the 1993-94 season, replacing Randy Pfund. He took over a team that had a 28-38 record, and won his first game as head coach, a 110-101 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. Johnson played well initially, winning five of his first six games as coach, but after losing the next five games, he announced that he was resigning as coach after the season.\n\nMagic Johnson All-Stars\n\nDetermined to play competitive basketball despite being out of the NBA, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team composed of former NBA and college players. The team played games in Australia, Israel, South America, Europe, New Zealand, and Japan, and also toured the United States, playing five games against teams from the CBA. Johnson played with the team frequently over the next several years, and possibly the most memorable game occurred in November 2001, when he played with the All-Stars against his alma mater, Michigan State.\n\nLegacy\n\nJohnson's legacy extends far beyond his playing career. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, and his influence on the game continues to be felt today. Johnson's five NBA championships, three MVP awards, and 12 All-Star Game appearances are just a few of his many accomplishments.\n\nJohnson's humanitarian work is also noteworthy. He has been involved in various charitable initiatives throughout his career, including the Magic Johnson Foundation, which was established in 1991 to support education and health initiatives. Johnson has also been an outspoken advocate for HIV/AIDS awareness and research.\n\nJohnson's business ventures have also been successful. He has been involved in various business partnerships and investments, including a stake in the Los Angeles Dodgers. Johnson has also been a successful entrepreneur, with a range of business interests in the entertainment and sports industries.\n\nIn 2012, Johnson was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the game. Johnson's induction was a testament to his enduring legacy and influence on the game of basketball.\n\nTeam ownership\n\nJohnson has also been involved in team ownership, with a stake in the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team. In 2012, Johnson's ownership group, which also includes movie executive Peter Guber, paid $2 billion for the Dodgers. Johnson is considered the face of the ownership group, while the controlling owner is Mark Walter.\n\nPolitics and activism\n\nJohnson has also been involved in politics and activism, with a focus on issues related to education and healthcare. In 2006, Johnson publicly endorsed Phil Angelides for Governor of California. Johnson has also been an outspoken supporter of Hillary Clinton, and has endorsed her in two presidential campaigns.\n\nHIV activism\n\nJohnson has also been an outspoken advocate for HIV/AIDS awareness and research. In 1991, Johnson announced that he had tested positive for HIV, and has since dedicated his life to raising awareness and funds for HIV/AIDS research. Johnson has worked with various organizations to promote HIV/AIDS awareness and has also been involved in various fundraising efforts to support HIV/AIDS research.\n\nIn conclusion, Magic Johnson is a true basketball legend and a shining example of what it means to be a champion on and off the court. His legacy extends far beyond his playing career, and he continues to be an inspiration to people around the world.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about

street [78] [79] During the Finals, Johnson averaged 18.0 points on .560 shooting, 13.6 assists, and 7.7 rebounds per game [80] Johnson later described the series as \"the one championship we should have had but didn't get\" [81]\n\n\nRepeat and falling short (1987–1991)\nBefore the 1987–88 NBA season, Lakers coach Pat Riley publicly promised that they would defend the NBA title, even though no team had won consecutive titles since the Celtics did so in the 1969 NBA Finals [91] Johnson had another productive season with averages of 19.6 points, 11.9 assists, and 6.2 rebounds per game despite missing 10 games with a groin injury [46] In the 1988 playoffs, the Lakers swept the San Antonio Spurs in 3 games, then survived two 4–3 series against the Utah Jazz and Dallas Mavericks to reach the Finals and face Thomas and the Detroit Pistons, [92] who with players such as Bill Laimbeer, John Salley, Vinnie Johnson, and Dennis Rodman were known as the \"Bad Boys\" for their physical style of play [93] Johnson and Thomas greeted each other with a kiss on the cheek before the opening tip of Game 1, which they called a display of brotherly love [79] [94] [95] After the teams split the first six games, Lakers forward and Finals MVP James Worthy had his first career triple-double of 36 points, 16 rebounds, and 10 assists, and led his team to a 108–105 win [96] Despite not being named MVP, Johnson had a strong championship series, averaging 21.1 points on .550 shooting, 13 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game [97] It was the fifth and final NBA championship of his career [98]\n\n\nHIV announcement and Olympics (1991–1992)\nAfter a physical examination before the 1991–92 NBA season, Johnson discovered that he had tested positive for HIV In a press conference held on November 7, 1991, Johnson made a public announcement that he would retire immediately [109] He stated that his wife, Cookie, and their unborn child did not have HIV, and that he would dedicate his life to \"battle this deadly disease\" [109]\n\n\nPost-Olympics and later life\nBefore the 1992–93 NBA season, Johnson announced his intention to stage an NBA comeback After practicing and playing in several pre-season games, he retired again before the start of the regular season, citing controversy over his return sparked by opposition from several active players [34] In an August 2011 interview, Johnson said that in retrospect he wished that he had never retired after being diagnosed with HIV, saying, \"If I knew what I know now, I wouldn't have retired.\" [122] Johnson said that despite the physical, highly competitive practices and scrimmages leading up to the 1992 Olympics, some of those same teammates still expressed concerns about his return to the NBA He said that he retired because he \"didn't want to hurt the game.\" [122]\n\n\nReturn to the Lakers as coach and player (1994, 1996)\nJohnson returned to the NBA as coach for the Lakers near the end of the 1993–94 NBA season, replacing Randy Pfund, and Bill Bertka, who served as an interim coach for two games [126] [127] Johnson, who took the job at the urging of owner Jerry Buss, admitted \"I've always had the desire (to coach) in the back of my mind.\" He insisted that his health was not an issue, while downplaying questions about returning as a player, saying, \"I'm retired Let's leave it at that.\" [128] Amid speculation from general manager Jerry West that he may only coach until the end of the season, [128] Johnson took over a team that had a 28–38 record, and won his first game as head coach, a 110–101 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks [129] He was coaching a team that had five of his former teammates on the roster: Vlade Divac, Elden Campbell, Tony Smith, Kurt Rambis, James Worthy, and Michael Cooper, who was brought in as an assistant coach [128] [130] Johnson, who still had a guaranteed player contract that would pay him $14.6 million during the 1994–95 NBA season, signed a separate contract to coach the team that had no compensation [128] The Lakers played well initially, winning five of their first six games under Johnson, but after losing the next five games, Johnson announced that he was resigning as coach after the season The Lakers finished the season on a ten-game losing streak, and Johnson's final record as a head coach was 5–11 [127] Stating that it was never his dream to coach, he chose instead to purchase a 5% share of the team in June 1994 [29]\n\n\nMagic Johnson All-Stars\nDetermined to play competitive basketball despite being out of the NBA, Johnson formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team composed of former NBA and college players In 1994, Johnson joined with former pros Mark Aguirre, Reggie Theus, John Long, Earl Cureton, Jim Farmer, and Lester Conner, as his team played games in Australia, Israel, South America, Europe, New Zealand, and Japan They also toured the United States, playing five games against teams from the CBA In the final game of the CBA series, Johnson had 30 points, 17 rebounds, and 13 assists, leading the All-Stars to a 126–121 victory over the Oklahoma City Cavalry [140] By the time he returned to the Lakers in 1996, the Magic Johnson All-Stars had amassed a record of 55–0, and Johnson was earning as much as $365,000 per game [37] Johnson played with the team frequently over the next several years, with possibly the most memorable game occurring in November 2001 At the age of 42, Johnson played with the All-Stars against his alma mater, Michigan State Although he played in a celebrity game to honor coach Jud Heathcoate in 1995, [47] this was Johnson's first meaningful game played in his hometown of Lansing in 22 years Playing in front of a sold-out arena, Johnson had a triple-double and played the entire game, but his all-star team lost to the Spartans by two points Johnson's half-court shot at the buzzer would have won the game, but it fell short [141] [142] On November 1, 2002, Johnson returned to play a second exhibition game against Michigan State Playing with the Canberra Cannons of Australia's National Basketball League instead of his usual group of players, Johnson's team defeated the Spartans 104–85, as he scored 12 points and had 10 assists and 10 rebounds [143]\n\n\nBrief period in Scandinavia\nIn 1999, Johnson joined the Swedish squad M7 Borås (now known as 'Borås Basket'), and was undefeated in five games with the team [144] [145] Johnson also became a co-owner of the club; [146] however, the project failed after one season and the club was forced into reconstruction [146] He later joined the Danish team The Great Danes [146]\n\n\nRivalry with Larry Bird\nJohnson and Bird were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State Spartans squad defeated Bird's Indiana State Sycamores team in the 1979 NCAA finals The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987, with the Lakers winning two out of three Finals Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers–Celtics games Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily box score was the first thing he checked in the morning [116]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn 905 NBA games, Johnson tallied 17,707 points, 6,559 rebounds, and 10,141 assists, translating to career averages of 19.5 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 11.2 assists per game, the highest assists per game average in NBA history [46] Johnson shares the single-game playoff record for assists (24), [155] holds the Finals record for assists in a game (21), [155] and has the most playoff assists (2,346) [156] He is the only player to average 12 assists in an NBA Finals series, achieving it six times [157] He holds the All-Star Game single-game record for assists (22), and the All-Star Game record for career assists (127) [155]\n\n\nNBA career statistics\nOn February

spent five hours visiting Buss at the hospital just a few months before his 2013 death from cancer Speaking to media just hours after Buss had died, Johnson was emotional, saying, \"Without Dr Jerry Buss, there is no Magic.\" [215] Buss acquired the team from Jack Kent Cooke in 1979, shortly before he drafted Johnson with the #1 pick in the 1979 NBA draft Buss took a special interest in Johnson,

The below list shows the top 12 players with the most ranking points acquired during the 2023‍–‍24 season, as of after the World Open who qualified for the event [4]\n\n\nSummary\nThe first-round matches were played on 1 and 2 April [2] World number three and the 2020 runner-up [7] Mark Allen and John Higgins, runner-up in 2022, [8] contested the opening match of the first round Previously in the 2023‍–‍24 season, Allen had defeated Higgins 6‍–‍2 in the semi-final of the 2023 Champion of Champions [9] and 6‍–‍5 in the first round of the 2024 Masters [10] But Higgins claimed victory twice in February, winning 5‍–‍2 both times at the 2024 German Masters and the 2024 Welsh Open [11] Allen took the first frame with a 69 break, but Higgins won four frames in a row, making breaks of 85, 75, 55, and 66 to lead 4‍–‍1 Allen responded with a century break of 123, and won two more frames to even the match at 4‍–‍4 at the end of the session [12] The first four frames in the second session were shared, with Allen winning the 11th frame on the last black ball, and the scores were level at 6‍–‍6 at the mid-session interval Allen pulled ahead with a 102 break in frame 13, and went on to take the 14th frame after a safety battle on the last pink ball Higgins made a break of 86 to trail 7‍–‍8, but Allen won the 16th frame with a 93 break to recover a two frame advantage Higgins only made a break of 20 early in frame 17, and made an error on a safety shot, allowing Allen to produce a 100 break to claim a 10‍–‍7 victory [13] [14] Allen commented: \"I'm very proud to have matched him  [Higgins] in the safety department and scored better as the match went on.\" He attributed the win to working with psychologist Paul Gaffney, saying: \"It has focussed my mind on just playing the next shot and the next frame as well as I can My decision-making is more measured Sometimes it's better to be patient and wait for a better chance.\" [11] Higgins praised Allen's performance, while criticising his own: \"I missed two or three unforgivable balls tonight My long game was non-existent, and at this level it's not good enough against the best players.\" [11] He hinted towards retiring, adding: \"I just need to dust myself down a couple of weeks before the worlds  [World Championship], try to get some good practice in and go there and give it a final go maybe.\" [15] [16]\n\n\nFirst round\nThe first-round matches were played on 1 and 2 April [2] World number three and the 2020 runner-up [7] Mark Allen and John Higgins, runner-up in 2022, [8] contested the opening

Carter in the first quarter-final Their three meetings previously in the season all ended in victory for O'Sullivan, including 6‍–‍3 at the 2023 Shanghai Masters, [28] 6‍–‍4 at the 2023 International Championship, [29] and 10‍–‍7 in the final of the 2024 Masters, where O'Sullivan claimed his record-extending eighth Masters title [30] O'Sullivan made breaks of 77, 87, and 54 as he led 4‍–‍0 at the mid-session interval He moved ahead to 7‍–‍0 with breaks of 51, 81, and 92 Carter made a total clearance of 141 in the eighth frame to win his first frame of the match, trailing 1‍–‍7 at the end of the first session [31] Carter won another frame with a 70 break after play resumed, narrowing his deficit to 2‍–‍7 However, breaks of 62, 54, and 67 saw O'Sullivan secure the match 10‍–‍2 [32] [33] O'Sullivan, who had withdrawn from the Welsh Open in February citing mental health reasons, commented on the difficulties he had faced that prompted him to work with Steve Peters, his psychiatrist, saying: \"It's been a hard year, drove myself pretty much insane really It's just got to me I had to go back to basics and get my head right  [I had to] deal with it because doing it the other way round isn't working Just getting my head around it is the only option I have left I've driven myself mad for the last two years and not enjoyed any of it.\" [34] [35]\n\n\nSemi-finals\nO'Sullivan played Wilson in the first semi-final on 5 April [2] O'Sullivan was contesting his 92nd career ranking semi-final, and Wilson his tenth [50] O'Sullivan had previously defeated Wilson 5‍–‍1 in the quarter-final of the World Grand Prix earlier in the season [51] Wilson won the first two frames, but O'Sullivan made a break of 102 in the third frame and won the fourth to draw level at the mid-session interval He went on to take a 3‍–‍2 lead with a break of 110 in frame five In the sixth frame, Wilson was trailing 40‍–‍57 when he potted a red which was touching the pink The referee Paul Collier called foul on Wilson, believing that the cue ball had contacted the pink first [52] Wilson accepted the decision after a brief discussion, but slow motion replay later showed that the cue ball had actually hit the red first, and was not a foul shot [53] The frame went to O'Sullivan, who then led 4‍–‍2 Wilson produced breaks of 83 and 84 to end the session with the scores level at 4‍–‍4 [50] Wilson took the opening frame of the second session, but O'Sullivan capitalised on Wilson's multiple errors to win three frames in a row and lead 7‍–‍5 Breaks of 82 and 96 from Wilson evened the scores again to 7‍–‍7 However, O'Sullivan made breaks of 97 and 129 to win three consecutive frames in only 33 minutes, and capture a 10‍–‍7 victory to reach his 64th career ranking final [54] [55] O'Sullivan praised his opponent after the match, saying: \"I really rate Gary  [Wilson] We have become good friends He's an honest bloke, the way he is in interviews, he's the same in real life He's a great lad and it's great to see him winning tournaments He loves the game so much and gets frustrated by it sometimes, a bit like me But he's learning now that you can't always play well, you need the patience to give yourself a chance.\" [54] He also revealed that he's been suffering from \"the yips\" and has tried to change his mindset: \"That's not a nice place to be, so I've got nothing left to do other than to try to get myself mentally out of it and hopefully my game will start to flow again, maybe.\" [56] [57]\n\n\nFinal\nA total of 27 century breaks were made in the tournament [77]

World number three and the 2020 runner-up Mark Allen and John Higgins, runner-up in 2022, contested the opening match of the first round. Previously in the 2023-24 season, Allen had defeated Higgins 6-2 in the semi-final of the 2023 Champion of Champions and 6-5 in the first round of the 2024 Masters. But Higgins claimed victory twice in February, winning 5-2 both times at the 2024 German Masters and the 2024 Welsh Open. Allen took the first frame with a 69 break, but Higgins won four frames in a row, making breaks of 85, 75, 55, and 66 to lead 4-1. Allen responded with a century break of 123, and won two more frames to even the match at 4-4 at the end of the session. The first four frames in the second session were shared, with Allen winning the 11th frame on the last black ball, and the scores were level at 6-6 at the mid-session interval. Allen pulled ahead with a 102 break in frame 13, and went on to take the 14th frame after a safety battle on the last pink ball. Higgins made a break of 86 to trail 7-8, but Allen won the 16th frame with a 93 break to recover a two-frame advantage. Higgins only made a break of 20 early in frame 17, and made an error on a safety shot, allowing Allen to produce a 100 break to claim a 10-7 victory.\n\n**Quarter-Finals**\n\nThe quarter-finals were played on 3 and 4 April. World number one Ronnie O'Sullivan, the 2019 champion and runner-up in 2021, played Carter in the first quarter-final. Their three meetings previously in the season all ended in victory for O'Sullivan, including 6-3 at the 2023 Shanghai Masters, 6-4 at the 2023 International Championship, and 10-7 in the final of the 2024 Masters, where O'Sullivan claimed his record-extending eighth Masters title. O'Sullivan made breaks of 77, 87, and 54 as he led 4-0 at the mid-session interval. He moved ahead to 7-0 with breaks of 51, 81, and 92. Carter made a total clearance of 141 in the eighth frame to win his first frame of the match, trailing 1-7 at the end of the first session. Carter won another frame with a 70 break after play resumed, narrowing his deficit to 2-7. However, breaks of 62, 54, and 67 saw O'Sullivan secure the match 10-2. O'Sullivan, who had withdrawn from the Welsh Open in February citing mental health reasons, commented on the difficulties he had faced that prompted him to work with Steve Peters, his psychiatrist, saying: \"It's been a hard year, drove myself pretty much insane really. It's just got to me. I had to go back to basics and get my head right. I had to deal with it because doing it the other way round isn't working. Just getting my head around it is the only option I have left. I've driven myself mad for the last two years and not enjoyed any of it.\"\n\n**Semi-Finals**\n\nO'Sullivan played Wilson in the first semi-final on 5 April. O'Sullivan was contesting his 92nd career ranking semi-final, and Wilson his tenth. O'Sullivan had previously defeated Wilson 5-1 in the quarter-final of the World Grand Prix earlier in the season. Wilson won the first two frames, but O'Sullivan made a break of 102 in the third frame and won the fourth to draw level at the mid-session interval. He went on to take a 3-2 lead with a break of 110 in frame five. In the sixth frame, Wilson was trailing 40-57 when he potted a red which was touching the pink. The referee Paul Collier called foul on Wilson, believing that the cue ball had contacted the pink first. Wilson accepted the decision after a brief discussion, but slow motion replay later showed that the cue ball had actually hit the red first, and was not a foul shot. The frame went to O'Sullivan, who then led 4-2. Wilson produced breaks of 83 and 84 to end the session with the scores level at 4-4. Wilson took the opening frame of the second session, but O'Sullivan capitalised on Wilson's multiple errors to win three frames in a row and lead 7-5. Breaks of 82 and 96 from Wilson evened the scores again to 7-7. However, O'Sullivan made breaks of 97 and 129 to win three consecutive frames in only 33 minutes, and capture a 10-7 victory to reach his 64th career ranking final.\n\n**Final**\n\nThe final was played on 7 April between O'Sullivan and Allen. O'Sullivan won the first frame with a break of 71, but Allen responded with a century break of 121 to level the match at 1-1. The scores remained level at 3-3 after the first session. In the second session, O'Sullivan made breaks of 87 and 83 to take a 5-3 lead. Allen pulled back with breaks of 114 and 67 to level the match at 5-5. However, O'Sullivan made breaks of 81 and 90 to take a 7-5 lead. Allen responded with a break of 67, but O'Sullivan made a further break of 91 to win the match 10-5 and claim the title.\n\n**Century Breaks**\n\nA total of 27 century breaks were made in the

The vacant title was a result of former champion Khabib Nurmagomedov's retirement, which he announced immediately after defending his title at UFC 254 last October. Nurmagomedov cited his father's death from complications related to COVID-19 in July as the main reason behind his retirement.\n\nDespite his announcement, the title was never officially vacated as UFC President Dana White said several times that he believed Nurmagomedov would still fight again. However, White finally conceded on March 19, confirming Nurmagomedov's retirement.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe event featured a total of 12 fights, with the following results:\n\n* **Preliminary Card**\n\t+ David Teymur def.

He tested positive for hydrochlorothiazide, a banned diuretic, in an out-of-competition urine sample in May 2021. Following notification of his positive test, Bontorin provided open containers of two dietary supplements he obtained from a Brazilian compounding pharmacy that he was using prior to his positive test for analysis by a WADA-accredited laboratory. Although no prohibited substances were listed on the supplement product labels, the analysis revealed the presence of HCTZ in the products.

abusive towards his mother and unloving towards him Chapman began to fantasize about having God-like power over a group of imaginary \"little people\" who lived in the walls of his bedroom \n\n\nMurder of John Lennon\nChapman allegedly started planning to kill Lennon three months prior to the murder A longtime fan of Lennon's former band the Beatles, Chapman turned against Lennon due to a religious conversion and Lennon's highly publicized 1966 remark about the Beatles being \"more popular than Jesus.\" [17] Some members of Chapman's prayer group made a joke in reference to Lennon's song \"Imagine\": \"It went, 'Imagine, imagine if John Lennon was dead.'\" [13] One of Chapman's childhood friends, Miles McManushe, recalled that Chapman said that the song was \"communist.\"

\"communist.\" [17]\n\n\nOctober–December 1980\nChapman went to New York City in late October 1980 intending to kill Lennon, but left to obtain ammunition from his unwitting friend Dana Reeves in Atlanta before returning in November [15] While in New York, Chapman was inspired by the film Ordinary People to stop his plans He returned to Hawaii and told his wife Gloria that he had been obsessed with killing Lennon, showing her the gun and bullets; Gloria did not inform the police or mental health services [13] Chapman later said that the commandment \"thou shalt not kill\" flashed on the television at him and was on a wall hanging that his wife put up in their apartment [2] He made an appointment to see a clinical psychologist, but he did not keep it and flew back to New York on December 6, 1980 [13] At one point, he considered ending his life by jumping from the Statue of Liberty [25]\n\n\nLegal process\nChapman was formally charged with second-degree murder which was the most serious murder charge in New York State law for killing a non-law officer He confessed to police that he had used hollow-point bullets \"to ensure Lennon's death.\" [33] Chapman's wife had known of her husband's preparations for killing Lennon, but took no action because Chapman did not follow through at the time; she did not face any charges [34] Chapman later said that he harbored a \"deep-seated resentment\" toward his wife, \"that she didn't go to somebody, even the police, and say, 'Look, my husband's bought a gun and he says he's going to kill John Lennon.'\" [35]\n\n\nMental state assessment\nMore than a dozen psychologists and psychiatrists interviewed Chapman in the six months prior to his trial—three for the prosecution, six for the defense, and several more on behalf of the court—and they conducted a battery of standard diagnostic procedures and more than 200 hours of clinical interviews All six defense experts concluded that Chapman was psychotic; five diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia, while the sixth felt that his symptoms were more consistent with manic depression The three prosecution experts declared that his delusions fell short of psychosis and instead diagnosed various personality disorders The court-appointed experts concurred with the prosecution's examiners that he was delusional yet competent to stand trial In the examinations, Chapman was more cooperative with the prosecution's mental health experts than with those for the defense; one psychiatrist conjectured that he did not wish to be considered \"crazy\" and was persuaded that the defense experts declared him insane only because they were hired to do so [1]\n\n\nGuilty plea\nChapman's court-appointed lawyer, Herbert Adlerberg, withdrew from the case amid threats of lynching Police feared that Lennon fans might storm the hospital, so they transferred Chapman to Rikers Island for his personal safety [36]\n\n\nSentencing hearing\nThe sentencing hearing took place on August 24, 1981, in a crowded courtroom Two experts gave evidence on Chapman's behalf Judge Edwards interrupted Dorothy Lewis, a research psychiatrist who was relatively inexperienced in the courtroom,

did not appear reasonable or explicable, and she implied that the judge did not want to allow an independent competency assessment [41] The district attorney argued that Chapman committed the murder

to do with his life:\n\n\nImprisonment\nIn 1981, Chapman was imprisoned at Attica Correctional Facility outside of Buffalo, New York He fasted for twenty-six days in February 1982, so the New York State Supreme Court authorized the state to force-feed him Central New York Psychiatric Center director Martin Von Holden said that Chapman refused to eat with other inmates but agreed to take liquid nutrients [43] He was held in a solitary confinement unit for violent and at-risk prisoners, in part due to concern that he might be harmed by Lennon's fans in the general population There were 105

years, James R Gaines interviewed him and wrote a three-part, 18,000-word People magazine series starting in 1981 and climaxing in February and March 1987 [1] [49] [50] Chapman subsequently told the

thirteen times Before his first parole hearing, Yoko Ono sent a letter to the board requesting that Chapman should stay behind bars and serve out the remainder of his life sentence [54] [55] In

television personality, journalist, and former Olympic athlete. She is best known for winning the 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon and for her subsequent transition from male to female.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nCaitlyn Marie Jenner was born on October 28, 1949, in Mount Kisco, New York, as William Bruce Jenner. Her parents are Esther Ruth (née McGuire) and William Hugh Jenner. Bruce's younger brother, Burt, was killed in a car accident in Canton, Connecticut, on November 30, 1976, shortly after Bruce's success at the Olympic Games. As a child, Bruce was diagnosed with dyslexia.\n\n**Education**\n\nBruce attended Sleepy Hollow High School in Sleepy Hollow, New York, for freshman and sophomore year and Newtown High School in Newtown, Connecticut, for junior and senior year, graduating in 1968. He earned a football athletic scholarship and attended Graceland College in Lamoni, Iowa, but was forced to stop playing football because of a knee injury. Recognizing Bruce's potential, Graceland track coach L. D Weldon encouraged Bruce to switch to the decathlon. Bruce debuted as a decathlete in 1970 in the Drake Relays decathlon in Des Moines, Iowa, finishing in fifth place. Bruce graduated from Graceland College in 1973 with a degree in physical education.\n\n**Decathlon Career**\n\nAt the 1972 U.S Olympic Trials at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon, Bruce was eleventh after the first day in the men's decathlon, and climbed to fifth behind Steve Gough and Andrew Pettes with one event remaining on the Fourth of July. Needing to make up a 19-second gap on Gough in the 1500 meters, Bruce qualified for the Olympic team by finishing first, 22 seconds ahead of the others. This prompted the Eugene Register-Guard to ask: \"Who's Jenner?\" Following the trials, Bruce was tenth in the decathlon at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany. By watching Soviet Mykola Avilov win the event, Bruce was inspired to start an intense training regimen. \"For the first time, I knew what I wanted out of life and that was it, and this guy has it,\" Bruce said. \"I literally started training that night at midnight, running through the streets of Munich, Germany, training for the Games. I trained that day on through the 1976 Games, 6–8 hours a day, every day, 365 days a year.\"\n\n**Olympic Success**\n\nBruce was the American champion in the men's decathlon event in 1974, and was featured on the cover of Track & Field News magazine's August 1974 issue.

The second Eugene record was a hybrid score because of a timing system failure and it was wind aided. Still, Bruce was proud of \"A nice little workout, huh?\"\n\n**Impact**\n\nAfter the event, Bruce took an American flag from a spectator and carried it during the victory lap, starting a tradition that became common among winning athletes.

ask: \"Who's Jenner?\" [34] [35] [33] Following the trials, Jenner was tenth in the decathlon at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany [36] By watching Soviet Mykola Avilov win the event, Jenner was inspired to start an intense training regimen \"For the first time, I knew what I wanted out of life and that was it, and this guy has it I literally started training that night at midnight, running through the streets of Munich, Germany, training for the Games I trained that day on through the 1976 Games, 6–8 hours a day, every day, 365 days a year.\" [37]\n\n\nOlympic

Eugene record was a hybrid score because of a timing system failure and it was wind aided Still, Jenner was proud of \"A nice little workout, huh?\"\n\n\nImpact\nAfter the event, Jenner took an American flag from a spectator and carried it during the victory lap, starting a tradition that became common among winning athletes [58] [59] Abandoning the vaulting poles in the stadium, with no

perfected Compound V into the fetuses of women who \"wouldn't be missed\", resulting in superheroes significantly more powerful than any others The Seven's members care little about their advertised ideals and are more concerned about merchandising rights They have shown grave incompetence in the face of the serious crises they are supposedly meant to solve; during the September 11 attacks, their efforts to land one of the hijacked planes resulted in the death of one member and the destruction of the Brooklyn Bridge, causing a significant public relations setback for both the team and VA.\n\n\nThe Homelander\nQueen Maeve is a long-time member of the Seven; her powers include super-strength and invulnerability It is suggested that Queen Maeve was more passionate about the Seven's

towards Starlight, and accidentally killed Wee Hughie's girlfriend Robin [11] Amidst the Homelander's efforts to overthrow the U.S government, A-Train is captured by Butcher, who presents him to Hughie The latter initially proves doubtful until Butcher reveals A-Train feels little to no regret over Robin's death and Vought intends to victimize Starlight Over A-Train's pleas, Hughie kills him.\n\n\nThe Deep\nA long-time member of the Seven, The Deep is a black man dressed in a diving suit, who, despite lacking aquatic powers, is marketed by Vought-American as the \"King of the Seas\", whose suit is irremovable due to an Atlantean curse Additionally, he is the most mature and civilized member of the group who often bears the brunt of the others' contempt, disregard, and racism, though he has engaged in their depraved acts, such as joining the male members in sexually assaulting Starlight After refusing to join the Homelander's failed attack on the U.S government, the Deep joins American Consolidated's group, \"True\", and adopts a new suit that features a large, cone-shaped hood resembling a Ku Klux Klan hood.\n\n\nJack from Jupiter\nJack from Jupiter is a member of

during Herogasm.\n\n\nLamplighter\nA former member of the Seven, the Lamplighter was turned over by the Seven to the Boys after the murders of Mallory's granddaughters to end their initial conflict He

to establish himself as a \"good guy\" [93] The film is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, which the book's publicist once described as \"big juicy fun\" rather than \"reportage\" [94] The film's screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told New York magazine, \"I don't want my fidelity to be the truth; I want it to be storytelling\", adding, \"What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?\" [95]\n\n\nThe Social Network\nA movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook, The Social

and author of The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company that is Connecting the World (2011), [102] \"the film is only 40% true .. he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way, the way Zuckerberg is played in the movie.\" He says that \"a lot of the factual incidents are accurate, but many are distorted and the overall impression is false\", and concludes that primarily \"his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the Internet\" [103]\n\n\nOther depictions\nZuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of The Simpsons titled \"Loan-a Lisa\",

Startup:Education foundation [112] It was reported in September 2010 that he had donated $100 million to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey [113] [114] Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg [115] Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, \"The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, I didn't want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project I was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate.\" [116] Newark Mayor Cory Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the

The conservator is responsible for making decisions on behalf of the conservatee, who may be incapacitated, mentally ill, or otherwise unable to make decisions for themselves.\n\n**Appointment**\n\nConservatorship is established either by court order (with regard to individuals) or via a statutory or regulatory authority (with regard to organizations such as business entities). In other legal terms, a conservatorship may refer to the legal responsibilities over a person who has a mental illness, including individuals who are psychotic, suicidal, demented, incapacitated, or in some other way unable to make legal, medical or financial decisions on behalf of themselves.\n\n**Conservatorship of persons**\n\nConservatorship is a legal term referring to the legal responsibilities of a conservator over the affairs of a person who has been deemed gravely disabled by the court and unable to meet their basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter. They are governed by the state's individual laws. Terminology varies, and some states or jurisdictions may refer to a conservator as a guardian of the estate or as a trustee.\n\nIn the United States, for example, conservatorship is often used to refer to the legal arrangement where a person is appointed to manage the affairs of another individual who is unable to manage their own affairs. This can include individuals who are suffering from Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or other mental health conditions.\n\n**Limited conservatorship**\n\nA \"limited conservatorship\" usually refers to the limited legal responsibilities of a conservator over the affairs of an individual who is developmentally disabled, but still capable of making important decisions for themselves. In these cases, the conservatee to whom the limited conservatorship applies can retain more control over their personal affairs than other conservatees can; for example, they may retain their right to decide where they may live.\n\nLimited conservatorship is often used in cases where the individual is able to make some decisions independently, but may require assistance with other aspects of their life. This can include managing finances, making medical decisions, or navigating daily tasks.\n\n**California**\n\nIn the state of California, there are two types of conservatorships: Lanterman–Petris–Short (Lanterman–Petris–Short Act of 1967, referred to as LPS) and Probate conservatorships. These forms of conservatorship are governed by the California Probate Code, and Welfare and Institutions Codes.\n\nLPS conservatorship is used for individuals who are suffering from a mental illness and are deemed incapable of managing their own affairs. This can include individuals who are suicidal, psychotic, or otherwise unable to make decisions for themselves.\n\nProbate conservatorship, on the other hand, is used for individuals who are unable to manage their financial affairs due to a physical or mental disability. This can include individuals who are suffering from Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or other conditions that affect their ability to manage their finances.\n\n**International equivalents**\n\nConservatorship for individuals is called \"deputyship\" in England, Wales, and in Switzerland (formerly \"guardianship\"), \"guardianship\" in Scotland, \"controllership\" in Northern Ireland, \"guardianship\" in India, and \"guardianship and administration\" in Australia.\n\nIn the Republic of Korea (South Korea), a Conservatorship is called a Guardianship. The process of appointing a guardian through Korean courts involves the Korean Family Courts, which typically has the authority to appoint a guardian. A general adult guardian is one who is in charge of both the ward's financial interests and personal welfare.\n\n**Conservatorship of organizations**\n\nIn the United States, in some states, corporations can be placed under conservatorship, as a less extreme alternative to receivership. Whereas a receiver is expected to terminate the rights of shareholders and managers, a conservator is expected merely to assume those rights, with the prospect that they will be relinquished.\n\nThis can be used in cases where the corporation is insolvent or unable to manage its own affairs. The conservator is responsible for managing the corporation's assets and making decisions on its behalf.\n\n**See also**\n\nThe process of conservatorship can be complex and involves various laws and regulations.

Jerusalem was the family home of his mother, Zahwa Abul Saud, who died from a kidney ailment in 1933, when Arafat was four years of age [17]\n\n\nEducation\nIn 1944, Arafat enrolled in the University of King Fuad I and graduated in 1950 [17] At university, he engaged Jews in discussion and read publications by Theodor Herzl and other prominent Zionists [18] By 1946, he was an Arab nationalist and began procuring weapons to be smuggled into Mandatory Palestine, for use by irregulars in the Arab Higher Committee and the Army of the Holy War militias [19]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1990, Arafat married Suha Tawil, a Palestinian Christian, when he was 61 and Suha, 27 Her mother introduced her to him in France, after which she worked as his secretary in Tunis [21] [22] Prior to their marriage, Arafat adopted fifty Palestinian war orphans [23] During their marriage, Suha tried to leave Arafat on many occasions, but he forbade it [24] Suha said she regrets the marriage, and given the choice again would not repeat it [24] [25] In mid-1995, Arafat's wife Suha gave birth in a Paris hospital to a daughter, named Zahwa after Arafat's mother [26]\n\n\nName\nArafat's full name was Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini Mohammed Abdel Rahman was his first name, Abdel Raouf was his father's name and Arafat his grandfather's Al-Qudwa was the name of his tribe and al-Husseini was that of the clan to which the al-Qudwas belonged The al-Husseini clan was based in Gaza and is not related to the well-known al-Husayni clan of Jerusalem [17]\n\n\nRise of Fatah\nFollowing the Suez Crisis in 1956, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser agreed to allow the United Nations Emergency Force to establish itself in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip, precipitating the expulsion of all guerrilla or \"fedayeen\" forces there—including Arafat Arafat originally attempted to obtain a visa to Canada and later Saudi Arabia, but was unsuccessful in both attempts [17] In 1957, he applied for a visa to Kuwait (at the time a British protectorate) and was approved, based on his work in civil engineering There he encountered two Palestinian friends: Salah Khalaf (\"Abu Iyad\") and Khalil al-Wazir (\"Abu Jihad\"), both official members of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood Arafat had met Abu Iyad while attending Cairo University and Abu Jihad in Gaza Both would later become Arafat's top aides Abu Iyad traveled with Arafat to Kuwait in late 1960; Abu Jihad, also working as a teacher, had already been living there since 1959 [27] After settling in Kuwait, Abu Iyad helped Arafat obtain a temporary job as a schoolteacher [28]\n\n\nFounding of Fatah\nFollowing the Suez Crisis in 1956, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser agreed to allow the

also working as a teacher, had already been living there since 1959 [27] After settling in Kuwait, Abu Iyad helped Arafat obtain a temporary job as a schoolteacher [28]\n\n\nLeader of the Palestinians\nOn 13 November 1966, Israel launched a major raid against the Jordanian administered West Bank town of as-Samu, in response to a Fatah-implemented roadside bomb attack which had killed three members of the Israeli security forces near the southern Green Line border In the resulting skirmish, scores of Jordanian security forces were killed and 125 homes razed This raid was one of several factors that led to the 1967 Six-Day War [35]\n\n\nBattle of Karameh\nThroughout 1968, Fatah and other Palestinian armed groups were the target of a major Israeli army operation in the Jordanian village of Karameh, where the Fatah headquarters—as well as a mid-sized Palestinian refugee camp—were located The town's name is the Arabic word for 'dignity', which elevated its symbolism in the eyes of the Arab people, especially after the collective Arab defeat in 1967 The operation was in response to attacks, including rockets strikes from Fatah and other Palestinian militias, within the Israeli-occupied West Bank According to Said Aburish, the government of Jordan and a number of Fatah commandos informed Arafat that large-scale Israeli military preparations for an attack on the town were underway, prompting fedayeen groups, such as George Habash's newly formed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Nayef Hawatmeh's breakaway organization the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), to withdraw their forces from the town Though advised by a sympathetic Jordanian Army divisional commander to withdraw his men and headquarters to the nearby hills, Arafat refused, [36] stating, \"We want to convince the world that there are those in the Arab world who will not withdraw or flee.\" [38] Aburish writes that it was on Arafat's orders that Fatah remained, and that the Jordanian Army agreed to back them if heavy fighting ensued [36]\n\n\nConfrontation with Jordan\nIn the late 1960s, tensions between Palestinians and the Jordanian government increased greatly; heavily armed Palestinian elements had created a virtual \"state within a state\" in Jordan, eventually controlling several strategic positions in that country After their proclaimed victory in the Battle of Karameh, Fatah and other Palestinian militias began taking control of civil life in Jordan They set up roadblocks, publicly humiliated Jordanian police forces, molested women and levied illegal taxes—all of which Arafat either condoned or ignored [38] King Hussein considered this a growing threat to his kingdom's sovereignty and security, and attempted to disarm the militias However, in order to avoid a military confrontation with opposition forces, Hussein dismissed several of his anti-PLO cabinet officials, including some of his own family members, and invited Arafat to become Deputy Prime Minister of Jordan Arafat refused, citing his belief in the need for a Palestinian state with Palestinian leadership [56]\n\n\nHeadquarters in Lebanon\nBecause of Lebanon's weak central government, the PLO was able to operate virtually as an independent state [59] During this time in the 1970s, numerous leftist PLO groups took up arms against Israel, carrying out attacks against civilians as well as military targets within Israel and outside of it [60]\n\n\nOfficial recognition\nBecause of Lebanon's weak central government, the PLO was able to operate virtually as an independent state [59] During this time in the 1970s, numerous leftist PLO groups took up arms against Israel, carrying out attacks against civilians as well as military targets within Israel and outside of it [60]\n\n\nFatah involvement in Lebanese Civil War\nAlthough hesitant at first to take sides in the conflict, Arafat and Fatah played an important role in the Lebanese Civil War Succumbing to pressure from PLO sub-groups such as the PFLP, DFLP and the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), Arafat aligned the PLO with the Communist and Nasserist Lebanese National Movement (LNM) The LNM was led by Kamal Jumblatt, who had a friendly relationship with Arafat and other PLO leaders Although originally aligned with Fatah, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad feared a loss of influence in Lebanon and switched sides He sent his army, along with the Syrian-backed Palestinian factions of as-Sa'iqa and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC) led by Ahmad Jibril to fight alongside right-wing Christian forces against the PLO and the LNM The primary components of the Christian front were the Phalangists loyal to Bachir Gemayel and the Tigers Militia led by Dany Chamoun, a son of former President Camille Chamoun [77]\n\n\nHeadquarters in Tunisia\nArafat and Fatah's center for operations was based in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, until 1993 In 1985 Arafat narrowly survived an Israeli assassination attempt when Israeli Air Force F-15s bombed his Tunis headquarters as part of Operation Wooden Leg, leaving 73 people dead; Arafat had gone out jogging that morning [89] The following year Arafat had his operational headquarters in Baghdad for some time [90]\n\n\nFirst Intifada\nDuring the 1980s, Arafat received financial assistance from Libya, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, which allowed him to reconstruct the badly damaged PLO This was particularly useful during the First Intifada in December 1987, which began as an uprising of Palestinians against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip The word Intifada in Arabic is literally translated as \"tremor\"; however, it is generally defined as an uprising or revolt [91]\n\n\nChange in direction\nIn August 1970, Arafat declared: \"Our basic aim is to liberate the land from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River We are not concerned with what took place in June 1967 or in eliminating the consequences of the June war The Palestinian revolution's basic concern is the uprooting of the Zionist entity from our land and liberating it.\" [94] However, in early 1976, at a meeting with US Senator Adlai Stevenson III, Arafat suggested that if Israel withdrew a \"few kilometers\" from parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and transferred responsibility to the UN, Arafat could give \"something to show his people before he could acknowledge Israel's right to exist\" [95]\n\n\nPalestinian Authority and peace negotiations\nIn the early 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah officials engaged the Israeli government in a series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords [70] [101] The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip over a five-year period, along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication [102]\n\n\nOslo Accords\nIn the early 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah officials engaged the Israeli government in a series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords [70] [101] The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip over a five-year period, along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas The accords called for a Palestinian

taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication [102]\n\n\nEstablishing authority in the territories\nIn accordance with the terms of the Oslo agreement, Arafat was required to implement PLO authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip He insisted that financial support was imperative to establishing this authority and needed it to secure the acceptance of the agreements by the Palestinians living in those areas However, Arab states of the Persian Gulf—Arafat's usual source for financial backing—still refused to provide him and the PLO with any major donations for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War [105] Ahmed Qurei—a key Fatah negotiator during the negotiations in Oslo—publicly announced that the PLO was bankrupt [106]\n\n\nOther peace agreements\nIn mid-1996, Benjamin Netanyahu was elected Prime Minister of Israel Palestinian-Israeli relations grew even more hostile as a result of continued conflict [112] Despite the Israel-PLO accord, Netanyahu opposed the idea of Palestinian statehood [113] In 1998, US President Bill Clinton persuaded the two leaders to meet The resulting Wye River Memorandum detailed the steps to be taken by the Israeli government and PNA to complete the peace process [114]\n\n\nPolitical survival\nArafat's long personal and political survival was taken by most Western commentators as a sign of his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations [117] Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he could become a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel [118] Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity as the leader of the Palestinians [117]\n\n\nRelations with Hamas and other militant groups\nArafat's ability to adapt to new tactical and political situations was perhaps tested by the rise of the Hamas and PIJ organizations, Islamist groups espousing rejectionist policies with Israel These groups often bombed non-military targets, such as malls and movie theaters, to increase the psychological damage and civilian casualties In the 1990s, these groups seemed to threaten Arafat's capacity to hold together a unified nationalist organization with a goal of statehood [117]\n\n\nAttempts to marginalize\nPersistent attempts by the Israeli government to identify another Palestinian leader to represent the Palestinian people failed Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, would normally have been quite wary of dealing with or supporting him Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada, but Israel had him arrested for allegedly being involved in the killing of twenty-six civilians, and he was sentenced to five life terms [127]\n\n\nFinancial dealings\nUnder the Oslo Peace Accords, Israel undertook to deposit the VAT tax receipts on goods purchased by Palestinians into the Palestinian treasury Until 2000, these monies were transferred directly to Arafat's personal accounts at Bank Leumi, in Tel Aviv.\n [141]\n\n\nIllness and death\nThe Israeli government tried for decades to assassinate Arafat, including attempting to intercept and shoot down private aircraft and commercial airliners on which he was believed to be traveling [149] The assassination was initially assigned to Caesarea, the Mossad unit in charge of Israel's numerous targeted killings Shooting down a commercial airliner in international airspace over very deep water was thought to be preferable to make recovery of the wreckage, and hence investigation, more difficult [149] Following Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Israeli Minister of Defense Ariel Sharon created a special task force code named \"Salt Fish\" headed by special operations experts Meir Dagan and Rafi Eitan to track Arafat's movements in Lebanon to kill him because Sharon saw Arafat as a \"Jew murderer\" and an important symbol, symbols being as important as body counts in a war against a terrorist organization The Salt Fish task force orchestrated the bombing of buildings where Arafat and senior PLO leaders were believed to be staying Later renamed \"Operation Goldfish\", Israeli operatives followed Israeli journalist Uri Avnery to a meeting with Arafat in an additional unsuccessful attempt to kill him In 2001, Sharon as prime minister is believed to have made a commitment to cease attempts to assassinate Arafat However, following Israel's successful assassination in March 2004 of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a founder of the Hamas movement, Sharon stated in April 2004 that \"this commitment of mine no longer exists.\" [149]\n\n\nUnsuccessful Israeli assassination attempts\nThe Israeli government tried for decades to assassinate Arafat,

said was influenza came on 25 October 2004, after he vomited during a staff meeting His condition deteriorated in the following days [150] Following visits by other doctors, including teams from Tunisia, Jordan, and Egypt—and agreement by Israel to allow him to travel—Arafat was flown from Ramallah to Jordan by a Jordanian military helicopter and from there to France on a French military plane He was admitted to the Percy military hospital in Clamart, a suburb of Paris [151] [152] [153] On 3 November, he had lapsed into a gradually deepening coma [154]\n\n\nFuneral\nOn 11 November 2004, a French Army guard of honour held a brief ceremony for Arafat, with his coffin draped in a Palestinian flag A military band played the French and Palestinian national anthems, and a Chopin

day, Arafat's body was flown from Paris aboard a French Air Force transport plane to Cairo, Egypt, for a brief military funeral there, attended by several heads of states, prime ministers and foreign ministers [164] Egypt's top Muslim cleric Sayed Tantawi led mourning prayers preceding the funeral procession [151]\n\n\nTheories about the cause of death\nNumerous theories have circulated regarding

Arafat\n\nIntroduction\nYasser Arafat was a Palestinian leader and politician who served as the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from 1969 to 2004. He was a key figure in the Palestinian nationalist movement and played a crucial role in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Arafat was born on August 24, 1929, in Cairo, Egypt, and died on November 11, 2004, in Paris, France.\n\nEarly Life\nArafat was born in Cairo, Egypt, on August 24, 1929. His father, Abdel Raouf al-Qudwa al-Husseini, was a Palestinian from Gaza City, and his mother, Zahwa Abul Saud, was from a family of Palestinian merchants. Arafat's family moved to Jerusalem when he was a young child, and he spent his early years in the city. He was educated at Islamic schools in Jerusalem and later attended the University of King Fuad I in Cairo, where he graduated with a degree in civil engineering in 1950.\n\nRise of Fatah\nIn 1956, Arafat became involved in the Palestinian nationalist movement and joined the Arab Nationalist Movement. He later co-founded Fatah, a Palestinian nationalist organization, with other Palestinian leaders. Fatah's primary goal was to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation and establish an independent Palestinian state.\n\nFounding of Fatah\nFatah was founded in 1957 by Arafat and other Palestinian leaders. The organization's primary goal was to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation and establish an independent Palestinian state. Fatah's early activities included guerrilla warfare and sabotage against Israeli targets.\n\nLeader of the Palestinians\nIn 1966, Arafat became the leader of Fatah and the Palestinian nationalist movement. He played a key role in the 1967 Six-Day War, which resulted in Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Arafat's leadership and charisma helped to galvanize the Palestinian nationalist movement and establish Fatah as a major force in the region.\n\nBattle of Karameh\nIn 1968, Arafat led Fatah in the Battle of Karameh, a major confrontation with Israeli forces in the Jordanian city of Karameh. The battle was a significant turning point in the Palestinian nationalist movement, as it demonstrated Fatah's military capabilities and helped to establish Arafat's reputation as a skilled leader.\n\nConfrontation with Jordan\nIn the late 1960s, tensions between Palestinians and the Jordanian government increased greatly. Fatah and other Palestinian militias had created a virtual \"state within a state\" in Jordan, taking control of several strategic positions in the country. King Hussein considered this a growing threat to his kingdom's sovereignty and security, and attempted to disarm the militias. However, in order to avoid a military confrontation with opposition forces, Hussein dismissed several of his anti-PLO cabinet officials, including some of his own family members, and invited Arafat to become Deputy Prime Minister of Jordan.

University of King Fuad I and graduated in 1950 [17] At university, he engaged Jews in discussion and read publications by Theodor Herzl and other prominent Zionists [18] By 1946, he was an Arab nationalist and began procuring weapons to be smuggled into Mandatory Palestine, for use by irregulars in the Arab Higher Committee and the Army of the Holy War militias [19]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1990, Arafat married Suha Tawil, a Palestinian Christian, when he was 61 and Suha, 27 Her mother introduced her to him in France, after which she worked as his secretary in Tunis [21] [22] Prior to their marriage, Arafat adopted fifty Palestinian war orphans [23] During their marriage, Suha tried to leave Arafat on many occasions, but he forbade it [24] Suha said she regrets the marriage, and given the choice again would not repeat it [24] [25] In mid-1995, Arafat's wife Suha gave birth in a Paris hospital to a daughter, named Zahwa after Arafat's mother [26]\n\n\nName\nArafat's full name was Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al-Qudwa al-Husseini Mohammed Abdel Rahman was his first name, Abdel Raouf was his father's name and Arafat his grandfather's Al-Qudwa was the name of his tribe and al-Husseini was that of the clan to which the al-Qudwas belonged The al-Husseini clan was based in Gaza and is not related to the well-known al-Husayni clan of Jerusalem [17]\n\n\nRise of Fatah\nFollowing the Suez Crisis in 1956, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser agreed to allow the United Nations Emergency Force to establish itself in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip, precipitating the expulsion of all guerrilla or \"fedayeen\" forces there—including Arafat Arafat originally attempted to obtain a visa to Canada and later Saudi Arabia, but was unsuccessful in both attempts [17] In 1957, he applied for a visa to Kuwait (at the time a British protectorate) and was approved, based on his work in civil engineering There he encountered two Palestinian friends: Salah Khalaf (\"Abu Iyad\") and Khalil al-Wazir (\"Abu Jihad\"), both official members of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood Arafat had met Abu Iyad while attending Cairo University and Abu Jihad in Gaza Both would later become Arafat's top aides Abu Iyad traveled with Arafat to Kuwait in late 1960; Abu Jihad, also working as a teacher, had already been living there since 1959 [27] After settling in Kuwait, Abu Iyad helped Arafat obtain a temporary job as a schoolteacher [28]\n\n\nFounding of Fatah\nFollowing the Suez Crisis in 1956, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser agreed to allow the United Nations Emergency Force to establish itself in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip, precipitating the expulsion of all guerrilla or \"fedayeen\" forces there—including Arafat Arafat originally attempted to obtain a visa to Canada and later Saudi Arabia, but was unsuccessful in both attempts [17] In 1957, he applied for a visa to Kuwait (at the time a British protectorate) and was approved, based on his work in civil engineering There he encountered two Palestinian friends: Salah Khalaf (\"Abu Iyad\") and Khalil al-Wazir (\"Abu Jihad\"), both official members of the Egyptian Muslim

also working as a teacher, had already been living there since 1959 [27] After settling in Kuwait, Abu Iyad helped Arafat obtain a temporary job as a schoolteacher [28]\n\n\nLeader of the Palestinians\nOn 13 November 1966, Israel launched a major raid against the Jordanian administered West Bank town of as-Samu, in response to a Fatah-implemented roadside bomb attack which had killed three members of the Israeli security forces near the southern Green Line border In the resulting skirmish, scores of Jordanian security forces were killed and 125 homes razed This raid was one of several factors that led to the 1967 Six-Day War [35]\n\n\nBattle of Karameh\nThroughout 1968, Fatah and other Palestinian armed groups were the target of a major Israeli army operation in the Jordanian village of Karameh, where the Fatah headquarters—as well as a mid-sized Palestinian refugee camp—were located The town's name is the Arabic word for 'dignity', which elevated its symbolism in the eyes of the Arab people, especially after the collective Arab defeat in 1967 The operation was in response to attacks, including rockets strikes from Fatah and other Palestinian militias, within the Israeli-occupied West Bank According to Said Aburish, the government of Jordan and a number of Fatah commandos informed Arafat that large-scale Israeli military preparations for an attack on the town were underway, prompting fedayeen groups, such as George Habash's newly formed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Nayef Hawatmeh's breakaway organization the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), to withdraw their forces from the town Though advised by a sympathetic Jordanian Army divisional commander to withdraw his men and headquarters to the nearby hills, Arafat refused, [36] stating, \"We want to convince the world that there are those in the Arab world who will not withdraw or flee.\" [38] Aburish writes that it was on Arafat's orders that Fatah remained, and that the Jordanian Army agreed to back them if heavy fighting ensued [36]\n\n\nConfrontation with Jordan\nIn the late 1960s, tensions between Palestinians and the Jordanian government increased greatly; heavily armed Palestinian elements had created a virtual \"state within a state\" in Jordan, eventually controlling several strategic positions in that country After their proclaimed victory in the Battle of Karameh, Fatah and other Palestinian militias began taking control of civil life in Jordan They set up roadblocks, publicly humiliated Jordanian police forces, molested women and levied illegal taxes—all of which Arafat either condoned or ignored [38] King Hussein considered this a growing threat to his kingdom's sovereignty and security, and attempted to disarm the militias However, in order to avoid a military confrontation with opposition forces, Hussein dismissed several of his anti-PLO cabinet officials, including some of his own family members, and invited Arafat to become Deputy Prime Minister of Jordan Arafat refused, citing his belief in the need for a Palestinian state with Palestinian leadership [56]\n\n\nHeadquarters in Lebanon\nBecause of Lebanon's weak central government, the PLO was able to operate virtually as an independent state [59] During this time in the 1970s, numerous leftist PLO groups took up arms against Israel, carrying out attacks against civilians as well as military targets within Israel and outside of it [60]\n\n\nOfficial recognition\nBecause of Lebanon's weak central government, the PLO was able to operate virtually as an independent state [59] During this time in the 1970s, numerous leftist PLO groups took up arms against Israel, carrying out attacks against civilians as well as military targets within Israel and outside of it [60]\n\n\nFatah involvement in Lebanese Civil War\nAlthough hesitant at first to take sides in the conflict, Arafat and Fatah played an important role in the Lebanese Civil War Succumbing to pressure from PLO sub-groups such as the PFLP, DFLP and the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), Arafat aligned the PLO with the Communist and Nasserist Lebanese National Movement (LNM) The LNM was led by Kamal Jumblatt, who had a friendly relationship with Arafat and other PLO leaders Although originally aligned with Fatah, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad feared a loss of influence in Lebanon and switched sides He sent his army, along with the Syrian-backed Palestinian factions of as-Sa'iqa and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC) led by Ahmad Jibril to fight alongside right-wing Christian forces against the PLO and the LNM The primary components of the Christian front were the Phalangists loyal to Bachir Gemayel and the Tigers Militia led by Dany Chamoun, a son of former President Camille Chamoun [77]\n\n\nHeadquarters in Tunisia\nArafat and Fatah's center for operations was based in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, until 1993 In 1985 Arafat narrowly survived an Israeli assassination attempt when Israeli Air Force F-15s bombed his Tunis headquarters as part of Operation Wooden Leg, leaving 73 people dead; Arafat had gone out jogging that morning [89] The following year Arafat had his operational headquarters in Baghdad for some time [90]\n\n\nFirst Intifada\nDuring the 1980s, Arafat received financial assistance from Libya, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, which allowed him to reconstruct the badly damaged PLO This was particularly useful during the First Intifada in December 1987, which began as an uprising of Palestinians against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip The word Intifada in Arabic is literally translated as \"tremor\"; however, it is generally defined as an uprising or revolt [91]\n\n\nChange in direction\nIn August 1970, Arafat declared: \"Our basic aim is to liberate the land from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River We are not concerned with what took place in June 1967 or in eliminating the consequences of the June war The Palestinian revolution's basic concern is the uprooting of the Zionist entity from our land and liberating it.\" [94] However, in early 1976, at a meeting with US Senator Adlai Stevenson III, Arafat suggested that if Israel withdrew a \"few kilometers\" from parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and transferred responsibility to the UN, Arafat could give \"something to show his people before he could acknowledge Israel's right to exist\" [95]\n\n\nPalestinian Authority and peace negotiations\nIn the early 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah officials engaged the Israeli government in a series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords [70] [101] The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip over a five-year period, along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication [102]\n\n\nOslo Accords\nIn the early 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah officials engaged the Israeli government in a series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords [70] [101] The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip over a five-year period, along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication [102]\n\n\nEstablishing authority in the territories\nIn accordance with the terms of the Oslo agreement, Arafat was required to implement PLO authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip He insisted that financial support was imperative to establishing this authority and needed it to secure the acceptance of the agreements by the Palestinians living in those areas However, Arab states of the Persian Gulf—Arafat's usual source for financial backing—still refused to provide him and the PLO with any major donations for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War [105] Ahmed Qurei—a key Fatah negotiator during the negotiations in Oslo—publicly announced that the PLO was bankrupt [106]\n\n\nOther peace agreements\nIn mid-1996, Benjamin Netanyahu was elected Prime Minister of Israel Palestinian-Israeli relations grew even more hostile as a result of continued conflict [112] Despite the Israel-PLO accord, Netanyahu opposed the idea of Palestinian statehood [113] In 1998, US President Bill Clinton persuaded the two leaders to meet The resulting Wye River Memorandum detailed the steps to be taken by the Israeli government and PNA to complete the peace process [114]\n\n\nPolitical survival\nArafat's long personal and political survival was taken by most Western commentators as a sign of his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations [117] Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he could become a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel [118] Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity as the leader of the Palestinians [117]\n\n\nRelations with Hamas and other militant groups\nArafat's ability to adapt to new tactical and political situations was perhaps tested by the rise of the Hamas and PIJ organizations, Islamist groups espousing rejectionist policies with Israel These groups often bombed non-military targets, such as malls and movie theaters, to increase the psychological damage and civilian casualties In the 1990s, these groups seemed to threaten Arafat's capacity to hold together a unified nationalist organization with a goal of statehood [117]\n\n\nAttempts to marginalize\nPersistent attempts by the Israeli government to identify another Palestinian leader to represent the Palestinian people failed Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, would normally have been quite wary of dealing with or supporting him Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada, but Israel had him arrested for allegedly being involved in the killing of twenty-six civilians, and he was sentenced to five life terms [127]\n\n\nFinancial dealings\nUnder the Oslo Peace Accords, Israel undertook to deposit the VAT tax receipts on goods purchased by Palestinians into the Palestinian treasury Until 2000, these monies were transferred directly to Arafat's personal accounts at Bank Leumi, in Tel Aviv.\n [141]\n\n\nIllness and death\nThe Israeli government tried for decades to assassinate Arafat, including attempting to intercept and shoot down private aircraft and commercial airliners on which he was believed to be traveling [149] The assassination was initially assigned to Caesarea, the Mossad unit in charge of Israel's numerous targeted killings Shooting down a commercial airliner in international airspace over very deep water was thought to be preferable to make recovery of the wreckage, and hence investigation, more difficult [149] Following Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Israeli Minister of Defense Ariel Sharon created a special task force code named \"Salt Fish\" headed by special operations experts Meir Dagan and Rafi Eitan to track Arafat's movements in Lebanon to kill him because Sharon saw Arafat as a \"Jew murderer\" and an important symbol, symbols being as important as body counts in a war against a terrorist organization The Salt Fish task force orchestrated the bombing of buildings where Arafat and senior PLO leaders were believed to be staying Later renamed \"Operation Goldfish\", Israeli operatives followed Israeli journalist Uri Avnery to a meeting with Arafat in an additional unsuccessful attempt to kill him In 2001, Sharon as prime minister is believed to have made a commitment to cease attempts to assassinate Arafat However, following Israel's successful assassination in March 2004 of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a founder of the Hamas movement, Sharon stated in April 2004 that \"this commitment of mine no longer exists.\" [149]\n\n\nUnsuccessful Israeli assassination attempts\nThe Israeli government tried for decades to assassinate Arafat, including attempting to intercept and shoot down private aircraft and commercial airliners on which he was believed to be traveling [149] The assassination was initially assigned to Caesarea, the Mossad unit in charge of Israel's numerous targeted killings Shooting down a commercial airliner in international airspace over very deep water was thought to be preferable to make recovery of the

movement, Sharon stated in April 2004 that \"this commitment of mine no longer exists.\" [149]\n\n\nFailing health\nThe first reports of Arafat's failing health by his doctors for what his spokesman said was influenza came on 25 October 2004, after he vomited during a staff meeting His condition deteriorated in the following days [150] Following visits by other doctors, including teams from Tunisia, Jordan, and Egypt—and agreement by Israel to allow him to travel—Arafat was flown from Ramallah to Jordan by a Jordanian military helicopter and from there to France on a French military plane He was admitted to the Percy military hospital in Clamart, a suburb of Paris [151] [152] [153] On 3 November, he had lapsed into a gradually deepening coma [154]\n\n\nFuneral\nOn 11 November 2004, a French Army guard of honour held a brief ceremony for Arafat, with his coffin draped in a Palestinian flag A military band played the French and Palestinian national anthems, and a Chopin funeral march [162] French President Jacques Chirac stood alone beside Arafat's coffin for about ten minutes in a last show of respect for Arafat, whom he hailed as \"a man of courage\" [163] The next day, Arafat's body was flown from Paris aboard a French Air Force transport plane to Cairo, Egypt, for a brief military funeral there, attended by several heads of states, prime ministers and foreign ministers [164] Egypt's top Muslim cleric Sayed Tantawi led mourning prayers preceding the funeral procession [151]\n\n\nTheories about the cause of death\nNumerous theories have circulated regarding Arafat's death, with the most prominent being poisoning [169] [170] [171] [172] (possibly by polonium) and [173] AIDS-related illnesses, [174] [175] [176] as well as liver disease [177] or a platelet

The film stars Jeremy Irons, George MacKay, Jannis Niewöhner, Sandra Hüller, Liv Lisa Fries, and August Diehl. The film premiered in 2021 and was released on Netflix.\n\n**Plot**\n\nThe film is set in 1938, on the eve of World War II. Hugh Legat, a young British diplomat, is sent to Munich to facilitate a meeting between British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and German Chancellor Adolf Hitler. The meeting is intended to prevent a war, but Legat soon realizes that the situation is more complex than he had anticipated.\n\nThe film follows Legat's experiences as he navigates the treacherous world of international politics. He is accompanied by his German friends, Paul von Hartmann and his girlfriend Lena, who provide insight into the inner workings of the German government.\n\nAs the meeting approaches, Legat becomes increasingly disillusioned with Chamberlain's policies, which he believes are naive and ineffective. He finds himself caught between his loyalty to his country and his growing sense of unease about the morality of the situation.\n\nThe film's plot is heavily influenced by historical events, and the characters are fictionalized for the sake of the story. However, the author and film have taken a more nuanced approach to Chamberlain's character, portraying him as a complex figure who is driven by a desire to avoid war at any cost.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast of talented actors, including:\n\n* Jeremy Irons as Hugh Legat, a young British diplomat\n* George MacKay as Paul von Hartmann, a German diplomat and friend of Legat's\n* Jannis Niewöhner as Paul's girlfriend, Lena\n* Sandra Hüller as Elsa von Brauchitsch, a German aristocrat and politician\n* Liv Lisa Fries as Dorothea von Schönberg, a German diplomat and friend of Legat's\n* August Diehl as Adolf Hitler, the German Chancellor\n\nThe cast brings depth and nuance to the film, and their performances are a key factor in its success.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe film was produced by Christian Schwochow, who also directed the film. The screenplay was written by Ben Power, based on the novel of the same name by Robert Harris. The film was shot on location in Germany and the UK, and was released on Netflix in 2021.\n\nThe production team took a meticulous approach to creating an accurate and immersive portrayal of 1930s Germany. They consulted with historians and experts to ensure that the film's costumes, sets, and props were accurate and authentic.\n\n**Revisionism and historical accuracy**\n\nThe film takes a nuanced approach to the historical events of 1938, portraying Chamberlain as a complex figure who is driven by a desire to avoid war at any cost. While some historians have criticized Chamberlain for his \"appeasement\" of Hitler, others have argued that his policies were a stalling tactic to allow Britain to prepare for an inevitable war with Nazi Germany.\n\nThe film's portrayal of the Munich Conference as a \"best case, worst case\" scenario is a deliberate attempt to challenge the traditional narrative of Chamberlain's policies. In the best case, Hitler would cease his planned invasion of Czechoslovakia. In the worst case, the letter of agreement would give Britain time to consolidate allies, rearm the military, and perhaps get the United States involved.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics, with many praising its performances, direction, and historical accuracy.

Born on June 18, 1976, in Ada, Oklahoma, Shelton has become one of the most successful country artists of all time, known for his unique blend of traditional country, rock, and pop styles.\n\nEarly life\nBlake Shelton was born in Ada, Oklahoma, to Dorothy Ann (née Bristol) (b 1936), a beauty salon owner, and Richard Lee \"Dick\" Shelton (1940–2012), a car salesman. Shelton began singing at an early age and by the age of 12, he was taught how to play the guitar by his uncle. By age 15, he had written his first song. By age 16, he had received a Denbo Diamond Award in his home state. On November 13, 1990, his older brother, Richie Shelton, was killed in an automobile accident at 24.\n\nMusic career\nShelton's music career began in the late 1990s, and he eventually signed to Giant Records. In 2001, he was slated to release a song entitled \"I Wanna Talk About Me\" as a single. However, staff at the label considered the song unsuitable for a lead-off single, and the song was eventually recorded by Toby Keith, whose version was a number 1 single.\n\n2001–2006: Beginnings\nShelton released his debut album in 2001, which was moderately successful. His follow-up album, \"The Dreamer\", was released in 2003 and spawned the hit single \"The Woman with You\". The song reached number one on the country charts and became Shelton's first number one single.\n\n2006–2011: Pure BS and Startin' Fires\nShelton released his fourth studio album, \"Pure BS\", in early 2007. Unlike with his first three albums, which were produced entirely by Bobby Braddock, Shelton worked with Braddock, Brent Rowan, and Paul Worley as producers for this album. Its first two singles—\"Don't Make Me\" and \"The More I Drink\"—were both Top 20 hits on the country charts, respectively reaching No. 12 and No. 19. Also in late 2007, Shelton made appearances on television shows, first as a judge on the talent competition \"Nashville Star\", and later on \"Clash of the Choirs\".\n\n2011–2012: The Voice and Red River Blue\nShelton released the album \"Red River Blue\" on July 12, 2011, led by the single, \"Honey Bee\". The song received 138,000 downloads in its first week and was certified gold in its seventh week, setting a record for the fastest gold certification by a male country singer. On June 13, 2011, in its tenth chart week, \"Honey Bee\" went to No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart, becoming his ninth No. 1 and his fastest-climbing.

He is perhaps best known for his role as Baretta in the 1970s television series of the same name. However, his personal life has been marred by controversy, particularly surrounding the murder of his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBlake was born on September 18, 1933, in Nutley, New Jersey, to Giacomo (James) Gubitosi and his wife, Elizabeth Cafone. In 1930, James worked as a die setter for a can manufacturer. Eventually, Blake's parents began a song-and-dance act, and their three children began performing, billed as \"The Three Little Hillbillies.\" In 1936, the family moved to Los Angeles, California, where the children began working as movie extras.\n\n**Child Actor**\n\nThen known as Mickey Gubitosi, Blake began his acting career as Toto in the MGM movie Bridal Suite (1939), starring Annabella and Robert Young. Blake then began appearing in MGM's Our Gang short subjects, a.k.a. The Little Rascals, under his real name, replacing Eugene \"Porky\" Lee. He appeared in 40 of the shorts between 1939 and 1944, eventually becoming the series' final lead character. Blake's parents also made appearances in the series as extras. In Our Gang, Blake's character, Mickey, was often called upon to cry, for which he was criticized for being unconvincing. He was also criticized for being obnoxious and whiny.\n\n**Career as an Adult**\n\nIn 1950, Blake was drafted into the U.S Army during the Korean War. Upon leaving at the age of 21, he found himself without any job prospects and fell into a deep depression. This led to a two-year addiction to heroin and cocaine. He also sold drugs. Blake entered Jeff Corey's acting class and began working on improving his personal and professional life. He eventually became a seasoned Hollywood actor, playing notable dramatic roles in movies and on television. In 1956, he was billed as Robert Blake for the first time.\n\n**Marriages and Children**\n\nBlake and actress Sondra Kerr were married in 1961, and divorced in 1983. It was his first marriage, from which came two children: actor Noah Blake (born 1965) and Delinah Blake (born 1966).\n\n**Murder of Bonny Lee Bakley**\n\nOn May 4, 2001, Blake took Bakley out for dinner at Vitello's Italian Restaurant in Studio City, California. Bakley was fatally shot in the head while sitting in Blake's vehicle, which was parked on a side street around the corner from the restaurant. Blake claimed that he had returned to the restaurant to collect a pistol which he had left inside and said that he had not been present when the shooting took place. The pistol Blake left in the restaurant was found and determined by police not to be the murder weapon.\n\n**Arrest**\n\nOn April 18, 2002, Blake was arrested and charged with Bakley's murder. His longtime bodyguard, Earle Caldwell, was also arrested and charged with conspiracy in connection with the murder. A key event that gave the Los Angeles Police Department the confidence to arrest Blake came when a retired stuntman, Ronald \"Duffy\" Hambleton, agreed to testify against him. Hambleton alleged that Blake tried to hire him to kill Bakley. Another retired stuntman and an associate of Hambleton's, Gary McLarty, also came forward with a similar story.\n\n**Trial and Acquittal**\n\nBlake's criminal trial for murder began on December 20, 2004, with opening statements by the prosecution and opening statements by the defense the following day. The prosecution contended that Blake intentionally murdered Bakley to free himself from a loveless marriage, while the defense claimed that Blake was an innocent victim of circumstantial and fabricated evidence. McLarty and Hambleton each testified that Blake had asked them to murder Bakley. On cross-examination, the defense brought up McLarty's mental health problems and Hambleton's criminal history. The lack of gunshot residue on Blake's hands was a key part of the defense's case that Blake was not the shooter. Blake chose not to testify.\n\n**Civil Case**\n\nBakley's three children filed a civil suit against Blake, asserting that he was responsible for their mother's death. During the trial, the girlfriend of Blake's co-defendant Earle Caldwell said she believed Blake and Caldwell were involved in the crime.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nBlake maintained a low profile after his acquittal and filing for bankruptcy, with debts of $3 million for unpaid legal fees as well as state and federal taxes. On April 9, 2010, the state of California filed a tax lien against Blake for $1,110,878 in unpaid back taxes.\n\n**Death**\n\nBlake died from heart disease in Los Angeles, on March 9, 2023, aged 89.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n### Film\n\n* Bridal Suite (1939)\n* Our Gang short subjects (1939-1944)\n* Baretta (1975-1978)\n* In the Line of Duty: The F.B.I.

{"title": "Ozzy_Osbourne", "content": "\nEarly life\nOsbourne was born at Maternity Hospital in Marston Green on 3 December 1948, [8] and grew up in the Aston area of Birmingham [8] [9] His mother, Lilian (née Unitt; 1916–2001), was a non-observant Catholic who worked at a Lucas factory [10] [11] [12] His father, John Thomas \"Jack\" Osbourne (1915–1977), worked night shifts as a toolmaker at the General Electric Company [13] [14] Osbourne has three older sisters named Jean, Iris, and Gillian, and two younger brothers named Paul and Tony The family lived in a small two-bedroom home at 14 Lodge Road in Aston Osbourne gained the nickname \"Ozzy\" as a child [15] He dealt with dyslexia at school [16] His accent has been described as a \"hesitant Brummie\" [17] At the age of 11, he suffered sexual abuse from school bullies [18] He claims to have attempted suicide multiple times as a teenager [19] [20]\n\n\nCareer\nIn late 1967, Geezer Butler formed his first band, Rare Breed, and recruited Osbourne to serve as its vocalist [15] The band played two shows, and then broke up Osbourne and Butler reunited in another band, Polka Tulk Blues, which included guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward, whose band Mythology recently broke up They renamed the band Earth But after being accidentally booked for a show instead of a different band with the same name, they decided to change the band's name again, settling on the name Black Sabbath in August 1969 The band's name was inspired by the film of the same title [25] Black Sabbath noticed how people enjoyed being frightened during their appearances, which inspired their decision to play a heavy blues style of music laced with gloomy sounds and lyrics [8] While recording their first album, Butler read an occult book and woke up seeing a dark figure at the end of his bed Butler told Osbourne about it, and together they wrote the lyrics to \"Black Sabbath\", their first song in a darker vein [26] [27]\n\n\nBlack Sabbath\n\n\n\nDismissal\nIn 1978, Osbourne left the band for three months to pursue a solo project called Blizzard of Ozz, [38] a title which had been suggested by his father [39] Three members of the band Necromandus, who had supported Sabbath in Birmingham when they were called Earth, backed Osbourne in the studio and briefly became the first incarnation of his solo band.\n\n\nSolo career\nAfter leaving Black Sabbath, Osbourne recalled, \"I'd got £96,000 for my share of the name, so I'd just locked myself away and spent three months doing coke and booze My thinking was, 'This is my last party, because after this I'm going back to Birmingham and the dole.\" [49] However, Don Arden signed him to Jet Records with the aim of recording new material Arden dispatched his daughter Sharon to Los Angeles to \"look after Ozzy's needs, whatever they were\", to protect his investment [50] Arden initially hoped Osbourne would return to Sabbath, who he was personally managing at that time, and later attempted to convince the singer to name his new band \"Son of Sabbath\", which Osbourne hated [15] Sharon attempted to convince Osbourne to form a supergroup with guitarist Gary Moore [15] \"When I lived in Los Angeles\", Moore recalled, \" [Moore's band] G-Force helped him to audition musicians If drummers were trying out, I played guitar, and if a bassist came along, my drummer would help out We felt sorry for him, basically He was always hovering around trying to get me to join, and I wasn't having any of it.\" [51]\n\n\nOzzfest\nOsbourne's biggest financial success of the 1990s was a venture named Ozzfest, created and managed by his wife/manager Sharon and assisted by his son Jack The first Ozzfest was held in Phoenix, Arizona, on 25 October 1996 and in Devore, California, on 26 October Ozzfest was an instant hit with metal fans, helping many up-and-coming groups who were featured there to broad exposure and commercial success Some acts shared the bill with a reformed Black Sabbath during the 1997 Ozzfest tour, beginning in West Palm Beach, Florida Osbourne reunited with the original members of Sabbath in 1997 and has performed periodically with them since.\n\n\n2000s\nDown to Earth, Osbourne's first album of new studio material in six years, was released on 16 October 2001 A live album, Live at Budokan, followed in 2002 Down to Earth, which achieved platinum status in 2003, featured the single \"Dreamer\", a song which peaked at number 10 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks [75] In June 2002, Osbourne was invited to participate in the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, performing the Black Sabbath anthem \"Paranoid\" at the Party at the Palace concert in the grounds of Buckingham Palace [76] In 2003, Osbourne recruited former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted, though his time with Osbourne would be short Osbourne's former bassist Robert Trujillo replaced Newsted in Metallica during this same period.\n\n\n2010s\nOn 13 April 2010, Osbourne announced the release date for Scream would be 15 June 2010 [91] The release date was later changed to a week later A single from the album, \"Let Me Hear You Scream\", debuted on 14 April 2010 episode of CSI: NY The song spent eight weeks on the Billboard Rock Songs chart, peaking at No 7.\n\n\n2020s\nOn 21 February 2020, Osbourne released his first solo album in almost ten years, Ordinary Man, which received positive reviews from music critics and debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart [107] [108] A few days after the release, Osbourne told iHeartRadio that he wanted to make another album with Andrew Watt, the main producer of Ordinary Man [109] [110] One week after the release of the album, an 8-bit video game dedicated to Osbourne was released, called Legend of Ozzy [111] Osbourne has started working on his follow up album, once again with Andrew Watt [112] In November 2021, Sony announced that Osbourne's album would be released within six months; [113] it was also announced that Zakk Wylde will have full involvement in the album following his absence on Ordinary Man [114] On 24 June 2022, Osbourne announced his thirteenth album would be titled Patient Number 9 and released the title track along with an accompanying music video that same day The album was released on 9 September 2022 [115]\n\n\nOther production work\nOsbourne achieved greater celebrity status via his own brand of reality television The Osbournes, a series featuring the domestic life of Osbourne and his family (wife Sharon, children Jack and Kelly, occasional appearances from his son Louis, but eldest daughter Aimee did not participate) The program became one of MTV's greatest hits It premiered on 5 March 2002, and the final episode aired on 21 March 2005 [120]\n\n\nBlack Sabbath reunion\nIt was announced on 11 November 2011 during a news conference at the Whisky a Go Go club on West Hollywood's Sunset Strip that the original Black Sabbath lineup of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward would reunite for a world tour and new album, to be produced by Rick Rubin [138] Ward dropped out for

Birmingham, their first concert since their reunion [139] The album, entitled 13, was released on 11 June 2013, [140] and topped both the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200 [141] [142]\n\n\nControversies\nThroughout his career, many religious groups have accused Osbourne of being a negative influence on teenagers, stating that his genre of rock music has been used to glorify Satanism Scholar Christopher M Moreman compared the controversy to those levelled against the occultist Aleister Crowley Both were demonised by the media and some religious groups for their antics Although Osbourne tempts the comparison with his song \"Mr Crowley\", he denies being a Satanist; conversely, it has been reported that Osbourne is a member of the Church of England and that he prays before taking the stage each night before every concert [149] [150]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1971, Osbourne met his first wife Thelma Riley at the Rum Runner, the Birmingham nightclub where she worked [15] They were married later that year and children Jessica and Louis were soon born Osbourne later referred to his first marriage as \"a terrible mistake\" [15] His drug and alcohol use, coupled with his frequent absences while touring with Black Sabbath, took their toll on his family life; his children later complained that he was not a good father In the 2011 documentary film God Bless Ozzy Osbourne, produced by his son Jack, Osbourne admitted that he could not even remember when Louis and Jessica were born [166]\n\n\nDrug and alcohol use\nOsbourne has misused alcohol and other drugs for

He is best known as the lead vocalist of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath and as a successful solo artist.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nOzzy Osbourne was born on December 3, 1948, at Maternity Hospital in Marston Green, Birmingham, England. He grew up in the Aston area of Birmingham with his three older sisters, Jean, Iris, and Gillian, and his two younger brothers, Paul and Tony. His father, John Thomas \"Jack\" Osbourne, was a toolmaker at the General Electric Company, and his mother, Lilian (née Unitt), worked at a Lucas factory.\n\nOsbourne gained the nickname \"Ozzy\" as a child and dealt with dyslexia at school. He suffered sexual abuse at the age of 11 and attempted suicide multiple times as a teenager.\n\n**Career**\n\nIn late 1967, Geezer Butler formed his first band, Rare Breed, and recruited Osbourne to serve as its vocalist. The band played two shows and then broke up. Osbourne and Butler reunited in another band, Polka Tulk Blues, which included guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward. They renamed the band Earth, but after being accidentally booked for a show instead of a different band with the same name, they decided to change the band's name again, settling on the name Black Sabbath in August 1969.\n\nBlack Sabbath noticed how people enjoyed being frightened during their appearances, which inspired their decision to play a heavy blues style of music laced with gloomy sounds and lyrics. While recording their first album, Butler read an occult book and woke up seeing a dark figure at the end of his bed. Butler told Osbourne about it, and together they wrote the lyrics to \"Black Sabbath\", their first song in a darker vein.\n\n**Black Sabbath**\n\nBlack Sabbath released their debut album in February 1970, which was a major commercial success. The band's music was a fusion of blues, psychedelia, and heavy metal, and their dark and occult-inspired lyrics captured the imagination of many young people.\n\nOver the next few years, Black Sabbath released a string of successful albums, including Paranoid (1970), Master of Reality (1971), and Vol. 4 (1972). The band's music was characterized by Osbourne's raw and emotive vocals, Iommi's heavy and distorted guitar riffs, Butler's melodic bass lines, and Ward's driving drum beats.\n\n**Dismissal**\n\nIn 1978, Osbourne left Black Sabbath for three months to pursue a solo project called Blizzard of Ozz. Three members of the band Necromandus, who had supported Sabbath in Birmingham when they were called Earth, backed Osbourne in the studio and briefly became the first incarnation of his solo band.\n\n**Solo Career**\n\nAfter leaving Black Sabbath, Osbourne recalled, \"I'd got £96,000 for my share of the name, so I'd just locked myself away and spent three months doing coke and booze My thinking was, 'This is my last party, because after this I'm going back to Birmingham and the dole.\" However, Don Arden signed him to Jet Records with the aim of recording new material.\n\nArden dispatched his daughter Sharon to Los Angeles to \"look after Ozzy's needs, whatever they were\", to protect his investment. Arden initially hoped Osbourne would return to Sabbath, who he was personally managing at that time, and later attempted to convince the singer to name his new band \"Son of Sabbath\", which Osbourne hated.\n\nSharon attempted to convince Osbourne to form a supergroup with guitarist Gary Moore. \"When I lived in Los Angeles\", Moore recalled, \" [Moore's band] G-Force helped him to audition musicians If drummers were trying out, I played guitar, and if a bassist came along, my drummer would help out We felt sorry for him, basically He was always hovering around trying to get me to join, and I wasn't having any of it.\"\n\n**Ozzfest**\n\nOsbourne's biggest financial success of the 1990s was a venture named Ozzfest, created and managed by his wife/manager Sharon and assisted by his son Jack. The first Ozzfest was held in Phoenix, Arizona, on October 25, 1996, and in Devore, California, on October 26.\n\nOzzfest was an instant hit with metal fans, helping many up-and-coming groups who were featured there to broad exposure and commercial success. Some acts shared the bill with a reformed Black Sabbath during the 1997 Ozzfest tour, beginning in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n**2000s**\n\nDown to Earth, Osbourne's first album of new studio material in six years, was released on October 16, 2001. A live album, Live at Budokan, followed in 2002. Down to Earth, which achieved platinum status in 2003, featured the single \"Dreamer\", a song which peaked at number 10 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks.\n\nIn June 2002, Osbourne was invited to participate in the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, performing the Black Sabbath anthem \"Paranoid\" at the Party at the Palace concert in the grounds of Buckingham Palace.\n\n**2010s**\n\nOn April 13, 2010, Osbourne announced the release date for Scream would be June 15, 2010. The release date was later changed to a week later. A single from the album, \"Let Me Hear You Scream\", debuted on April 14, 2010, episode of CSI: NY. The song spent eight weeks on the Billboard Rock Songs chart, peaking at No 7.\n\n**2020s**\n\nOn February 21, 2020, Osbourne released his first solo album in almost ten years, Ordinary Man, which received positive reviews from music critics and debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart. A few days after the release, Osbourne told iHeartRadio that he wanted to make another album with Andrew Watt, the main producer of Ordinary Man.\n\nOne week after the release of the album, an 8-bit video game dedicated to Osbourne was released, called Legend of Ozzy. Osbourne has started working on his follow-up album, once again with Andrew Watt. In November 2021, Sony announced that Osbourne's album would be released within six months.\n\n**Black Sabbath Reunion**\n\nIt was announced on November 11, 2011, during a news conference at the Whisky a Go Go club on West Hollywood's Sunset Strip that the original Black Sabbath lineup of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward would reunite for a world tour and new album, to be produced by Rick Rubin.\n\nWard dropped out for contractual reasons, but the project continued with Rage Against the Machine's Brad Wilk stepping in for Ward on drums. On May 21, 2012, Black Sabbath played at the O2 Academy in their hometown Birmingham, their first concert since their reunion.\n\nThe album, entitled 13, was released on June 11, 2013, and topped both the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nThroughout his career, many religious groups have accused Osbourne of being a negative influence on teenagers, stating that his genre of rock music has been used to glorify Satanism. Scholar Christopher M Moreman compared the controversy to those levelled against the occultist Aleister Crowley.\n\nBoth were demonised by the media and some religious groups for their antics. Although Osbourne tempts the comparison with his song \"Mr Crowley\", he denies being a Satanist; conversely, it has been reported that Osbourne is a member of the Church of England and that he prays before taking the stage each night before every concert.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nIn 1971, Osbourne met his first wife Thelma Riley at the Rum Runner, the Birmingham nightclub where she worked. They were married later that year and children Jessica and Louis were soon born. Osbourne later referred to his first marriage as \"a terrible mistake\".\n\nHis drug and alcohol use, coupled with his frequent absences while touring with Black Sabbath, took their toll on his family life; his children later complained that he was not a good father. In the 2011 documentary film God Bless Ozzy Osbourne, produced by his son Jack, Osbourne admitted that he could not even remember when Louis and Jessica were born.\n\n**Drug and Alcohol Use**\n\nOsbourne has misused alcohol and other drugs for most of his adult life. He admitted to Sounds in 1978, \"I get high, I get fucked up .. what the hell's wrong with getting fucked up? There must be something wrong with the system if so many people have to get fucked up .. I never take dope or anything before I go on stage I'll smoke a joint or whatever afterwards.\"\n\nBlack Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi said that while all the band were involved with alcohol and other drugs to various degrees in the 1970s, Osbourne had the unhealthiest lifestyle of them all. Despite this, said Iommi, he was typically the only one left standing when the others were \"out for the count\".\n\n**Legacy**\n\nOsbourne is considered an icon of hard rock music, and one of the founders of heavy metal music through his work with Black Sabbath. He dislikes being categorized as metal, stating that while his band \"plays heavy\", other bands that are considered metal are \"really heavy\".\n\n\"When you get pigeonholed with a certain [genre], it can be very difficult to do something a bit lighter or an acoustic track or whatever you want to do Back in the day, it was always just rock music It’s still just rock music.\"\n\n**Band Members**\n\nCurrent members:\n\n* Ozzy Osbourne - lead vocals\n* Tony Iommi - guitar\n* Geezer Butler - bass\n* Brad Wilk - drums\n\n**Awards**\n\nOsbourne has received several awards for his contributions to the music community. In 1994, he was awarded a Grammy Award for the track \"I Don't Want to Change the World\" from Live & Loud for Best Metal Performance of 1994.\n\nAt the 2004 NME Awards in London, Osbourne received the award for Godlike Genius. In 2005 Osbourne was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame both as a solo artist and as a member of Black Sabbath.\n\nIn 2006, he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi, Bill Ward, and Geezer Butler. In 2024, Osbourne was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for his solo career.\n\n**Discography**\n\n* Blizzard of Ozz (1980)\n* Diary of a Madman (1981)\n* Speak of the Devil (1982)\n* Bark
