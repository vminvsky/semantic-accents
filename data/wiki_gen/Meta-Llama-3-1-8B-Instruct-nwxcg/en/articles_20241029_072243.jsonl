The region was also home to numerous other indigenous groups, who developed their own distinct cultures and traditions.\n\nThe Mayans were a major civilization in the region, known for their advanced knowledge of astronomy and mathematics. They developed a complex system of writing and a sophisticated calendar system. The Mayans also built elaborate cities and temples, which were often decorated with intricate carvings and sculptures.\n\nThe Aztecs, who were a powerful and militaristic society, also played a significant role in the history of Dzuluinicob. They built a vast empire that stretched from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico, and their capital city, Tenochtitlan, was one of the largest and most advanced cities in the world.\n\n## Columbian\n\nThe arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century had a profound impact on the indigenous populations of Dzuluinicob. Many of the native communities were decimated by disease, violence, and forced labor. The Spanish also imposed their own language, culture, and religion on the region, leading to the suppression of indigenous traditions and customs.\n\nDespite these challenges, the indigenous populations of Dzuluinicob continued to resist Spanish rule and maintain their cultural identity. Many of the native communities formed alliances with other groups, such as the French and the English, in an effort to resist Spanish colonization.\n\n# Society\n\nThe society of Dzuluinicob was complex and diverse, with numerous indigenous communities developing their own distinct cultures and traditions.

Many of these societies were matrilineal, with women playing a significant role in the transmission of property and social status.\n\nThe economy of Dzuluinicob was based on agriculture, with many of the native communities developing sophisticated irrigation systems and crop rotation techniques. The region was also home to numerous trade networks, which connected the region to other parts of Mesoamerica and beyond.\n\n# Legacy\n\n## Scholarly\n\nThe legacy of Dzuluinicob can be seen in the many scholarly studies and research projects that have focused on the region's history, culture, and geography. Many of these studies have shed new light on the complex societies and civilizations that once flourished in the region, and have helped to preserve the cultural heritage of the indigenous populations.\n\nThe study of Dzuluinicob has also contributed to our understanding of the broader history of the Americas, including the impacts of colonization and the processes of cultural exchange and transformation.\n\n# Notes and references\n\n## Explanatory footnotes\n\n1.

This article will examine notable sets of music written in all 24 keys, composers who have written multiple sets, and variants of this concept.\n\n**Notable Sets that Cover All 24 Keys**\n\nOne of the most famous examples of music written in all 24 keys is J.S. Bach's _The Well-Tempered Clavier_. This work, composed between 1722 and 1742, consists of two books, each containing 24 preludes and fugues, one in each major and minor key. Bach's _The Well-Tempered Clavier_ is not only a masterpiece of Baroque music but also a groundbreaking work in the exploration of tonality.\n\nAnother notable example is the _Harmonia Universalis_ by Georg Philipp Telemann, composed in 1713. This work, written for the Hamburger Oper, consists of 24 arias, one in each major and minor key, and is considered one of the earliest examples of music written in all 24 keys.\n\n**Composers Who Wrote Multiple Sets**\n\nSeveral composers have written multiple sets of music in all 24 keys. One such composer is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who wrote a set of 24 minuets, one in each key, in 1787. Mozart's minuets are considered some of the most elegant and refined examples of music written in all 24 keys.\n\nOther composers who have written multiple sets include:\n\n* Heinrich Christoph Koch, who wrote a set of 24 sonatas, one in each key, in 1793\n* Simon Sechter, who wrote a set of 24 fugues, one in each key, in 1834\n* Sergei Rachmaninoff, who wrote a set of 24 preludes, one in each key, in 1917\n\n**Variants**\n\nWhile music written in all 24 keys is a specific concept, there are several variants of this idea. One such variant is the single piece that modulates through many keys. An example of this is the _Toccata and Fugue in D minor_ by J.S. Bach, which modulates through several keys before resolving in D minor.\n\nAnother variant is the work that covers all eight church modes. An example of this is the _Fantasia in C minor_ by Johann Sebastian Bach, which explores all eight church modes.\n\n**Other Sets of 24 Pieces**\n\nThere are several other sets of 24 pieces that cover all 24 keys. One such example is the _24 Preludes for Piano_ by Alexander Scriabin, composed in 1910. This work consists of 24 preludes, one in each key, and is considered one of the most important works of early 20th-century music.\n\n**Keys**\n\nThe order of keys in published works can vary depending on the composer and the specific work. However, there are some common patterns that emerge. For example, many composers begin with the major keys and then proceed to the minor keys, or vice versa.\n\nIn some cases, composers have used the order of keys in a specific pattern, such as the order of the circle of fifths. This pattern, in which the keys are arranged in a circular pattern with the major keys on one side and the minor keys on the other, has been used by several composers.\n\n**History**\n\n**Bach and His Precursors**\n\nThe concept of music written in all 24 keys dates back to the 17th century, with composers such as Heinrich Schütz and Samuel Scheidt writing sets of music in all 24 keys. However, it was J.S. Bach who is often credited with fully realizing this concept in his _The Well-Tempered Clavier_.\n\n**After Bach**\n\n**18th and 19th Centuries**\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, the concept of music written in all 24 keys continued to evolve. Composers such as Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven wrote sets of music in all 24 keys, and the concept became increasingly popular.\n\n**20th Century**\n\nIn the 20th century, the concept of music written in all 24 keys continued to evolve, with composers such as Sergei Rachmaninoff, Alexander Scriabin, and Igor Stravinsky writing sets of music in all 24 keys.\n\n**21st Century**\n\nIn the 21st century, the concept of music written in all 24 keys has continued to evolve, with composers such as John Adams, Arvo Pärt, and Thomas Adès writing sets of music in all 24 keys.\n\n**Notes**\n\nMusic written in all 24 keys is a complex and multifaceted concept that has evolved over time. From the early examples of Heinrich Schütz and Samuel Scheidt to the modern works of John Adams and Arvo Pärt, the concept has continued to evolve and adapt to changing musical tastes and styles.\n\n**References**\n\n* Bach, J.S.

Throughout his career, An has won numerous awards and accolades, including multiple Olympic medals and World Championship titles.\n\n## Early life and education\nViktor An was born in Seoul, South Korea on April 3, 1980. He began speed skating at a young age and quickly demonstrated a natural talent for the sport. An attended the Korea National Sports University (KNSU), where he studied physical education and trained with the Korean national short track speed skating team.\n\n## Career\n### 2000s\n#### Early career and the 2002 Winter Olympics\nAn made his international debut at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. He was a member of the Korean national team, which was considered one of the favorites to win the gold medal in the 5000m relay event. However, the team struggled with consistency and ultimately finished fourth.\n\n#### National team 'recommendation system'\nIn the lead-up to the 2002 Winter Olympics, An and several other Korean short track speed skaters were placed on a \"recommendation system\" by the Korea Skating Union (KSU). This system allowed the coaches to recommend which athletes should compete in certain events.

The reforms aim to alter the balance of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, but critics argue that they would undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Israeli Supreme Court and Judicial Review\n\nThe Israeli Supreme Court is the highest court in the country and has the power to review the constitutionality of laws and government actions. The court has played a crucial role in shaping Israeli law and has been a key factor in maintaining the rule of law in the country.\n\n### 1992 Constitutional Revolution and its Discontents\n\nIn 1992, the Israeli government passed the Basic Laws, which effectively established a constitution for the country. However, the laws did not grant the Supreme Court the power to review the constitutionality of Basic Laws themselves. This led to criticism that the court's power was limited and that it was not an equal branch of government.\n\n### 2018–2022 Israeli Political Crisis and 2022 Legislative Election\n\nIn 2018, the Israeli government collapsed, leading to a series of unstable governments and a deepening political crisis. The crisis culminated in the 2022 legislative election, which saw the rise of the Yamina party, led by Naftali Bennett. Bennett's party campaigned on a platform of judicial reform, which would ultimately become the focus of the 2023 reform.\n\n**Legislative History**\n\n### HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v. Knesset (2024)\n\nIn 2024, the Movement for Quality Government in Israel filed a petition with the Supreme Court challenging the government's judicial reform. The petition argued that the reform would undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. The court's ruling on the petition is still pending.\n\n**Proposed Changes**\n\n### Judicial Selection\n\n#### Current System\n\nThe current system of judicial selection in Israel is based on a committee composed of judges, lawyers, and academics. The committee selects candidates for the Supreme Court, but the final decision is made by the President of Israel. The system has been criticized for being opaque and for giving too much power to the President.\n\n#### Proposed System\n\nThe proposed system would give the government a larger role in selecting judges, with the committee's recommendations subject to cabinet approval. This has sparked concerns that politicians would be able to influence the selection of judges and that the independence of the judiciary would be undermined.\n\n#### Arguments in Favor of the Reform\n\nProponents of the reform argue that it would bring more transparency and accountability to the judicial selection process. They also argue that the current system is undemocratic and that the government should have more control over the judiciary.\n\n#### Arguments Against the Reform\n\nCritics of the reform argue that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. They also argue that the proposed system would be subject to political interference and that it would erode the trust in the judiciary.\n\n### Government Legal Advisors\n\nThe government has proposed a new role for government legal advisors, who would be responsible for advising the government on the constitutionality of laws and government actions. Critics argue that this would create a conflict of interest and that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary.\n\n### Constitutional Review\n\nThe proposed reform also includes a provision that would allow the government to override the Supreme Court's decisions in certain cases. Critics argue that this would undermine the rule of law and that it would give the government too much power.\n\n### Override Clause\n\nThe override clause has sparked intense debate, with proponents arguing that it would bring more stability to the government and critics arguing that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary.\n\n### Abolition of \"Unreasonableness\" Grounds\n\nThe proposed reform also includes a provision that would abolish the grounds of \"unreasonableness\" for judicial review. Critics argue that this would limit the power of the judiciary to review the constitutionality of laws and government actions.\n\n#### Arguments in Favor of the Reform\n\nProponents of abolishing the grounds of \"unreasonableness\" argue that it would bring more clarity and predictability to the judicial review process.\n\n#### Arguments Against the Reform\n\nCritics of abolishing the grounds of \"unreasonableness\" argue that it would undermine the power of the judiciary to review the constitutionality of laws and government actions.\n\n### Status of the Attorney-General\n\nThe proposed reform also includes a provision that would give the Attorney-General a new role in advising the government on the constitutionality of laws and government actions. Critics argue that this would create a conflict of interest and that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### National\n\nThe proposed reform has sparked intense debate in Israel, with proponents arguing that it would bring more stability and accountability to the government and critics arguing that it would undermine the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law.\n\n### International\n\nThe proposed reform has sparked international concern, with many countries and international organizations expressing concerns about the potential impact on the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.\n\n### Connection to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict\n\nThe proposed reform has also sparked concerns about its potential impact on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with some arguing that it would undermine the Palestinian right to self-determination and others arguing that it would strengthen Israel's position in the conflict.\n\n**Suspension and Overruling**\n\nIn 2024, the Supreme Court suspended the implementation of the proposed reform, pending its ruling on the Movement for Quality Government in Israel's petition. The court has yet to issue its ruling, and the future of the proposed reform remains uncertain.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Israeli Supreme Court\n* Judicial review\n* Rule of law\n* Independence of the judiciary\n* Israeli-Palestinian conflict\n\n**References**\n\n* (none)\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Israeli Ministry of Justice\n* Israeli Supreme Court\n* Movement for Quality Government in Israel", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2023_Israeli_judicial_reform\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Israeli Supreme Court and judicial review\n##1992 Constitutional Revolution and its discontents\n##2018–2022 Israeli political crisis and 2022 legislative election\n#Legislative history\n##HCJ 5658/23 Movement for Quality Government in Israel v.

The project was initially met with skepticism, with some cast members and crew members expressing concerns about the viability of the franchise. However, the group ultimately decided to move forward with the project, with a focus on creating a film that would be both a celebration of the franchise's legacy and a bold new direction for the series.\n\n### Bam Margera's firing\n\nIn 2020, it was announced that Bam Margera had been fired from the project due to creative differences and personal issues. Margera had been a key cast member on the original Jackass series and had appeared in all three previous films. However, his involvement in the project was reportedly tense, with some cast members and crew members expressing concerns about his behavior and attitude. Despite his firing, Margera is still credited as a cast member in the film, although he does not appear in any stunts or sketches.\n\n### Casting\n\nThe casting process for Jackass Forever was extensive, with the main cast and crew working to recruit a diverse and talented group of performers. The film features a mix of seasoned actors and comedians, as well as several newcomers to the franchise. The casting process was reportedly grueling, with the main cast and crew working to find performers who could bring a unique perspective and energy to the film.\n\n### Filming\n\nFilming for Jackass Forever began in 2020 and wrapped in 2021. The film was shot on location in various parts of the United States, including California, Nevada, and New York. The shoot was reportedly intense, with the main cast and crew working long hours to capture a wide range of stunts and sketches. The film's stunt team was led by Jason \"Wee Man\" Acuña, who has been a key member of the franchise for over two decades.\n\n### Injuries\n\nAs with previous Jackass films, the production of Jackass Forever was marked by several injuries and accidents. The main cast and crew worked to mitigate the risks of the stunts and sketches, but several performers were still injured during filming. The injuries ranged from minor to severe, with some performers requiring hospitalization and surgery. Despite the risks, the main cast and crew remained committed to the project, with a focus on pushing the limits of physical comedy and danger.\n\n**Release**\n\n### Home media\n\nJackass Forever was released on digital and Blu-ray in 2022. The home media release features a range of bonus materials, including deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and interviews with the main cast and crew. The release was met with positive reviews, with many critics praising the film's irreverent humor and outrageous stunts.\n\n**Reception**\n\n### Box office\n\nJackass Forever performed well at the box office, grossing over $100 million worldwide. The film's success was driven by a mix of positive word-of-mouth and a strong marketing campaign. The film's box office performance was seen as a vindication of the franchise's enduring popularity, with many fans and critics praising the film's bold and irreverent approach to comedy.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe critical response to Jackass Forever was largely positive, with many reviewers praising the film's outrageous stunts and irreverent humor. The film holds a 77% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with many critics praising the film's energy and enthusiasm. However, some critics noted that the film's tone was sometimes uneven, with some segments feeling more like sketches than fully formed stunts. Despite this, the film's overall tone and approach were seen as a celebration of the franchise's legacy and a bold new direction for the series.\n\n**Jackass 4.5**\n\nIn 2022, it was announced that a spin-off film titled Jackass 4.5 was in development. The film was reportedly a more experimental and avant-garde take on the Jackass franchise, with a focus on pushing the limits of physical comedy and danger. The film's production was overseen by the main cast and crew, with a focus on creating a unique and bold new direction for the series.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jackass_Forever\" following this outline:\n\n#Synopsis\n#Cast\n##Guest appearances\n##Crew\n#Production\n##Development\n##Bam Margera's firing\n##Casting\n##Filming\n##Injuries\n#Release\n##Home media\n#Reception\n##Box office\n##Critical response\n#Jackass 4.5\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Kennedy\n\nThe assassination of John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, occurred on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was shot while riding in an open-top car in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza, a public park in downtown Dallas. The event was a pivotal moment in American history, and its impact continues to be felt today.\n\nBackground\n\n### Kennedy\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was the 35th President of the United States, serving from January 1961 until his death in 1963. He was a member of the Democratic Party and was known for his charisma, leadership, and vision for the country. Kennedy's presidency was marked by several significant events, including the Cuban Missile Crisis and the beginning of the space program.\n\n### Oswald\n\nLee Harvey Oswald was a 24-year-old former Marine who had a history of ideological and psychological instability. He had lived in the Soviet Union and had been a member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, a group that advocated for closer ties between the United States and Cuba. Oswald had also been known to be interested in communism and was a vocal supporter of Fidel Castro.\n\nNovember 22\n\n### Kennedy's arrival in Dallas and route to Dealey Plaza\n\nOn November 22, 1963, Kennedy arrived in Dallas, Texas, as part of a two-day trip to Texas to boost his re-election campaign. He was scheduled to give a speech at the Dallas Trade Mart, but first, he was to ride in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza, a public park in downtown Dallas. The motorcade route took Kennedy through the streets of Dallas, with thousands of spectators lining the streets to catch a glimpse of the President.\n\n### Shooting\n\nAt 12:30 PM Central Standard Time, Kennedy's motorcade turned onto Elm Street in Dealey Plaza. As the car turned, shots rang out from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building. Kennedy was struck in the neck and head, and Governor John Connally, who was riding in the car with Kennedy, was also hit. The car sped away from the scene, with the driver, Secret Service agent William Greer, trying to get Kennedy to safety.\n\n### Aftermath in Dealey Plaza\n\nAs the motorcade sped away from Dealey Plaza, chaos erupted in the streets. Thousands of spectators were in shock, and many were screaming and crying. The Secret Service agents in the car with Kennedy were trying to tend to the President's wounds, but it was clear that he was mortally hurt. Meanwhile, a group of bystanders rushed to the Texas School Book Depository building, where they found a rifle on the sixth floor.\n\n### Oswald's flight, killing of J. D. Tippit, and arrest\n\nLee Harvey Oswald quickly fled the scene of the crime, disappearing into the crowd of spectators. He made his way to a nearby movie theater, where he watched the news coverage of the assassination. Meanwhile, a police officer, J. D. Tippit, was killed by Oswald in a s", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n##Kennedy\n##Oswald\n#November 22\n##Kennedy's arrival in Dallas and route to Dealey Plaza\n##Shooting\n##Aftermath in Dealey Plaza\n##Oswald's flight, killing of J.

The country's strict laws and social norms restrict women's rights, freedoms, and opportunities. Women in Iran face numerous challenges, including limited access to education, employment, and healthcare. The government has also enforced strict dress codes, requiring women to wear the hijab, a headscarf, and loose-fitting clothing.\n\n### Protest movements under the Islamic Republic\n\nDespite the risks, women in Iran have a long history of protesting against the government's restrictions and policies. In 1979, the Iranian Revolution led by Ayatollah Khomeini saw widespread protests and demonstrations, including those led by women who demanded equal rights and freedoms. In the following decades, women continued to protest against the government's policies, including the introduction of the hijab in 1979.\n\n### Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody\n\nMahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, was arrested on September 13, 2022, by the morality police in Tehran for allegedly not adhering to the country's strict dress code. According to eyewitnesses, Amini was beaten and mistreated during her arrest. Three days later, she was transferred to a hospital, where she fell into a coma and later died. The cause of her death remains disputed, with the government attributing it to a pre-existing medical condition, while her family and human rights groups claim she was beaten to death in custody.\n\n**Protests**\n\n### Slogans and grievances\n\nThe protests that began in Tehran on September 16, 2022, quickly spread to other cities across Iran, with protesters chanting slogans such as \"Women, Life, Freedom\" and \"Death to the Dictator.\" The protesters demanded justice for Mahsa Amini, an end to the morality police, and greater freedoms for women. They also called for the resignation of the president and the supreme leader.\n\n### Iranian public opinion\n\nPublic opinion in Iran is divided, with some supporting the protests and others opposing them. Many Iranians have expressed sympathy for the protesters and demanded greater freedoms and human rights. However, the government has also received support from some Iranians who see the protests as a threat to national security and stability.\n\n### Protest techniques\n\nProtesters have employed various tactics, including street demonstrations, sit-ins, and online activism. They have also used social media platforms to share information and coordinate their actions. The protests have been largely peaceful, with some exceptions, including clashes between protesters and security forces.\n\n### Civil boycotts\n\nIn some cities, protesters have called for civil boycotts of government services, including schools, universities, and government offices. The boycotts have been largely successful, with many institutions and businesses shutting down or operating at reduced levels.\n\n### Media Western coverage\n\nWestern media have largely covered the protests extensively, with many outlets providing live coverage and analysis. However, some Iranian media outlets have been critical of the coverage, accusing Western media of sensationalism and bias.\n\n**Casualties, government response**\n\n### Casualties\n\nAccording to official figures, over 400 people have been killed in the protests, including security forces and civilians. However, human rights groups have reported significantly higher casualty figures, with some estimates suggesting over 1,000 people have been killed.\n\n### Government casualties\n\nThe government has acknowledged that some security forces have been killed in the protests, with reports suggesting over 100 security personnel have been killed.\n\n### Arrests and death sentences\n\nTens of thousands of people have been arrested in connection with the protests, including activists, journalists, and ordinary citizens. Many have been charged with crimes such as inciting violence and spreading dissent.

SVB was a commercial bank that specialized in serving the financial needs of the technology industry, particularly startups and venture capital firms.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 in Santa Clara, California, and grew to become one of the largest banks in the United States, with over $200 billion in assets. The bank's collapse was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, after the failure of Washington Mutual in 2008. The collapse of SVB had significant consequences for its customers, shareholders, and the broader financial system.\n\n**Background**\n\nSilicon Valley Bank was a commercial bank that focused on serving the financial needs of the technology industry. The bank provided a range of financial services, including deposit accounts, loans, and investment banking services. SVB was known for its expertise in serving the needs of startups and venture capital firms, and it became a leading bank in the technology industry.\n\n**Collapse**\n\nThe collapse of SVB was the result of a combination of factors, including a decline in the bank's stock price, a loss of investor confidence, and a significant decline in the value of the bank's assets.\n\n### Losses\n\nThe bank's collapse was triggered by a series of significant losses. In 2022, the bank invested heavily in the bond market, purchasing bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and other government agencies. However, the bond market declined sharply in 2023, resulting in significant losses for the bank. The bank's stock price also declined sharply, further exacerbating the bank's financial difficulties.\n\n### Instability\n\nAs the bank's financial situation deteriorated, investor confidence in the bank declined. Depositors began to withdraw their funds, and the bank's liquidity position became increasingly uncertain. The bank's management attempted to stabilize the situation by raising capital and selling assets, but these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n### Receivership\n\nOn March 10, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) took control of the bank, placing it into receivership. The DFPI appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as the receiver, and the FDIC took over the management of the bank's assets and liabilities.\n\n### Acquisition\n\nThe FDIC sold the bank's assets to First Citizens Bank, a North Carolina-based bank, for $16.5 billion. The sale included the bank's deposits, loans, and other assets, and it marked the end of the bank's operations.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe collapse of SVB had significant effects on its customers, shareholders, and the broader financial system.\n\n### Customers\n\nThe collapse of SVB resulted in significant disruptions to the bank's customers. Depositors who had funds in the bank were able to access their deposits up to the $250,000 insurance limit provided by the FDIC. However, some customers who had funds in excess of the insurance limit experienced losses. The bank's customers also faced difficulties in accessing their accounts and managing their financial affairs.\n\n### Shareholders\n\nThe collapse of SVB resulted in significant losses for the bank's shareholders. The bank's stock price declined sharply in the months leading up to the bank's collapse, and shareholders who held shares in the bank were left with significant losses.\n\n### Financial system\n\nThe collapse of SVB had significant effects on the broader financial system. The bank's failure highlighted the risks associated with the banking industry and the importance of effective regulation and oversight. The collapse of the bank also underscored the need for banks to maintain adequate capital levels and to manage their risk exposure effectively.\n\n### Legal actions\n\nThe collapse of SVB also raised questions about the bank's management and the actions of its executives. The FDIC and other regulatory agencies launched investigations into the bank's activities and the actions of its management. The bank's executives faced significant scrutiny, and some individuals were ultimately charged with wrongdoing.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nThe collapse of SVB sparked significant reactions from officials and commentators.\n\n### Official responses\n\nThe FDIC and other regulatory agencies responded quickly to the bank's collapse, taking steps to protect depositors and to maintain stability in the financial system. The FDIC also launched an investigation into the bank's activities and the actions of its management.\n\n### Debate over government intervention\n\nThe collapse of SVB raised questions about the role of government intervention in the banking industry. Some commentators argued that the government should have intervened earlier to prevent the bank's collapse, while others argued that the government should not have intervened and that the market should have been allowed to sort out the bank's problems.\n\n### Debate about causes\n\nThe collapse of SVB also raised questions about the causes of the bank's failure. Some commentators attributed the bank's collapse to the bank's management and the actions of its executives, while others argued that the bank's collapse was the result of broader economic factors, such as the decline in the bond market and the rise of fintech companies.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Washington Mutual\n* Bank failures in the United States\n* Commercial banking\n* Deposit insurance\n* Financial regulation\n* Silicon Valley Bank", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Collapse_of_Silicon_Valley_Bank\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Collapse\n##Losses\n##Instability\n##Receivership\n##Acquisition\n#Effects\n##Customers\n##Shareholders\n##Financial system\n##Legal actions\n#Reactions\n##Official responses\n##Debate over government intervention\n##Debate about causes\n#See also\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

With a career spanning over three decades, Harding has built a reputation as a risk-taker and a pioneer in various industries.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\nHamish Harding was born on June 18, 1964, in London, England. His early life and education are not well-documented, but it is known that he developed an interest in aviation and entrepreneurship from a young age. Harding attended a prestigious boarding school in the United Kingdom, where he excelled in his studies and developed a passion for flying.\n\n## Career and Adventures\n\nHarding's career began in the 1980s when he worked as a trader on the London Stock Exchange. He quickly made a name for himself as a shrewd and ambitious businessman, earning a reputation for his ability to take calculated risks and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In the early 1990s, Harding founded his own financial services company, which quickly gained a reputation as a leading player in the industry.\n\nIn addition to his business ventures, Harding has also had a successful career as an explorer and adventurer. He has completed several high-profile expeditions, including a record-breaking flight around the world in a private jet. Harding has also climbed some of the world's highest mountains, including Mount Everest and K2.\n\n## Titan Expedition and Death\n\nIn 2019, Harding was part of a team of experienced explorers and scientists who embarked on an expedition to the surface of Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. The team, which included astronauts and engineers from around the world, aimed to explore the moon's surface and gather data on its geology and atmospheric conditions.\n\nTragically, the expedition ended in disaster when Harding's spacecraft, the Titan Explorer, experienced a catastrophic malfunction and crashed on the moon's surface. Harding and his crew were killed in the accident, which was one of the most significant space-related tragedies in recent history.\n\n## Personal Life\n\nHarding was known to be a private person, and little is known about his personal life. However, it is reported that he was married with two children and lived in a luxury home in the United Kingdom. Harding was also known to be a philanthropist and supported several charitable causes, including organizations that promoted education and healthcare in developing countries.\n\n## Awards and Recognition\n\nDespite his untimely death, Harding's contributions to the fields of business, exploration, and science have been recognized and celebrated. He was posthumously awarded several honors and accolades, including the Order of the British Empire and the Congressional Space Medal of Honor. Harding's legacy continues to inspire new generations of entrepreneurs, explorers, and scientists, and his memory will be remembered for years to come.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Titan (moon)\n* Space exploration\n* Business and entrepreneurship\n* Aviation and aerospace\n\n## External Links\n\n* Hamish Harding's official website\n* NASA's webpage on the Titan Expedition\n* The Guardian's obituary of Hamish Harding\n* BBC News' article on the Titan Expedition tragedy", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Hamish_Harding\" following this outline:\n\n#Early life and education\n#Career and adventures\n#Titan expedition and death\n#Personal life\n#Awards and recognition\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The team's home stadium is the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, Paris.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nFrance has a rich football history, with a strong following and a reputation for producing talented players. The team has won numerous international titles, including two FIFA World Cup trophies and one UEFA European Championship. France has also been a dominant force in European football, consistently qualifying for major tournaments.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early years (1900–1930s)\n\nThe France national team was founded in 1904, and its early years were marked by inconsistent performances. France's first international match was against Belgium on April 1, 1904, which ended in a 3–3 draw. The team's first major tournament was the 1908 Summer Olympics, where France finished fourth. In the 1920s, France began to establish itself as a competitive team, qualifying for the 1920 and 1924 Olympics.\n\n### 1950s–1980s\n\nFrance's golden era began in the 1950s, with the team winning the 1958 FIFA World Cup under the guidance of Coach Albert Batteux. The team's success continued in the 1960s, with a second World Cup title in 1966. However, the team's performance declined in the 1970s and 1980s, failing to qualify for the 1974 and 1978 World Cups. France's fortunes improved in the 1980s, with the team finishing fourth in the 1986 World Cup.\n\n### Zidane era and World Champions (1996–2006)\n\nThe 1990s saw the emergence of French football's golden generation, led by iconic players such as Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry, and David Trezeguet. Under Coach Aimé Jacquet, France won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, defeating Brazil 3–0 in the final. The team's success continued in the 2000s, with a second World Cup title in 2006 under Coach Raymond Domenech. Zidane's leadership and skill were instrumental in France's success during this period.\n\n### Decline and rebuild (2007–2015)\n\nFrance's performance declined in the late 2000s and early 2010s, failing to qualify for the 2010 World Cup. The team's fortunes improved under Coach Laurent Blanc, who led France to the 2012 UEFA European Championship final. However, the team's performance continued to be inconsistent, with a disappointing exit from the 2014 World Cup.\n\n### Renewed success (2016–present)\n\nUnder Coach Didier Deschamps, France won the 2018 FIFA World Cup, defeating Croatia 4–2 in the final. The team's success continued in the 2019 UEFA Nations League, where France won the inaugural tournament. France's renewed success is attributed to the team's young and talented squad, which includes players such as Kylian Mbappé and Paul Pogba.\n\n**Home stadium**\n\nThe France national team's home stadium is the Stade de France, located in Saint-Denis, Paris. The stadium was built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and has a seating capacity of over 81,000. The stadium has hosted numerous high-profile matches, including the 2006 FIFA World Cup final and the 2019 UEFA Nations League final.\n\n**Team image**\n\n### Media coverage\n\nThe France national team receives extensive media coverage, with matches broadcast on major television networks and streaming platforms. The team's social media presence is also significant, with millions of followers on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram.\n\n### Kits and crest\n\nThe France national team's kit is manufactured by Adidas, and the team's crest features the country's coat of arms. The kit sponsorship deal is worth millions of euros per year, making Adidas one of the team's largest sponsors.\n\n### Kit deals\n\nThe France national team's kit deals are among the most lucrative in the world, with Adidas paying millions of euros per year to manufacture and supply the team's kits.\n\n### Nickname\n\nThe France national team is commonly known as the \"Les Bleus\" (The Blues), due to the team's blue jerseys.\n\n**Results and fixtures**\n\n### 2023\n\nFrance's schedule for the 2023 calendar year includes several high-profile matches, including a friendly against Germany and a UEFA Nations League match against Denmark.\n\n### 2024\n\nFrance's schedule for the 2024 calendar year includes several high-profile matches, including a friendly against Brazil and a UEFA Nations League match against Austria.\n\n**Coaching staff**\n\n### Coaching history\n\nThe France national team has had several coaches throughout its history, including:\n\n* Albert Batteux (1955–1964)\n* Louis Dugauguez (1964–1967)\n* Georges Boulogne (1967–1973)\n* Michel Hidalgo (1974–1984)\n* Aimé Jacquet (1989–1993)\n* Aimé Jacquet (1993–1998)\n* Roger Lemerre (1998–2002)\n* Jacques Santini (2002–2004)\n* Raymond Domenech (2004–2010)\n* Laurent Blanc (2010–2012)\n* Didier Deschamps (2012–present)\n\n**Players**\n\n### Current squad\n\nThe France national team's current squad includes:\n\n* Goalkeepers: Hugo Lloris, Steve Mandanda, Alphonse Areola\n* Defenders: Raphaël Varane, Presnel Kimpembe, Dayot Upamecano, Benjamin Pavard, Lucas Hernández\n* Midfielders: Paul Pogba, N'Golo Kanté, Corentin Tolisso, Moussa Sissoko, Thomas Lemar\n* Forwards: Kylian Mbappé, Olivier Giroud, Antoine Griezmann, Alexandre Lacazette\n\n### Recent call-ups\n\nThe France national team has called up several players in recent months, including:\n\n* Amine Gouiri\n* Youssouf Fofana\n* Randal Kolo Muani\n\n### Player of the Year\n\nThe France national team's player of the year award is presented annually to the player who has made the most significant contribution to the team's success.

It is the largest of all the bear species and the largest land carnivore on Earth. Polar bears are well adapted to their Arctic habitat, with a white coat and a layer of fat to keep them warm in the extreme cold.\n\n**Naming**\n\nThe polar bear's scientific name, Ursus maritimus, is derived from the Latin words \"ursus,\" meaning bear, and \"maritimus,\" meaning sea or marine. The common name \"polar bear\" is thought to have originated from the bear's habitat in the Arctic Circle.\n\n**Taxonomy**\n\nThe polar bear belongs to the family Ursidae, which includes all the bear species. It is the only member of the genus Ursus that lives in the Arctic. The polar bear's closest relative is the brown bear (Ursus arctos), with which it can interbreed and produce fertile offspring.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nThe polar bear's evolution is closely linked to the evolution of the Arctic environment. The bear's ancestors are thought to have evolved from a population of brown bears that lived in the region millions of years ago. Over time, these bears adapted to the Arctic environment, developing a white coat to camouflage themselves in the snow and a layer of fat to keep warm in the extreme cold. The modern polar bear is thought to have emerged around 200,000 years ago.\n\n**Characteristics**\n\nThe polar bear is a large animal, with adult males weighing up to 1,700 pounds (770 kg) and reaching lengths of up to 9 feet (2.7 meters). The bear's white coat is made up of two layers: a thick undercoat and a longer, guard hair layer that helps to repel water and snow. The bear's fur is transparent, allowing sunlight to penetrate and help to keep the bear warm. The polar bear's eyes, nose, and mouth are black, which helps to absorb heat from the sun.\n\n**Distribution and Habitat**\n\nThe polar bear is found in the Arctic Circle, including the Arctic Ocean and surrounding land masses. The bear's range includes the Arctic regions of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Russia. The bear's habitat includes sea ice, tundra, and coastal areas.\n\n**Behaviour and Ecology**\n\n**Social Life**\n\nPolar bears are generally solitary animals, only coming together to mate or to feed on carrion. Female bears often have a home range, which they mark with scent to keep other bears away. Male bears, on the other hand, have a larger home range, which they use to hunt and feed.\n\n**Diet and Hunting**\n\nPolar bears are carnivores, and their diet consists mainly of seals, which they hunt on the sea ice. The bear uses its keen sense of smell and hearing to locate seals, and then ambushes them in the snow. The bear also eats other marine mammals, such as walruses and belugas, as well as fish and carrion.\n\n**Reproduction and Development**\n\nPolar bears breed in the spring, and the female bear gives birth to one or two cubs in the den. The cubs are born blind and helpless, but develop quickly, nursing on their mother's milk for several months. The cubs stay with their mother for up to two years, learning important survival skills such as hunting and navigating.\n\n**Mortality**\n\nPolar bears face several threats to their survival, including habitat loss due to climate change, human-caused mortality, and disease. The bear's main predators are orcas and other polar bears, although humans are a significant threat due to hunting and poaching.\n\n**Conservation Status**\n\nThe polar bear is listed as \"vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List, due to the decline in its sea ice habitat. The bear's population is estimated to be around 20,000-25,000 individuals, although this number is thought to be declining.\n\n**Relationship with Humans**\n\n**Exploitation**\n\nPolar bears have been hunted for their fur, meat, and organs for centuries. The bear's fur is highly prized for its quality and warmth, and is used to make clothing and accessories. The bear's organs, particularly its liver and kidneys, are also highly valued for their supposed medicinal properties.\n\n**Conflicts**\n\nPolar bears have come into conflict with humans in several ways, including habitat loss and fragmentation, human-caused mortality, and disease transmission. The bear's loss of sea ice habitat has led to increased encounters with humans, particularly in coastal areas.\n\n**Captivity**\n\nPolar bears are occasionally kept in captivity in zoos and aquariums, where they are used for educational and research purposes. However, the bear's captivity is often controversial, due to concerns about the bear's welfare and the ethics of keeping a wild animal in captivity.\n\n**Cultural Significance**\n\nThe polar bear has significant cultural and symbolic importance in many Arctic societies. The bear is often seen as a sacred animal, associated with strength, courage, and resilience. The bear's fur and organs are also highly valued for their supposed spiritual and medicinal properties.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Arctic ecosystem\n* Ursidae\n* Brown bear\n* Climate change\n* Habitat loss\n* Human-wildlife conflict\n* Polar bear hunting\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The polar bear is also known as the \"white bear\" or \"sea bear\".\n* The bear's scientific name, Ursus maritimus, is derived from the Latin words \"ursus,\" meaning bear, and \"maritimus,\" meaning sea or marine.\n* The polar bear's closest relative is the brown bear (Ursus arctos).\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Polar bear\" (2022).

He is considered one of the most important figures in the development of medieval philosophy and his works had a significant impact on the intellectual life of the Middle Ages.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nBoethius was born around 480 AD in Rome, Italy, to a noble family. His father, Flavius Manlius Boethius, was a senator and a member of the Anicii, a powerful and influential family in Rome. Boethius' mother's name is unknown, but it is believed that she may have been a member of the Roman aristocracy.\n\nBoethius received a classical education in Rome, studying literature, philosophy, and law. He was particularly interested in the works of Aristotle and Plato, and he spent many years studying and translating their works into Latin. Boethius' education was typical of the time, with a focus on classical texts and the development of rhetorical and philosophical skills.\n\n**Rise to Power**\n\nBoethius' career as a statesman and philosopher began in the early 520s, when he served as a consul in Rome. During this time, he became close friends with the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great, who had conquered Italy in 493 AD. Theodoric was a patron of the arts and sciences, and he saw Boethius as a valuable advisor and a potential successor.\n\nBoethius' rise to power was rapid, and he soon became one of the most influential men in Italy. He served as a consul again in 522 AD and was appointed as the magister officiorum, or master of ceremonies, which made him the chief administrator of the imperial court.\n\n**Downfall and Death**\n\nBoethius' downfall began in 523 AD, when he fell out of favor with Theodoric. The exact reason for this is unclear, but it is believed that Boethius may have opposed Theodoric's policies or that he had become too powerful and independent.\n\nAs a result, Boethius was imprisoned in Pavia, where he was held in a small cell with little food or water. Despite his difficult circumstances, Boethius continued to write and compose music, and he even composed a hymn to the Virgin Mary, which is still sung today.\n\nBoethius was eventually executed in 524 AD, along with his son-in-law, Symmachus, and several other high-ranking officials. The exact circumstances of his death are unclear, but it is believed that he may have been strangled or beheaded.\n\n**Major Works**\n\nBoethius' works are considered some of the most important in the history of philosophy. He wrote on a wide range of topics, including philosophy, mathematics, music, and theology.\n\n### **De consolatione philosophiae**\n\nOne of Boethius' most famous works is the \"Consolation of Philosophy,\" a philosophical treatise that explores the nature of good and evil, fortune and misfortune, and the human condition. In the book, Boethius uses the character of Lady Philosophy to guide the reader through a series of arguments and reflections on the nature of reality.\n\n### **De topicis differentiis**\n\nBoethius also wrote a work called \"De topicis differentiis,\" which is a treatise on logic and rhetoric. In the book, Boethius discusses the nature of argumentation and the use of logical and rhetorical devices in argumentation.\n\n### **De arithmetica**\n\nBoethius wrote a work on arithmetic, which is a treatise on mathematical topics such as numbers, proportions, and ratios. In the book, Boethius uses mathematical examples to illustrate his points and to argue for the importance of mathematical knowledge.\n\n### **De institutione musica**\n\nBoethius also wrote a work on music, which is a treatise on the theory and practice of music. In the book, Boethius discusses the nature of sound, the use of musical instruments, and the role of music in society.\n\n### **Opuscula sacra**\n\nBoethius wrote several shorter works on theological topics, including a treatise on the nature of God and a work on the Trinity. In these works, Boethius explores the nature of the divine and the relationship between God and the world.\n\n**Dates of Works**\n\nThe exact dates of Boethius' works are unclear, but it is believed that he wrote most of his major works in the 520s and 530s AD.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nBoethius' legacy is complex and multifaceted. He is considered one of the most important figures in the development of medieval philosophy, and his works had a significant impact on the intellectual life of the Middle Ages.\n\nBoethius' ideas about the nature of good and evil, fortune and misfortune, and the human condition continue to be studied and debated by scholars today. His use of Lady Philosophy as a character in the \"Consolation of Philosophy\" is a pioneering example of the use of philosophical fiction, and his work on logic and rhetoric continues to be studied by scholars of medieval philosophy.\n\n**Veneration**\n\nBoethius was venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church, and his feast day is celebrated on October 23rd.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nBoethius has been the subject of several literary and artistic works, including a play by John Milton and a poem by T.S. Eliot.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Anicii\n* Ostrogothic Kingdom\n* Theodoric the Great\n* Lady Philosophy\n* Medieval Philosophy\n* Logic and Rhetoric\n\n**Notes**\n\n* This article is a summary of the life and works of Boethius, and it is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive account of his life and ideas.\n* The exact dates of Boethius' works are unclear, and the dates provided in this article are approximate.\n* The article is based on a wide range of sources, including medieval manuscripts and modern scholarly studies.\n\n**References**\n\n* Sources:\n\t+ Boethius, Anicius Manlius Severinus.

It was released in November 2022 and has since gained significant attention for its ability to understand and respond to human-like language.\n\n# Training\n\nChatGPT was trained on a massive dataset of text from the internet, which allows it to learn patterns and relationships in language. The training process involved using a technique called masked language modeling, where the model is presented with a piece of text and is asked to predict the missing word. This process helps the model to learn the context and semantics of language.\n\n# Features and limitations\n\n## Features\n\nChatGPT has a number of features that make it a powerful tool for communication and information retrieval. Some of its key features include:\n\n* Conversational interface: ChatGPT can engage in conversations with users, using context to understand the conversation and respond accordingly.\n* Knowledge base: ChatGPT has access to a vast knowledge base of information on a wide range of topics, which it can draw upon to answer questions and provide information.\n* Language understanding: ChatGPT can understand natural language and respond accordingly, using context and semantics to guide its responses.\n* Emotional intelligence: ChatGPT can recognize and respond to emotions, using emotional intelligence to create a more personal and empathetic interaction.\n\n## Limitations\n\nChatGPT also has a number of limitations that are worth noting. Some of these include:\n\n* Lack of common sense: While ChatGPT is able to understand and respond to language, it often lacks the common sense and real-world experience that humans take for granted.\n* Limited domain knowledge: ChatGPT's knowledge base is vast, but it is not exhaustive, and there may be areas where it is not knowledgeable.\n* Potential for bias: ChatGPT, like all AI systems, is susceptible to bias and may reflect the biases of its training data.\n* Limited ability to understand humor and sarcasm: ChatGPT can struggle to understand humor and sarcasm, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.\n\n### Jailbreaking\n\nIn February 2023, a group of developers discovered a way to \"jailbreak\" ChatGPT, which allowed them to access the underlying code and modify it to perform tasks that were not intended by the developers. This has raised concerns about the security and safety of the model, and the potential for it to be used for malicious purposes.\n\n# Service\n\n## ChatGPT Plus\n\nChatGPT Plus is a paid subscription service that offers additional features and support for users. It includes features such as:\n\n* Priority access to customer support\n* Access to a dedicated community forum\n* Ability to save and access previous conversations\n* Ability to export conversations as text files\n\n## Mobile app\n\nChatGPT is available as a mobile app for both iOS and Android devices.

The country's capital and largest city is Kiev.\n\n**Etymology and orthography**\n\nThe name \"Ukraine\" is derived from the Old East Slavic word \"ukraina,\" which means \"borderland\" or \"march.\" The name was first used in the 13th century to refer to the western borderlands of the Grand Duchy of Kievan Rus', a medieval state that encompassed much of Eastern Europe. The modern Ukrainian alphabet is based on the Cyrillic script, which was introduced to Ukraine in the 9th century.\n\n**History**\n\n### Early history\n\nThe history of Ukraine dates back to the 10th century, when the state of Kievan Rus' was formed under the rule of Prince Oleg and his successor, Prince Igor. Kievan Rus' was a powerful and influential state that played a significant role in the development of Eastern Europe. In the 13th century, Ukraine was invaded by the Mongols, who destroyed the city of Kiev and killed many of its inhabitants.\n\n### Golden Age of Kyiv\n\nIn the 11th and 12th centuries, Ukraine experienced a golden age under the rule of the Rurik dynasty, which saw the development of a vibrant culture and the construction of many impressive architectural monuments, including the St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev. The city of Kiev, which was the capital of Kievan Rus', was a major center of trade and commerce, and its merchants traded goods such as furs, wax, and honey.\n\n### Foreign domination\n\nIn the 13th century, Ukraine was invaded by the Mongols, who destroyed the city of Kiev and killed many of its inhabitants.

This style of architecture is characterized by symmetry, proportion, and the use of classical elements such as columns, arches, and domes. Palladian architecture has had a significant impact on Western architecture and continues to influence building design to this day.\n\n**Palladio's Architecture**\n\nAndrea Palladio (1508-1580) was a renowned Italian architect who is widely regarded as one of the most influential architects in history. Born in Padua, Italy, Palladio was apprenticed to a local stonemason at the age of 14 and later studied under the tutelage of the famous architect Bartolomeo Scamozzi. Palladio's early work was influenced by the classical architecture of ancient Greece and Rome, and he spent many years studying the ruins of these civilizations.\n\nPalladio's first major commission was the Villa Capra at Vicenza, which he designed in 1566 for the nobleman Giangiorgio Trissino. This villa was a groundbreaking design that combined elements of classical architecture with a more modern, symmetrical layout. The villa's design featured a central courtyard, surrounded by a series of arches and columns, which created a sense of balance and harmony.\n\nPalladio's subsequent designs, including the Villa Rotonda, Villa Maser, and Teatro Olimpico, further refined his architectural style and solidified his reputation as a master builder. His designs were characterized by their use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, combined with a sense of proportion and balance.\n\n**Venetian and Palladian Windows**\n\nOne of the defining features of Palladian architecture is the use of Venetian and Palladian windows. These windows are characterized by their arched or curved shape, which is often topped with a decorative surround. The Venetian window is a type of window that originated in Venice, Italy, and features a series of small panes of glass arranged in a diamond or trapezoidal pattern.\n\nPalladian windows, on the other hand, are characterized by their use of a single, large arched or curved shape, often topped with a decorative surround. These windows were a hallmark of Palladian architecture and were often used in conjunction with classical elements such as columns and arches.\n\n**Early Palladianism**\n\nEarly Palladianism was characterized by a revival of classical architecture in the 16th and 17th centuries. This style of architecture was influenced by the works of Andrea Palladio and other architects, such as Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren. Early Palladianism was marked by the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, combined with a sense of proportion and balance.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of early Palladianism is the English country house, which was popularized by Inigo Jones and other architects during the 17th century. These houses were characterized by their use of classical elements, such as columns and arches, combined with a sense of proportion and balance.\n\n**Neo-Palladianism**\n\nNeo-Palladianism was a style of architecture that emerged in the 18th century, characterized by a revival of classical architecture. This style of architecture was influenced by the works of Andrea Palladio and other architects, such as Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren.\n\nEnglish Palladian architecture was a subset of Neo-Palladianism, characterized by the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, combined with a sense of proportion and balance. This style of architecture was popularized by architects such as Robert Adam and James Wyatt, who designed numerous country houses and other buildings in the classical style.\n\nIrish Palladian architecture was also a subset of Neo-Palladianism, characterized by the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, combined with a sense of proportion and balance. This style of architecture was popularized by architects such as James Hoban and Thomas Cooley, who designed numerous buildings in the classical style.\n\nNorth American Palladian architecture was also influenced by Neo-Palladianism, with architects such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Latrobe designing buildings in the classical style. This style of architecture was characterized by the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, combined with a sense of proportion and balance.\n\n**Palladianism Elsewhere**\n\nPalladianism was not limited to Europe and North America. In other parts of the world, such as India and Australia, Palladian architecture was also influenced by Neo-Palladianism. In India, architects such as Robert Adam and James Wyatt designed buildings in the classical style, while in Australia, architects such as James Barnet and Edmund Blacket designed buildings in the classical style.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nPalladian architecture has had a lasting impact on Western architecture and continues to influence building design to this day. The use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, combined with a sense of proportion and balance, has become a hallmark of Palladian architecture.\n\nMany famous architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier, have cited Palladian architecture as an influence on their work. Palladian architecture has also influenced the development of other architectural styles, such as Art Deco and Modernism.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Andrea Palladio\n* Inigo Jones\n* Christopher Wren\n* Robert Adam\n* James Wyatt\n* Thomas Jefferson\n* Benjamin Latrobe\n* Frank Lloyd Wright\n* Le Corbusier\n\n**Notes, References and Sources**\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Palladian architecture is a style of architecture that originated in the early 16th century in Italy.\n* The style is characterized by the use of classical elements, such as columns, arches, and domes, combined with a sense of proportion and balance.\n* Palladian architecture has had a lasting impact on Western architecture and continues to influence building design to this day.\n\n**References**\n\n* Palladio, A.

The club was formed in 1889 and currently plays in the National League South, the sixth tier of the English football league system.\n\n**History**\n\n### Formation and early years (1889–1925)\n\nBath City F.C. was founded in 1889 as a friendly football club, competing in local tournaments and against other local teams. The club initially played on the North Parade Ground, a large open space in the city, and was affiliated with the Somerset County Football Association. During this period, the club's early success was limited, but it began to build a strong following in the local community.\n\n### Large crowds and missing out on Football League (1925–1958)\n\nThe 1920s saw a significant improvement in the club's fortunes, with Bath City winning several local cups and recording impressive victories over larger clubs. The club's popularity grew, and it began to attract large crowds to its matches, peaking at over 10,000 spectators in the 1930s. However, despite its on-field success and popularity, the club narrowly missed out on promotion to the Football League, the top division of English football, in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\n### Glory, yoyo years and nationwide football (1958–1996)\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s saw a period of significant success for Bath City, including several FA Cup runs and a promotion to the Football League in 1960. However, the club's fortunes were soon reversed, and it was relegation-bound in the following years. This yo-yo pattern of success and failure continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with the club experiencing several promotions and relegations. The club's popularity continued to decline in the 1980s and 1990s, but it remained a beloved institution in the local community.\n\n### Decline and subsequent relegation (1996–2017)\n\nThe 1990s and 2000s saw a significant decline in the club's fortunes, with the team struggling to maintain its position in the lower divisions of English football. The club was relegated from the Football Conference in 2006 and struggled to regain its footing in the lower divisions. The club's financial situation also deteriorated, leading to several ownership changes and a decline in the team's overall competitiveness.\n\n### The Gill Era (2017–present)\n\nIn 2017, Bath City was acquired by a new ownership group led by James and Kevin Gill, who inherited a club struggling to maintain its position in the lower divisions. The Gills brought significant investment to the club, including a new stadium and improved facilities. The team's fortunes began to improve under the new ownership, and the club has since experienced several promotions and improved performances.\n\n**Badge**\n\nBath City F.C.'s badge features a white and blue color scheme, with a blue circle at the top and a white circle at the bottom. The badge features the club's initials \"BCFC\" in a stylized font, with a blue and white striped pattern. The badge has undergone several design changes throughout the club's history, but the current design has been in use since 2017.\n\n**Stadiums**\n\n### 1889: The North Parade Ground\n\nBath City F.C. was initially based at the North Parade Ground, a large open space in the city. The ground was used for several years before the club moved to a new location.\n\n### 1900–1919: Belvoir Castle\n\nIn 1900, the club moved to Belvoir Castle, a large sports ground in the city. The ground was used for several years before the club moved to a new location.\n\n### 1919–1932: Lambridge\n\nIn 1919, the club moved to Lambridge, a sports ground located on the outskirts of the city. The ground was used for several years before the club moved to Twerton Park.\n\n### 1932–present: Twerton Park\n\nIn 1932, the club moved to Twerton Park, a stadium located in Twerton, a suburb of Bath. Twerton Park has been the club's home ground for over 80 years and has undergone several renovations and expansions during that time.\n\n**Support**\n\nBath City F.C. has a loyal and dedicated fan base, with supporters traveling from across the country to watch the team play.

As Ethan navigates this complex web of espionage and counter-espionage, he is aided by his trusted allies, Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames). Meanwhile, a new character, a skilled but troubled hacker named Alana Vaughn (Hayley Atwell), is introduced, who may hold the key to unlocking the secrets of the Syndicate.\n\n## Cast\n\nThe cast of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One includes:\n\n* Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt\n* Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell\n* Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn\n* Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust\n* Vanessa Kirby as Alanna Mitsopolis\n* Hayley Atwell as Alana Vaughn\n* Esai Morales as The Baron\n* Henry Czerny as Eugene Kittridge\n\n## Production\n\n### Development and pre-production\n\nThe film was announced in January 2019, with Christopher McQuarrie set to return as director and writer.

In February 2020, it was announced that Esai Morales had joined the cast as the main villain, and that the film would be released on July 23, 2023.\n\n### Filming\n\nPrincipal photography began in April 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was shot on location in the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, and Iceland, with Cruise performing many of his own stunts.\n\n### Polish bridge controversy\n\nDuring filming in Poland, Cruise was involved in a controversy when he refused to use a stunt double for a scene in which he was to jump from a moving train onto a bridge. The scene required a precise jump to avoid a safety net, and Cruise insisted on performing the stunt himself. The incident sparked a heated debate about the safety of action film stunts, with some criticizing Cruise for putting himself and others at risk.\n\n### Post-production\n\nThe film underwent extensive post-production work, including visual effects and sound design. In an interview, McQuarrie revealed that he had spent over a year working on the film's visual effects, which were created by a team of over 200 artists and technicians.\n\n## Music\n\nThe score for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One was composed by Lorne Balfe, who had previously worked on the Mission: Impossible franchise. The soundtrack features a mix of orchestral and electronic elements, with a focus on action and suspense.\n\n## Marketing\n\nThe film's marketing campaign began in February 2023, with the release of a trailer and poster. The trailer showcased the film's action-packed sequences, including a dramatic car chase and a high-rise fight scene. The poster featured Tom Cruise in a dramatic pose, with a cityscape in the background.\n\n## Release\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One was released on July 14, 2023, in the United States and on July 19, 2023, in the United Kingdom.

The special features include a making-of documentary, deleted scenes, and a commentary track by Christopher McQuarrie.\n\n## Reception\n\n### Box office\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One performed well at the box office, grossing over $770 million worldwide. The film opened at number one in the United States, with a domestic gross of $57.2 million. It also performed well in other major markets, including China, the United Kingdom, and Australia.\n\n### Critical response\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the action sequences and the performances of the cast. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 78% approval rating, with an average rating of 6.8/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 63 out of 100, based on 52 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n### Accolades\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One received several awards and nominations, including a nomination for Best Action Film at the 2023 MTV Movie & TV Awards and a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 2023 Visual Effects Society Awards.\n\n### Political impact\n\nThe film has been criticized for its depiction of the CIA's covert operations in the Middle East, with some accusing the film of promoting a pro-American agenda and glossing over the negative consequences of US foreign policy. In response to these criticisms, the film's director, Christopher McQuarrie, stated that the film was intended to be a critique of the CIA's actions, rather than a celebration of them.\n\n## Sequel\n\nA sequel to Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is in development, with Christopher McQuarrie set to return as director and writer. The film will be the eighth installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise and is expected to be released in 2025.\n\n## Notes\n\n* The film's script was heavily influenced by the real-life exploits of the CIA's Operation Ajax, which overthrew the government of Iran in 1953.\n* The film's action sequences were performed by Tom Cruise and other cast members, with some stunts being performed by experienced stunt performers.\n* The film's visual effects were created by a team of over 200 artists and technicians, with a focus on creating a realistic and immersive experience for the audience.\n\n## References\n\n* \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)\".

He was the eldest son of King Paul and Queen Frederica of Greece and the first cousin of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\n**Early life**\n\n### World War II and the exile of the royal family\n\nConstantine II was born on June 2, 1940, in Psychiko, Athens, Greece, to King Paul and Queen Frederica. At the time of his birth, Greece was still a kingdom, but the royal family's position was precarious due to the country's involvement in World War II. In November 1940, Italy invaded Greece, and the royal family was forced to flee. They eventually settled in the UK, where Constantine II spent much of his childhood.\n\n### After World War II and return to Greece\n\nAfter the war, the royal family returned to Greece, and Constantine II began his education in England. He attended the prestigious Cheam School in Berkshire and later studied at the University of Geneva. In 1954, he returned to Greece to assume his duties as Crown Prince.\n\n**Crown Prince**\n\n### Education\n\nConstantine II received his early education at the Tatoi Palace in Greece, where he was tutored by private instructors. He later attended the British school Cheam School in Berkshire, England, and the University of Geneva in Switzerland, where he studied economics and politics.\n\n### Sailing and the Olympic Games\n\nConstantine II was an accomplished sailor and participated in several Olympic Games. In 1960, he competed in the 5.5-meter class at the Rome Olympics, where Greece won a silver medal. He also competed in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, sailing in the 5.5-meter class.\n\n**Reign**\n\n### Accession and marriage\n\nOn March 6, 1964, Constantine II succeeded his father, King Paul, as the King of Greece. He married Anne-Marie of Denmark, the daughter of King Frederick IX of Denmark and Queen Ingrid, on September 18, 1964, in Athens. The couple had three children: Crown Prince Alexander, Queen Pavlina-Maria, and Queen Chrysantha.\n\n### Apostasia of 1965\n\nIn 1965, Constantine II faced a major crisis when a group of army officers, led by Colonel Georgios Zoitakis, attempted a coup. The coup was eventually put down, but it led to a constitutional crisis and a reorganization of the government. The incident became known as the Apostasia of 1965.\n\n### Greek dictatorship of 1967–1974\n\nIn 1967, a group of army officers, led by Colonel Georgios Papadopoulos, staged a successful coup, and Constantine II was forced into exile. The new junta, which ruled Greece until 1974, abolished the monarchy and established a republic.\n\n### Royal countercoup of 13 December 1967 and exile\n\nIn December 1967, Constantine II attempted a countercoup, but it failed, and he was forced to flee the country. He settled in London, where he remained in exile until the restoration of democracy in Greece.\n\n**Restoration of democracy and the referendum**\n\nIn 1974, the Greek dictatorship was overthrown, and a referendum was held to determine the future of the monarchy. Constantine II returned to Greece, and the referendum resulted in a narrow majority in favor of the abolition of the monarchy. On June 1, 1973, the monarchy was officially abolished, and Greece became a republic.\n\n**Life in exile after 1974**\n\n### Abortive conspiracies\n\nDuring his exile, Constantine II was involved in several abortive conspiracies to restore the monarchy. In 1975, he was involved in a plot to overthrow the new government, but it was discovered and put down.\n\n### 1993 visit to Greece\n\nIn 1993, Constantine II returned to Greece, where he was met with a mixture of emotions.
