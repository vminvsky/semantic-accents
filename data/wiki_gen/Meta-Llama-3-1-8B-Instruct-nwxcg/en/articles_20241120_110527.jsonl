Football League (NFL) for eight seasons, primarily with the Denver Broncos. He was a three-time Pro Bowl selection and holds several franchise records for the Broncos.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nDemaryius Thomas was born on December 25, 1987, in Montrose, Georgia. When he was a child, police raided the house where his mother and grandmother lived, and his mother was sentenced to 20 years in prison for crack cocaine distribution. His grandmother was sentenced to life in prison for the same crime. Thomas grew up with his aunt and uncle after his mother was sent to prison. He was given the nickname \"Bay Bay\" by his uncle, which was inspired by the bad kids from the movie Bebe's Kids.\n\nIn 2015, President Barack Obama commuted Thomas' mother's sentence, and she was released from prison a year later. Thomas' grandmother also had her sentence commuted by Obama in 2016. Thomas' family struggles had a significant impact on his life and shaped his perspective on the world.\n\n**High School Career**\n\nThomas attended West Laurens High School in Dexter, Georgia, where he was a three-sport star in basketball, football, and track. He played wide receiver for the Raiders football team under the direction of head coach John Kenny. As a junior in 2004, Thomas recorded 32 receptions for 330 yards and three touchdowns. He was named an all-region and all-Heart of Georgia player.\n\nAs a senior, Thomas recorded 82 receptions for 1,234 yards and ten touchdowns. He participated in the North-South All-Star game and was selected as an all-region and all-Heart of Georgia player again. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution named him to its Class AA all-state first team and PrepStar to its All-Region team. Scout.com assessed him as the 22nd-ranked college prospect in the state of Georgia, and Rivals.com rated him the 34th-ranked such prospect.\n\nThomas received scholarship offers from Duke, Georgia, and Georgia Tech. He chose to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he majored in management.\n\n**College Career**\n\nThomas sat out the 2006 season as a redshirt freshman under Yellow Jackets head coach Chan Gailey. In 2007, he played in three games and recorded four receptions for 42 yards.\n\nIn 2008, Paul Johnson was hired as the head coach, and he implemented the run-heavy triple option offense. Thomas considered transferring but decided against doing so. During the season, he recorded 39 receptions for 627 yards and three touchdowns as the leading receiver. Despite playing in a heavily run-oriented system, Thomas' statistics were relatively high for a wide receiver in the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\nIn the 27-0 victory over Duke on October 4, Thomas caught nine receptions for 230 yards, the second-most in a single game in school history. Thomas' mark was the best of any wide receiver from the school since Calvin Johnson had 1,202 yards in 2006.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nThe Denver Broncos selected Thomas in the first round of the 2010 NFL draft, as the 22nd overall pick.

He was a promising young player with a lot of potential.\n\nIn 2011, Thomas tore his Achilles tendon while working out and was expected to miss a majority of the season. However, he was surprisingly activated from the Physically Unable to Perform List prior to the start of the season. Unfortunately, during his first practice back, Thomas broke his left pinkie finger and missed the first five games of the season.\n\nIn 2012, Thomas was coming off surgery to remove pins in his left pinkie when quarterback Peyton Manning signed with the Broncos. Manning noted during training camp that Thomas' \"size, strength and speed just allow you to do certain things with him that other players just can't do.\"\n\nThomas started the 2013 season strong, recording five receptions for 161 yards and two touchdowns in a Week 1 victory over the Baltimore Ravens. He received AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for his performance against the San Diego Chargers in Week 10.\n\nIn the 2014 season, Thomas started quietly, but he eventually broke the franchise record for receiving yards in a single game against the Arizona Cardinals on October 5. He caught eight receptions for 226 yards and two touchdowns, breaking the record held by Shannon Sharpe.\n\nThomas finished the 2014 season with a career-high 1,619 yards off a career-high 111 catches. He was named to his third consecutive Pro Bowl and was ranked 20th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015 list.\n\nIn the 2015 season, Thomas started the year strong, recording six receptions for 100 yards and a touchdown in a Week 3 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. He scored receiving touchdowns in three consecutive games, making him a consistent threat on the field.\n\nIn the 2016 season, Thomas started the year strong, recording six receptions for 100 yards and a touchdown in a Week 3 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. He scored receiving touchdowns in three consecutive games, making him a consistent threat on the field.\n\nIn the 2017 season, Thomas remained a strong presence for the Broncos, despite inconsistent quarterback play. His best statistical game came in Week 6 against the New York Giants on NBC Sunday Night Football, where he recorded ten receptions for 133 yards.\n\nIn the 2018 season, Thomas started the year strong, recording 20 receptions for 168 yards and a touchdown in the first four games of the season. He had his best output of the season to that point with five receptions for 105 receiving yards and a touchdown in a Week 5 loss to the New York Jets.\n\n**Houston Texans**\n\nOn October 30, 2018, the Broncos traded Thomas and a seventh-round pick in the 2019 NFL draft to the Houston Texans for a fourth and seventh-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft.\n\n**New England Patriots**\n\nOn April 16, 2019, Thomas signed a one-year contract with the New England Patriots.

{"title": "Biology", "content": "\nHistory\nThe earliest of roots of science, which included medicine, can be traced to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE [11] [12] Their contributions shaped ancient Greek natural philosophy [13] [11] [12] [14] [15] Ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle (384–322 BCE) contributed extensively to the development of biological knowledge [16] He explored biological causation and the diversity of life His successor, Theophrastus, began the scientific study of plants [17] Scholars of the medieval Islamic world who wrote on biology included al-Jahiz (781–869), Al-Dīnawarī (828–896), who wrote on botany, [18] and Rhazes (865–925) who wrote on anatomy and physiology Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought.\n\n\nChemical basis\nAll organisms are made up of chemical elements; [32] oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen account for most (96%) of the mass of all organisms, with calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium constituting essentially all the remainder Different elements can combine to form compounds such as water, which is fundamental to life [32] Biochemistry is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including molecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.\n\n\nAtoms and molecules\nAll organisms are made up of chemical elements; [32] oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen account for most (96%) of the mass of all organisms, with calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium constituting essentially all the remainder Different elements can combine to form compounds such as water, which is fundamental to life [32] Biochemistry is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including molecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.\n\n\nWater\nLife arose from the Earth's first ocean, which formed some 3.8 billion years ago [33] Since then, water continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism Water is important to life because it is an effective solvent, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution Once dissolved in water, these solutes are more likely to come in contact with one another and therefore take part in chemical reactions that sustain life [33] In terms of its molecular structure, water is a small polar molecule with a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (H) atoms to one oxygen (O) atom (H2O) [33] Because the O–H bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge [33] This polar property of water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water cohesive [33] Surface tension results from the cohesive force due to the attraction between molecules at the surface of the liquid [33] Water is also adhesive as it is able to adhere to the surface of any polar or charged non-water molecules [33] Water is denser as a liquid than it is as a solid (or ice) [33] This unique property of water allows ice to float above liquid water such as ponds, lakes, and oceans, thereby insulating the liquid below from the cold air above [33] Water has the capacity to absorb energy, giving it a higher specific heat capacity than other solvents such as ethanol [33] Thus, a large amount of energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules to convert liquid water into water vapor [33] As a molecule, water is not completely stable as each water molecule continuously dissociates into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions before reforming into a water molecule again [33] In pure water, the number of hydrogen ions balances (or equals) the number of hydroxyl ions, resulting in a pH that is neutral.\n\n\nOrganic compounds\nOrganic compounds are molecules that contain carbon bonded to another element such as hydrogen [33] With the exception of water, nearly all the molecules that make up each organism contain carbon [33] [34] Carbon can form covalent bonds with up to four other atoms, enabling it to form diverse, large, and complex molecules [33] [34] For example, a single carbon atom can form four single covalent bonds such as in methane, two double covalent bonds such as in carbon dioxide (CO2), or a triple covalent bond such as in carbon monoxide (CO) Moreover, carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting carbon–carbon bonds such as octane or ring-like structures such as glucose.\n\n\nMacromolecules\nMacromolecules are large molecules made up of smaller subunits or monomers [36] Monomers include sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides [37] Carbohydrates include monomers and polymers of sugars [38]\nLipids are the only class of macromolecules that are not made up of polymers They include steroids, phospholipids, and fats, [37] largely nonpolar and hydrophobic (water-repelling) substances [39]\nProteins are the most diverse of the macromolecules They include enzymes, transport proteins, large signaling molecules, antibodies, and structural proteins The basic unit (or monomer) of a protein is an amino acid [36] Twenty amino acids are used in proteins [36]\nNucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides [40] Their function is to store, transmit, and express hereditary information [37]\n\n\nCells\nCell theory states that cells are the fundamental units of life, that all living things are composed of one or more cells, and that all cells arise from preexisting cells through cell division [41] Most cells are very small, with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers and are therefore only visible under a light or electron microscope [42] There are generally two types of cells: eukaryotic cells, which contain a nucleus, and prokaryotic cells, which do not Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms such as bacteria, whereas eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body is derived ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg.\n\n\nCell structure\nEvery cell is enclosed within a cell membrane that separates its cytoplasm from the extracellular space [43] A cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer, including cholesterols that sit between phospholipids to maintain their fluidity at various temperatures Cell membranes are semipermeable, allowing small molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water to pass through while restricting the movement of larger molecules and charged particles such as ions [44] Cell membranes also contain membrane proteins, including integral membrane proteins that go across the membrane serving as membrane transporters, and peripheral proteins that loosely attach to the outer side of the cell membrane, acting as enzymes shaping the cell [45] Cell membranes are involved in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, storing electrical energy, and cell signalling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures such as a cell wall, glycocalyx, and cytoskeleton.\n\n\nMetabolism\nAll cells require energy to sustain cellular processes Metabolism is the set of chemical reactions in an organism The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to monomer building blocks; and the elimination of metabolic wastes These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments Metabolic reactions may be categorized as catabolic—the breaking down of compounds (for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by cellular respiration); or anabolic—the building up (synthesis) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids) Usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, each step being facilitated by a specific enzyme Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy Enzymes act as catalysts—they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly without being consumed by it—by reducing the amount of activation energy needed to convert reactants into products Enzymes also allow the regulation of the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.\n\n\nCellular respiration\nCellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in cells to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products [48] The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a cell because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions.\n\n\nPhotosynthesis\nPhotosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organism's metabolic activities via cellular respiration This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water [50] [51] [52] In most cases, oxygen is released as a waste product Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis, which is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth [53]\n\n\nCell signaling\nCell signaling (or communication) is the ability of cells to receive, process, and transmit signals with its environment and with itself [55] [56] Signals can be non-chemical such as light, electrical impulses, and heat, or chemical signals (or ligands) that interact with receptors, which can be found embedded in the cell membrane of another cell or located deep inside a cell [57] [56] There are generally four types of chemical signals: autocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine, and hormones [57] In autocrine signaling, the ligand affects the same cell that releases it Tumor cells, for example, can reproduce uncontrollably because they release signals that initiate their own self-division In paracrine signaling, the ligand diffuses to nearby cells and affects them For example, brain cells called neurons release ligands called neurotransmitters that diffuse across a synaptic cleft to bind with a receptor on an adjacent cell such as another neuron or muscle cell In juxtacrine signaling, there is direct contact between the signaling and responding cells Finally, hormones are ligands that travel through the circulatory systems of animals or vascular systems of plants to reach their target cells Once a ligand binds with a receptor, it can influence the behavior of another cell, depending on the type of receptor For instance, neurotransmitters that bind with an inotropic receptor can alter the excitability of a target cell Other types of receptors include protein kinase receptors (e.g., receptor for the hormone insulin) and G protein-coupled receptors Activation of G protein-coupled receptors can initiate second messenger cascades The process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a series of molecular events is called signal transduction.\n\n\nCell cycle\nThe cell cycle is a series of events that take place in a cell that cause it to divide into two daughter cells These events include the duplication of its DNA and some of its organelles, and the subsequent partitioning of its cytoplasm into two daughter cells in a process called cell division [58] In eukaryotes (i.e., animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells), there are two distinct types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis [59] Mitosis is part of the cell cycle, in which replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei Cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often followed by telophase and cytokinesis; which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane of one cell into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components The different stages of mitosis all together define the mitotic phase of an animal cell cycle—the division of the mother cell into two genetically identical daughter cells [60] The cell cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled fertilized egg develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which hair, skin, blood cells, and some internal organs are renewed After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the interphase of a new cycle In contrast to mitosis, meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions [61] Homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division (meiosis I), and sister chromatids are separated in the second division (meiosis II) Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.\n\n\nSexual reproduction and meiosis\nMeiosis is a central feature of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes, and the most fundamental function of meiosis appears to be conservation of the integrity of the genome that is passed on to progeny by parents [63] [64]  Two aspects of sexual reproduction, meiotic recombination and outcrossing, are likely maintained respectively by the adaptive advantages of recombinational repair of genomic DNA damage and genetic complementation which masks the expression of deleterious recessive mutations [65]\n\n\nGenetics\nGenetics is the scientific study of inheritance [67] [68] [69] Mendelian inheritance, specifically, is the process by which genes and traits are passed on from parents to offspring [29] It has several principles The first is that genetic characteristics, alleles, are discrete and have alternate forms (e.g., purple vs white or tall vs dwarf), each inherited from one of two parents Based on the law of dominance and uniformity, which states that some alleles are dominant while others are recessive; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the phenotype of that dominant allele During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate, so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene Heterozygotic individuals produce gametes with an equal frequency of two alleles Finally, the law of independent assortment, states that genes of different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes, i.e., genes are unlinked An exception to this rule would include traits that are sex-linked Test crosses can be performed to experimentally determine the underlying genotype of an organism with a dominant phenotype [70] A Punnett square can be used to predict the results of a test cross The chromosome theory of inheritance, which states that genes are found on chromosomes, was supported by Thomas Morgans's experiments with fruit flies, which established the sex linkage between eye color and sex in these insects [71]\n\n\nInheritance\nGenetics is the scientific study of inheritance [67] [68] [69] Mendelian inheritance, specifically, is the process by which genes and traits are passed on from parents

experiments with fruit flies, which established the sex linkage between eye color and sex in these insects [71]\n\n\nGenes and DNA\nA gene is a unit of heredity that corresponds to a region of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that carries genetic information that controls form or function of an organism DNA is composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix [72] It is found as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes The set of chromosomes in a cell is collectively known as its genome In eukaryotes, DNA is mainly in the cell nucleus [73] In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within the nucleoid [74] The genetic information is held within genes, and the complete assemblage in an organism is called its genotype [75]\nDNA replication is a semiconservative process whereby each strand serves as a template for a new strand of DNA [72] Mutations are heritable changes in DNA [72] They can arise spontaneously as a result of replication errors that were not corrected by proofreading or can be induced by an environmental mutagen such as a chemical (e.g., nitrous acid, benzopyrene) or radiation (e.g., x-ray, gamma ray, ultraviolet radiation, particles emitted by unstable isotopes) [72] Mutations can lead to phenotypic effects such as loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and conditional mutations [72]\nSome mutations are beneficial, as they are a source of genetic variation for evolution [72] Others are harmful if they were to result in a loss of function of genes needed for survival [72]\n\n\nGene expression\nGene expression is the molecular process by which a genotype encoded in DNA gives rise to an observable phenotype in the proteins of an organism's body This process is summarized by the central dogma of molecular biology, which was formulated by Francis Crick in 1958 [76] [77] [78] According to the Central Dogma, genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein There are two gene expression processes: transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation (RNA to protein) [79]\n\n\nGene regulation\nThe regulation of gene expression by environmental factors and during different stages of development can occur at each step of the process such as transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein [80] Gene expression can be influenced by positive or negative regulation, depending on which of the two types of regulatory proteins called transcription factors bind to the DNA sequence close to or at a promoter [80] A cluster of genes that share the same promoter is called an operon, found mainly in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans) [80] [81] In positive regulation of gene expression, the activator is the transcription factor that stimulates transcription when it binds to the sequence near or at the promoter Negative regulation occurs when another transcription factor called a repressor binds to a DNA sequence called an operator, which is part of an operon, to prevent transcription Repressors can be inhibited by compounds called inducers (e.g., allolactose), thereby allowing transcription to occur [80] Specific genes that can be activated by inducers are called inducible genes, in contrast to constitutive genes that are almost constantly active [80] In contrast to both, structural genes encode proteins that are not involved in gene regulation [80] In addition to regulatory events involving the promoter, gene expression can also be regulated by epigenetic changes to chromatin, which is a complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells [80]\n\n\nGenes, development, and evolution\nDevelopment is the process by which a multicellular organism (plant or animal) goes through a series of changes, starting from a single cell, and taking on various forms that are characteristic of its life cycle [82] There are four key processes that underlie development: Determination, differentiation, morphogenesis, and growth Determination sets the developmental fate of a cell, which becomes more restrictive during development Differentiation is the process by which specialized cells arise from less specialized cells such as stem cells [83] [84] Stem cells are undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells that can differentiate into various types of cells and proliferate indefinitely to produce more of the same stem cell [85] Cellular differentiation dramatically changes a cell's size, shape, membrane potential, metabolic activity, and responsiveness to signals, which are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression and epigenetics With a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the DNA sequence itself [86] Thus, different cells can have very different physical characteristics despite having the same genome Morphogenesis, or the development of body form, is the result of spatial differences in gene expression [82] A small fraction of the genes in an organism's genome called the developmental-genetic toolkit control the development of that organism These toolkit genes are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes Hox genes determine where repeating parts, such as the many vertebrae of snakes, will grow in a developing embryo or larva [87]\n\n\nEvolution\nEvolution is a central organizing concept in biology It is the change in heritable characteristics of populations over successive generations [88] [89] In artificial selection, animals were selectively bred for specific traits.\n [90] Given that traits are inherited, populations contain a varied mix of traits, and reproduction is able to increase any population, Darwin argued that in the natural world, it was nature that played the role of humans in selecting for specific traits [90] Darwin inferred that individuals who possessed heritable traits better adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and produce more offspring than other individuals [90] He further inferred that this would lead to the accumulation of favorable traits over successive generations, thereby increasing the match between the organisms and their environment [91] [92] [93] [90] [94]\n\n\nEvolutionary processes\nEvolution is a central organizing concept in biology It is

[91] [92] [93] [90] [94]\n\n\nSpeciation\nA species is a group of organisms that mate with one another and speciation is the process by which one lineage splits into two lineages as a result of having evolved independently from each other [95] For speciation to occur, there has to be reproductive isolation [95] Reproductive isolation can result from incompatibilities between genes as described by Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model Reproductive isolation also tends to increase with genetic divergence Speciation can occur when there are physical barriers that divide an ancestral species, a process known as allopatric speciation [95]\n\n\nPhylogeny\nA phylogeny is an evolutionary history of a specific group of organisms or their genes [96] It can be represented using a phylogenetic tree, a diagram showing lines of descent among organisms or their genes Each line drawn on the time axis of a tree represents a lineage of descendants of a particular species or population When a lineage divides into two, it is represented as a fork or split on the phylogenetic tree [96] Phylogenetic trees are the basis for comparing and grouping different species [96] Different species that share a feature inherited from a common ancestor are described as having homologous features (or synapomorphy) [97] [98] [96] Phylogeny provides the basis of biological classification [96] This classification system is rank-based, with the highest rank being the domain followed by kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species [96] All organisms can be classified as belonging to one of three domains: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria), bacteria (originally eubacteria), or eukarya (includes the fungi, plant, and animal kingdoms) [99]\n\n\nHistory of life\nThe history of life on Earth traces how organisms have evolved from the earliest emergence of life to present day Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and all life on Earth, both living and extinct, descended from a last universal common ancestor that lived about 3.5 billion years ago [100] [101] Geologists have developed a geologic time scale that divides the history of the Earth into major divisions, starting with four eons (Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic), the first three of which are collectively known as the Precambrian, which lasted approximately 4 billion years [102] Each eon can be divided into eras, with the Phanerozoic eon that began 539 million years ago [103] being subdivided into Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras [102] These three eras together comprise eleven periods (Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary) [102]\n\n\nDiversity\nBacteria are a type of cell that constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms Typically a few micrometers in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, [124] and the deep biosphere of the Earth's crust Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory [125]\n\n\nBacteria and Archaea\nBacteria are a type of cell that constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms Typically a few micrometers in length, bacteria have a number of

only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory [125]\n\n\nEukaryotes\nEukaryotes are hypothesized to have split from archaea, which was followed by their endosymbioses with bacteria (or symbiogenesis) that gave rise to mitochondria and chloroplasts, both of which are now part of modern-day eukaryotic cells [131] The major lineages of eukaryotes diversified in the Precambrian about 1.5 billion years ago and can be classified into eight major clades: alveolates, excavates, stramenopiles, plants, rhizarians, amoebozoans, fungi, and animals [131] Five of these clades are collectively known as protists, which are mostly microscopic eukaryotic organisms that are not plants, fungi, or animals [131] While it is likely that protists share a common ancestor (the last eukaryotic common ancestor), [132] protists by themselves do not constitute a separate clade as some protists may be more closely related to plants, fungi, or animals than they are to other protists Like groupings such as algae, invertebrates, or protozoans, the protist grouping is not a formal taxonomic group but is used for convenience [131] [133] Most protists are unicellular; these are called microbial eukaryotes [131]\n\n\nViruses\nViruses are submicroscopic infectious agents that replicate inside the cells of organisms [137] Viruses infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea [138] [139] More than 6,000 virus species have been described in detail [140] Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity [141] [142]\n\n\nEcology\nEcology is the study of the distribution and abundance of life, the interaction between organisms and their environment [146]\n\n\nEcosystems\nThe community of living (biotic) organisms in conjunction with the nonliving (abiotic) components (e.g., water, light, radiation, temperature, humidity, atmosphere, acidity, and soil) of their environment is called an ecosystem [147] [148] [149] These biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows [150] Energy from the sun enters the system through photosynthesis and is incorporated into plant tissue By feeding on plants and on one another, animals move matter and energy through the system They also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present By breaking down dead organic matter, decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and other microbes [151]\n\n\nPopulations\nA population is the group of organisms of the same species that occupies an area and reproduce from generation to generation [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] Population size can be estimated by multiplying population density by the area or volume The carrying capacity of an environment is the maximum population size of a species that can be sustained by that specific environment, given the food, habitat, water, and other resources that are available [157] The carrying capacity of a population can be affected by changing environmental conditions such as changes in the availability of resources and the cost of maintaining them In human populations, new technologies such as the Green revolution have helped increase the Earth's carrying capacity for humans over time, which has stymied the attempted predictions of impending population decline, the most famous of which was by Thomas Malthus in the 18th century [152]\n\n\nCommunities\nA community is a group of populations of species occupying the same geographical area at the same time [159] A biological interaction is the effect that a pair of organisms living together in a community have on each other They can be either of the same species (intraspecific interactions), or of different species (interspecific interactions) These effects may be short-term, like pollination and predation, or long-term; both often strongly influence the evolution of the species involved A long-term interaction is called a symbiosis Symbioses range from mutualism, beneficial to both partners, to competition, harmful to both partners [160] Every species participates as a consumer, resource, or both in consumer–resource interactions, which form the core of food chains or food webs [161] There are different trophic levels within any food web, with the lowest level being the primary producers (or autotrophs) such as plants and algae that convert energy and inorganic material into organic compounds, which can then be used by the rest of the community [53] [162] [163] At the next level are the heterotrophs, which are the species that obtain energy by breaking apart organic compounds from other organisms [161] Heterotrophs that consume plants are primary consumers (or herbivores) whereas heterotrophs that consume herbivores are secondary consumers (or carnivores) And those that eat secondary consumers are tertiary consumers and so on Omnivorous heterotrophs are able to consume at multiple levels Finally, there are decomposers that feed on the waste products or dead bodies of organisms [161]\nOn average, the total amount of energy incorporated into the biomass of a trophic level per unit of time is about one-tenth of the energy of the trophic level that it consumes Waste and dead material used by decomposers as well as heat lost from metabolism make up the other ninety percent of energy that is not consumed by the next trophic level [164]\n\n\nBiosphere\nIn the global ecosystem or biosphere, matter exists as different interacting compartments, which can be biotic or abiotic as well as accessible or inaccessible, depending on their forms and locations [166] For example, matter from terrestrial autotrophs are both biotic and accessible to other organisms whereas the matter in rocks and minerals are abiotic and inaccessible A biogeochemical cycle is a pathway by which specific elements of matter are turned over or moved through the biotic (biosphere) and the abiotic (lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere) compartments of Earth There are biogeochemical cycles for nitrogen, carbon, and water.\n\n\nConservation\nConservation biology is the study of the conservation of Earth's biodiversity with the aim of protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions [167] [168] [169] It is concerned with factors that influence the maintenance, loss, and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetic, population, species, and ecosystem diversity [170] [171] [172] [173] The concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50% of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years, [174] which has contributed to poverty, starvation, and will reset the course of evolution on this planet [175] [176] Biodiversity affects the functioning of ecosystems, which provide a variety of services upon which people depend Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends of biodiversity loss, species extinctions, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to sustain the well-being of human society Organizations and citizens are responding to the current biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales [177] [170] [171] [172]\n\n\nSee also\nJournal links\n\n\nReferences\nJournal links\n\n\nFurther reading\nJournal links\n\n\nExternal links\nJournal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Biology**\n\nBiology is the scientific study of living organisms and their interactions with the environment. The earliest roots of science, which included medicine, can be traced to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their contributions shaped ancient Greek natural philosophy. Ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle (384–322 BCE) contributed extensively to the development of biological knowledge. He explored biological causation and the diversity of life. His successor, Theophrastus, began the scientific study of plants.\n\n**Chemical Basis**\n\nAll organisms are made up of chemical elements. Oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen account for most (96%) of the mass of all organisms. Calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium constitute essentially all the remainder. Different elements can combine to form compounds such as water, which is fundamental to life. Biochemistry is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including molecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.\n\n**Atoms and Molecules**\n\nAll organisms are made up of chemical elements.

Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including molecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.\n\n**Water**\n\nLife arose from the Earth's first ocean, which formed some 3.8 billion years ago. Since then, water continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism. Water is important to life because it is an effective solvent, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution. In terms of its molecular structure, water is a small polar molecule with a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (H) atoms to one oxygen (O) atom (H2O). Because the O–H bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge. This polar property of water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water cohesive. Surface tension results from the cohesive force due to the attraction between molecules at the surface of the liquid. Water is also adhesive as it is able to adhere to the surface of any polar or charged non-water molecules. Water has the capacity to absorb energy, giving it a higher specific heat capacity than other solvents such as ethanol.\n\n**Organic Compounds**\n\nOrganic compounds are molecules that contain carbon bonded to another element such as hydrogen. With the exception of water, nearly all the molecules that make up each organism contain carbon. Carbon can form covalent bonds with up to four other atoms, enabling it to form diverse, large, and complex molecules. For example, a single carbon atom can form four single covalent bonds such as in methane, two double covalent bonds such as in carbon dioxide (CO2), or a triple covalent bond such as in carbon monoxide (CO). Moreover, carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting carbon–carbon bonds such as octane or ring-like structures such as glucose.\n\n**Macromolecules**\n\nMacromolecules are large molecules made up of smaller subunits or monomers. Monomers include sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides. Carbohydrates include monomers and polymers of sugars. Lipids are the only class of macromolecules that are not made up of polymers. They include steroids, phospholipids, and fats, largely nonpolar and hydrophobic (water-repelling) substances. Proteins are the most diverse of the macromolecules. They include enzymes, transport proteins, large signaling molecules, antibodies, and structural proteins. The basic unit (or monomer) of a protein is an amino acid. Twenty amino acids are used in proteins. Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides. Their function is to store, transmit, and express hereditary information.\n\n**Cells**\n\nCell theory states that cells are the fundamental units of life, that all living things are composed of one or more cells, and that all cells arise from preexisting cells through cell division. Most cells are very small, with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers and are therefore only visible under a light or electron microscope. There are generally two types of cells: eukaryotic cells, which contain a nucleus, and prokaryotic cells, which do not. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms such as bacteria, whereas eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body is derived ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg.\n\n**Cell Structure**\n\nEvery cell is enclosed within a cell membrane that separates its cytoplasm from the extracellular space. A cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer, including cholesterols that sit between phospholipids to maintain their fluidity at various temperatures. Cell membranes are semipermeable, allowing small molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water to pass through while restricting the movement of larger molecules and charged particles such as ions. Cell membranes also contain membrane proteins, including integral membrane proteins that go across the membrane serving as membrane transporters, and peripheral proteins that loosely attach to the outer side of the cell membrane, acting as enzymes shaping the cell.\n\n**Metabolism**\n\nAll cells require energy to sustain cellular processes. Metabolism is the set of chemical reactions in an organism. The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to monomer building blocks; and the elimination of metabolic wastes. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. Metabolic reactions may be categorized as catabolic—the breaking down of compounds (for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by cellular respiration); or anabolic—the building up (synthesis) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids). Usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy.\n\n**Cellular Respiration**\n\nCellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in cells to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions. Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a cell because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions.\n\n**Photosynthesis**\n\nPhotosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organism's metabolic activities via cellular respiration. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water. In most cases, oxygen is released as a waste product. Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis, which is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.\n\n**Cell Signaling**\n\nCell signaling (or communication) is the ability of cells to receive, process, and transmit signals with their environment and with themselves. Signals can be non-chemical such as light, electrical impulses, and heat, or chemical signals (or ligands) that interact with receptors, which can be found embedded in the cell membrane of another cell or located deep inside a cell. There are generally four types of chemical signals: autocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine, and hormones. In autocrine signaling, the ligand affects the same cell that releases it. Tumor cells, for example, can reproduce uncontrollably because they release signals that initiate their own self-division.\n\n**Cell Cycle**\n\nThe cell cycle is a series of events that take place in a cell that cause it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the duplication of its DNA and some of its organelles, and the subsequent partitioning of its cytoplasm into two daughter cells in a process called cell division. In eukaryotes (i.e., animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells), there are two distinct types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is part of the cell cycle, in which replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. Cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained.\n\n**Evolution**\n\nEvolution is the change in heritable characteristics of populations over successive generations. In artificial selection, animals were selectively bred for specific traits. Darwin argued that in the natural world, it was nature that played the role of humans in selecting for specific traits. He inferred that individuals who possessed heritable traits better adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and produce more offspring than other individuals. This would lead to the accumulation of favorable traits over successive generations, thereby increasing the match between the organisms and their environment.\n\n**Speciation**\n\nA species is a group of organisms that mate with one another and speciation is the process by which one lineage splits into two lineages as a result of having evolved independently from each other. For speciation to occur, there has to be reproductive isolation. Reproductive isolation can result from incompatibilities between genes as described by the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model. Reproductive isolation also tends to increase with genetic divergence. Speciation can occur when there are physical barriers that divide an ancestral species, a process known as allopatric speciation.\n\n**Phylogeny**\n\nA phylogeny is an evolutionary history of a specific group of organisms or their genes. It can be represented using a phylogenetic tree, a diagram showing lines of descent among organisms or their genes. Each line drawn on the time axis of a tree represents a lineage of descendants of a particular species or population. When a lineage divides into two, it is represented as a fork or split on the phylogenetic tree.\n\n**Biosphere**\n\nIn the global ecosystem or biosphere, matter exists as different interacting compartments, which can be biotic or abiotic as well as accessible or inaccessible, depending on their forms and locations. For example, matter from terrestrial autotrophs are both biotic and accessible to other organisms whereas the matter in rocks and minerals are abiotic and inaccessible. A biogeochemical cycle is a pathway by which specific elements of matter are turned over or moved through the biotic (biosphere) and the abiotic (lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere) compartments of Earth.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Biology\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nThe earliest of roots of science, which included medicine, can be traced to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE [11] [12] Their contributions shaped ancient Greek natural philosophy [13] [11] [12] [14] [15] Ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle (384–322 BCE) contributed extensively to the development of biological knowledge [16] He explored biological causation and the diversity of life His successor, Theophrastus, began the scientific study of plants [17] Scholars of the medieval Islamic world who wrote on biology included al-Jahiz (781–869), Al-Dīnawarī (828–896), who wrote on botany, [18] and Rhazes (865–925) who wrote on anatomy and physiology Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought.\n\n\nChemical basis\nAll organisms are made up of chemical elements; [32] oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen account for most (96%) of the mass of all organisms, with calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium constituting essentially all the remainder Different elements can combine to form compounds such as water, which is fundamental to life [32] Biochemistry is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including molecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.\n\n\nAtoms and molecules\nAll organisms are made up of chemical elements; [32] oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen account for most (96%) of the mass of all organisms, with calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium constituting essentially all the remainder Different elements can combine to form compounds such as water, which is fundamental to life [32] Biochemistry is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including molecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.\n\n\nWater\nLife arose from the Earth's first ocean, which formed some 3.8 billion years ago [33] Since then, water continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism Water is important to life because it is an effective solvent, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution Once dissolved in water, these solutes are more likely to come in contact with one another and therefore take part in chemical reactions that sustain life [33] In terms of its molecular structure, water is a small polar molecule with a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (H) atoms to one oxygen (O) atom (H2O) [33] Because the O–H bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge [33] This polar property of water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water cohesive [33] Surface tension results from the cohesive force due to the attraction between molecules at the surface of the liquid [33] Water is also adhesive as it is able to adhere to the surface of any polar or charged non-water molecules [33] Water is denser as a liquid than it is as a solid (or ice) [33] This unique property of water allows ice to float above liquid water such as ponds, lakes, and oceans, thereby insulating the liquid below from the cold air above [33] Water has the capacity to absorb energy, giving it a higher specific heat capacity than other solvents such as ethanol [33] Thus, a large amount of energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules to convert liquid water into water vapor [33] As a molecule, water is not completely stable as each water molecule continuously dissociates into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions before reforming into a water molecule again [33] In pure water, the number of hydrogen ions balances (or equals) the number of hydroxyl ions, resulting in a pH that is neutral.\n\n\nOrganic compounds\nOrganic compounds are molecules that contain carbon bonded to another element such as hydrogen [33] With the exception of water, nearly all the molecules that make up each organism contain carbon [33] [34] Carbon can form covalent bonds with up to four other atoms, enabling it to form diverse, large, and complex molecules [33] [34] For example, a single carbon atom can form four single covalent bonds such as in methane, two double covalent bonds such as in carbon dioxide (CO2), or a triple covalent bond such as in carbon monoxide (CO) Moreover, carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting carbon–carbon bonds such as octane or ring-like structures such as glucose.\n\n\nMacromolecules\nMacromolecules are large molecules made up of smaller subunits or monomers [36] Monomers include sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides [37] Carbohydrates include monomers and polymers of sugars [38]\nLipids are the only class of macromolecules that are not made up of polymers They include steroids, phospholipids, and fats, [37] largely nonpolar and hydrophobic (water-repelling) substances [39]\nProteins are the most diverse of the macromolecules They include enzymes, transport proteins, large signaling molecules, antibodies, and structural proteins The basic unit (or monomer) of a protein is an amino acid [36] Twenty amino acids are used in proteins [36]\nNucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides [40] Their function is to store, transmit, and express hereditary information [37]\n\n\nCells\nCell theory states that cells are the fundamental units of life, that all living things are composed of one or more cells, and that all cells arise from preexisting cells through cell division [41] Most cells are very small, with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers and are therefore only visible under a light or electron microscope [42] There are generally two types of cells: eukaryotic cells, which contain a nucleus, and prokaryotic cells, which do not Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms such as bacteria, whereas eukaryotes can be single-celled or multicellular In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body is derived ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg.\n\n\nCell structure\nEvery cell is enclosed within a cell membrane that separates its cytoplasm from the extracellular space [43] A cell membrane consists of a lipid bilayer, including cholesterols that sit between phospholipids to maintain their fluidity at various temperatures Cell membranes are semipermeable, allowing small molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water to pass through while restricting the movement of larger molecules and charged particles such as ions [44] Cell membranes also contain membrane proteins, including integral membrane proteins that go across the membrane serving as membrane transporters, and peripheral proteins that loosely attach to the outer side of the cell membrane, acting as enzymes shaping the cell [45] Cell membranes are involved in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, storing electrical energy, and cell signalling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures such as a cell wall, glycocalyx, and cytoskeleton.\n\n\nMetabolism\nAll cells require energy to sustain cellular processes Metabolism is the set of chemical reactions in an organism The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to monomer building blocks; and the elimination of metabolic wastes These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments Metabolic reactions may be categorized as catabolic—the breaking down of compounds (for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by cellular respiration); or anabolic—the building up (synthesis) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids) Usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, each step being facilitated by a specific enzyme Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy Enzymes act as catalysts—they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly without being consumed by it—by reducing the amount of activation energy needed to convert reactants into products Enzymes also allow the regulation of the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.\n\n\nCellular respiration\nCellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in cells to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products [48] The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a cell because of the slow, controlled release of energy from the series of reactions.\n\n\nPhotosynthesis\nPhotosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organism's metabolic activities via cellular respiration This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water [50] [51] [52] In most cases, oxygen is released as a waste product Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis, which is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth [53]\n\n\nCell signaling\nCell signaling (or communication) is the ability of cells to receive, process, and transmit signals with its environment and with itself [55] [56] Signals can be non-chemical such as light, electrical impulses, and heat, or chemical signals (or ligands) that interact with receptors, which can be found embedded in the cell membrane of another cell or located deep inside a cell [57] [56] There are generally four types of chemical signals: autocrine, paracrine, juxtacrine, and hormones [57] In autocrine signaling, the ligand affects the same cell that releases it Tumor cells, for example, can reproduce uncontrollably because they release signals that initiate their own self-division In paracrine signaling, the ligand diffuses to nearby cells and affects them For example, brain cells called neurons release ligands called neurotransmitters that diffuse across a synaptic cleft to bind with a receptor on an adjacent cell such as another neuron or muscle cell In juxtacrine signaling, there is direct contact between the signaling and responding cells Finally, hormones are ligands that travel through the circulatory systems of animals or vascular systems of plants to reach their target cells Once a ligand binds with a receptor, it can influence the behavior of another cell, depending on the type of receptor For instance, neurotransmitters that bind with an inotropic receptor can alter the excitability of a target cell Other types of receptors include protein kinase receptors (e.g., receptor for the hormone insulin) and G protein-coupled receptors Activation of G protein-coupled receptors can initiate second messenger cascades The process by which a chemical or physical signal is transmitted through a cell as a series of molecular events is called signal transduction.\n\n\nCell cycle\nThe cell cycle is a series of events that take place in a cell that cause it to divide into two daughter cells These events include the duplication of its DNA and some of its organelles, and the subsequent partitioning of its cytoplasm into two daughter cells in a process called cell division [58] In eukaryotes (i.e., animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells), there are two distinct types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis [59] Mitosis is part of the cell cycle, in which replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei Cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is preceded by the S stage of interphase (during which the DNA is replicated) and is often followed by telophase and cytokinesis; which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane of one cell into two new cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components The different stages of mitosis all together define the mitotic phase of an animal cell cycle—the division of the mother cell into two genetically identical daughter cells [60] The cell cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled fertilized egg develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which hair, skin, blood cells, and some internal organs are renewed After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the interphase of a new cycle In contrast to mitosis, meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions [61] Homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division (meiosis I), and sister chromatids are separated in the second division (meiosis II) Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.\n\n\nSexual reproduction and meiosis\nMeiosis is a central feature of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes, and the most fundamental function of meiosis appears to be conservation of the integrity of the genome that is passed on to progeny by parents [63] [64]  Two aspects of sexual reproduction, meiotic recombination and outcrossing, are likely maintained respectively by the adaptive advantages of recombinational repair of genomic DNA damage and genetic complementation which masks the expression of deleterious recessive mutations [65]\n\n\nGenetics\nGenetics is the scientific study of inheritance [67] [68] [69] Mendelian inheritance, specifically, is the process by which genes and traits are passed on from parents to offspring [29] It has several principles The first is that genetic characteristics, alleles, are discrete and have alternate forms (e.g., purple vs white or tall vs dwarf), each inherited from one of two parents Based on the law of dominance and uniformity, which states that some alleles are dominant while others are recessive; an organism with at least one dominant allele will display the phenotype of that dominant allele During gamete formation, the alleles for each gene segregate, so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene Heterozygotic individuals produce gametes with an equal frequency of two alleles Finally, the law of independent assortment, states that genes of different traits can segregate independently during the formation of gametes, i.e., genes are unlinked An exception to this rule would include traits that are sex-linked Test crosses can be performed to experimentally determine the underlying genotype of an organism with a dominant phenotype [70] A Punnett square can be used to predict the results of a test cross The chromosome theory of inheritance, which states that genes are found on chromosomes, was supported by Thomas Morgans's experiments with fruit flies, which established the sex linkage between eye color and sex in these insects [71]\n\n\nInheritance\nGenetics is the scientific study of inheritance [67] [68] [69]

insects [71]\n\n\nGenes and DNA\nA gene is a unit of heredity that corresponds to a region of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that carries genetic information that controls form or function of an organism DNA is composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix [72] It is found as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes The set of chromosomes in a cell is collectively known as its genome In eukaryotes, DNA is mainly in the cell nucleus [73] In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within the nucleoid [74] The genetic information is held within genes, and the complete assemblage in an organism is called its genotype [75]\nDNA replication is a semiconservative process whereby each strand serves as a template for a new strand of DNA [72] Mutations are heritable changes in DNA [72] They can arise spontaneously as a result of replication errors that were not corrected by proofreading or can be induced by an environmental mutagen such as a chemical (e.g., nitrous acid, benzopyrene) or radiation (e.g., x-ray, gamma ray, ultraviolet radiation, particles emitted by unstable isotopes) [72] Mutations can lead to phenotypic effects such as loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and conditional mutations [72]\nSome mutations are beneficial, as they are a source of genetic variation for evolution [72] Others are harmful if they were to result in a loss of function of genes needed for survival [72]\n\n\nGene expression\nGene expression is the molecular process by which a genotype encoded in DNA gives rise to an observable phenotype in the proteins of an organism's body This process is summarized by the central dogma of molecular biology, which was formulated by Francis Crick in 1958 [76] [77] [78] According to the Central Dogma, genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein There are two gene expression processes: transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation (RNA to protein) [79]\n\n\nGene regulation\nThe regulation of gene expression by environmental factors and during different stages of development can occur at each step of the process such as transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein [80] Gene expression can be influenced by positive or negative regulation, depending on which of the two types of regulatory proteins called transcription factors bind to the DNA sequence close to or at a promoter [80] A cluster of genes that share the same promoter is called an operon, found mainly in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans) [80] [81] In positive regulation of gene expression, the activator is the transcription factor that stimulates transcription when it binds to the sequence near or at the promoter Negative regulation occurs when another transcription factor called a repressor binds to a DNA sequence called an operator, which is part of an operon, to prevent transcription Repressors can be inhibited by compounds called inducers (e.g., allolactose), thereby allowing transcription to occur [80] Specific genes that can be activated by inducers are called inducible genes, in contrast to constitutive genes that are almost constantly active [80] In contrast to both, structural genes encode proteins that are not involved in gene regulation [80] In addition to regulatory events involving the promoter, gene expression can also be regulated by epigenetic changes to chromatin, which is a complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells [80]\n\n\nGenes, development, and evolution\nDevelopment is the process by which a multicellular organism (plant or animal) goes through a series of changes, starting from a single cell, and taking on various forms that are characteristic of its life cycle [82] There are four key processes that underlie development: Determination, differentiation, morphogenesis, and growth Determination sets the developmental fate of a cell, which becomes more restrictive during development Differentiation is the process by which specialized cells arise from less specialized cells such as stem cells [83] [84] Stem cells are undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells that can differentiate into various types of cells and proliferate indefinitely to produce more of the same stem cell [85] Cellular differentiation dramatically changes a cell's size, shape, membrane potential, metabolic activity, and responsiveness to signals, which are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression and epigenetics With a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the DNA sequence itself [86] Thus, different cells can have very different physical characteristics despite having the same genome Morphogenesis, or the development of body form, is the result of spatial differences in gene expression [82] A small fraction of the genes in an organism's genome called the developmental-genetic toolkit control the development of that organism These toolkit genes are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes Hox genes determine where repeating parts, such as the many vertebrae of snakes, will grow in a developing embryo or larva [87]\n\n\nEvolution\nEvolution is a central organizing concept in biology It is the change in heritable characteristics of populations over successive generations [88] [89] In artificial selection, animals were selectively bred for specific traits.\n [90] Given that traits are inherited, populations contain a varied mix of traits, and reproduction is able to increase any population, Darwin argued that in the natural world, it was nature that played the role of humans in selecting for specific traits [90] Darwin inferred that individuals who possessed heritable traits better adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and produce more offspring than other individuals [90] He further inferred that this would lead to the accumulation of favorable traits over successive generations, thereby increasing the match between the organisms and their environment [91] [92] [93] [90] [94]\n\n\nEvolutionary processes\nEvolution is a central organizing concept in biology It is the change in heritable characteristics of populations over successive generations [88]

mate with one another and speciation is the process by which one lineage splits into two lineages as a result of having evolved independently from each other [95] For speciation to occur, there has to be reproductive isolation [95] Reproductive isolation can result from incompatibilities between genes as described by Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model Reproductive isolation also tends to increase with genetic divergence Speciation can occur when there are physical barriers that divide an ancestral species, a process known as allopatric speciation [95]\n\n\nPhylogeny\nA phylogeny is an evolutionary history of a specific group of organisms or their genes [96] It can be represented using a phylogenetic tree, a diagram showing lines of descent among organisms or their genes Each line drawn on the time axis of a tree represents a lineage of descendants of a particular species or population When a lineage divides into two, it is represented as a fork or split on the phylogenetic tree [96] Phylogenetic trees are the basis for comparing and grouping different species [96] Different species that share a feature inherited from a common ancestor are described as having homologous features (or synapomorphy) [97] [98] [96] Phylogeny provides the basis of biological classification [96] This classification system is rank-based, with the highest rank being the domain followed by kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species [96] All organisms can be classified as belonging to one of three domains: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria), bacteria (originally eubacteria), or eukarya (includes the fungi, plant, and animal kingdoms) [99]\n\n\nHistory of life\nThe history of life on Earth traces how organisms have evolved from the earliest emergence of life to present day Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and all life on Earth, both living and extinct, descended from a last universal common ancestor that lived about 3.5 billion years ago [100] [101] Geologists have developed a geologic time scale that divides the history of the Earth into major divisions, starting with four eons (Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic), the first three of which are collectively known as the Precambrian, which lasted approximately 4 billion years [102] Each eon can be divided into eras, with the Phanerozoic eon that began 539 million years ago [103] being subdivided into Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras [102] These three eras together comprise eleven periods (Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary) [102]\n\n\nDiversity\nBacteria are a type of cell that constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms Typically a few micrometers in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, [124] and the deep biosphere of the Earth's crust Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory [125]\n\n\nBacteria and Archaea\nBacteria are a type of cell that constitute a large

symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals Most bacteria have not been characterised, and only about 27 percent of the bacterial phyla have species that can be grown in the laboratory [125]\n\n\nEukaryotes\nEukaryotes are hypothesized to have split from archaea, which was followed by their endosymbioses with bacteria (or symbiogenesis) that gave rise to mitochondria and chloroplasts, both of which are now part of modern-day eukaryotic cells [131] The major lineages of eukaryotes diversified in the Precambrian about 1.5 billion years ago and can be classified into eight major clades: alveolates, excavates, stramenopiles, plants, rhizarians, amoebozoans, fungi, and animals [131] Five of these clades are collectively known as protists, which are mostly microscopic eukaryotic organisms that are not plants, fungi, or animals [131] While it is likely that protists share a common ancestor (the last eukaryotic common ancestor), [132] protists by themselves do not constitute a separate clade as some protists may be more closely related to plants, fungi, or animals than they are to other protists Like groupings such as algae, invertebrates, or protozoans, the protist grouping is not a formal taxonomic group but is used for convenience [131] [133] Most protists are unicellular; these are called microbial eukaryotes [131]\n\n\nViruses\nViruses are submicroscopic infectious agents that replicate inside the cells of organisms [137] Viruses infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea [138] [139] More than 6,000 virus species have been described in detail [140] Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity [141] [142]\n\n\nEcology\nEcology is the study of the distribution and abundance of life, the interaction between organisms and their environment [146]\n\n\nEcosystems\nThe community of living (biotic) organisms in conjunction with the nonliving (abiotic) components (e.g., water, light, radiation, temperature, humidity, atmosphere, acidity, and soil) of their environment is called an ecosystem [147] [148] [149] These biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows [150] Energy from the sun enters the system through photosynthesis and is incorporated into plant tissue By feeding on plants and on one another, animals move matter and energy through the system They also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present By breaking down dead organic matter, decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and other microbes [151]\n\n\nPopulations\nA population is the group of organisms of the same species that occupies an area and reproduce from generation to generation [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] Population size can be estimated by multiplying population density by the area or volume The carrying capacity of an environment is the maximum population size of a species that can be sustained by that specific environment, given the food, habitat, water, and other resources that are available [157] The carrying capacity of a population can be affected by changing environmental conditions such as changes in the availability of resources and the cost of maintaining them In human populations, new technologies such as the Green revolution have helped increase the Earth's carrying capacity for humans over time, which has stymied the attempted predictions of impending population decline, the most famous of which was by Thomas Malthus in the 18th century [152]\n\n\nCommunities\nA community is a group of populations of species occupying the same geographical area at the same time [159] A biological interaction is the effect that a pair of organisms living together in a community have on each other They can be either of the same species (intraspecific interactions), or of different species (interspecific interactions) These effects may be short-term, like pollination and predation, or long-term; both often strongly influence the evolution of the species involved A long-term interaction is called a symbiosis Symbioses range from mutualism, beneficial to both partners, to competition, harmful to both partners [160] Every species participates as a consumer, resource, or both in consumer–resource interactions, which form the core of food chains or food webs [161] There are different trophic levels within any food web, with the lowest level being the primary producers (or autotrophs) such as plants and algae that convert energy and inorganic material into organic compounds, which can then be used by the rest of the community [53] [162] [163] At the next level are the heterotrophs, which are the species that obtain energy by breaking apart organic compounds from other organisms [161] Heterotrophs that consume plants are primary consumers (or herbivores) whereas heterotrophs that consume herbivores are secondary consumers (or carnivores) And those that eat secondary consumers are tertiary consumers and so on Omnivorous heterotrophs are able to consume at multiple levels Finally, there are decomposers that feed on the waste products or dead bodies of organisms [161]\nOn average, the total amount of energy incorporated into the biomass of a trophic level per unit of time is about one-tenth of the energy of the trophic level that it consumes Waste and dead material used by decomposers as well as heat lost from metabolism make up the other ninety percent of energy that is not consumed by the next trophic level [164]\n\n\nBiosphere\nIn the global ecosystem or biosphere, matter exists as different interacting compartments, which can be biotic or abiotic as well as accessible or inaccessible, depending on their forms and locations [166] For example, matter from terrestrial autotrophs are both biotic and accessible to other organisms whereas the matter in rocks and minerals are abiotic and inaccessible A biogeochemical cycle is a pathway by which specific elements of matter are turned over or moved through the biotic (biosphere) and the abiotic (lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere) compartments of Earth There are biogeochemical cycles for nitrogen, carbon, and water.\n\n\nConservation\nConservation biology is the study of the conservation of Earth's biodiversity with the aim of protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions [167] [168] [169] It is concerned with factors that influence the maintenance, loss, and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetic, population, species, and ecosystem diversity [170] [171] [172] [173] The concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50% of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years, [174] which has contributed to poverty, starvation, and will reset the course of evolution on this planet [175] [176] Biodiversity affects the functioning of ecosystems, which provide a variety of services upon which people depend Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends of biodiversity loss, species extinctions, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to sustain the well-being of human society Organizations and citizens are responding to the current biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales [177] [170]

September 2000 at the Mugello Circuit [9] On just the second day of the test, Räikkönen lapped half a second quicker than regular driver Pedro Diniz Sauber had kept the news of his test quiet to distract potential competitors, internally referring to Räikkönen as \"Eskimo\" [10] After further tests in Jerez and Barcelona, Sauber signed Räikkönen for the 2001 season However, some critics (including FIA president Max Mosley) voiced concerns over granting an F1 Super Licence to such an inexperienced driver; Räikkönen had only 23 car races to his credit He was nevertheless granted his licence from the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) after a performance delivery promise by his team boss, Peter Sauber, [11] and scored a championship point in his debut at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix Reportedly, Räikkönen was asleep 30 minutes before the race [12]\n\n\nSauber (2001)\nOn the basis of these results, Peter Sauber gave the Finn a test with the Sauber Formula One team in September 2000 at the Mugello Circuit [9] On just the second day of the test, Räikkönen lapped half a second quicker than regular driver Pedro Diniz Sauber had kept the news of his test quiet

Australian Grand Prix Reportedly, Räikkönen was asleep 30 minutes before the race [12]\n\n\nMcLaren (2002–2006)\nRäikkönen, long linked to Sauber's engine supplier Ferrari, sufficiently impressed McLaren to earn a race seat in Ron Dennis's team for 2002, taking the seat left vacant by double-world champion, mentor and fellow Finn Mika Häkkinen The decision to choose Räikkönen over his Sauber teammate, the Mercedes linked Nick Heidfeld, was heavily influenced by Häkkinen who repeatedly told Ron Dennis \"If you wanna win, get the Finn.\" [13]\n\n\n2002\nRäikkönen scored a third-place podium finish in his first race with McLaren at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix Although McLaren suffered many engine failures in 2002, Räikkönen scored 24 points and four podiums, and held his own against teammate David Coulthard Räikkönen came close to winning his first Grand Prix in France but went off track at the Adelaide hairpin with a handful of laps to go, because of oil from the blown engine of Allan McNish's Toyota on the circuit [14] He finished the race second He finished the season in sixth place, one place behind his teammate Together they achieved a solid third place for McLaren in the Constructors' Championship.\n\n\n2003\nAt the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Räikkönen qualified 15th in the spare car In the race he took the lead before being caught speeding in the pitlane, caused by a software glitch in the car's electronic system Räikkönen held off Michael Schumacher to finish third In Malaysia, Räikkönen won his first race [14] after starting from seventh on the grid During the next round in Brazil, Räikkönen was declared the winner after the race was stopped on lap 55 According to the rules the winner is decided by the race order as of two laps before the race stopped, i.e lap 53 However a week later, evidence emerged that Giancarlo Fisichella was on lap 56 when the race stopped, therefore the winner was decided by the order at lap 54 This granted the win to Fisichella, with Räikkönen second.\n\n\n2004\nThe 2004 season began with Räikkönen only claiming a single point in the first seven races His McLaren, especially the Mercedes engine, suffered repeated breakdowns, allowing him to complete just two of the first seven events After seven rounds Räikkönen had only one point to Michael Schumacher's 60 In Canada, Räikkönen made 5 pit-stops but was classified fifth since the Williams-BMWs and the two Toyotas were disqualified At the United States Grand Prix, Räikkönen finished sixth.\n\n\n2005\nRäikkönen's start to the 2005 season was less than perfect The car was reported to be too soft on its Michelin tyres, with the result that it was not generating enough heat to post competitive qualifying times [16] The best qualifying position that a McLaren driver could manage in the first 3 races was sixth Räikkönen compounded this by stalling on the grid of the first race of the season, the Australian Grand Prix, and ending the race with just a point He looked set for a podium in Malaysia until a faulty tyre valve failed and dropped him out of the points Bahrain saw him achieve his first podium of the season with a third place behind Renault's Alonso and the Toyota of Jarno Trulli.\n\n\n2006\nIn Bahrain, starting from 22nd place on the grid, he drove through the field, ending third behind Alonso and Michael Schumacher In Malaysia, Räikkönen was hit from behind by Red Bull Racing's Christian Klien on the first lap and retired.\n\n\nFerrari (2007–2009)\nAfter the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen had signed a three-year contract with Scuderia Ferrari for the 2007–2009 seasons Räikkönen said after the move that he was very happy with this change of events but wished McLaren the best of luck in the future He became the teammate to Brazilian Felipe Massa, who had been driving for Ferrari since 2006.\n\n\n2007: World Champion\nRäikkönen started the season in Australia by taking pole position, setting the fastest lap, and becoming the first driver since Nigel Mansell in 1989 to win his first Grand Prix with Ferrari.\n\n\n2008\nAfter a disappointing first race in Australia, where Räikkönen eventually finished eighth after qualifying only 15th due to a mechanical problem, he won his first race of the 2008 season at the Malaysian Grand Prix, finishing ahead of Robert Kubica and Heikki Kovalainen His victory in Kuala Lumpur came on the fifth anniversary of his maiden victory at the same track In Bahrain, Räikkönen qualified in fourth on the grid He moved up to second place by the third lap and finished in that position, behind his team-mate Felipe Massa He also secured the lead in the championship.\n\n\n2009\nAt the start of the 2009 season in the Australian Grand Prix, Räikkönen qualified in ninth place The pace of the Ferraris and McLarens in particular was significantly slower than the likes of the Brawn, Red Bull and other outfits who were struggling to keep up with them in 2008 In the race, both Ferraris were running well before Räikkönen hit a barrier He was forced to make an unscheduled pit stop on lap 43 and subsequently retired with differential failure.\n\n\nLeaving Formula One (2010–2011)\nNear the end of the 2009 season, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen would be leaving the team, despite having a contract to race for them in 2010 He would be replaced by Fernando Alonso [59] He was expected to return to McLaren alongside Lewis Hamilton but negotiations with the team failed [60] Räikkönen was then linked to Mercedes GP but the team eventually signed Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg Toyota F1, before it pulled out of Formula One, offered Räikkönen a driving contract to replace Timo Glock in 2010 The BBC reported that he refused the contract owing to wanting to drive a race-winning car, not to mention Toyota not offering a large enough salary [61]\n\n\nReturn to Formula One (2012–2021)\nIn the week before the 2011 Singapore Grand Prix, several news sources reported that Räikkönen was eyeing a return to Formula One for 2012 with Williams, after he was spotted at the team's headquarters in Grove, Oxfordshire [65] On 29 November 2011, it was announced that Räikkönen would be returning to Formula 1 in 2012, signing a two-year contract with Lotus [66]\n\n\nLotus (2012–2013)\nIn the week before the 2011 Singapore Grand Prix, several news sources reported that Räikkönen was eyeing a return to Formula One for 2012 with Williams, after he was spotted at the team's headquarters in Grove, Oxfordshire [65] On 29 November 2011, it was announced that Räikkönen would be returning to Formula 1 in 2012, signing a two-year contract with Lotus [66]\n\n\n2012\nRäikkönen began the season by qualifying 17th for the Australian Grand Prix after making a mistake on his last flying lap However, he recovered his weekend during the race the next day, as he made a good start to move up to twelfth, before making it into the top ten He took three places on the last lap of the race, to finish in seventh place [67] In the dry qualifying session for the Malaysian Grand Prix Räikkönen qualified in fifth place He started the race from 10th place because of an unscheduled gearbox change In the race he had the opportunity to try Pirelli's wet-weather tyres for the first time He finished the race in fifth despite being inexperienced with Pirelli's wet-weather tyres compared to most of the other drivers At the Chinese Grand Prix he was 14th after running second before being overtaken by 10 cars in the space of one lap, due to a mistake in tyre strategy, expecting the Pirelli tyres to last longer in the last stint At the Bahrain Grand Prix he finished second starting from 11th position on the grid It was his first podium and his best finish of this comeback Three weeks later, Räikkönen finished third at the Spanish Grand Prix, after having qualified in fifth place, which had been promoted to fourth as a result of a penalty given to Lewis Hamilton In the Monaco Grand Prix Räikkönen qualified in eighth but finished one place lower in ninth place For the Canadian Grand Prix Räikkönen again had a bad qualifying session finishing 12th He was able to finish eighth in the race taking, as he stated, \"important championship points\" In the European Grand Prix at the Valencia Street Circuit he finished second behind Fernando Alonso [68] In the British Grand Prix he finished fifth, after having qualified in sixth place During qualifying for the German Grand Prix, Räikkönen had good pace in Q1 with the harder set of tyres and was looking good for a potential shot at a higher grid place At the start of Q2 the rain was already heavy meaning that Räikkönen lost the advantage he had in dry conditions In the wet Q3 session he qualified in 10th place Good pace in dry conditions from the qualifying session was proven in the race as Räikkönen succeeded to finish fourth, and eventually gaining the last podium spot after Sebastian Vettel was penalised for an illegal overtaking manoeuvre For the Hungarian Grand Prix Räikkönen qualified fifth He lost fifth place at the start to Alonso due to a KERS issue on his E20 car He succeeded in gaining a position over Alonso during the first round of pit-stops, and later did the same to Button and Vettel during the second round He finished the race in second place, just one second behind the race winner Hamilton.\n\n\n2013\nOn 29 October 2012, Lotus confirmed that Räikkönen would be racing with the team in 2013, after several weeks of speculation that Räikkönen had several other options for 2013, including other forms of motorsport.\n\n\nReturn to Ferrari (2014–2018)\nOn 11 September 2013, it was confirmed that Räikkönen had agreed a 2-year deal to return to Ferrari (where he won the championship in 2007), starting from 2014 [75] [76] He revealed that it was for monetary reasons that he left Lotus [77] [78]\n\n\n2014\nRäikkönen was on for a podium finish at the Monaco Grand Prix However, Max Chilton punctured Räikkönen's left-rear tyre while unlapping himself, forcing Räikkönen to make a second pitstop [91] Räikkönen then set the fastest lap of the race on lap 75, but finished 12th.\n\n\n2015\nRäikkönen had to retire from the first race of the season in Australia due to a loose wheel following a pitstop [94] Following that mishap, he recovered to finish fourth both in Malaysia and China Another pit issue befell Räikkönen during practice for the Bahrain Grand Prix as he was reprimanded for exiting the pitlane in a 'potentially dangerous manner' by the stewards, having swerved around a standing car in an undesignated area However, he escaped a possible grid penalty [95] During the same weekend, his manager Steve Robertson suggested that Räikkönen was heading towards a contract extension with Ferrari [96] That would contradict previous suggestions from Räikkönen himself that he would 'probably' retire at the end of his Ferrari contract, and that 2015 would be his last season [97] Courtesy of a considerate tyre strategy by the Ferrari team, at the Bahrain Grand Prix, Räikkönen finished second after gaining that position late in the race and starting from fourth on the grid [98] In the process, Räikkönen recorded his first podium since the 2013 Korean Grand Prix for Lotus, and the first in his second spell with Ferrari – his most recent Ferrari podium was a third-place finish at the 2009 Italian Grand Prix Räikkönen said that he was hopeful in winning races in the near future after the team's strong recovery relative to 2014 He also commented that, both the engine and downforce had been significantly improved and that the car handled much more to his liking [99] In a post-race interview, Ferrari team boss, Maurizio Arrivabene, described this result as a sign that Räikkönen \"is back\" and that he \"showed what a race animal he is\", also implying that if he had a few more race laps available, Räikkönen would have challenged Hamilton for the race win [100]\n\n\n2016\nFor the second year in a row, Räikkönen had to retire from the first race of the season in Australia, after a fire broke out in his airbox [110] Räikkönen finished in the second place at the Bahrain Grand Prix while his teammate Sebastian Vettel did not start the race after his car broke down on the formation lap [111] Räikkönen outpaced Vettel in qualifying at the Chinese Grand Prix to take third on the grid, however a first lap collision with Vettel saw him damaging his front wing and he dropped down the order, he then showed good pace to move up the field and eventually finished fifth [112] He managed to finish the Russian Grand Prix in third place after a huge start collision, which left his teammate Vettel out of the race This was also the 700th podium in Ferrari's Formula One history [113] [114] Räikkönen finished behind Max Verstappen in second place to take his third podium of the season in the Spanish Grand Prix finishing ahead of Vettel who was third [115]\n\n\n2017\nRäikkönen started the 2017 season with fourth in Australia, fifth in China and then again fourth in Bahrain Räikkönen scored his first podium of the season at the following Russian Grand Prix, finishing third He retired from the Spanish Grand Prix after being involved in an incident on the first lap.\n\n\n2018\nRäikkönen renewed his contract with Ferrari for the 2018 season on 22 August 2017 [131] He qualified second for the first race in Australia and finished third, after being jumped by Vettel during the virtual safety car period At the Bahrain Grand Prix, he qualified second after encountering traffic on his last run [132] He then ran in third for most of the race, but retired on lap 35 due to a pit stop error by Ferrari [133] He went on to finish third at the Chinese Grand Prix after recovering from a strategy aimed at helping his teammate [134]\n\n\nAlfa Romeo (2019–2021)\nOn 11 September 2018, it was announced that Räikkönen would leave Ferrari at the end of the season to rejoin Sauber on a two-year contract, the team he made his Formula One debut with in 2001 [148] Räikkönen made his Sauber return in the postseason Abu Dhabi Pirelli tyre test driving their 2018 car [149] The Sauber team was renamed Alfa Romeo Racing prior to the start of the 2019 season.\n\n\n2019\nOn 11 September 2018, it was announced that Räikkönen would leave Ferrari at the end of the season to rejoin Sauber on a two-year contract, the team he made his Formula One debut

2019 season.\n\n\n2020\nRäikkönen remained at the Alfa Romeo Racing team for the 2020 season The team's Ferrari-powered car proved to be one of the slowest cars of the season, [153] and the team was left fighting at the back of the grid against Haas and Williams [154] During the season Räikkönen scored points twice, finishing ninth at the Tuscan Grand Prix and again ninth at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, while he scored the team's best qualifying result with eighth in Turkey During the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Räikkönen ran as high as second after a red flag and penalties to Lewis Hamilton and Giovinazzi, however ultimately finished 11th and outside the points These results placed him 16th in the drivers' standings with four points, ahead of teammate Antonio Giovinazzi and the Haas and Williams drivers [155] Räikkönen was the highest finishing driver among this group in nine of the season's 17 races, [156] while he finished ahead of his teammate in nine of the 13 races which both finished and qualified ahead of him eight times [157] He was also the highest finishing Ferrari-powered driver on four occasions [158] [159]\n\n\n2021\nRäikkönen continued with Alfa Romeo

race, the steering wheel broke, but he continued, informing his mechanic by frantically waving the steering wheel in the air on the home straight Räikkönen's next Monaco race was also memorable; he was thrown on the wrong side of the safety fence in a first lap collision but continued driving until running out of road Undeterred, he lifted his kart back onto the track and continued to race His

at the Mugello Circuit [9] On just the second day of the test, Räikkönen lapped half a second quicker than regular driver Pedro Diniz Sauber had kept the news of his test quiet to distract potential competitors, internally referring to Räikkönen as \"Eskimo\" [10] After further tests in Jerez and Barcelona, Sauber signed Räikkönen for the 2001 season However, some critics (including FIA president Max Mosley) voiced concerns over granting an F1 Super Licence to such an inexperienced driver; Räikkönen had only 23 car races to his credit He was nevertheless granted his licence from the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) after a performance delivery promise by his team boss, Peter Sauber, [11] and scored a championship point in his debut at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix Reportedly, Räikkönen was asleep 30 minutes before the race [12]\n\n\nSauber (2001)\nOn the basis of these results, Peter Sauber gave the Finn a test with the Sauber Formula One team in September 2000

Reportedly, Räikkönen was asleep 30 minutes before the race [12]\n\n\nMcLaren (2002–2006)\nRäikkönen, long linked to Sauber's engine supplier Ferrari, sufficiently impressed McLaren to earn a race seat in Ron Dennis's team for 2002, taking the seat left vacant by double-world champion, mentor and fellow Finn Mika Häkkinen The decision to choose Räikkönen over his Sauber teammate, the Mercedes linked Nick Heidfeld, was heavily influenced by Häkkinen who repeatedly told Ron Dennis \"If you wanna win, get the Finn.\" [13]\n\n\n2002\nRäikkönen scored a third-place podium finish in his first race with McLaren at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix Although McLaren suffered many engine failures in 2002, Räikkönen scored 24 points and four podiums, and held his own against teammate David Coulthard Räikkönen came close to winning his first Grand Prix in France but went off track at the Adelaide hairpin with a handful of laps to go, because of oil from the blown engine of Allan McNish's Toyota on the circuit [14] He finished the race second He finished the season in sixth place, one place behind his teammate Together they achieved a solid third place for McLaren in the Constructors' Championship.\n\n\n2003\nAt the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Räikkönen qualified 15th in the spare car In the race he took the lead before being caught speeding in the pitlane, caused by a software glitch in the car's electronic system Räikkönen held off Michael Schumacher to finish third In Malaysia, Räikkönen won his first race [14] after starting from seventh on the grid During the next round in Brazil, Räikkönen was declared the winner after the race was stopped on lap 55 According to the rules the winner is decided by the race order as of two laps before the race stopped, i.e lap 53 However a week later, evidence emerged that Giancarlo Fisichella was on lap 56 when the race stopped, therefore the winner was decided by the order at lap 54 This granted the win to Fisichella, with Räikkönen second.\n\n\n2004\nThe 2004 season began with Räikkönen only claiming a single point in the first seven races His McLaren, especially the Mercedes engine, suffered repeated breakdowns, allowing him to complete just two of the first seven events After seven rounds Räikkönen had only one point to Michael Schumacher's 60 In Canada, Räikkönen made 5 pit-stops but was classified fifth since the Williams-BMWs and the two Toyotas were disqualified At the United States Grand Prix, Räikkönen finished sixth.\n\n\n2005\nRäikkönen's start to the 2005 season was less than perfect The car was reported to be too soft on its Michelin tyres, with the result that it was not generating enough heat to post competitive qualifying times [16] The best qualifying position that a McLaren driver could manage in the first 3 races was sixth Räikkönen compounded this by stalling on the grid of the first race of the season, the Australian Grand Prix, and ending the race with just a point He looked set for a podium in Malaysia until a faulty tyre valve failed and dropped him out of the points Bahrain saw him achieve his first podium of the season with a third place behind Renault's Alonso and the Toyota of Jarno Trulli.\n\n\n2006\nIn Bahrain, starting from 22nd place on the grid, he drove through the field, ending third behind Alonso and Michael Schumacher In Malaysia, Räikkönen was hit from behind by Red Bull Racing's Christian Klien on the first lap and retired.\n\n\nFerrari (2007–2009)\nAfter the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen had signed a three-year contract with Scuderia Ferrari for the 2007–2009 seasons Räikkönen said after the move that he was very happy with this change of events but wished McLaren the best of luck in the future He became the teammate to Brazilian Felipe Massa, who had been driving for Ferrari since 2006.\n\n\n2007: World Champion\nRäikkönen started the season in Australia by taking pole position, setting the fastest lap, and becoming the first driver since Nigel Mansell in 1989 to win his first Grand Prix with Ferrari.\n\n\n2008\nAfter a disappointing first race in Australia, where Räikkönen eventually finished eighth after qualifying only 15th due to a mechanical problem, he won his first race of the 2008 season at the Malaysian Grand Prix, finishing ahead of Robert Kubica and Heikki Kovalainen His victory in Kuala Lumpur came on the fifth anniversary of his maiden victory at the same track In Bahrain, Räikkönen qualified in fourth on the grid He moved up to second place by the third lap and finished in that position, behind his team-mate Felipe Massa He also secured the lead in the championship.\n\n\n2009\nAt the start of the 2009 season in the Australian Grand Prix, Räikkönen qualified in ninth place The pace of the Ferraris and McLarens in particular was significantly slower than the likes of the Brawn, Red Bull and other outfits who were struggling to keep up with them in 2008 In the race, both Ferraris were running well before Räikkönen hit a barrier He was forced to make an unscheduled pit stop on lap 43 and subsequently retired with differential failure.\n\n\nLeaving Formula One (2010–2011)\nNear the end of the 2009 season, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen would be leaving the team, despite having a contract to race for them in 2010 He would be replaced by Fernando Alonso [59] He was expected to return to McLaren alongside Lewis Hamilton but negotiations with the team failed [60] Räikkönen was then linked to Mercedes GP but the team eventually signed Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg Toyota F1, before it pulled out of Formula One, offered Räikkönen a driving contract to replace Timo Glock in 2010 The BBC reported that he refused the contract owing to wanting to drive a race-winning car, not to mention Toyota not offering a large enough salary [61]\n\n\nReturn to Formula One (2012–2021)\nIn the week before the 2011 Singapore Grand Prix, several news sources reported that Räikkönen was eyeing a return to Formula One for 2012 with Williams, after he was spotted at the team's headquarters in Grove, Oxfordshire [65] On 29 November 2011, it was announced that Räikkönen would be returning to Formula 1 in 2012, signing a two-year contract with Lotus [66]\n\n\nLotus (2012–2013)\nIn the week before the 2011 Singapore Grand Prix, several news sources reported that Räikkönen was eyeing a return to Formula One for 2012 with Williams, after he was spotted at the team's headquarters in Grove, Oxfordshire [65] On 29 November 2011, it was announced that Räikkönen would be returning to Formula 1 in 2012, signing a two-year contract with Lotus [66]\n\n\n2012\nRäikkönen began the season by qualifying 17th for the Australian Grand Prix after making a mistake on his last flying lap However, he recovered his weekend during the race the next day, as he made a good start to move up to twelfth, before making it into the top ten He took three places on the last lap of the race, to finish in seventh place [67] In the dry qualifying session for the Malaysian Grand Prix Räikkönen qualified in fifth place He started the race from 10th place because of an unscheduled gearbox change In the race he had the opportunity to try Pirelli's wet-weather tyres for the first time He finished the race in fifth despite being inexperienced with Pirelli's wet-weather tyres compared to most of the other drivers At the Chinese Grand Prix he was 14th after running second before being overtaken by 10 cars in the space of one lap, due to a mistake in tyre strategy, expecting the Pirelli tyres to last longer in the last stint At the Bahrain Grand Prix he finished second starting from 11th position on the grid It was his first podium and his best finish of this comeback Three weeks later, Räikkönen finished third at the Spanish Grand Prix, after having qualified in fifth place, which had been promoted to fourth as a result of a penalty given to Lewis Hamilton In the Monaco Grand Prix Räikkönen qualified in eighth but finished one place lower in ninth place For the Canadian Grand Prix Räikkönen again had a bad qualifying session finishing 12th He was able to finish eighth in the race taking, as he stated, \"important championship points\" In the European Grand Prix at the Valencia Street Circuit he finished second behind Fernando Alonso [68] In the British Grand Prix he finished fifth, after having qualified in sixth place During qualifying for the German Grand Prix, Räikkönen had good pace in Q1 with the harder set of tyres and was looking good for a potential shot at a higher grid place At the start of Q2 the rain was already heavy meaning that Räikkönen lost the advantage he had in dry conditions In the wet Q3 session he qualified in 10th place Good pace in dry conditions from the qualifying session was proven in the race as Räikkönen succeeded to finish fourth, and eventually gaining the last podium spot after Sebastian Vettel was penalised for an illegal overtaking manoeuvre For the Hungarian Grand Prix Räikkönen qualified fifth He lost fifth place at the start to Alonso due to a KERS issue on his E20 car He succeeded in gaining a position over Alonso during the first round of pit-stops, and later did the same to Button and Vettel during the second round He finished the race in second place, just one second behind the race winner Hamilton.\n\n\n2013\nOn 29 October 2012, Lotus confirmed that Räikkönen would be racing with the team in 2013, after several weeks of speculation that Räikkönen had several other options for 2013, including other forms of motorsport.\n\n\nReturn to Ferrari (2014–2018)\nOn 11 September 2013, it was confirmed that Räikkönen had agreed a 2-year deal to return to Ferrari (where he won the championship in 2007), starting from 2014 [75] [76] He revealed that it was for monetary reasons that he left Lotus [77] [78]\n\n\n2014\nRäikkönen was on for a podium finish at the Monaco Grand Prix However, Max Chilton punctured Räikkönen's left-rear tyre while unlapping himself, forcing Räikkönen to make a second pitstop [91] Räikkönen then set the fastest lap of the race on lap 75, but finished 12th.\n\n\n2015\nRäikkönen had to retire from the first race of the season in Australia due to a loose wheel following a pitstop [94] Following that mishap, he recovered to finish fourth both in Malaysia and China Another pit issue befell Räikkönen during practice for the Bahrain Grand Prix as he was reprimanded for exiting the pitlane in a 'potentially dangerous manner' by the stewards, having swerved around a standing car in an undesignated area However, he escaped a possible grid penalty [95] During the same weekend, his manager Steve Robertson suggested that Räikkönen was heading towards a contract extension with Ferrari [96] That would contradict previous suggestions from Räikkönen himself that he would 'probably' retire at the end of his Ferrari contract, and that 2015 would be his last season [97] Courtesy of a considerate tyre strategy by the Ferrari team, at the Bahrain Grand Prix, Räikkönen finished second after gaining that position late in the race and starting from fourth on the grid [98] In the process, Räikkönen recorded his first podium since the 2013 Korean Grand Prix for Lotus, and the first in his second spell with Ferrari – his most recent Ferrari podium was a third-place finish at the 2009 Italian Grand Prix Räikkönen said that he was hopeful in winning races in the near future after the team's strong recovery relative to 2014 He also commented that, both the engine and downforce had been significantly improved and that the car handled much more to his liking [99] In a post-race interview, Ferrari team boss, Maurizio Arrivabene, described this result as a sign that Räikkönen \"is back\" and that he \"showed what a race animal he is\", also implying that if he had a few more race laps available, Räikkönen would have challenged Hamilton for the race win [100]\n\n\n2016\nFor the second year in a row, Räikkönen had to retire from the first race of the season in Australia, after a fire broke out in his airbox [110] Räikkönen finished in the second place at the Bahrain Grand Prix while his teammate Sebastian Vettel did not start the race after his car broke down on the formation lap [111] Räikkönen outpaced Vettel in qualifying at the Chinese Grand Prix to take third on the grid, however a first lap collision with Vettel saw him damaging his front wing and he dropped down the order, he then showed good pace to move up the field and eventually finished fifth [112] He managed to finish the Russian Grand Prix in third place after a huge start collision, which left his teammate Vettel out of the race This was also the 700th podium in Ferrari's Formula One history [113] [114] Räikkönen finished behind Max Verstappen in second place to take his third podium of the season in the Spanish Grand Prix finishing ahead of Vettel who was third [115]\n\n\n2017\nRäikkönen started the 2017 season with fourth in Australia, fifth in China and then again fourth in Bahrain Räikkönen scored his first podium of the season at the following Russian Grand Prix, finishing third He retired from the Spanish Grand Prix after being involved in an incident on the first lap.\n\n\n2018\nRäikkönen renewed his contract with Ferrari for the 2018 season on 22 August 2017 [131] He qualified second for the first race in Australia and finished third, after being jumped by Vettel during the virtual safety car period At the Bahrain Grand Prix, he qualified second after encountering traffic on his last run [132] He then ran in third for most of the race, but retired on lap 35 due to a pit stop error by Ferrari [133] He went on to finish third at the Chinese Grand Prix after recovering from a strategy aimed at helping his teammate [134]\n\n\nAlfa Romeo (2019–2021)\nOn 11 September 2018, it was announced that Räikkönen would leave Ferrari at the end of the season to rejoin Sauber on a two-year contract, the team he made his Formula One debut with in 2001 [148] Räikkönen made his Sauber

remained at the Alfa Romeo Racing team for the 2020 season The team's Ferrari-powered car proved to be one of the slowest cars of the season, [153] and the team was left fighting at the back of the grid against Haas and Williams [154] During the season Räikkönen scored points twice, finishing ninth at the Tuscan Grand Prix and again ninth at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, while he scored the team's best qualifying result with eighth in Turkey During the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Räikkönen ran as high as second after a red flag and penalties to Lewis Hamilton and Giovinazzi, however ultimately finished 11th and outside the points These results placed him 16th in the drivers' standings with four points, ahead of teammate Antonio Giovinazzi and the Haas and Williams drivers [155] Räikkönen was the highest finishing driver among this group in nine of the season's 17 races, [156] while he finished ahead of his teammate in nine of the 13 races which both finished and qualified

The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used \"photos compiled from the online face books of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the 'hotter' person\" [15] Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours [16] The site was sent to several campus group listservs, but was shut down a few days later by Harvard administration Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged with breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy Ultimately, the charges were dropped [15] Zuckerberg expanded on this project that semester by creating a social study tool He uploaded art images, each accompanied by a comments section, to a website he shared with his classmates [17]\n\n\n2006–2012: Public access, Microsoft alliance, and rapid growth\nIn May 2006, Facebook hired its first intern, Julie Zhuo [39] After a month, Zhuo was hired as a full-time engineer [39] On September 26, 2006, Facebook opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email address [40] [41] [42] By late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 pages on which companies promoted themselves [43] Organization pages began rolling out in May 2009 [44] On October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240 million ($353 million in 2023 dollars [20]), giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15 billion ($22 billion in 2023 dollars [20]) Microsoft's purchase included rights to place international advertisements [45] [46]\n\n\n2012–2013: IPO, lawsuits, and one billion active users\nIn March 2012, Facebook announced App Center, a store selling applications that operate via the website The store was to be available on iPhones, Android devices, and for mobile web users [82]\n\n\n2013–2014: Site developments, A4AI, and 10th anniversary\nOn January 15, 2013, Facebook announced Facebook Graph Search, which provides users with a \"precise answer\", rather than a link to an answer by leveraging data present on its site [100] Facebook emphasized that the feature would be \"privacy-aware\", returning results only from content already shared with the user [101] On April 3, 2013, Facebook unveiled Facebook Home, a user-interface layer for Android devices offering greater integration with the site HTC announced HTC First, a phone with Home pre-loaded [102]\n\n\n2015–2020: Algorithm revision; fake news\nAs of 2015 [update], Facebook's algorithm was revised in an attempt to filter out false or misleading content, such as fake news stories and hoaxes It relied on users who flag a story accordingly Facebook maintained that satirical content should not be intercepted [119] The algorithm was accused of maintaining a \"filter bubble\", where material the user disagrees with [120] and posts with few likes would be deprioritized [121] In November, Facebook extended paternity leave from 4 weeks to 4 months [122]\n\n\n2020–present: FTC lawsuit, corporate re-branding, shut down of facial recognition technology, ease of policy\nIn January 2021, as part of a redesign, Facebook removed likes from its public pages used by famous people and brands [192]\n\n\nOctober 4, 2021, global service outage\nOn October 4, 2021, Facebook had its worst outage since 2008 The outage was global in scope, and took down all Facebook properties, including Instagram and WhatsApp, from approximately 15:39 UTC to 22:05 UTC, and affected roughly three billion users [216] [217] [218] Security experts identified the problem as a BGP withdrawal of all of the IP routes to their Domain Name (DNS) servers which were all self-hosted at the time [219] [220] The outage also affected all internal communications systems used by Facebook employees, which disrupted restoration efforts [220]\n\n\nShutdown of facial recognition\nOn November 2, 2021, Facebook announced it would shut down its facial recognition technology and delete the data on over a billion users [229] Meta later announced plans to implement the technology as well as other biometric systems in its future products, such as the metaverse [230]\n\n\nFeatures\nFacebook posts can have an unlimited number of characters They can also have images and videos.\n\n\nWebsite\nThe site's primary color is blue as Zuckerberg is red–green colorblind, a realization that occurred after a test taken around 2007 [232] [233] Facebook was initially built using PHP, a popular scripting language designed for web development [234] PHP was used to create dynamic content and manage data on the server side of the Facebook application Zuckerberg and co-founders chose PHP for its simplicity and ease of use, which allowed them to quickly develop and deploy the initial version of Facebook As Facebook grew in user base and functionality, the company encountered scalability and performance challenges with PHP In response, Facebook engineers developed tools and technologies to optimize PHP performance One of the most significant was the creation of the HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) This significantly improved the performance and efficiency of PHP code execution on Facebook's servers.\n\n\nTechnical aspects\nThe site's primary color is blue as Zuckerberg is red–green colorblind, a realization that occurred after a test taken around 2007 [232] [233] Facebook was initially built using PHP, a popular scripting language designed for web development [234] PHP was used to create dynamic content and manage data on the server side of the Facebook application Zuckerberg and co-founders chose PHP

scalability and performance challenges with PHP In response, Facebook engineers developed tools and technologies to optimize PHP performance One of the most significant was the creation of the HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) This significantly improved the performance and efficiency of PHP code execution on Facebook's servers.\n\n\n2012 architecture\nFacebook is developed as one monolithic application According to an interview in 2012 with Facebook build engineer Chuck Rossi, Facebook compiles into a 1.5 GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom BitTorrent-based release system Rossi stated that it takes about 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers The build and release process has zero downtime Changes to Facebook are rolled out daily [236]\n\n\nContent delivery network (CDN)\nFacebook uses its own content delivery network or \"edge network\" under the domain fbcdn.net for serving static data [238] [239] Until the mid-2010s, Facebook also relied on Akamai for CDN services [240] [241] [242]\n\n\nHack programming language\nOn March 20, 2014, Facebook announced a new open-source programming language called Hack Before public release, a large portion of Facebook was already running and \"battle tested\" using the new language [243]\n\n\nUser profile/personal timeline\nEach registered user on Facebook has a personal profile that shows their posts and content [244] The format of individual user pages was revamped in September 2011 and became known as \"Timeline\", a chronological feed of a user's stories, [245] [246] including status updates, photos, interactions with apps and events [247] The layout let users add a \"cover photo\" [247] Users were given more privacy settings [247] In 2007, Facebook launched Facebook Pages for brands and celebrities to interact with their fanbases [248] [249] 100,000 Pages [further explanation needed] launched in November [250] In June 2009, Facebook introduced a \"Usernames\" feature, allowing users to choose a unique nickname used in the URL for their personal profile, for easier sharing [251] [252]\n\n\nNews Feed\nNews Feed appears on every user's homepage and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events and friends' birthdays [258] This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause [259] Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users) [260] Zuckerberg apologized for the site's failure to include appropriate privacy features Users then gained control over what types of information are shared automatically with friends Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts and newly added friends [261]\n\n\nLike button\nThe \"like\" button, stylized as a \"thumbs up\" icon, was first enabled on February 9, 2009, [285] and enables users to easily interact with status updates, comments, photos and videos, links shared by friends, and advertisements Once clicked by a user, the designated content is more likely to appear in friends' News Feeds [286] [287] The button displays the number of other users who have liked the content [288] The like button was extended to comments in June 2010 [289] In February 2016, Facebook expanded Like into \"Reactions\", choosing among five pre-defined emotions, including \"Love\", \"Haha\", \"Wow\", \"Sad\", or \"Angry\" [290] [291] [292] [293] In late April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a new \"Care\" reaction was added [294]\n\n\nInstant messaging\nFacebook Messenger is an instant messaging service and software application It began as Facebook Chat in 2008, [295] was revamped in 2010 [296] and eventually became a standalone mobile app in August 2011, while remaining part of the user page on browsers [297]\n\n\nPrivacy policy\nFacebook's data policy outlines its policies for collecting, storing, and sharing user's data [321] Facebook enables users to control access to individual posts and their profile [322] through privacy settings [323] The user's name and profile picture (if applicable) are public.\n\n\nBug Bounty Program\nOn July 29, 2011, Facebook announced its Bug Bounty Program that paid security researchers a minimum of $500 ($677.00 in 2023 dollars [20]) for reporting security holes The company promised not to pursue \"white hat\" hackers who identified such problems [326] [327] This led researchers in many countries to participate, particularly in India and Russia [328]\n\n\nReception\nFacebook's rapid growth began as soon as it became available and continued through 2018, before beginning to decline.\n\n\nUserbase\nFacebook's rapid growth began as soon as it became available and continued through 2018, before beginning to decline.\n\n\nDemographics\nThe highest number of Facebook users as of April 2023 are from India and the United States, followed by Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines [342] Region-wise, the highest number of users in 2018 are from Asia-Pacific (947 million) followed by Europe (381 million) and US-Canada (242 million) The rest of the world has 750 million users [343]\n\n\nCensorship\nIn many countries the social networking sites and mobile apps have been blocked temporarily, intermittently, or permanently, including: Brazil, [344] China, [345] Iran, [346] Vietnam, [347] Pakistan, [348] Syria, [349] and North Korea In May 2018, the government of Papua New Guinea announced that it would ban Facebook for a month while it considered the impact of the website on the country, though no ban has since occurred [350] In 2019, Facebook announced it would start enforcing its ban on users, including influencers, promoting any vape, tobacco products, or weapons on its platforms [351]\n\n\nCriticisms and controversies\n\"I'm here today because I believe Facebook's products harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people.\"\n\n\nPrivacy\nFacebook has experienced a steady stream of controversies over how it handles user privacy, repeatedly adjusting its privacy settings and policies [395]\n\n\nRacial bias\nFacebook was accused of committing \"systemic\" racial bias by EEOC based on the complaints of three rejected candidates and a current employee of the company The three rejected employees along with the Operational Manager at Facebook as of March 2021 accused the firm of discriminating against Black people The EEOC has initiated an investigation into the case [409]\n\n\nShadow profiles\nA \"shadow profile\" refers to the data Facebook collects about individuals without their explicit permission For example, the \"like\" button that appears on third-party websites allows the company to collect information about an individual's internet browsing habits, even if the individual is not a Facebook user [410] [411] Data can also be collected by other users For example, a Facebook user can link their email account to their Facebook to find friends on the site, allowing the company to collect the email addresses of users and non-users alike [412] Over time, countless data points about an individual are collected; any single data point perhaps cannot identify an individual, but together allows the company to form a unique \"profile\".\n\n\nCambridge Analytica\nFacebook customer Global Science Research sold information on over 87 million Facebook users to Cambridge Analytica, a political data analysis firm led by Alexander Nix [413] While approximately 270,000 people used the app, Facebook's API permitted data collection from their friends without their knowledge [414] At first Facebook downplayed the significance of the breach, and suggested that Cambridge Analytica no longer had access Facebook then issued a statement expressing alarm and suspended Cambridge Analytica Review of documents and interviews with former Facebook employees suggested that Cambridge Analytica still possessed the data [415] This was a violation of Facebook's consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission This violation potentially carried a penalty of $40,000 ($48,534 in 2023 dollars [20]) per occurrence, totalling trillions of dollars [416]\n\n\nDataSpii\nIn July 2019, cybersecurity researcher Sam Jadali exposed a catastrophic data leak known as DataSpii involving data provider DDMR and marketing intelligence company Nacho Analytics (NA) [430] [431] Branding itself as the \"God mode for the internet,\" NA through DDMR, provided its members access to private Facebook photos and Facebook Messenger attachments including tax returns [432] DataSpii harvested data from millions of Chrome and Firefox users through compromised browser extensions [433] The NA website stated it collected data from millions of opt-in users Jadali, along with journalists from Ars Technica and The Washington Post, interviewed impacted users, including a Washington Post staff member According to the interviews, the impacted users did not consent to such collection.\n\n\nBreaches\nOn September 28, 2018, Facebook experienced a major breach in its security, exposing the data of 50 million users The data breach started in July 2017 and was discovered on September 16 [435] Facebook notified users affected by the exploit and logged them out of their accounts [436] [437]\n\n\nPhone data and activity\nAfter acquiring Onavo in 2013, Facebook used its Onavo Protect virtual private network (VPN) app to collect information on users' web traffic and app usage This allowed Facebook to monitor its competitors' performance, and motivated Facebook to acquire WhatsApp in 2014 [443] [444] [445] Media outlets classified Onavo Protect as spyware [446] [447] [448] In August 2018, Facebook removed the app in response to pressure from Apple, who asserted that it violated their guidelines [449] [450] The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission sued Facebook on December 16, 2020, for \"false, misleading or deceptive conduct\" in response to the company's use of personal data obtained from Onavo for business purposes in contrast to Onavo's privacy-oriented marketing [451] [452]\n\n\nPublic apologies\nThe company first apologized for its privacy abuses in 2009 [467]\n\n\nContent disputes and moderation\nFacebook relies on its users to generate the content that bonds its users to the service The company has come under criticism both for allowing objectionable content, including conspiracy theories and fringe discourse, [473] and for prohibiting other content that it deems inappropriate.\n\n\nMisinformation and fake news\nFacebook has been criticized as a vector for fake news, and has been accused of bearing responsibility for the conspiracy theory that the United States created ISIS, [474] false anti-Rohingya posts being used by Myanmar's military to fuel genocide and ethnic cleansing, [475] [476] enabling climate change denial [477] [478] [479] and Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theorists, [480] and anti-refugee attacks in Germany [481] [482] [483] The government of the Philippines has also used Facebook as a tool to attack its critics [484]\n\n\nThreats and incitement\nProfessor Ilya Somin reported that he had been the subject of death threats on Facebook in April 2018 from Cesar Sayoc, who threatened to kill Somin and his family and \"feed the bodies to Florida alligators\" Somin's Facebook friends reported the comments to Facebook, which did nothing except dispatch automated messages [499] Sayoc was later arrested for the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts directed at Democratic politicians.\n\n\nTerrorism\nForce v Facebook, Inc., 934 F.3d 53 (2nd Cir 2019) was a case that alleged Facebook was profiting off recommendations for Hamas In 2019, the US Second Circuit Appeals Court held that Section 230 bars civil terrorism claims against social media companies and internet service providers, the first federal appellate court to do so.\n\n\nHate speech\nIn October 2020, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan urged Mark Zuckerberg, through a letter posted on government's Twitter account, to ban Islamophobic content on Facebook, warning that it encouraged extremism and violence [500]\n\n\nViolent Erotica\nThere are ads on Facebook and Instagram containing sexually explicit content, descriptions of graphic violence and content promoting acts of self harm Many of the ads are for webnovel apps backed by tech giants Bytedance and Tencent [506]\n\n\nInfoWars\nFacebook was criticized for allowing InfoWars to publish falsehoods and conspiracy theories [490] [507] [508] [509] [510] Facebook defended its actions in regard to InfoWars, saying \"we just don't think banning Pages for sharing conspiracy theories or false news is the right way to go.\" [508] Facebook provided only six cases in which it fact-checked content on the InfoWars page over the period September 2017 to July 2018 [490] In 2018, InfoWars falsely claimed that the survivors of the Parkland shooting were \"actors\" Facebook pledged to remove InfoWars content making the claim, although InfoWars videos pushing the false claims were left up, even though Facebook had been contacted about the videos [490] Facebook stated that the videos never explicitly called them actors [490] Facebook also allowed InfoWars videos that shared the Pizzagate conspiracy theory to survive, despite specific assertions that it would purge Pizzagate content [490] In late July 2018, Facebook suspended the personal profile of InfoWars head Alex Jones for 30 days [511] In early August 2018, Facebook banned the four most active InfoWars-related pages for hate speech [512]\n\n\nPolitical manipulation\nAs a dominant social-web service with massive outreach, Facebook has been used by identified or unidentified political operatives to affect public opinion Some of these activities have been done in violation of the platform policies, creating \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\", support or attacks These activities can be scripted or paid Various such abusive campaign have been revealed in recent years, best known being the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections In 2021, former Facebook analyst within the Spam and Fake Engagement teams, Sophie Zhang, reported more than 25 political subversion operations and criticized the general slow reaction time, oversightless, laissez-faire attitude by Facebook [513] [514] [515]\n\n\nInfluence Operations and Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior\nIn 2018, Facebook stated that during 2018 they had identified \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" in \"many Pages, Groups and accounts created to stir up political debate, including in the US, the Middle East, Russia and the UK.\" [516]\n\n\nRussian interference\nIn 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian organizations for \"engaging in operations to interfere with U.S political and electoral processes, including the 2016 presidential election.\" [550] [551] [552]\n\n\nAnti-Rohingya propaganda\nIn 2018, Facebook took down 536 Facebook pages, 17 Facebook groups, 175 Facebook accounts, and 16 Instagram accounts linked to the Myanmar military Collectively these were followed by over 10 million people [578] The New York Times reported that: [579]\n\n\nAnti-Muslim propaganda and Hindu nationalism in India\nA 2019 book titled The Real Face of Facebook in India, co-authored by the journalists Paranjoy Guha Thakurta and Cyril Sam, alleged that Facebook helped enable and benefited from the rise of Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India [580]\n\n\nCompany governance\nEarly Facebook investor and former Zuckerberg mentor Roger McNamee described Facebook as having \"the most centralized decision-making structure I have ever encountered in a large company.\" [605] Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder argued for transforming Facebook into a platform cooperative owned and governed by the users [606]\n\n\nCustomer Support\nFacebook has been criticized for its lack of human customer support [611] When users personal and business accounts are breached, many are forced to go through small claims court to regain access and restitution [612]\n\n\nLitigation\nThe company has been subject to repeated litigation [613] [614] [615] [616] Its most prominent case addressed allegations that Zuckerberg broke an oral contract with Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra to build the then-named \"HarvardConnection\" social network in 2004 [617] [618] [619]\n\n\nImpact\nA commentator in The Washington Post noted that Facebook constitutes a \"massive depository of information that documents both our reactions to events and our evolving customs with a scope and immediacy of which earlier historians could only dream\" [630] Especially for anthropologists, social researchers, and social historians—and subject to proper preservation and curation—the website \"will preserve images of our lives that are vastly crisper and more nuanced than any ancestry record in existence\" [630]\n\n\nScope\nA commentator in The Washington Post noted that Facebook constitutes a \"massive depository of information that

social historians—and subject to proper preservation and curation—the website \"will preserve images of our lives that are vastly crisper and more nuanced than any ancestry record in existence\" [630]\n\n\nEconomy\nEconomists have noted that Facebook offers many non-rivalrous services that benefit as many users as are interested without forcing users to compete with each other By contrast, most goods are available to a limited number of users E.g., if one user buys a phone, no other user can buy that phone Three areas add the most economic impact: platform competition, the market place and user behavior data [631]\n\n\nSociety\nFacebook was one of the first large-scale social networks In The Facebook Effect, David Kirkpatrick stated that Facebook's structure makes it difficult to replace, because of its \"network effects\" [neutrality is disputed] As of 2016, it is estimated that 44 percent of the US population gets news through Facebook [636] A study published at Frontiers

the Facebook application Zuckerberg and co-founders chose PHP for its simplicity and ease of use, which allowed them to quickly develop and deploy the initial version of Facebook As Facebook grew in user base and functionality, the company encountered scalability and performance challenges with PHP In response, Facebook engineers developed tools and technologies to optimize PHP performance One of the most significant was the creation of the HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) This significantly improved the performance and efficiency of PHP code execution on Facebook's servers.\n\n\nTechnical

and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events and friends' birthdays [258] This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause [259] Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users) [260] Zuckerberg apologized for the site's failure to include appropriate privacy features Users then gained control over what types of information are shared automatically with friends Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts and newly added friends [261]\n\n\nLike button\nThe \"like\"

no ban has since occurred [350] In 2019, Facebook announced it would start enforcing its ban on users, including influencers, promoting any vape, tobacco products, or weapons on its platforms [351]\n\n\nCriticisms and controversies\n\"I'm here today because I believe Facebook's products harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy The company's leadership knows how to make

without their explicit permission For example, the \"like\" button that appears on third-party websites allows the company to collect information about an individual's internet browsing habits, even if the individual is not a Facebook user [410] [411] Data can also be collected by other users For example, a Facebook user can link their email account to their Facebook to find friends on the site, allowing the company to collect the email addresses of users and non-users alike [412] Over time, countless data points about an individual are collected; any single data point perhaps cannot identify an individual, but together allows the company to form a unique \"profile\".\n\n\nCambridge Analytica\nFacebook customer Global Science Research sold information on over 87 million Facebook users to Cambridge Analytica, a political data analysis firm led by Alexander Nix [413] While approximately 270,000 people used the app, Facebook's API permitted data collection from their friends without

suspended Cambridge Analytica Review of documents and interviews with former Facebook employees suggested that Cambridge Analytica still possessed the data [415] This was a violation of Facebook's consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission This violation potentially carried a penalty of $40,000 ($48,534 in 2023 dollars [20]) per occurrence, totalling trillions of dollars [416]\n\n\nDataSpii\nIn July 2019, cybersecurity researcher Sam Jadali exposed a catastrophic data leak known as DataSpii involving data provider DDMR and marketing intelligence company Nacho

Facebook used its Onavo Protect virtual private network (VPN) app to collect information on users' web traffic and app usage This allowed Facebook to monitor its competitors' performance, and motivated Facebook to acquire WhatsApp in 2014 [443] [444] [445] Media outlets classified Onavo Protect as spyware [446] [447] [448] In August 2018, Facebook removed the app in response to pressure from Apple, who asserted that it violated their guidelines [449] [450] The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission sued Facebook on December 16, 2020, for \"false, misleading or deceptive conduct\" in response to the company's use of personal data obtained from Onavo for business purposes in contrast to Onavo's privacy-oriented marketing [451] [452]\n\n\nPublic apologies\nThe company

2018 [490] In 2018, InfoWars falsely claimed that the survivors of the Parkland shooting were \"actors\" Facebook pledged to remove InfoWars content making the claim, although InfoWars videos pushing the false claims were left up, even though Facebook had been contacted about the videos [490] Facebook stated that the videos never explicitly called them actors [490] Facebook also allowed InfoWars videos that shared the Pizzagate conspiracy theory to survive, despite specific assertions that it would purge Pizzagate content [490] In late July 2018, Facebook suspended the personal profile of

its lack of human customer support [611] When users personal and business accounts are breached, many are forced to go through small claims court to regain access and restitution [612]\n\n\nLitigation\nThe company has been subject to repeated litigation [613] [614] [615] [616] Its most prominent case addressed allegations that Zuckerberg broke an oral contract with Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra to build the then-named \"HarvardConnection\" social network in 2004 [617] [618] [619]\n\n\nImpact\nA commentator in The Washington Post noted that Facebook constitutes a \"massive depository of information that documents both our reactions to events and our evolving customs with a scope and immediacy of which earlier historians could only dream\" [630] Especially for anthropologists, social researchers, and social historians—and subject to proper preservation and curation—the website \"will preserve images of our lives that are vastly crisper and more nuanced than any ancestry record in existence\" [630]\n\n\nScope\nA commentator in The Washington Post noted that Facebook constitutes a \"massive depository of information that

social historians—and subject to proper preservation and curation—the website \"will preserve images of our lives that are vastly crisper and more nuanced than any ancestry record in existence\" [630]\n\n\nEconomy\nEconomists have noted that Facebook offers many non-rivalrous services that benefit as many users as are interested without forcing users to compete with each other By contrast, most goods are available to a limited number of users E.g., if one user buys a phone, no other user can buy that phone Three areas add the most economic impact: platform competition, the market place and user behavior data [631]\n\n\nSociety\nFacebook was one of the first large-scale social networks In The Facebook Effect, David Kirkpatrick stated that Facebook's structure makes it difficult to replace, because of its \"network effects\" [neutrality is disputed] As of 2016, it is estimated that 44 percent of the US population gets news through Facebook [636] A study published at Frontiers Media in 2023 found that there was more polarization of the user-base on Facebook than even far-right social networks like Gab [637]\n\n\nMental and emotional health\nStudies have associated social networks with positive [638] and negative impacts [639] [640] [641] [642] [643] on emotional health.\n\n\nPolitics\nIn February 2008, a Facebook group called \"One Million Voices Against FARC\" organized an event in which hundreds of thousands of Colombians marched in protest against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) [651] In August 2010, one of North Korea's official government websites and the country's official news agency, Uriminzokkiri, joined Facebook [652]\n\n\nIndia\nAhead of the 2019 general elections in India, Facebook has removed 103 pages, groups and accounts on Facebook and Instagram platforms originating from Pakistan Facebook said its investigation found a Pakistani military link, along with a mix of real accounts of ISPR employees, and a network of fake accounts created by them that have been operating military fan pages, general interest pages but were posting content about Indian politics while trying to conceal their identity [682] Owing to the same reasons, Facebook also removed 687 pages and accounts of Congress because of coordinated inauthentic behavior on the platform [683]\n\n\nCulture\nFacebook and Zuckerberg have been the subject of music, books, film and television The 2010 film The Social Network, directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin, stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg and went on to win three Academy Awards and four Golden Globes.\n\n\nInternet.org\nIn August 2013, Facebook founded Internet.org in collaboration with six other technology companies to plan and help build affordable Internet access for underdeveloped and developing countries [686] The service, called Free Basics, includes various low-bandwidth applications such as AccuWeather, BabyCenter, BBC News, ESPN, and Bing [687] [688] There was severe opposition to Internet.org in India, where the service started in partnership with Reliance Communications in 2015 was banned a year later by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) In 2018, Zuckerberg claimed that \"Internet.org efforts have helped almost 100 million people get access to the internet who may not have had it otherwise.\" [687]\n\n\nEnvironment\nFacebook announced in 2021 that it will make an effort to stop disinformation about climate change The company will use George Mason University, Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the University of Cambridge as sources of information The company will expand its information hub on climate to 16 countries Users in other countries will be directed to the site of the United Nations Environment Programme for information [689]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, he was the only child of Ernest Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley Richardson. Jack had two half-siblings, Patrick and Gloria Hemingway, from his father's marriage to Pauline Pfeiffer.\n\n## Early Life\n\nJack Hemingway's early life was marked by his family's frequent relocations due to his father's work as a journalist. He spent his childhood in various parts of the United States and Canada, developing a strong sense of adventure and a love for the outdoors. Despite his family's nomadic lifestyle, Jack's parents instilled in him a strong sense of values and a passion for literature.\n\n## College, Military Service, and Early Post-War Career\n\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Jack enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he served during World War II. During his time in the military, Jack developed a sense of humor and a talent for storytelling. In a notable incident, he interrupted a conversation between two older men at a bar near Orangeburg, New York, and shared his opinion on who was the better writer, Ernest Hemingway or William Faulkner. Jack's wit and confidence impressed the men, including one who claimed to be Maurice Walsh, a writer Jack admired.\n\n## Marriage and Family\n\nIn 1949, Jack married Byra Louise \"Puck\" Whittlesey in Paris, a city that held a special place in his family's history. The couple had three daughters: Joan Whittlesey \"Muffet\" Hemingway (born 1950), Margot Louise Hemingway (later known as Margaux Hemingway, 1954-1996), and Mariel Hadley Hemingway (born 1961). Jack's family life was marked by a deep love for his children and a commitment to family values.\n\n## Sexual Abuse Allegations\n\nIn the 1990s, Jack's daughter Margaux accused him of molesting her as a child, an allegation he denied. Tragically, Margaux died of a barbiturate overdose in 1996 at the age of 42, her death ruled self-inflicted. In a 2013 documentary film, Mariel spoke of her family's struggles with alcoholism, mental illness, and suicide, and backed up her sister's allegations of abuse.\n\n## Angler and Conservationist\n\nThroughout his life, Jack Hemingway was an avid fly fisherman, with a passion for exploring North America's great trout streams and the world's best salmon rivers. His love for the outdoors and his commitment to conservation led to numerous fishing trips and a deep appreciation for the natural world.\n\n## Writer\n\nJack Hemingway assisted his father's fourth wife and widow, Mary Welsh Hemingway, with final editing before publication of A Moveable Feast, his father's memoir of life in 1920s Paris. Published in 1964, the book provided a unique insight into Ernest Hemingway's life and work.\n\n## Death and Honors\n\nJack Hemingway died on December 1, 2000, at the age of 77, following complications from heart surgery in New York City. He had previously suffered a heart attack at around the age of 44. In 2001, the state of Idaho designated an annual \"Jack Hemingway Conservation Day\" in his honor. Jack is buried in Idaho at the Ketchum Cemetery, next to his wife Puck, daughter Margaux, father Ernest, step-mother Mary, and half-sister Gloria.\n\n## Writings\n\nJack Hemingway's written works are limited, but his contributions to his father's memoir and his own experiences as a fly fisherman and conservationist provide valuable insights into his life and interests.\n\n## Notes\n\nJack Hemingway's life was marked by a deep love for his family and the outdoors. His experiences as a fly fisherman and conservationist, combined with his literary connections, make him a unique figure in the Hemingway family's history.\n\n## References\n\nThis article includes a range of sources, including biographies, memoirs, and historical records.

The symbol originated in the early 20th century and has since been associated with neo-fascist, neo-Nazi, and far-right ideologies. However, its use extends beyond these groups, and it has also been adopted by modern pagan and satanist movements, as well as being used as a fashionable or aesthetic symbol.\n\n**Wewelsburg mosaic and the Nazi period**\n\nThe symbol that later became known as the \"Black Sun\" originated in the early 20th century, with the first depiction being the Wewelsburg mosaic. In 1933, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, acquired Wewelsburg, a castle near Paderborn in the German region of Westphalia. Himmler intended to make the building into a center for the SS, and between 1936 and 1942, Himmler ordered the building expanded and rebuilt for ceremonial purposes.\n\nHimmler's remodeling included the Wewelsburg mosaic that was composed of twelve dark-green radially overlaid sig runes, such as those employed in the logo of the SS, on the white marble floor of the structure's north tower known as the \"General's Hall\" (Obergruppenführersaal). The intended significance of the image remains unknown. The Wewelsburg mosaic was likely created by the architect and SS member Hans Friedrichs. The mosaic was an attempt to create a symbol that would represent the unity and power of the SS, but its meaning and significance have been lost to history.\n\n**Neo-Nazism and far right**\n\nIn the late 20th century, the Black Sun symbol became widely used by neo-fascist, neo-Nazi, and far-right groups. The symbol often appears on extremist flags, t-shirts, posters, websites, and in extremist publications associated with such groups. Modern far-right groups often refer to the symbol as the sun wheel or Sonnenrad. The use of the Black Sun symbol by these groups is often seen as a way to create a sense of unity and shared identity among members.\n\nThe Black Sun symbol has also been used by white nationalist and supremacist groups, who see it as a symbol of their ideology and movement. However, it's worth noting that the symbol has also been used by other groups and individuals with different meanings and interpretations. The use of the Black Sun symbol by these groups is often seen as a way to create a sense of legitimacy and credibility, and to associate themselves with a broader movement or ideology.\n\n**Azov Battalion**\n\nThe Ukrainian military unit Azov Brigade, founded in 2014, used the symbol as part of its logo. The Azov Brigade is a far-right militia that has been involved in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The use of the Black Sun symbol by the Azov Brigade has been seen as a way to create a sense of unity and shared identity among its members, but it has also been criticized for its association with neo-Nazi ideology.\n\nPolitical scientist Ivan Gomza wrote in Krytyka that the Nazi connotations of the symbol in that logo are lost on most people in Ukraine, and the logo rather has an association with \"a successful fighting unit that protects Ukraine.\" However, WotanJugend, a neo-Nazi group based in Kyiv and connected to the broader Azov political movement, has also used the Black Sun symbol to promote its group.\n\n**NATO and the Ukrainian crisis**\n\nDuring the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, NATO tweeted a photo of a female Ukrainian soldier for International Women's Day. The soldier wore a symbol on her uniform that \"appears to be the black sun symbol.\" After receiving complaints from social media users, NATO removed the tweet and stated \"The post was removed when we realised it contained a symbol that we could not verify as official.\" The incident highlights the complexities and nuances of the use of the Black Sun symbol, and the need for careful consideration and context when interpreting its meaning.\n\n**Other uses**\n\nAccording to Freedom House initiative Reporting Radicalism, the Black Sun is also used by some modern pagan and satanist groups as an esoteric symbol. They further note that it is sometimes used as a fashionable, aesthetic symbol, or misunderstood as having origins in ancient Scandinavian or Slavic cultures.

{"title": "Neil_Armstrong", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nArmstrong was born near Wapakoneta, Ohio, [5] on August 5, 1930, the son of Viola Louise (née Engel) and Stephen Koenig Armstrong He was of German, English, Scots-Irish, and Scottish descent [6] [7] He is a descendant of Clan Armstrong [8] [9] He had a younger sister, June, and a younger brother, Dean His father was an auditor for the Ohio state government, [10] and the family moved around the state repeatedly, living in 16 towns over the next 14 years [11] Armstrong's love for flying grew during this time, having started at the age of two when his father took him to the Cleveland Air Races When he was five or six, he experienced his first airplane flight in Warren, Ohio, when he and his father took a ride in a Ford Trimotor (also known as the \"Tin Goose\") [12] [13]\n\n\nNavy service\nArmstrong's call-up from the Navy arrived on January 26, 1949, requiring him to report to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida for flight training with class 5-49 After passing the medical examinations, he became a midshipman on February 24, 1949 [23] Flight training was conducted in a North American SNJ trainer, in which he soloed on September 9, 1949 [24] On March 2, 1950, he made his first aircraft carrier landing on USS Cabot, an achievement he considered comparable to his first solo flight [24] He was then sent to Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas for training on the Grumman F8F Bearcat, culminating in a carrier landing on USS Wright On August 16, 1950, Armstrong was informed by letter that he was a fully qualified naval aviator His mother and sister attended his graduation ceremony on August 23, 1950 [25]\n\n\nCollege years\nAfter his service with the Navy, Armstrong returned to Purdue His previously earned good but not outstanding grades now improved, lifting his final Grade Point Average (GPA) to a respectable but not outstanding 4.8 out of 6.0 He pledged the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and lived in its fraternity house He wrote and co-directed two musicals as part of the all-student revue The first was a version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, co-directed with his girlfriend Joanne Alford from the Alpha Chi Omega sorority, with songs from the 1937 Walt Disney film, including \"Someday My Prince Will Come\"; the second was titled The Land of Egelloc (\"college\" spelled backward), with music from Gilbert and Sullivan but new lyrics \n\n\nTest pilot\nFollowing his graduation from Purdue, Armstrong became an experimental research test pilot He applied at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base [43] NACA had no open positions, and forwarded his application to the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland, where Armstrong made his first test flight on March 1, 1955 [43] Armstrong's stint at Cleveland lasted only a couple of months before a position at the High-Speed Flight Station became available, and he reported for work there on July 11, 1955 [44]\n\n\nAstronaut career\nIn June 1958, Armstrong was selected for the U.S Air Force's Man in Space Soonest program, but the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) canceled its funding on August 1, 1958, and on November 5, 1958, it was superseded by Project Mercury, a civilian project run by NASA As a NASA civilian test pilot, Armstrong was ineligible to become one of its astronauts at this time, as selection was restricted to military test pilots [61] [62] In November 1960, he was chosen as part of the pilot consultant group for the X-20 Dyna-Soar, a military space plane under development by Boeing for the U.S Air Force, and on March 15, 1962, he was selected by the U.S Air Force as one of seven pilot-engineers who would fly the X-20 when it got off the design board [63] [64]\n\n\nGemini program\nOn February 8, 1965, Armstrong and Elliot See were picked as the backup crew for Gemini 5, with Armstrong as commander, supporting the prime crew of Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad [72] The mission's purpose was to practice space rendezvous and to develop procedures and equipment for a seven-day flight, all of which would be required for a mission to the Moon With two other flights (Gemini 3 and Gemini 4) in preparation, six crews were competing for simulator time, so Gemini 5 was postponed It finally lifted off on August 21 [73] Armstrong and See watched the launch at Cape Kennedy, then flew to the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) in Houston [74] The mission was generally successful, despite a problem with the fuel cells that prevented a rendezvous Cooper and Conrad practiced a \"phantom rendezvous\", carrying out the maneuver without a target [75]\n\n\nGemini 5\nOn February 8,

Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) in Houston [74] The mission was generally successful, despite a problem with the fuel cells that prevented a rendezvous Cooper and Conrad practiced a \"phantom rendezvous\", carrying out the maneuver without a target [75]\n\n\nGemini 8\nThe crews for Gemini 8 were assigned on September 20, 1965 Under the normal rotation system, the backup crew for one mission became the prime crew for the third mission after, but Slayton designated David Scott as the pilot of Gemini 8 [76] [77] Scott was the first member of the third group of astronauts, who was selected on October 18, 1963, to receive a prime crew assignment [78] See was designated to command Gemini 9 Henceforth, each Gemini mission was commanded by a member of Armstrong's group, with a member of Scott's group as the pilot Conrad would be Armstrong's backup this time, and Richard F Gordon Jr his pilot [76] [77] Armstrong became the first American civilian in space (Valentina Tereshkova of the Soviet Union had become the first civilian—and first woman—nearly three years earlier aboard Vostok 6 when it launched on June 16, 1963 [79]) Armstrong would also be the last of his group to fly in space, as See died in a T-38 crash on February 28, 1966, that also took the life of crewmate Charles Bassett They were replaced by the backup crew of Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan, while Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin moved up from the backup crew of Gemini 10 to become the backup for Gemini 9, [80] and would eventually fly Gemini 12 [81]\n\n\nGemini 11\nIn Armstrong's final assignment in the Gemini program, he was the back-up Command Pilot for Gemini 11 Having trained for two flights, Armstrong was quite knowledgeable about the systems and took on a teaching role for the rookie backup pilot, William Anders [94] The launch was on September 12, 1966, [95] with Conrad and Gordon on board, who successfully completed the mission objectives, while Armstrong served as a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) [96]\n\n\nApollo program\nOn January 27, 1967—the day of the Apollo 1 fire—Armstrong was in Washington, D.C., with Cooper, Gordon, Lovell and Scott Carpenter for the signing of the United Nations Outer Space Treaty The astronauts chatted with the assembled dignitaries until 18:45, when Carpenter went to the airport, and the others returned to the Georgetown Inn, where they each found messages to phone the MSC During these calls, they learned of the deaths of Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee in the fire Armstrong and the group spent the rest of the night drinking scotch and discussing what had happened [99]\n\n\nApollo 11\nAfter Armstrong served as backup commander for Apollo 8, Slayton offered him the post of commander of Apollo 11 on December 23, 1968, as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon [110] According to Armstrong's 2005 biography, Slayton told him that although the planned crew was Commander Armstrong, Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin, and Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, he was offering Armstrong the chance to replace Aldrin with Jim Lovell After thinking it over for a day, Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with Aldrin, as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command Replacing Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the lunar module pilot, unofficially the lowest ranked member, and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell, the commander of Gemini 12, in the number 3 position of the crew [111] The crew of Apollo 11 was assigned on January 9, 1969, as Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin, with Lovell, Anders, and Fred Haise as the backup crew [112]\n\n\nVoyage to the Moon\nA Saturn V rocket launched Apollo 11 from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (09:32:00 EDT local time) [116] Armstrong's wife Janet and two sons watched from a yacht moored on the Banana River [117] During the launch, Armstrong's heart rate peaked at 110 beats per minute [118] He found the first stage the loudest, much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch The Apollo command module was relatively roomy compared with the Gemini spacecraft None of the Apollo 11 crew suffered space sickness, as some members of previous crews had Armstrong was especially glad about this, as he had been prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after long periods of aerobatics [119]\n\n\nFirst Moon walk\nThe flight plan called for a crew rest period before leaving the module, but Armstrong asked for this to be moved to earlier in the evening, Houston time When he and Aldrin were ready to go outside, Eagle was depressurized, the hatch was opened, and Armstrong made his way down the ladder [131] At the bottom of the ladder, while standing on a Lunar Module landing pad, Armstrong said, \"I'm going to step off the LM now\" He turned and set his left boot on the lunar surface at 02:56 UTC July 21, 1969, [132] then said, \"That's one small step for  [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\" [133] The exact time of Armstrong's first step on the Moon is unclear [134]\n\n\nReturn to Earth\nAfter they re-entered the LM, the hatch was closed and sealed While preparing for liftoff, Armstrong and Aldrin discovered that, in their bulky space suits, they had broken the ignition switch for the ascent engine; using part of a pen, they pushed in the circuit breaker to start the launch sequence [160] The Eagle then continued to its rendezvous in lunar orbit, where it docked with Columbia, the command and service module The three astronauts returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, to be picked up by the USS Hornet [161]\n\n\nLife after Apollo\nShortly after Apollo 11, Armstrong stated that he did not plan to fly in space again [169] He was appointed Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics for the Office of Advanced Research and Technology at ARPA, served in the position for a year, then resigned from it and NASA in 1971 [170] He accepted a teaching position in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, [171] having chosen Cincinnati over other universities, including his alma mater Purdue, because Cincinnati had a small aerospace department, [172] and said he hoped the faculty there would not be annoyed that he came straight into a professorship with only a USC master's degree [173] He began his master's degree while stationed at Edwards years before, and completed it after Apollo 11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight [174]\n\n\nTeaching\nShortly after Apollo 11, Armstrong stated that he did not plan to fly in space again [169] He was appointed Deputy Associate

[174]\n\n\nNASA commissions\nIn 1970, after an explosion aboard Apollo 13 aborted its lunar landing, Armstrong was part of Edgar Cortright's investigation of the mission He produced a detailed chronology of the flight He determined that a 28-volt thermostat switch in an oxygen tank, which was supposed to have been replaced with a 65-volt version, led to the explosion Cortright's report recommended the entire tank be redesigned at a cost of $40 million Many NASA managers, including Armstrong, opposed the recommendation, since only the thermostat switch had caused the problem They lost the argument, and the tanks were redesigned [175]\n\n\nBusiness activities\nAfter Armstrong retired from NASA in 1971, he acted as a spokesman for several businesses The first company to successfully approach him was Chrysler, for whom he appeared in advertising starting in January 1979 Armstrong thought they had a strong engineering division, and they were in financial difficulty He later acted as a spokesman for other American companies, including General Time Corporation and the Bankers Association of America [179] He acted as a spokesman for only American companies [180]\n\n\nNorth Pole expedition\nIn 1985, professional expedition leader Mike Dunn organized a trip to take men he deemed the \"greatest explorers\" to the North Pole The group included Armstrong, Edmund Hillary, Hillary's son Peter, Steve Fossett, and Patrick Morrow They arrived at the Pole on April 6, 1985 Armstrong said he was curious to see what it looked like from the ground, as he had seen it only from the Moon [183] He did not inform the media of the trip, preferring to keep it private [184]\n\n\nPublic profile\nArmstrong's family described him as a \"reluctant American hero\" [185] [186] [187] He kept a low profile later in his life, leading to the belief that he was a recluse [188] [189] Recalling Armstrong's humility, John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, told CNN: \" [Armstrong] didn't feel that he should be out huckstering himself He was a humble person, and that's the way he remained after his lunar flight, as well as before.\" [190] Armstrong turned down most requests for interviews and public appearances Michael Collins said in his book Carrying the Fire that when Armstrong moved to a dairy farm to become a college professor, it was like he \"retreated to his castle and pulled up the drawbridge\" Armstrong found this amusing, and said, \"... those of us that live out in the hinterlands think that people that live inside the Beltway are the ones that have the problems.\" [191]\n\n\nPersonal life\nSome former astronauts, including Glenn and Apollo 17's Harrison Schmitt, sought political careers after leaving NASA Armstrong was approached by groups from both the Democratic and Republican parties but declined the offers He supported states' rights and opposed the U.S acting as the \"world's policeman\" [199]\n\n\nIllness and death\nOn August 7, 2012, Armstrong underwent bypass surgery at Mercy Faith–Fairfield Hospital in Fairfield, Ohio, to relieve coronary artery disease [218] [219] Although he was reportedly recovering well, [220] he developed complications and died on August 25 [221] [222] President Barack Obama issued a statement memorializing Armstrong as \"among the greatest of American heroes—not just of his time, but of all time\", [223] [224] and added that Armstrong had carried the aspirations of the United States' citizens and had delivered \"a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten.\" [225]\n\n\nLegacy\nWhen Pete Conrad of Apollo 12 became the third man to walk on the Moon, on November 19, 1969, his first words referenced Armstrong The shorter of the two, when Conrad stepped from the LM onto the surface he proclaimed \"Whoopie! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.\" [239]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "Neil Armstrong\n\nIntroduction\nNeil Armstrong was an American astronaut, engineer, and naval aviator who was the first person to walk on the Moon on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.

successful, despite a problem with the fuel cells that prevented a rendezvous Cooper and Conrad practiced a \"phantom rendezvous\", carrying out the maneuver without a target [75]\n\n\nGemini 8\nThe crews for Gemini 8 were assigned on September 20, 1965 Under the normal rotation system, the backup crew for one mission became the prime crew for the third mission after, but Slayton designated David Scott as the pilot of Gemini 8 [76] [77] Scott was the first member of the third group of astronauts, who was selected on October 18, 1963, to receive a prime crew assignment [78] See was designated to command Gemini 9 Henceforth, each Gemini mission was commanded by a member of Armstrong's group, with a member of Scott's group as the pilot Conrad would be Armstrong's backup this time, and Richard F Gordon Jr his pilot [76] [77] Armstrong became the first American civilian in space (Valentina Tereshkova of the Soviet Union had become the first civilian—and first woman—nearly three years earlier aboard Vostok 6 when it launched on June 16, 1963 [79]) Armstrong would also be the last of his group to fly in space, as See died in a T-38 crash on February 28, 1966, that also took the life of crewmate Charles Bassett They were replaced by the backup crew of Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan, while Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin moved up from the backup crew of Gemini 10 to become the backup for Gemini 9, [80] and would eventually fly Gemini 12 [81]\n\n\nGemini 11\nIn Armstrong's final assignment in the Gemini program, he was the back-up Command Pilot for Gemini 11 Having trained for two flights, Armstrong was quite knowledgeable about the systems and took on a teaching role for the rookie backup pilot, William Anders [94] The launch was on September 12, 1966, [95] with Conrad and Gordon on board, who successfully completed the mission objectives, while Armstrong served as a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) [96]\n\n\nApollo program\nOn January 27, 1967—the day of the Apollo 1 fire—Armstrong was in Washington, D.C., with Cooper, Gordon, Lovell and Scott Carpenter for the signing of the United Nations Outer Space Treaty The astronauts chatted with the assembled dignitaries until 18:45, when Carpenter went to the airport, and the others returned to the Georgetown Inn, where they each found messages to phone the MSC During these calls, they learned of the deaths of Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee in the fire Armstrong and the group spent the rest of the night drinking scotch and discussing what had happened [99]\n\n\nApollo 11\nAfter Armstrong served as backup commander for Apollo 8, Slayton offered him the post of commander of Apollo 11 on December 23, 1968, as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon [110] According to Armstrong's 2005 biography, Slayton told him that although the planned crew was Commander Armstrong, Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin, and Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, he was offering Armstrong the chance to replace Aldrin with Jim Lovell After thinking it over for a day, Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with Aldrin, as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command Replacing Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the lunar module pilot, unofficially the lowest ranked member, and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell, the commander of Gemini 12, in the number 3 position of the crew [111] The crew of Apollo 11 was assigned on January 9, 1969, as Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin, with Lovell, Anders, and Fred Haise as the backup crew [112]\n\n\nVoyage to the Moon\nA Saturn V rocket launched Apollo 11 from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (09:32:00 EDT local time) [116] Armstrong's wife Janet and two sons watched from a yacht moored on the Banana River [117] During the launch, Armstrong's heart rate peaked at 110 beats per minute [118] He found the first stage the loudest, much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch The Apollo command module was relatively roomy compared with the Gemini spacecraft None of the Apollo 11 crew suffered space sickness, as some members of previous crews had Armstrong was especially glad about this, as he had been prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after long periods of aerobatics [119]\n\n\nFirst Moon walk\nThe flight plan called for a crew rest period before leaving the module, but Armstrong asked for this to be moved to earlier in the evening, Houston time When he and Aldrin were ready to go outside, Eagle was depressurized, the hatch was opened, and Armstrong made his way down the ladder [131] At the bottom of the ladder, while standing on a Lunar Module landing pad, Armstrong said, \"I'm going to step off the LM now\" He turned and set his left boot on the lunar surface at 02:56 UTC July 21, 1969, [132] then said, \"That's one small step for  [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\" [133] The exact time of Armstrong's first step on the Moon is unclear [134]\n\n\nReturn to Earth\nAfter they re-entered the LM, the hatch was closed and sealed While preparing for liftoff, Armstrong and Aldrin discovered that, in their bulky space suits, they had broken the ignition switch for the ascent engine; using part of a pen, they pushed in the circuit breaker to start the launch sequence [160] The Eagle then continued to its rendezvous in lunar orbit, where it docked with Columbia, the command and service module The three astronauts returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, to be picked up by the USS Hornet [161]\n\n\nLife after Apollo\nShortly after Apollo 11, Armstrong stated that he did not plan to fly in space again [169] He was appointed Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics for the Office of Advanced Research and Technology at ARPA, served in the position for a year, then resigned from it and NASA in 1971 [170] He accepted a teaching position in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, [171] having chosen Cincinnati over other universities, including his alma mater Purdue, because Cincinnati had a small aerospace department, [172] and said he hoped the faculty there would not be annoyed that he came straight into a professorship with only a USC master's degree [173] He began his master's degree while stationed at Edwards years before, and completed it after Apollo 11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight [174]\n\n\nTeaching\nShortly after Apollo 11, Armstrong stated that he did not plan to fly in space again [169] He was appointed Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics for the Office of Advanced Research and Technology at ARPA, served in the position for a

Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight [174]\n\n\nNASA commissions\nIn 1970, after an explosion aboard Apollo 13 aborted its lunar landing, Armstrong was part of Edgar Cortright's investigation of the mission He produced a detailed chronology of the flight He determined that a 28-volt thermostat switch in an oxygen tank, which was supposed to have been replaced with a 65-volt version, led to the explosion Cortright's report recommended the entire tank be redesigned at a cost of $40 million Many NASA managers, including Armstrong, opposed the recommendation, since only the thermostat switch had caused the problem They lost the argument, and the tanks were redesigned [175]\n\n\nBusiness activities\nAfter Armstrong retired from NASA in 1971, he acted as a spokesman for several businesses The first company to successfully approach him was Chrysler, for whom he appeared in advertising starting in January 1979 Armstrong thought they had a strong engineering division, and they were in financial difficulty He later acted as a spokesman for other American companies, including General Time Corporation and the Bankers Association of America [179] He acted as a spokesman for only American companies [180]\n\n\nNorth Pole expedition\nIn 1985, professional expedition leader Mike Dunn organized a trip to take men he deemed the \"greatest explorers\" to the North Pole The group included Armstrong, Edmund Hillary, Hillary's son Peter, Steve Fossett, and Patrick Morrow They arrived at the Pole on April 6, 1985 Armstrong said he was curious to see what it looked like from the ground, as he had seen it only from the Moon [183] He did not inform the media of the trip, preferring to keep it private [184]\n\n\nPublic profile\nArmstrong's family described him as a \"reluctant American hero\" [185] [186] [187] He kept a low profile later in his life, leading to the belief that he was a recluse [188] [189] Recalling Armstrong's humility, John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, told CNN: \" [Armstrong] didn't feel that he should be out huckstering himself He was a humble person, and that's the way he remained after his lunar flight, as well as before.\" [190] Armstrong turned down most requests for interviews and public appearances Michael Collins said in his book Carrying the Fire that when Armstrong moved to a dairy farm to become a college professor, it was like he \"retreated to his castle and pulled up the drawbridge\" Armstrong found this amusing, and said, \"... those of us that live out in the hinterlands think that people that live inside the Beltway are the ones that have the problems.\" [191]\n\n\nPersonal life\nSome former astronauts, including Glenn and Apollo 17's Harrison Schmitt, sought political careers after leaving NASA Armstrong was approached by groups from both the Democratic and Republican parties but declined the offers He supported states' rights and opposed the U.S acting as the \"world's policeman\" [199]\n\n\nIllness and death\nOn August 7, 2012, Armstrong underwent bypass surgery at Mercy Faith–Fairfield Hospital in Fairfield, Ohio, to relieve coronary artery disease [218] [219] Although he was reportedly recovering well, [220] he developed complications and died on August 25 [221] [222] President Barack Obama issued a statement memorializing Armstrong as \"among the greatest of American heroes—not just of his time, but of all time\", [223] [224] and added that Armstrong had carried the aspirations of the United States' citizens and had delivered \"a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten.\" [225]\n\n\nLegacy\nWhen Pete Conrad of Apollo 12 became the third man to walk on the Moon, on November 19, 1969, his first words referenced Armstrong The shorter of the two, when Conrad stepped from the LM onto the surface he proclaimed \"Whoopie! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.\" [239]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

order to continue his development [8] In August, Fernández was loaned to fellow top-flight club Defensa y Justicia [3] [9] He made his debut for the Halcón on 18 September by manager Hernán Crespo in a 3–0 win over Delfín in the Copa Libertadores [3] [10] Despite initially not being a starter, his performances impressed his manager and eventually he earned a place in the team, helping the club win

{"title": "Russian_Empire", "content": "\nHistory\nThe foundations of a Russian national state were laid in the late 15th century during the reign of Ivan III [16] By the early 16th century, all of the semi-independent and petty princedoms in Russia had been unified with Moscow [17] During the reign of Ivan IV, the khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan were conquered by Russia in the mid-16th century, leading to the development of an increasingly multinational state [18]\n\n\nPopulation\nMuch of Russia's expansion occurred in the 17th century, culminating in the first Russian colonization of the Pacific, the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667) which led to the incorporation of left-bank Ukraine, and the Russian conquest of Siberia Poland was partitioned by its rivals in 1772–1815;most of its land and population being taken under Russian rule Most of the empire's growth in the 19th century came from gaining territory in central and eastern Asia south of Siberia [19] By 1795, after the Partitions of Poland, Russia became the most populous state in Europe, ahead of France.\n\n\nBackground\nThe foundations of the Russian Empire were laid during Peter I's reforms, which significantly altered Russia's political and social structure, [21] and as a result of the Great Northern War which strengthened Russia's standing on the world stage [22] Internal transformations and military victories contributed to the transformation of Russia into a great power, playing a major role in European politics [23] On the day of the announcement of the Treaty of Nystad, the 2 November  [O.S 22 October] 1721, the Governing Senate and Synod invested the tsar with the titles of Pater Patriae [h] and Imperator of all Rusia [i] [24] The adoption of the latter title by Peter I is usually seen as the beginning of the \"imperial\" period of Russia [j] [27]\n\n\n18th century\nPeter I (r. 1682–1725), also known as Peter the Great, played a major role in introducing the European state system into Russia While the empire's vast lands had a population of 14 million, grain yields trailed behind those in the West [32] Nearly the entire population was devoted to agriculture, with only a small percentage living in towns The class of kholops, whose status was close to that of slaves, remained a major institution in Russia until 1723, when Peter converted household kholops into house serfs, thus counting them for poll taxation Russian agricultural kholops had been formally converted into serfs earlier in 1679 They were largely tied to the land, in a feudal sense, until the late 19th century.\n\n\nPeter the Great (1682–1725)\nPeter I (r. 1682–1725), also known as Peter the Great, played a major role in introducing the European state system into Russia While the empire's vast lands had a population of 14 million, grain yields trailed behind those in the West [32] Nearly the entire population was devoted to agriculture, with only a small percentage living in towns The class of kholops, whose status was close to that of slaves, remained a major institution in Russia until 1723, when Peter converted household kholops into house serfs, thus counting them for poll taxation Russian agricultural kholops had been formally converted into serfs earlier in 1679 They were largely tied to the land, in a feudal sense, until the late 19th century.\n\n\nCatherine the Great (1762–1796)\nCatherine the Great was a German princess who married Peter III, the German heir to the Russian crown After the death of Empress Elizabeth, Catherine came to power after she effected a coup d'état against her very unpopular husband She contributed to the resurgence of the Russian nobility that began after the death of Peter the Great, abolishing State service and granting them control of most state functions in the provinces She also removed the Beard tax instituted by Peter the Great [37]\n\n\nState budget\nRussia was in a continuous state of financial crisis While revenue rose from 9 million rubles in 1724 to 40 million in 1794, expenses grew more rapidly, reaching 49 million in 1794 The budget allocated 46 percent to the military, 20 percent to government economic activities, 12 percent to administration, and nine percent for the Imperial Court in St Petersburg The deficit required borrowing, primarily from bankers in Amsterdam; five percent of the budget was allocated to debt payments Paper money was issued to pay for expensive wars, thus causing inflation As a result of its spending, Russia developed a large and well-equipped army, a very large and complex bureaucracy, and a court that rivaled those of Versailles and London But the government was living far beyond its means, and 18th-century Russia remained \"a poor, backward, overwhelmingly agricultural, and illiterate country\" [44]\n\n\nFirst half of the 19th century\nIn 1801, over four years after Paul became the emperor of Russia, he was killed in Saint Michael's Castle in a coup Paul was succeeded by his 23-year-old son, Alexander Russia was in a state of war with the French Republic under the leadership of the Corsica-born First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte After he became the emperor, Napoleon defeated Russia at Austerlitz in 1805, Eylau and Friedland in 1807 After Alexander was defeated in Friedland, he agreed to negotiate and sued for peace with France; the Treaties of Tilsit led to the Franco-Russian alliance against the Coalition and joined the Continental System [45] By 1812, Russia had occupied many territories in Eastern Europe, holding some of Eastern Galicia from Austria and Bessarabia from the Ottoman Empire; [46] from Northern Europe, it had gained Finland from the war against a weakened Sweden; it also gained some territory in the Caucasus.\n\n\nForeign policy (1800–1864)\nAfter Russian armies liberated the Eastern Georgian Kingdom (allied since the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk) from the Qajar dynasty's occupation of 1802, [citation needed] during the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813), they clashed with Persia over control and consolidation of Georgia, and also became involved in the Caucasian War against the Caucasian Imamate At the conclusion of the war, Persia irrevocably ceded what is now Dagestan, eastern Georgia, and most of Azerbaijan to Russia, under the Treaty of Gulistan [53] Russia attempted to expand to the southwest, at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, using recently acquired Georgia at its base for its Caucasus and Anatolian front The late 1820s were successful years militarily Despite losing almost all recently consolidated territories in the first year of the Russo-Persian War of 1826–1828, Russia managed to favorably bring an end to the war with the Treaty of Turkmenchay, including the formal acquisition of what are now Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iğdır Province [54] In the 1828–1829 Russo-Turkish War, Russia invaded northeastern Anatolia and occupied the strategic Ottoman towns of Karin and Gümüşhane (Argiroupoli) and, posing as protector of the Greek Orthodox population, received extensive support from the region's Pontic Greeks Following a brief occupation, the Russian imperial army withdrew back into Georgia [55]\n\n\nSecond half of the 19th century\nIn 1854–1855, Russia fought Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire in the Crimean War, which Russia lost The war was fought primarily in the Crimean peninsula, and to a lesser extent in the Baltic during the related Åland War Since playing a major role in the defeat of Napoleon, Russia had been regarded as militarily invincible, but against a coalition of the great powers of Europe, the reverses it suffered on land and sea exposed the weakness of Emperor Nicholas I's regime.\n\n\nAlexander III\nIn 1881, Alexander II was assassinated by the Narodnaya Volya, a Nihilist terrorist organization The throne passed to Alexander III (1881–1894), a reactionary who revived the maxim of \"Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality\" of Nicholas I A committed Slavophile, Alexander III believed that Russia could be saved from turmoil only by shutting itself off from the subversive influences of Western Europe During his reign, Russia formed the Franco-Russian Alliance, to contain the growing power of Germany; completed the conquest of Central Asia; and demanded important territorial and commercial concessions from China The emperor's most influential adviser was Konstantin Pobedonostsev, tutor to Alexander III and his son Nicholas, and procurator of the Holy Synod from 1880 to 1895 Pobedonostsev taught his imperial pupils to fear freedom of speech and the press, as well as dislike democracy, constitutions, and the parliamentary system Under Pobedonostsev, revolutionaries were persecuted—by the imperial secret police, with thousands being exiled to Siberia—and a policy of Russification was carried out throughout the empire [72]\n\n\nForeign policy (1864–1907)\nRussia had little difficulty expanding to the south, including conquering Turkestan, [73] until Britain became alarmed when Russia threatened Afghanistan, with the implicit threat to India; and decades of diplomatic maneuvering resulted, called the Great Game [74] That rivalry between the two empires has been considered to have included far-flung territories such as Outer Mongolia and Tibet The maneuvering largely ended with the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 [75]\n\n\nEarly 20th century\nIn 1894, Alexander III was succeeded by his son, Nicholas II, who was committed to retaining the autocracy that his father had left him Nicholas II proved as an ineffective ruler, and in the end his dynasty was overthrown by the Russian Revolution [79] The Industrial Revolution began to show significant influence in Russia, but the country remained rural and poor.\n\n\nWar, revolution, and collapse\nRussia, along with France and Britain, was a member of the Entente in antecedent to World War I; these three powers were formed up in response to Germany's rival [86] Triple Alliance, comprising itself, Austria-Hungary and Italy Previously, Saint Petersburg and Paris, along with London, were belligerents in the Crimean War The relations with Britain were in disquietude from the Great Game in Central Asia until the 1907 Anglo-Russian Convention, when both agreed to settle their differences and joined to oppose the new rising power of Germany [87] Russia and France's relations remained isolated before the 1890s when both sides agreed to ally when peace was threatened [88] France also granted loans for building infrastructure, especially rail [89]\n\n\nOrigins of causes\nRussia, along with France and Britain, was a member of the Entente in antecedent to World War I;

granted loans for building infrastructure, especially rail [89]\n\n\nDeclaration of War\nAs a result of Vienna's declaration of war on Serbia, Nicholas II ordered the mobilization of 4.9 million men Germany, Austria-Hungary's ally, saw the call to arms as a threat; when Russia mustered its troops, Germany affirmed the state of \"imminent danger of War\", [95] followed by the declaration of war on 1 August 1914 [96] The Russians were imbued with patriotic earnestness and Germanophobic sentiment, including the name of the capital, Saint Petersburg, which sounded too German for the sake of words Sankt- and -burg; and was renamed Petrograd [97]\n\n\nTheaters of operations\nBy August 1914, Russia had invaded with unexpected speed the German province of East Prussia, ending with a humiliating defeat at Tannenberg, owing to a message sent without wiring and coding, [100] causing the destruction of the entire second army Russia suffered a massive defeat at the Masurian Lakes twice, the first ending with a hundred thousand casualties; [101] and the second suffering 200,000 [102] By October, the German Ninth Army was near Warsaw, and the newly-formed Tenth Army had retreated from the frontier in East Prussia Grand Duke Nicholas, the Russian commander-in-chief, now had the order to invade Silesia with his Fifth, Fourth, and Ninth armies [103] The Ninth Army, led by Mackensen, retreated from the frontline in Galicia and concentrated between the cities of Posen and Thorn The advance took place on 11 November against the main army's right flank and rear; the First and Second armies were severely mauled, and the Second army was nearly surrounded in Łódź on 17 November.\n\n\nGerman front\nBy August 1914, Russia had invaded with unexpected speed the German province of East

and rear; the First and Second armies were severely mauled, and the Second army was nearly surrounded in Łódź on 17 November.\n\n\nAustrian front\nAustria-Hungary went to war with Russia on 6 August The Russians started to invade Galicia, held by Austrian Cisleithania on 20 August, and annihilated the Austro-Hungarian Army at Lemberg, leading to the occupation of Galicia [109] While the fortress of Premissel was besieged, the first attempt to capture the fortress failed, but the second attempt seized the redoubt in March 1915 [110] On 2 May, the Russian army was broken through by joint Austro-German forces, retreating from the Gorlice to Tarnów line and losing Premissel.\n\n\nTurkish front\nOn 29 October 1914, a prelude to the Russo-Turkish front, the Turkish fleet, with German support, began to raid Russian coastal cities in Odessa, Sevastopol, Novorossiysk, Feodosia, Kerch, and Yalta  [113] This led Russia to declare war on the Ottoman Empire on 2 November [114] Throughout the war the Russian General Staff saw the Caucasus as a secondary theater and prioritized troops for other regions [115] The Russians, led by Baltic German General Georgy Bergmann, opened the front by crossing the frontier but failed to capture Köprüköy In December 1914, Russia obtained success at Sarikamish, where the Russian General Nikolai Yudenich routed Enver Pasha [116] Yudenich captured Köprüköy in January 1916 and captured Erzurum about one month later in February [115]\n\n\nProblems in the empire\nBy the middle of 1915, the impact of the war was demoralizing Food and fuel were in short supply, casualties were increasing, and inflation was mounting Strikes rose among low-paid factory workers, and there were reports that peasants, who wanted reforms of land ownership, were restless The emperor eventually decided to take personal command of the army and moved to the front, leaving his wife, the Empress Alexandra, in charge in the capital She fell under the spell of a monk, Grigori Rasputin (1869–1916) His assassination in late 1916 by a clique of nobles could not restore the emperor's lost prestige [120]\n\n\nEnd of imperial rule\nOn 3 March 1917, International Women's Day, a strike was organized at a factory in the capital, followed by thousands of people took to the streets in Petrograd to protest food shortages A day later, protesters rose to two hundred thousand, demanding that Russia withdraw from the war and the emperor be deposed Eighty thousand Russian troops, half of the men sent to restore order, had gone on strike and refused the senior officers' orders [121] Any imperial symbols were destroyed and burned The capital was out of control and gripped by protest and strife [122]\n\n\nTerritory\nBy the end of the 19th century the area of the empire was about 22,400,000 square kilometers (8,600,000 sq mi), or almost one-sixth of the Earth's landmass; its only rival in size at the time was the British Empire The majority of the population lived in European Russia More than 100 different ethnic groups lived in the Russian Empire, with ethnic Russians composing about 45% of the population [124]\n\n\nGeography\nThe administrative boundaries of European Russia, apart from Finland and its portion of Poland, coincided approximately with the natural limits of the East-European plains To the north was the Arctic Ocean Novaya Zemlya and the Kolguyev and Vaygach Islands were considered part of European Russia, but the Kara Sea was part of Siberia To the east were the Asiatic territories of the empire: Siberia and the Kyrgyz steppes, from both of which it was separated by the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, and the Caspian Sea — the administrative boundary, however, partly extended into Asia on the Siberian slope of the Urals To the south, were the Black Sea and the Caucasus, being separated from the latter by the Manych River depression, which in post-Pliocene times connected the Sea of Azov with the Caspian The western boundary was purely arbitrary: it crossed the Kola Peninsula from the Varangerfjord to the Gulf of Bothnia It then ran to the Curonian Lagoon in the southern Baltic Sea, and then to the mouth of the Danube, taking a great circular sweep to the west to embrace east-central Poland, and separating Russia from Prussia, Austrian Galicia, and Romania.\n\n\nTerritorial development\nFrom 1860 to 1905, the Russian Empire occupied all territories of the present-day Russian Federation, with the exception of the present-day Kaliningrad Oblast, Kuril Islands and Tuva In 1905 Russia lost southern Sakhalin to Japan, but gained Tuva as a protectorate in 1914 Prior to 1917 the Russian Empire included most of Dnieper Ukraine, Belarus, Bessarabia, the Grand Duchy of Finland, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Central Asian states of Russian Turkestan, most of the Baltic governorates, a significant part of Poland, and the former Ottoman provinces of Ardahan, Artvin, Iğdır, Kars, and the northeastern part of Erzurum Province.\n\n\nImperial territories\nAccording to the 1st article of the Organic Law, the Russian Empire was one indivisible state In addition, the 26th article stated that \"With the Imperial Russian throne are indivisible the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Principality of Finland\" Relations with the Grand Principality of Finland were also regulated by the 2nd article, \"The Grand Principality of Finland, constituted an indivisible part of the Russian state, in its internal affairs governed by special regulations at the base of special laws\", and by the law of 10 June 1910.\n\n\nGovernment and administration\nFrom its initial creation until the 1905 Revolution, the Russian Empire was led by the emperor (also referred to as tsar) who ruled as an absolute monarch After the Revolution of 1905, Russia developed a new type of government, which became difficult to categorize In the Almanach de Gotha for 1910, Russia was described as \"a constitutional monarchy under an autocratic Tsar\" This contradiction in terms demonstrated the difficulty of precisely defining the system, transitional and sui generis, established in the Russian Empire after October 1905 Before this date, the fundamental laws of Russia described the power of the emperor as \"autocratic and unlimited\" After October 1905, while the imperial style was still \"Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias\", the fundamental laws were changed by removing the word unlimited While the emperor retained many of his old prerogatives, including an absolute veto over all legislation, he equally agreed to the establishment of an elected parliament, without whose consent no laws were to be enacted in Russia Not that the regime in Russia had become in any true sense constitutional, far less parliamentary But the \"unlimited autocracy\" had given way to a \"self-limited autocracy\" Whether this autocracy was to be permanently limited by the new changes, or only at the continuing discretion of the autocrat, became a subject of heated controversy between conflicting parties in the state Provisionally, then, the Russian governmental system may perhaps be best defined as \"a limited monarchy under an autocratic emperor\".\n\n\nEmperor\nPeter the Great changed his title from tsar to emperor in order to secure Russia's position in the European states system [130] While later rulers did not discard the new title, the Russian monarch was commonly known as the tsar or tsaritsa until the imperial system was abolished during the February Revolution of 1917 Prior to the issuance of the October Manifesto, the emperor ruled as an absolute monarch, subject to only two limitations on his authority, both of which were intended to protect the existing system: the emperor and his consort must both belong to the Russian Orthodox Church, and he must obey the Pauline Laws of succession established by Paul I Beyond this, the power of the Russian autocrat was virtually limitless.\n\n\nImperial Council\nUnder Russia's revised Fundamental Law of 20 February 1906, the State Council was associated with the Duma as a legislative Upper House; from this time the legislative power was exercised normally by the emperor only in concert with the two chambers [131] The Council of the Empire, or Imperial Council, as reconstituted for this purpose, consisted of 196 members, of whom 98 were nominated by the emperor, while 98 were elective The ministers, also nominated, were ex officio members Of the elected members, 3 were returned by the \"black\" clergy (the monks), 3 by the \"white\" clergy (secular), 18 by the corporations of nobles, 6 by the academy of sciences and the universities, 6 by the chambers of commerce, 6 by the industrial councils, 34 by local governmental zemstvos, 16 by local governments having no zemstvos, and 6 by Poland As a legislative body the powers of the council were coordinate with those of the Duma; in practice, however, it has seldom if ever initiated legislation.\n\n\nState Duma\nThe Duma of the Empire or Imperial Duma (Gosudarstvennaya Duma), which formed the lower house of the Russian parliament, consisted (since the ukaz of 2 June 1907) of 442 members, elected by an exceedingly complicated process The membership was manipulated as to secure an overwhelming majority of the wealthy (especially the landed classes) and also for the representatives of the Russian peoples at the expense of the subject nations Each province of the empire, except Central Asia, returned a certain number of members; added to which were those returned by several large cities The members of the Duma were chosen by electoral colleges and these, in their turn, were elected by assemblies of the three classes: landed proprietors, citizens, and peasants In these assemblies the wealthiest proprietors sat in person while the lesser proprietors were represented by delegates The urban population was divided into two categories according to taxable wealth and elected delegates directly to the college of the governorates The peasants were represented by delegates selected by the regional subdivisions called volosts Workmen were treated in a special manner, with every industrial concern employing fifty hands electing one or more delegates to the electoral college.\n\n\nCouncil of Ministers\nIn 1905, a Council of Ministers (Sovyet Ministrov) was created, under a minister president, the first appearance of a prime minister in Russia This council consisted of all the ministers and of the heads of other principal departments The ministries were as follows:\n\n\nMost Holy Synod\nThe Most Holy Synod (established in 1721) was the supreme organ of government of the Orthodox Church in Russia It was presided over by a lay Procurator, representing the emperor, and consisted of the three metropolitans of Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Kiev, the Archbishop of Georgia, and a number of bishops sitting in rotation.\n\n\nSenate\nThe Senate (Pravitelstvuyushchi Senat, i.e directing or governing senate), originally established during the Government reform of Peter the Great, consisted of members nominated by the emperor Its wide variety of functions were carried out by the different departments into which it was divided It was the supreme court of cassation; an audit office; a high court of justice for all political offences; and one of its departments fulfilled the functions of a heralds' college It also had supreme jurisdiction in all disputes arising out of the administration of the empire, notably in differences between representatives of the central power and the elected organs of local self-government Lastly, it promulgated new laws, a function which theoretically gave it a power akin to that of the Supreme Court of the United States, of rejecting measures not in accordance with fundamental laws.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAs of 1914, Russia was divided into 81 governorates (guberniyas), 20 oblasts, and 1 okrug Vassals and protectorates of the Russian Empire included the Emirate of Bukhara, the Khanate of Khiva, and, after 1914, Tuva (Uriankhai) Of these, 11 Governorates, 17 oblasts, and 1 okrug (Sakhalin) belonged to Asian Russia Of the rest, 8 Governorates were in Finland and 10 in Congress Poland European Russia thus embraced 59 governorates and 1 oblast (that of the Don) The Don Oblast was under the direct jurisdiction of the ministry of war; the rest each had a governor and deputy-governor, the latter presiding over the administrative council In addition, there were governors-general, generally placed over several governorates and armed with more extensive powers, usually including the command of the troops within the limits of their jurisdiction In 1906, there were governors-general in Finland, Warsaw, Vilna, Kiev, Moscow, and Riga The larger cities (Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Odessa, Sevastopol, Kerch, Nikolayev, and Rostov) had administrative systems of their own, independent of the governorates; in these the chief of police acted as governor.\n\n\nJudicial system\nThe judicial system of the Russian Empire was established by the statute of 20 November 1864 of Alexander II This system – based partly on English and French law – was predicated on the separation of judicial and administrative functions, the independence of the judges and courts, public trials and oral procedure, and the equality of all classes before the law Moreover, a democratic element was introduced by the adoption of the jury system and the election of judges This system was disliked by the bureaucracy, due to its putting the administration of justice outside of the executive sphere During the latter years of Alexander II and the reign of Alexander III, power that had been given was gradually taken back, and that take back was fully reversed by the third Duma after the 1905 Revolution [k]\n\n\nLocal administration\nAlongside the local organs of the central government in Russia there are three classes of local elected bodies charged with administrative functions:\n\n\nMunicipal dumas\nSince 1870, the municipalities in European Russia had institutions like those of the zemstvos All owners of houses, tax-paying merchants, artisans, and workmen were enrolled on lists, in descending order according to their assessed wealth The total valuation was then divided into three equal parts, representing three groups of electors very unequal in number, each of which would elect an equal number of delegates to the municipal duma The executive was in the hands of an elected mayor and an uprava, which consisted of several members elected by the municipal duma Under Alexander III, however, bylaws promulgated in 1892 and 1894, the municipal dumas were subordinated to the governors in the same way as the zemstvos In 1894, municipal institutions, with still more restricted powers, were granted to several towns in Siberia, and in 1895 to some in the Caucasus.\n\n\nBaltic provinces\nThe formerly Swedish-controlled Baltic provinces of Livonia and Estonia and later Duchy of Courland, a vassal of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, were incorporated into the Russian Empire after the defeat of Sweden in the Great Northern War Under the Treaty of Nystad of 1721, the Baltic German nobility retained considerable powers of self-government and numerous privileges in matters affecting education, police, and the local administration of justice After 167 years of German language administration and education, in 1888 and 1889 laws were passed transferring administration of the police and manorial justice from Baltic German control to officials of the central government About the same time, a process of Russification was being carried out in the same provinces, in all departments of administration, in the higher schools, and in the Imperial University of Dorpat, the name of which was altered to Yuriev In 1893, district committees for the management of the peasants' affairs, similar to those in purely Russian governments, were introduced into this part of the empire.\n\n\nEconomy\nBefore the liberation of the serfs in 1861, Russia's economy mainly depended on agriculture [132] By the census of 1897, 95% of the Russian population lived in the countryside [133] Nicholas I attempted to modernise his country, and have it not been so dependent on a single economic sector [134] During the reign of Alexander III, many reforms occurred The Peasants' Land Bank was founded in 1883 to provide loans for Russian peasants, both as individuals and in communes The Nobles' Land Bank, in 1885, made loans at nominal interest rates to the landed nobility The poll tax was abolished in 1886 [135]\n\n\nAgriculture\nRussia had a longstanding economic bargain on fundamental agriculture on large estates worked by Russian peasants (also known as serfs), who did not get any rights from slave masters under the system of \"barshchina\" [l] Another system was called obrok, [m] in which serfs worked in exchange for cash or goods from the master, allowing them to work outside the estate [138] These systems were based on a legal code called the Sobornoye Ulozheniye, which was introduced by Alexis I in 1649.\n\n\nMining and heavy industry\nAfter 1860, the expansion of Russian rail had far-reaching effects on the economy, culture, and ordinary life of Russia The central authorities and the imperial elite made most of the key decisions, but local elites made demands for rail linkages Local nobles, merchants, and entrepreneurs imagined a future of promoting their regional interests, from \"locality\" to \"empire\" Often, they had to compete with other cities By envisioning their own role in a rail network they came to understand how important they were to the empire's economy [142]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nAfter 1860, the expansion of Russian rail had

came to understand how important they were to the empire's economy [142]\n\n\nReligion\nThe Russian Empire's state religion was Orthodox Christianity [144] The emperor was not allowed to \"profess any faith other than the Orthodox\" (Article 62 of the 1906 Fundamental Laws) and was deemed \"the Supreme Defender and Guardian of the dogmas of the predominant Faith and is the Keeper of the purity of the Faith and all good order within the Holy Church\" (Article 64 ex supra) Although he made and annulled all senior ecclesiastical appointments, he did not settle questions of dogma or church teaching The principal ecclesiastical authority of the Russian Church—which extended its jurisdiction over the entire territory of the empire, including the ex-Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti—was the Most Holy Synod, the civilian Over Procurator of the Holy Synod being one of the council of ministers with wide de facto powers in ecclesiastical matters.\n\n\nReligious policy\nAll non-Orthodox religions were formally forbidden from proselytizing within the empire [145] In a policy influenced by Catherine II but solidified in the 19th century, Tsarist Russia exhibited increasing \"confessionalization\", pursuing top-down reorganization of the empire's faiths, [145] also referred to as the \"confessional state\" [146] The tsarist administration sought to arrange \"orthodoxies\" within Islam, Buddhism, and the Protestant faiths, which was performed by creating spiritual assemblies (in the case of Islam, Judaism, and Lutheranism), banning and declaring bishoprics (in the case of Roman Catholicism), and arbitrating doctrinal disputes [145] When the state lacked resources to provide a secular bureaucracy across its entire territory, guided 'reformation' of faiths provided elements of social control [145] [146]\n\n\nAnti-semitism\nAfter Catherine II annexed eastern Poland in the Polish Partitions, [147] there were restrictions placed against Jews known as the Pale of Settlement, an area of Tsarist Russia inside which Jews were authorized to settle, and outside of which were deprived of various rights such as freedom of movement or commerce [148] Particularly repressive was Emperor Nicholas I, who sought the forced assimilation of Jews, [149] from 1827 conscripted Jewish children as Cantonists in military institutions in the east aiming to compel them to convert to Christianity, [150] attempted to stratify Jews into \"useful\" and \"not useful\" based on wealth [149] and further restricted religious and commercial rights within the Pale of Settlement [148] [151] Emperor Alexander II ceased this harsh treatment and pursued a more bureaucratic type of assimilation, [149] such as compensating the Cantonists for their previous military service, including those who remained Jewish, [148] although certain military ranks were still limited to Christians [149] In contrast, Emperor Alexander III resumed an atmosphere of oppression, including the May Laws, which further restricted Jewish settlements and rights to own property, as well as limiting the types of professions available, [152] [148] and the expulsion of Jews from Kiev in 1886 and Moscow in 1891 The overall anti-Jewish policy of the Russian Empire led to significant sustained emigration [148]\n\n\nPersecution of Muslims\nIslam had a \"sheltered but precarious\" place in the Russian Empire [153] Initially, sporadic forced conversions were demanded against Muslims in the early Russian Empire In the 18th century, Catherine II issued an edict of toleration that gave legal status to Islam and allowed Muslims to fulfill religious obligations [154] Catherine also established the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly, which had a degree of imperial jurisdiction over the organization of Islamic practice in the country [155] As the Russian Empire expanded, tsarist administrators found it expedient to draw on existing Islamic religious institutions that were already in place [156] [155]\n\n\nPolicy towards non-Eastern Orthodox Christian sects\nDespite the predominance of Orthodoxy, several Christian denominations were professed [163] Lutherans were particularly tolerated with the invited settlement of Volga Germans and the presence of Baltic German nobility [164] During the reign of Catherine II, the Jesuit suppression was not promulgated, so Jesuits survived in Russian Empire, and this \"Russian Society\" played a role in re-establishing the Jesuits in the west [165] Overall, Roman Catholicism was strictly controlled during Catherine II's reign, which was considered an epoch of relative tolerance for Catholicism [145] [166] Catholics were distrusted by the Russian Empire as elements of Polish nationalism, a perception which especially increased following the January Uprising [167] After this Russification policies intensified and Orthodox churches such as Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Warsaw were built across Congress Poland, but no forced conversion was attempted.\n\n\nDemography\nAccording to returns published in 1905, based on the Russian Empire census of 1897, adherents of the different religious communities in the empire numbered approximately as follows.\n\n\nImperial census of 1897\nAccording to returns published in 1905, based on the Russian Empire census of 1897, adherents of the different religious communities in the empire numbered approximately as follows.\n\n\nRussian Central Asia\nRussian Central Asia was also called Turkestan As of the 1897 census, Russian Central Asia's five oblasts contained 5,260,300 inhabitants, 13.9 percent of them urban The largest towns were Tashkent (156,400), Kokand (82,100), Namangan (61,900), and Samarkand (54,900) By 1911, 17 percent of Semireche's population and half of its urban residents were Russians, four-fifths of them agricultural colonists In the other four oblasts in the same year, Russians constituted only 4 percent of the population, and the overwhelming majority lived in European-style settlements alongside the native quarters in the major towns [175]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe armed forces of the Russian Empire consisted of the Imperial Russian Army and the Imperial Russian Navy The Emperor of Russia was the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and implemented out his military policies through the Ministry of War and the Ministry of the Navy, which were tasked with administering their respective branches There was no joint staff, but joint commissions were formed to work on specific tasks that involved both services [176] [177] The Main Staff of the War Ministry administered the Army's organization, training, and mobilization, as well as coordinating the different branches of the Army, while the General Staff was tasked with operational planning This structure developed in the 1860s after the Crimean War [178] The Navy Ministry had a similar structure, including a Main Staff tasked with administration and a Naval Technological Committee, and after the Russo-Japanese War a Naval General Staff was added for operational planning and war preparation [179] [180]\n\n\nSociety\nThe Russian Empire was predominantly a rural society spread over vast spaces In 1913, 80% of the people were peasants Soviet historiography proclaimed that the Russian Empire of the 19th century was characterized by systemic crisis, which impoverished the workers and peasants and culminated in the revolutions of the early 20th century Recent research by Russian scholars disputes this interpretation Mironov assesses the effects of the reforms of latter 19th-century, especially in terms of the 1861 emancipation of the serfs, agricultural output trends, various standard of living indicators, and taxation of peasants He argues that those reforms brought about measurable improvements in social welfare More generally, he finds that the well-being of the Russian people declined during most of the 18th century but increased slowly from the end of the 18th century to 1914 [200]\n\n\nEstates\nSubjects of the Russian Empire were segregated into sosloviyes, or social estates (classes) such as nobility (dvoryanstvo), clergy, merchants, cossacks, and peasants Native people of the Caucasus, non-ethnic Russian areas such as Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Siberia and Central Asia were officially registered as a category called inorodtsy ('non-Slavic', lit. 'people of another origin').\n\n\nSerfdom\nThe serfdom that had developed in Russia in the 16th century, and had become enshrined in law in 1649, was abolished in 1861 [201] [202]\n\n\nPeasants\nThe former serfs became peasants, joining the millions of farmers who already had peasant status [204] [202] Most peasants lived in tens of thousands of small villages under a highly patriarchal system Hundreds of thousands moved to cities to work in factories, but they typically retained their village connections [206]\n\n\nLandowners\nThe situation of the former serf-proprietors was also unsatisfactory Accustomed to the use of compulsory labor, they failed to adapt to the new conditions The millions of rubles of redemption money received from the crown was spent without any real or lasting agricultural improvements having been effected The forests were sold, and the only prosperous landlords were those who exacted rack-rents for the land allotted to peasants There was an increase of wealth among the few, but along with this a general impoverishment of the mass of the people Added to this, the peculiar institution of the mir—framed on the principle of community ownership and occupation of the land—the overall effect was not encouraging of individual effort.\n\n\nMedia\nCensorship was heavy-handed until the reign of Alexander II, but it never went away [209] Newspapers were strictly limited in what they could publish, and intellectuals favored literary magazines for their publishing outlets Fyodor Dostoyevsky, for example, ridiculed the St Petersburg newspapers, such as Golos and Peterburgskii Listok, accusing them of publishing trifles and distracting readers from the pressing social concerns of contemporary Russia through their obsession with spectacle and European popular culture [210]\n\n\nEducation\nEducational standards were very low in the Russian Empire, though they slowly increased in its last century of existence By 1800, the level of literacy among male peasants ranged from 1 to 12 percent and from 20 to 25 percent for urban men Literacy among women was very low Literacy rates were highest for the nobility (84 to 87 percent), followed by merchants (over 75 percent), and then the workers and peasants Serfs were the least literate In every group, women were far less literate than men By contrast, in Western Europe, urban men had about a 50 percent literacy rate The Orthodox hierarchy was suspicious of education, seeing no religious need for literacy whatsoever Peasants did not need to be literate, and those who did — such as artisans, businessmen, and professionals — were few in number As late as 1851, only 8% of Russians lived in cities [211]\n\n\nSee

century, all of the semi-independent and petty princedoms in Russia had been unified with Moscow [17] During the reign of Ivan IV, the khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan were conquered by Russia in the mid-16th century, leading to the development of an increasingly multinational state [18]\n\n\nPopulation\nMuch of Russia's expansion occurred in the 17th century, culminating in the first Russian colonization of the Pacific, the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667) which led to the incorporation of left-bank Ukraine, and the Russian conquest of Siberia Poland was partitioned by its rivals in 1772–1815;most of its land and population being taken under Russian rule Most of the empire's growth in the 19th century came from gaining territory in central and eastern Asia south of Siberia [19] By 1795, after the Partitions of Poland, Russia became the most populous state in Europe, ahead of France.\n\n\nBackground\nThe foundations of the Russian Empire were laid during Peter I's reforms, which significantly altered Russia's political and social structure, [21] and as a result of the Great Northern War which strengthened Russia's standing on the world stage [22] Internal transformations and military victories contributed to the transformation of Russia into a great power, playing a major role in European politics [23] On the day of the announcement of the Treaty of Nystad, the 2 November  [O.S 22 October] 1721, the Governing Senate and Synod invested the tsar with the titles of Pater Patriae [h] and Imperator of all Rusia [i] [24] The adoption of the latter title by Peter I is usually seen as the beginning of the \"imperial\" period of Russia [j] [27]\n\n\n18th century\nPeter I (r. 1682–1725), also known as Peter the Great, played a major role in introducing the European state system into Russia While the empire's vast lands had a population of 14 million, grain yields trailed behind those in the West [32] Nearly the entire population was devoted to agriculture, with only a small percentage living in towns The class of kholops, whose status was close to that of slaves, remained a major institution in Russia until 1723, when Peter converted household kholops into house serfs, thus counting them for poll taxation Russian agricultural kholops had been formally converted into serfs earlier in 1679 They were largely tied to the land, in a feudal sense, until the late 19th century.\n\n\nPeter the Great (1682–1725)\nPeter I (r. 1682–1725), also known as Peter the Great, played a major role in introducing the European state system into Russia While the empire's vast lands had a population of 14 million, grain yields trailed behind those in the West [32] Nearly the entire population was devoted to agriculture, with only a small percentage living in towns The class of kholops, whose status was close to that of slaves, remained a major institution in Russia until 1723, when Peter converted household kholops into house serfs, thus counting them for poll taxation Russian agricultural kholops had been formally converted into serfs earlier in 1679 They were largely tied to the land, in a feudal sense, until the late 19th century.\n\n\nCatherine the Great (1762–1796)\nCatherine the Great was a German princess who married Peter III, the German heir to the Russian crown After the death of Empress Elizabeth, Catherine came to power after she effected a coup d'état against her very unpopular husband She contributed to the resurgence of the Russian nobility that began after the death of Peter the Great, abolishing State service and granting them control of most state functions in the provinces She also removed the Beard tax instituted by Peter the Great [37]\n\n\nState budget\nRussia was in a continuous state of financial crisis While revenue rose from 9 million rubles in 1724 to 40 million in 1794, expenses grew more rapidly, reaching 49 million in 1794 The budget allocated 46 percent to the military, 20 percent to government economic activities, 12 percent to administration, and nine percent for the Imperial Court in St Petersburg The deficit required borrowing, primarily from bankers in Amsterdam; five percent of the budget was allocated to debt payments Paper money was issued to pay for expensive wars, thus causing inflation As a result of its spending, Russia developed a large and well-equipped army, a very large and complex bureaucracy, and a court that rivaled those of Versailles and London But the government was living far beyond its means, and 18th-century Russia remained \"a poor, backward, overwhelmingly agricultural, and illiterate country\" [44]\n\n\nFirst half of the 19th century\nIn 1801, over four years after Paul became the emperor of Russia, he was killed in Saint Michael's Castle in a coup Paul was succeeded by his 23-year-old son, Alexander Russia was in a state of war with the French Republic under the leadership of the Corsica-born First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte After he became the emperor, Napoleon defeated Russia at Austerlitz in 1805, Eylau and Friedland in 1807 After Alexander was defeated in Friedland, he agreed to negotiate and sued for peace with France; the Treaties of Tilsit led to the Franco-Russian alliance against the Coalition and joined the Continental System [45] By 1812, Russia had occupied many territories in Eastern Europe, holding some of Eastern Galicia from Austria and Bessarabia from the Ottoman Empire; [46] from Northern Europe, it had gained Finland from the war against a weakened Sweden; it also gained some territory in the Caucasus.\n\n\nForeign policy (1800–1864)\nAfter Russian armies liberated the Eastern Georgian Kingdom (allied since the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk) from the Qajar dynasty's occupation of 1802, [citation needed] during the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813), they clashed with Persia over control and consolidation of Georgia, and also became involved in the Caucasian War against the Caucasian Imamate At the conclusion of the war, Persia irrevocably ceded what is now Dagestan, eastern Georgia, and most of Azerbaijan to Russia, under the Treaty of Gulistan [53] Russia attempted to expand to the southwest, at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, using recently acquired Georgia at its base for its Caucasus and Anatolian front The late 1820s were successful years militarily Despite losing almost all recently consolidated territories in the first year of the Russo-Persian War of 1826–1828, Russia managed to favorably bring an end to the war with the Treaty of Turkmenchay, including the formal acquisition of what are now Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iğdır Province [54] In the 1828–1829 Russo-Turkish War, Russia invaded northeastern Anatolia and occupied the strategic Ottoman towns of Karin and Gümüşhane (Argiroupoli) and, posing as protector of the Greek Orthodox population, received extensive support from the region's Pontic Greeks Following a brief occupation, the Russian imperial army withdrew back into Georgia [55]\n\n\nSecond half of the 19th century\nIn 1854–1855, Russia fought Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire in the Crimean War, which Russia lost The war was fought primarily in the Crimean peninsula, and to a lesser extent in the Baltic during the related Åland War Since playing a major role in the defeat of Napoleon, Russia had been regarded as militarily invincible, but against a coalition of the great powers of Europe, the reverses it suffered on land and sea exposed the weakness of Emperor Nicholas I's regime.\n\n\nAlexander III\nIn 1881, Alexander II was assassinated by the Narodnaya Volya, a Nihilist terrorist organization The throne passed to Alexander III (1881–1894), a reactionary who revived the maxim of \"Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality\" of Nicholas I A committed Slavophile, Alexander III believed that Russia could be saved from turmoil only by shutting itself off from the subversive influences of Western Europe During his reign, Russia formed the Franco-Russian Alliance, to contain the growing power of Germany; completed the conquest of Central Asia; and demanded important territorial and commercial concessions from China The emperor's most influential adviser was Konstantin Pobedonostsev, tutor to Alexander III and his son Nicholas, and procurator of the Holy Synod from 1880 to 1895 Pobedonostsev taught his imperial pupils to fear freedom of speech and the press, as well as dislike democracy, constitutions, and the parliamentary system Under Pobedonostsev, revolutionaries were persecuted—by the imperial secret police, with thousands being exiled to Siberia—and a policy of Russification was carried out throughout the empire [72]\n\n\nForeign policy (1864–1907)\nRussia had little difficulty expanding to the south, including conquering Turkestan, [73] until Britain became alarmed when Russia threatened Afghanistan, with the implicit threat to India; and decades of diplomatic maneuvering resulted, called the Great Game [74] That rivalry between the two empires has been considered to have included far-flung territories such as Outer Mongolia and Tibet The maneuvering largely ended with the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 [75]\n\n\nEarly 20th century\nIn 1894, Alexander III was succeeded by his son, Nicholas II, who was committed to retaining the autocracy that his father had left him Nicholas II proved as an ineffective ruler, and in the end his dynasty was overthrown by the Russian Revolution [79] The Industrial Revolution began to show significant influence in Russia, but the country remained rural and poor.\n\n\nWar, revolution, and collapse\nRussia, along with France and Britain, was a member of the Entente in antecedent to World War I; these three powers were formed up in response to Germany's rival [86] Triple Alliance, comprising itself, Austria-Hungary and Italy Previously, Saint Petersburg and Paris, along with London, were belligerents in the Crimean War The relations with Britain were in disquietude from the Great Game in Central Asia until the 1907 Anglo-Russian Convention, when both agreed to settle their differences and joined to oppose the new rising power of Germany [87] Russia and France's relations remained isolated before the 1890s when both sides agreed to ally when peace was threatened [88] France also granted loans for building infrastructure, especially rail [89]\n\n\nOrigins of causes\nRussia, along with France and Britain, was a member of the Entente in antecedent to

[88] France also granted loans for building infrastructure, especially rail [89]\n\n\nDeclaration of War\nAs a result of Vienna's declaration of war on Serbia, Nicholas II ordered the mobilization of 4.9 million men Germany, Austria-Hungary's ally, saw the call to arms as a threat; when Russia mustered its troops, Germany affirmed the state of \"imminent danger of War\", [95] followed by the declaration of war on 1 August 1914 [96] The Russians were imbued with patriotic earnestness and Germanophobic sentiment, including the name of the capital, Saint Petersburg, which sounded too German for the sake of words Sankt- and -burg; and was renamed Petrograd [97]\n\n\nTheaters of operations\nBy August 1914, Russia had invaded with unexpected speed the German province of East Prussia, ending with a humiliating defeat at Tannenberg, owing to a message sent without wiring and coding, [100] causing the destruction of the entire second army Russia suffered a massive defeat at the Masurian Lakes twice, the first ending with a hundred thousand casualties; [101] and the second suffering 200,000 [102] By October, the German Ninth Army was near Warsaw, and the newly-formed Tenth Army had retreated from the frontier in East Prussia Grand Duke Nicholas, the Russian commander-in-chief, now had the order to invade Silesia with his Fifth, Fourth, and Ninth armies [103] The Ninth Army, led by Mackensen, retreated from the frontline in Galicia and concentrated between the cities of Posen and Thorn The advance took place on 11 November against the main army's right flank and rear; the First and Second armies were severely mauled, and the Second army was nearly surrounded in Łódź on 17 November.\n\n\nGerman front\nBy August 1914, Russia had invaded with unexpected speed the German

army's right flank and rear; the First and Second armies were severely mauled, and the Second army was nearly surrounded in Łódź on 17 November.\n\n\nAustrian front\nAustria-Hungary went to war with Russia on 6 August The Russians started to invade Galicia, held by Austrian Cisleithania on 20 August, and annihilated the Austro-Hungarian Army at Lemberg, leading to the occupation of Galicia [109] While the fortress of Premissel was besieged, the first attempt to capture the fortress failed, but the second attempt seized the redoubt in March 1915 [110] On 2 May, the Russian army was broken through by joint Austro-German forces, retreating from the Gorlice to Tarnów line and losing Premissel.\n\n\nTurkish front\nOn 29 October 1914, a prelude to the Russo-Turkish front, the Turkish fleet, with German support, began to raid Russian coastal cities in Odessa, Sevastopol, Novorossiysk, Feodosia, Kerch, and Yalta  [113] This led Russia to declare war on the Ottoman Empire on 2 November [114] Throughout the war the Russian General Staff saw the Caucasus as a secondary theater and prioritized troops for other regions [115] The Russians, led by Baltic German General Georgy Bergmann, opened the front by crossing the frontier but failed to capture Köprüköy In December 1914, Russia obtained success at Sarikamish, where the Russian General Nikolai Yudenich routed Enver Pasha [116] Yudenich captured Köprüköy in January 1916 and captured Erzurum about one month later in February [115]\n\n\nProblems in the empire\nBy the middle of 1915, the impact of the war was demoralizing Food and fuel were in short supply, casualties were increasing, and inflation was mounting Strikes rose among low-paid factory workers, and there were reports that peasants, who wanted reforms of land ownership, were restless The emperor eventually decided to take personal command of the army and moved to the front, leaving his wife, the Empress Alexandra, in charge in the capital She fell under the spell of a monk, Grigori Rasputin (1869–1916) His assassination in late 1916 by a clique of nobles could not restore the emperor's lost prestige [120]\n\n\nEnd of imperial rule\nOn 3 March 1917, International Women's Day, a strike was organized at a factory in the capital, followed by thousands of people took to the streets in Petrograd to protest food shortages A day later, protesters rose to two hundred thousand, demanding that Russia withdraw from the war and the emperor be deposed Eighty thousand Russian troops, half of the men sent to restore order, had gone on strike and refused the senior officers' orders [121] Any imperial symbols were destroyed and burned The capital was out of control and gripped by protest and strife [122]\n\n\nTerritory\nBy the end of the 19th century the area of the empire was about 22,400,000 square kilometers (8,600,000 sq mi), or almost one-sixth of the Earth's landmass; its only rival in size at the time was the British Empire The majority of the population lived in European Russia More than 100 different ethnic groups lived in the Russian Empire, with ethnic Russians composing about 45% of the population [124]\n\n\nGeography\nThe administrative boundaries of European Russia, apart from Finland and its portion of Poland, coincided approximately with the natural limits of the East-European plains To the north was the Arctic Ocean Novaya Zemlya and the Kolguyev and Vaygach Islands were considered part of European Russia, but the Kara Sea was part of Siberia To the east were the Asiatic territories of the empire: Siberia and the Kyrgyz steppes, from both of which it was separated by the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, and the Caspian Sea — the administrative boundary, however, partly extended into Asia on the Siberian slope of the Urals To the south, were the Black Sea and the Caucasus, being separated from the latter by the Manych River depression, which in post-Pliocene times connected the Sea of Azov with the Caspian The western boundary was purely arbitrary: it crossed the Kola Peninsula from the Varangerfjord to the Gulf of Bothnia It then ran to the Curonian Lagoon in the southern Baltic Sea, and then to the mouth of the Danube, taking a great circular sweep to the west to embrace east-central Poland, and separating Russia from Prussia, Austrian Galicia, and Romania.\n\n\nTerritorial development\nFrom 1860 to 1905, the Russian Empire occupied all territories of the present-day Russian Federation, with the exception of the present-day Kaliningrad Oblast, Kuril Islands and Tuva In 1905 Russia lost southern Sakhalin to Japan, but gained Tuva as a protectorate in 1914 Prior to 1917 the Russian Empire included most of Dnieper Ukraine, Belarus, Bessarabia, the Grand Duchy of Finland, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Central Asian states of Russian Turkestan, most of the Baltic governorates, a significant part of Poland, and the former Ottoman provinces of Ardahan, Artvin, Iğdır, Kars, and the northeastern part of Erzurum Province.\n\n\nImperial territories\nAccording to the 1st article of the Organic Law, the Russian Empire was one indivisible state In addition, the 26th article stated that \"With the Imperial Russian throne are indivisible the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Principality of Finland\" Relations with the Grand Principality of Finland were also regulated by the 2nd article, \"The Grand Principality of Finland, constituted an indivisible part of the Russian state, in its internal affairs governed by special regulations at the base of special laws\", and by the law of 10 June 1910.\n\n\nGovernment and administration\nFrom its initial creation until the 1905 Revolution, the Russian Empire was led by the emperor (also referred to as tsar) who ruled as an absolute monarch After the Revolution of 1905, Russia developed a new type of government, which became difficult to categorize In the Almanach de Gotha for 1910, Russia was described as \"a constitutional monarchy under an autocratic Tsar\" This contradiction in terms demonstrated the difficulty of precisely defining the system, transitional and sui generis, established in the Russian Empire after October 1905 Before this date, the fundamental laws of Russia described the power of the emperor as \"autocratic and unlimited\" After October 1905, while the imperial style was still \"Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias\", the fundamental laws were changed by removing the word unlimited While the emperor retained many of his old prerogatives, including an absolute veto over all legislation, he equally agreed to the establishment of an elected parliament, without whose consent no laws were to be enacted in Russia Not that the regime in Russia had become in any true sense constitutional, far less parliamentary But the \"unlimited autocracy\" had given way to a \"self-limited autocracy\" Whether this autocracy was to be permanently limited by the new changes, or only at the continuing discretion of the autocrat, became a subject of heated controversy between conflicting parties in the state Provisionally, then, the Russian governmental system may perhaps be best defined as \"a limited monarchy under an autocratic emperor\".\n\n\nEmperor\nPeter the Great changed his title from tsar to emperor in order to secure Russia's position in the European states system [130] While later rulers did not discard the new title, the Russian monarch was commonly known as the tsar or tsaritsa until the imperial system was abolished during the February Revolution of 1917 Prior to the issuance of the October Manifesto, the emperor ruled as an absolute monarch, subject to only two limitations on his authority, both of which were intended to protect the existing system: the emperor and his consort must both belong to the Russian Orthodox Church, and he must obey the Pauline Laws of succession established by Paul I Beyond this, the power of the Russian autocrat was virtually limitless.\n\n\nImperial Council\nUnder Russia's revised Fundamental Law of 20 February 1906, the State Council was associated with the Duma as a legislative Upper House; from this time the legislative power was exercised normally by the emperor only in concert with the two chambers [131] The Council of the Empire, or Imperial Council, as reconstituted for this purpose, consisted of 196 members, of whom 98 were nominated by the emperor, while 98 were elective The ministers, also nominated, were ex officio members Of the elected members, 3 were returned by the \"black\" clergy (the monks), 3 by the \"white\" clergy (secular), 18 by the corporations of nobles, 6 by the academy of sciences and the universities, 6 by the chambers of commerce, 6 by the industrial councils, 34 by local governmental zemstvos, 16 by local governments having no zemstvos, and 6 by Poland As a legislative body the powers of the council were coordinate with those of the Duma; in practice, however, it has seldom if ever initiated legislation.\n\n\nState Duma\nThe Duma of the Empire or Imperial Duma (Gosudarstvennaya Duma), which formed the lower house of the Russian parliament, consisted (since the ukaz of 2 June 1907) of 442 members, elected by an exceedingly complicated process The membership was manipulated as to secure an overwhelming majority of the wealthy (especially the landed classes) and also for the representatives of the Russian peoples at the expense of the subject nations Each province of the empire, except Central Asia, returned a certain number of members; added to which were those returned by several large cities The members of the Duma were chosen by electoral colleges and these, in their turn, were elected by assemblies of the three classes: landed proprietors, citizens, and peasants In these assemblies the wealthiest proprietors sat in person while the lesser proprietors were represented by delegates The urban population was divided into two categories according to taxable wealth and elected delegates directly to the college of the governorates The peasants were represented by delegates selected by the regional subdivisions called volosts Workmen were treated in a special manner, with every industrial concern employing fifty hands electing one or more delegates to the electoral college.\n\n\nCouncil of Ministers\nIn 1905, a Council of Ministers (Sovyet Ministrov) was created, under a minister president, the first appearance of a prime minister in Russia This council consisted of all the ministers and of the heads of other principal departments The ministries were as follows:\n\n\nMost Holy Synod\nThe Most Holy Synod (established in 1721) was the supreme organ of government of the Orthodox Church in Russia It was presided over by a lay Procurator, representing the emperor, and consisted of the three metropolitans of Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Kiev, the Archbishop of Georgia, and a number of bishops sitting in rotation.\n\n\nSenate\nThe Senate (Pravitelstvuyushchi Senat, i.e directing or governing senate), originally established during the Government reform of Peter the Great, consisted of members nominated by the emperor Its wide variety of functions were carried out by the different departments into which it was divided It was the supreme court of cassation; an audit office; a high court of justice for all political offences; and one of its departments fulfilled the functions of a heralds' college It also had supreme jurisdiction in all disputes arising out of the administration of the empire, notably in differences between representatives of the central power and the elected organs of local self-government Lastly, it promulgated new laws, a function which theoretically gave it a power akin to that of the Supreme Court of the United States, of rejecting measures not in accordance with fundamental laws.\n\n\nAdministrative divisions\nAs of 1914, Russia was divided into 81 governorates (guberniyas), 20 oblasts, and 1 okrug Vassals and protectorates of the Russian Empire included the Emirate of Bukhara, the Khanate of Khiva, and, after 1914, Tuva (Uriankhai) Of these, 11 Governorates, 17 oblasts, and 1 okrug (Sakhalin) belonged to Asian Russia Of the rest, 8 Governorates were in Finland and 10 in Congress Poland European Russia thus embraced 59 governorates and 1 oblast (that of the Don) The Don Oblast was under the direct jurisdiction of the ministry of war; the rest each had a governor and deputy-governor, the latter presiding over the administrative council In addition, there were governors-general, generally placed over several governorates and armed with more extensive powers, usually including the command of the troops within the limits of their jurisdiction In 1906, there were governors-general in Finland, Warsaw, Vilna, Kiev, Moscow, and Riga The larger cities (Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Odessa, Sevastopol, Kerch, Nikolayev, and Rostov) had administrative systems of their own, independent of the governorates; in these the chief of police acted as governor.\n\n\nJudicial system\nThe judicial system of the Russian Empire was established by the statute of 20 November 1864 of Alexander II This system – based partly on English and French law – was predicated on the separation of judicial and administrative functions, the independence of the judges and courts, public trials and oral procedure, and the equality of all classes before the law Moreover, a democratic element was introduced by the adoption of the jury system and the election of judges This system was disliked by the bureaucracy, due to its putting the administration of justice outside of the executive sphere During the latter years of Alexander II and the reign of Alexander III, power that had been given was gradually taken back, and that take back was fully reversed by the third Duma after the 1905 Revolution [k]\n\n\nLocal administration\nAlongside the local organs of the central government in Russia there are three classes of local elected bodies charged with administrative functions:\n\n\nMunicipal dumas\nSince 1870, the municipalities in European Russia had institutions like those of the zemstvos All owners of houses, tax-paying merchants, artisans, and workmen were enrolled on lists, in descending order according to their assessed wealth The total valuation was then divided into three equal parts, representing three groups of electors very unequal in number, each of which would elect an equal number of delegates to the municipal duma The executive was in the hands of an elected mayor and an uprava, which consisted of several members elected by the municipal duma Under Alexander III, however, bylaws promulgated in 1892 and 1894, the municipal dumas were subordinated to the governors in the same way as the zemstvos In 1894, municipal institutions, with still more restricted powers, were granted to several towns in Siberia, and in 1895 to some in the Caucasus.\n\n\nBaltic provinces\nThe formerly Swedish-controlled Baltic provinces of Livonia and Estonia and later Duchy of Courland, a vassal of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, were incorporated into the Russian Empire after the defeat of Sweden in the Great Northern War Under the Treaty of Nystad of 1721, the Baltic German nobility retained considerable powers of self-government and numerous privileges in matters affecting education, police, and the local administration of justice After 167 years of German language administration and education, in 1888 and 1889 laws were passed transferring administration of the police and manorial justice from Baltic German control to officials of the central government About the same time, a process of Russification was being carried out in the same provinces, in all departments of administration, in the higher schools, and in the Imperial University of Dorpat, the name of which was altered to Yuriev In 1893, district committees for the management of the peasants' affairs, similar to those in purely Russian governments, were introduced into this part of the empire.\n\n\nEconomy\nBefore the liberation of the serfs in 1861, Russia's economy mainly depended on agriculture [132] By the census of 1897, 95% of the Russian population lived in the countryside [133] Nicholas I attempted to modernise his country, and have it not been so dependent on a single economic sector [134] During the reign of Alexander III, many reforms occurred The Peasants' Land Bank was founded in 1883 to provide loans for Russian peasants, both as individuals and in communes The Nobles' Land Bank, in 1885, made loans at nominal interest rates to the landed nobility The poll tax was abolished in 1886 [135]\n\n\nAgriculture\nRussia had a longstanding economic bargain on fundamental agriculture on large estates worked by Russian peasants (also known as serfs), who did not get any rights from slave masters under the system of \"barshchina\" [l] Another system was called obrok, [m] in which serfs worked in exchange for cash or goods from the master, allowing them to work outside the estate [138] These systems were based on a legal code called the Sobornoye Ulozheniye, which was introduced by Alexis I in 1649.\n\n\nMining and heavy industry\nAfter 1860, the expansion of Russian rail had far-reaching effects on the economy, culture, and ordinary life of Russia The central authorities and the imperial elite made most of the key decisions, but local elites made demands for rail linkages Local nobles, merchants, and entrepreneurs imagined a future of promoting their regional interests, from \"locality\" to \"empire\" Often, they had to compete with other cities By envisioning their own role in a rail network they came to understand how important they were to the empire's economy [142]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nAfter 1860, the expansion of Russian rail had

came to understand how important they were to the empire's economy [142]\n\n\nReligion\nThe Russian Empire's state religion was Orthodox Christianity [144] The emperor was not allowed to \"profess any faith other than the Orthodox\" (Article 62 of the 1906 Fundamental Laws) and was deemed \"the Supreme Defender and Guardian of the dogmas of the predominant Faith and is the Keeper of the purity of the Faith and all good order within the Holy Church\" (Article 64 ex supra) Although he made and annulled all senior ecclesiastical appointments, he did not settle questions of dogma or church teaching The principal ecclesiastical authority of the Russian Church—which extended its jurisdiction over the entire territory of the empire, including the ex-Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti—was the Most Holy Synod, the civilian Over Procurator of the Holy Synod being one of the council of ministers with wide de facto powers in ecclesiastical matters.\n\n\nReligious policy\nAll non-Orthodox religions were formally forbidden from proselytizing within the empire [145] In a policy influenced by Catherine II but solidified in the 19th century, Tsarist Russia exhibited increasing \"confessionalization\", pursuing top-down reorganization of the empire's faiths, [145] also referred to as the \"confessional state\" [146] The tsarist administration sought to arrange \"orthodoxies\" within Islam, Buddhism, and the Protestant faiths, which was performed by creating spiritual assemblies (in the case of Islam, Judaism, and Lutheranism), banning and declaring bishoprics (in the case of Roman Catholicism), and arbitrating doctrinal disputes [145] When the state lacked resources to provide a secular bureaucracy across its entire territory, guided 'reformation' of faiths provided elements of social control [145] [146]\n\n\nAnti-semitism\nAfter Catherine II annexed eastern Poland in the Polish Partitions, [147] there were restrictions placed against Jews known as the Pale of Settlement, an area of Tsarist Russia inside which Jews were authorized to settle, and outside of which were deprived of various rights such as freedom of movement or commerce [148] Particularly repressive was Emperor Nicholas I, who sought the forced assimilation of Jews, [149] from 1827 conscripted Jewish children as Cantonists in military institutions in the east aiming to compel them to convert to Christianity, [150] attempted to stratify Jews into \"useful\" and \"not useful\" based on wealth [149] and further restricted religious and commercial rights within the Pale of Settlement [148] [151] Emperor Alexander II ceased this harsh treatment and pursued a more bureaucratic type of assimilation, [149] such as compensating the Cantonists for their previous military service, including those who remained Jewish, [148] although certain military ranks were still limited to Christians [149] In contrast, Emperor Alexander III resumed an atmosphere of oppression, including the May Laws, which further restricted Jewish settlements and rights to own property, as well as limiting the types of professions available, [152] [148] and the expulsion of Jews from Kiev in 1886 and Moscow in 1891 The overall anti-Jewish policy of the Russian Empire led to significant sustained emigration [148]\n\n\nPersecution of Muslims\nIslam had a \"sheltered but precarious\" place in the Russian Empire [153] Initially, sporadic forced conversions were demanded against Muslims in the early Russian Empire In the 18th century, Catherine II issued an edict of toleration that gave legal status to Islam and allowed Muslims to fulfill religious obligations [154] Catherine also established the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly, which had a degree of imperial jurisdiction over the organization of Islamic practice in the country [155] As the Russian Empire expanded, tsarist administrators found it expedient to draw on existing Islamic religious institutions that were already in place [156] [155]\n\n\nPolicy towards non-Eastern Orthodox Christian sects\nDespite the predominance of Orthodoxy, several Christian denominations were professed [163] Lutherans were particularly tolerated with the invited settlement of Volga Germans and the presence of Baltic German nobility [164] During the reign of Catherine II, the Jesuit suppression was not promulgated, so Jesuits survived in Russian Empire, and this \"Russian Society\" played a role in re-establishing the Jesuits in the west [165] Overall, Roman Catholicism was strictly controlled during Catherine II's reign, which was considered an epoch of relative tolerance for Catholicism [145] [166] Catholics were distrusted by the Russian Empire as elements of Polish nationalism, a perception which especially increased following the January Uprising [167] After this Russification policies intensified and Orthodox churches such as Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Warsaw were built across Congress Poland, but no forced conversion was attempted.\n\n\nDemography\nAccording to returns published in 1905, based on the Russian Empire census of 1897, adherents of the different religious communities in the empire numbered approximately as follows.\n\n\nImperial census of 1897\nAccording to returns published in 1905, based on the Russian Empire census of 1897, adherents of the different religious communities in the empire numbered approximately as follows.\n\n\nRussian Central Asia\nRussian Central Asia was also called Turkestan As of the 1897 census, Russian Central Asia's five oblasts contained 5,260,300 inhabitants, 13.9 percent of them urban The largest towns were Tashkent (156,400), Kokand (82,100), Namangan (61,900), and Samarkand (54,900) By 1911, 17 percent of Semireche's population and half of its urban residents were Russians, four-fifths of them agricultural colonists In the other four oblasts in the same year, Russians constituted only 4 percent of the population, and the overwhelming majority lived in European-style settlements alongside the native quarters in the major towns [175]\n\n\nMilitary\nThe armed forces of the Russian Empire consisted of the Imperial Russian Army and the Imperial Russian Navy The Emperor of Russia was the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and implemented out his military policies through the Ministry of War and the Ministry of the Navy, which were tasked with administering their respective branches There was no joint staff, but joint commissions were formed to work on specific tasks that involved both services [176] [177] The Main Staff of the War Ministry administered the Army's organization, training, and mobilization, as well as coordinating the different branches of the Army, while the General Staff was tasked with operational planning This structure developed in the 1860s after the Crimean War [178] The Navy Ministry had a similar structure, including a Main Staff tasked with administration and a Naval Technological Committee, and after the Russo-Japanese War a Naval General Staff was added for operational planning and war preparation [179] [180]\n\n\nSociety\nThe Russian Empire was predominantly a rural society spread over vast spaces In 1913, 80% of the people were peasants Soviet historiography proclaimed that the Russian Empire of the 19th century was characterized by systemic crisis, which impoverished the workers and peasants and culminated in the revolutions of the early 20th century Recent research by Russian scholars disputes this interpretation Mironov assesses the effects of the reforms of latter 19th-century, especially in terms of the 1861 emancipation of the serfs, agricultural output trends, various standard of living indicators, and taxation of peasants He argues that those reforms brought about measurable improvements in social welfare More generally, he finds that the well-being of the Russian people declined during most of the 18th century but increased slowly from the end of the 18th century to 1914 [200]\n\n\nEstates\nSubjects of the Russian Empire were segregated into sosloviyes, or social estates (classes) such as nobility (dvoryanstvo), clergy, merchants, cossacks, and peasants Native people of the Caucasus, non-ethnic Russian areas such as Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Siberia and Central Asia were officially registered as a category called inorodtsy ('non-Slavic', lit. 'people of another origin').\n\n\nSerfdom\nThe serfdom that had developed in Russia in the 16th century, and had become enshrined in law in 1649, was abolished in 1861 [201] [202]\n\n\nPeasants\nThe former serfs became peasants, joining the millions of farmers who already had peasant status [204] [202] Most peasants lived in tens of thousands of small villages under a highly patriarchal system Hundreds of thousands moved to cities to work in factories, but they typically retained their village connections [206]\n\n\nLandowners\nThe situation of the former serf-proprietors was also unsatisfactory Accustomed to the use of compulsory labor, they failed to adapt to the new conditions The millions of rubles of redemption money received from the crown was spent without any real or lasting agricultural improvements having been effected The forests were sold, and the only prosperous landlords were those who exacted rack-rents for the land allotted to peasants There was an increase of wealth among the few, but along with this a general impoverishment of the mass of the people Added to this, the peculiar institution of the mir—framed on the principle of community ownership and occupation of the land—the overall effect was not encouraging of individual effort.\n\n\nMedia\nCensorship was heavy-handed until the reign of Alexander II, but it never went away [209] Newspapers were strictly limited in what they could publish, and intellectuals favored literary magazines for their publishing outlets Fyodor Dostoyevsky, for example, ridiculed the St Petersburg newspapers, such as Golos and Peterburgskii Listok, accusing them of publishing trifles and distracting readers from the pressing social concerns of contemporary Russia through their obsession with spectacle and European popular culture [210]\n\n\nEducation\nEducational standards were very low in the Russian Empire, though they slowly increased in its last century of existence By 1800, the level of literacy among male peasants ranged from 1 to 12 percent and from 20 to 25 percent for urban men Literacy among women was very low Literacy rates were highest for the nobility (84 to 87 percent), followed by merchants (over 75 percent), and then the workers and peasants Serfs were the least literate In every group, women were far less literate than men By contrast, in Western Europe, urban men had about a 50 percent literacy rate The Orthodox hierarchy was suspicious of education, seeing no religious need for literacy whatsoever Peasants did not need to be literate, and those who did — such as artisans, businessmen, and professionals — were few in number As late as 1851, only 8% of Russians lived in cities [211]\n\n\nSee

His life and teachings have had a profound impact on the history of Christianity, and he remains one of the most revered figures in the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\n## Sources\n\nThere exist three major early biographies of Simeon, each with its own unique perspective and insights into the life of this remarkable saint. The first of these is by Theodoret, bishop of Cyrrhus, and is found within his work \"Religious History\". This biography was written during Simeon's lifetime, and Theodoret relates several events of which he claims to be an eyewitness. The second biography is anonymous and is written from the perspective of a disciple of Simeon. The third is a Syriac source, which dates to 473 AD, and is the longest of the three biographies.\n\n## Life\n\nSimeon was born in Sis, now the Turkish town of Kozan in Adana Province, in the Roman province of Cilicia. At the time, Cilicia was a major center of Christianity, and it is said that Simeon's parents were devout Christians. Simeon's early life is shrouded in mystery, but it is believed that he was raised in a devout Christian household and was deeply influenced by the teachings of the early Church Fathers.\n\n## Early Life\n\nAs a young man, Simeon became increasingly drawn to a life of asceticism and solitude. He was deeply troubled by the corruption and immorality of the world around him, and he saw the need for a more authentic and spiritual way of living. Simeon's parents, however, were opposed to his plans, and they tried to persuade him to marry and settle down. Nevertheless, Simeon remained resolute in his decision to devote his life to God, and he eventually abandoned his family and the comforts of the world.\n\n## Atop the Pillar\n\nIn order to get away from the ever-increasing number of people who came to him for prayers and advice, Simeon discovered a pillar which had survived among ruins in nearby Telanissa (modern-day Taladah in Syria). He formed a small platform at the top of the pillar and determined to live out his life there. For sustenance, small boys from the nearby village would climb up the pillar and pass him parcels of flat bread and goats' milk. Simeon may also have pulled up food in buckets via a pulley.\n\n## Fame and Final Years\n\nReports of Simeon's asceticism and spiritual wisdom soon reached the church hierarchy and the imperial court. The Emperor Theodosius II and his wife Aelia Eudocia greatly respected Simeon and listened to his counsels, while the Emperor Leo I paid respectful attention to a letter he sent in favor of the Council of Chalcedon. Simeon is also said to have corresponded with Genevieve of Paris.\n\n## Legacy\n\nSimeon's legacy is profound and far-reaching. He inspired many imitators, and for the next century, ascetics living on pillars, stylites, were a common sight throughout the Christian Levant. Simeon's teachings and example have had a lasting impact on the spiritual lives of countless individuals, and his influence can still be felt today.\n\n## Cultural References\n\nThe life of Simeon Stylites has inspired many cultural references, including an 1842 poem by Alfred Tennyson, \"St Simeon Stylites\". Modern works based upon the life of the saint include Luis Buñuel's 1965 film Simón del desierto, Hans Zender's 1986 opera Stephen Climax, and the 1998 film At Sachem Farm.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Asceticism in Christianity\n* Christian hermits\n* Eastern Orthodox Church\n* Pillar saints", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Simeon_Stylites\" following this outline:\n\n\nSources\nThere exist three major early biographies of Simeon The first of these is by Theodoret, bishop of Cyrrhus, and is found within his work Religious History This biography was written during Simeon's lifetime, and Theodoret relates several events of which he claims to be an eyewitness The narrator of a second biography names himself as Antonius, a disciple of Simeon's This work is of unknown date and provenance The third is a Syriac source, which dates to 473 This is the longest of the three, and the most effusive in its praise of Simeon; it places Simeon on a par with the Old Testament prophets, and portrays him as a founder of the Christian Church The three sources exhibit signs of independent development; although they each follow the same rough outline, they have hardly any narrative episodes in common [3]\n\n\nLife\nSimeon was the son of a shepherd [7] He was born in Sis, now the Turkish town of Kozan in Adana Province Sis was in the Roman province of Cilicia After the division of the Roman Empire in 395 A.D., Cilicia became part of the Eastern Roman Empire Christianity took hold quickly there.\n\n\nEarly life\nSimeon was the son of a shepherd [7] He was born in Sis, now the Turkish town of Kozan in Adana Province Sis was in the Roman province of Cilicia After the division of the Roman Empire in 395 A.D., Cilicia became part of the Eastern Roman Empire Christianity took hold quickly there.\n\n\nAtop the pillar\nIn order to get away from the ever-increasing number of people who came to him for prayers and advice, leaving him little if any time for his private austerities, Simeon discovered a pillar which had survived among ruins in nearby Telanissa (modern-day Taladah in Syria), [9] [10] and formed a small platform at the top He determined to live out his life on this platform For sustenance, small boys from the nearby village would climb up the pillar and pass him parcels of flat bread and goats' milk He may also have pulled up food in buckets via a pulley [citation needed]\n\n\nFame and final years\nReports of Simeon reached the church hierarchy and the imperial court The Emperor Theodosius II and his wife Aelia Eudocia greatly respected Simeon and listened to his counsels, while the Emperor Leo I paid respectful attention to a letter he sent in favour of the Council of Chalcedon Simeon is also said to have corresponded with Genevieve of Paris.\n\n\nLegacy\nSimeon inspired many imitators For the next century, ascetics living on pillars, stylites, were a common sight throughout the Christian Levant.\n\n\nCultural references\nThe life of Simeon Stylites inspired an 1842 poem by Alfred Tennyson, \"St Simeon Stylites\" [18] Modern works based upon the life of the saint include Luis Buñuel's 1965 film Simón del desierto, Hans Zender's 1986 opera Stephen Climax and the 1998 film At Sachem Farm.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Nuclear_weapon", "content": "\nTesting and deployment\nNuclear weapons have only twice been used in warfare, both times by the United States against Japan at the end of World War II On August 6, 1945, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed \"Little Boy\" over the Japanese city of Hiroshima; three days later, on August 9, the USAAF [3] detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed \"Fat Man\" over the Japanese city of Nagasaki These bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel [4] The ethics of these bombings and their role in Japan's surrender are to this day, still subjects of debate.\n\n\nTypes\nThere are two basic types of nuclear weapons: those that derive the majority of their energy from nuclear fission reactions alone, and those that use fission reactions to begin nuclear fusion reactions that produce a large amount of the total energy output [10]\n\n\nFission weapons\nAll existing nuclear weapons derive some of their explosive energy from nuclear fission reactions Weapons whose explosive output is exclusively from fission reactions are commonly referred to as atomic bombs or atom bombs (abbreviated as A-bombs) This has long been noted as something of a misnomer, as their energy comes from the nucleus of the atom, just as it does with fusion weapons.\n\n\nFusion weapons\nThe other basic type of nuclear weapon produces a large proportion of its energy in nuclear fusion reactions Such fusion weapons are generally referred to as thermonuclear weapons or more colloquially as hydrogen bombs (abbreviated as H-bombs), as they rely on fusion reactions between isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium and tritium) All such weapons derive a significant portion of their energy from fission reactions used to \"trigger\" fusion reactions, and fusion reactions can themselves trigger additional fission reactions [13]\n\n\nOther types\nThere are other types of nuclear weapons as well For example, a boosted fission weapon is a fission bomb that increases its explosive yield through a small number of fusion reactions, but it is not a fusion bomb In the boosted bomb, the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions serve primarily to increase the efficiency of the fission bomb There are two types of boosted fission bomb: internally boosted, in which a deuterium-tritium mixture is injected into the bomb core, and externally boosted, in which concentric shells of lithium-deuteride and depleted uranium are layered on the outside of the fission bomb core The external method of boosting enabled the USSR to field the first partially thermonuclear weapons, but it is now obsolete because it demands a spherical bomb geometry, which was adequate during the 1950s arms race when bomber aircraft were the only available delivery vehicles.\n\n\nTactical nuclear weapons\nSome nuclear weapons are designed for special purposes; most of these are for non-strategic (decisively war-winning) purposes and are referred to as tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n\nWeapons delivery\nThe system used to deliver a nuclear weapon to its target is an important factor affecting both nuclear weapon design and nuclear strategy The design, development, and maintenance of delivery systems are among the most expensive parts of a nuclear weapons program; they account, for example, for 57% of the financial resources spent by the United States on nuclear weapons projects since 1940 [28]\n\n\nNuclear strategy\nNuclear warfare strategy is a set of policies that deal with preventing or fighting a nuclear war The policy of trying to prevent an attack by a nuclear weapon from another country by threatening nuclear retaliation is known as the strategy of nuclear deterrence The goal in deterrence is to always maintain a second strike capability (the ability of a country to respond to a nuclear attack with one of its own) and potentially to strive for first strike status (the ability to destroy an enemy's nuclear forces before they could retaliate) During the Cold War, policy and military theorists considered the sorts of policies that might prevent a nuclear attack, and they developed game theory models that could lead to stable deterrence conditions [30]\n\n\nGovernance, control, and law\nBecause they are weapons of mass destruction, the proliferation and possible use of nuclear weapons are important issues in international relations and diplomacy In most countries, the use of nuclear force can only be authorized by the head of government or head of state [c] Despite controls and regulations governing nuclear weapons, there is an inherent danger of \"accidents, mistakes, false alarms, blackmail, theft, and sabotage\" [42]\n\n\nDisarmament\nNuclear disarmament refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-free world, in which nuclear weapons are eliminated.\n\n\nUnited Nations\nThe UN Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) is a department of the United Nations Secretariat established in January 1998 as part of the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan's plan to reform the UN as presented in his report to the General Assembly in July 1997 [64]\n\n\nControversy\nEven before the first nuclear weapons had been developed, scientists involved with the Manhattan Project were divided over the use of the weapon The role of the two atomic bombings of the country in Japan's surrender and the U.S.'s ethical justification for them has been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades The question of whether nations should have nuclear weapons, or test them, has been continually and nearly universally controversial [65]\n\n\nEthics\nEven before the first nuclear weapons had been developed, scientists involved with the Manhattan Project were divided over the use of the weapon The role of the two atomic bombings of the country in Japan's surrender and the U.S.'s ethical justification for them has been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades The question of whether nations should have nuclear weapons, or test them, has been continually and nearly universally controversial [65]\n\n\nNotable nuclear weapons accidents\nOver 500 atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were conducted at various sites around the world from 1945 to 1980 Radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when the Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb test at the Pacific Proving Grounds contaminated the crew and catch of the Japanese fishing boat Lucky Dragon [82] One of the fishermen died in Japan seven months later, and the fear of contaminated tuna led to a temporary boycotting of the popular staple in Japan The incident caused widespread concern around the world, especially regarding the effects of nuclear fallout and atmospheric nuclear testing, and \"provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of the anti-nuclear weapons movement in many countries\" [82]\n\n\nNuclear testing and fallout\nOver 500 atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were conducted at various sites around the world from 1945 to 1980 Radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when the Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb test at the Pacific Proving Grounds contaminated the crew and catch of the Japanese fishing boat Lucky Dragon [82] One of the fishermen died in Japan seven months later, and the fear of contaminated tuna led to a temporary boycotting of the popular staple in Japan The incident caused widespread concern around the world, especially regarding the effects of nuclear fallout and atmospheric nuclear testing, and \"provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of the anti-nuclear weapons movement in many countries\" [82]\n\n\nEffects of nuclear explosions\nSome scientists estimate that a nuclear war with 100 Hiroshima-size nuclear explosions on cities could cost the lives of tens of millions of people from long-term climatic effects alone The climatology hypothesis is that if each city firestorms, a great deal of soot could be thrown up into the atmosphere which could blanket the earth, cutting out sunlight for years on end, causing the disruption of food chains, in what is termed a nuclear winter [88] [89]\n\n\nEffects of nuclear explosions on human health\nSome scientists estimate that a nuclear war with 100 Hiroshima-size nuclear explosions on cities could cost the lives of tens of millions of people from long-term climatic effects alone The climatology hypothesis is that if each city firestorms, a great deal of soot could be thrown up into the atmosphere which could blanket the earth, cutting out sunlight for years on end, causing the disruption of food chains, in what is termed a nuclear winter [88] [89]\n\n\nEffects of nuclear war\nNuclear war could yield unprecedented human death tolls and habitat destruction Detonating large numbers of nuclear weapons would have an immediate, short term and long-term effects on the climate, potentially causing cold weather known as a \"nuclear winter\" [94] [95] In 1982, Brian Martin estimated that a US–Soviet nuclear exchange might kill 400–450 million directly, mostly in the United States, Europe and Russia, and maybe several hundred million more through follow-up consequences in those same areas [96] Many scholars have posited that a global thermonuclear war with Cold War-era stockpiles, or even with the current smaller stockpiles, may lead to the extinction of the human race [97] The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War believe that nuclear war could indirectly contribute to human extinction via secondary effects, including environmental consequences, societal breakdown, and economic collapse It has been estimated that a relatively small-scale nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan involving 100 Hiroshima yield (15 kilotons) weapons, could cause a nuclear winter and kill more than a billion people [98]\n\n\nPublic opposition\nPeace movements emerged in Japan and in 1954

destructive power from nuclear reactions, either fission or fusion. The term \"nuclear\" is derived from the Greek word \"nux,\" meaning \"kernel\" or \"seed,\" and the Latin word \"nucleus,\" meaning \"center.\" Nuclear weapons are also known as atomic bombs or thermonuclear weapons, depending on the type of reaction they employ.\n\n**Testing and Deployment**\n\nNuclear weapons have only twice been used in warfare, both times by the United States against Japan at the end of World War II. On August 6, 1945, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb nicknamed \"Little Boy\" over the Japanese city of Hiroshima; three days later, on August 9, the USAAF detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb nicknamed \"Fat Man\" over the Japanese city of Nagasaki. These bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel. The ethics of these bombings and their role in Japan's surrender are to this day, still subjects of debate.\n\n**Types**\n\nThere are two basic types of nuclear weapons: those that derive the majority of their energy from nuclear fission reactions alone, and those that use fission reactions to begin nuclear fusion reactions that produce a large amount of the total energy output.\n\n### Fission Weapons\n\nAll existing nuclear weapons derive some of their explosive energy from nuclear fission reactions. Weapons whose explosive output is exclusively from fission reactions are commonly referred to as atomic bombs or atom bombs (abbreviated as A-bombs). This has long been noted as something of a misnomer, as their energy comes from the nucleus of the atom, just as it does with fusion weapons.\n\n### Fusion Weapons\n\nThe other basic type of nuclear weapon produces a large proportion of its energy in nuclear fusion reactions. Such fusion weapons are generally referred to as thermonuclear weapons or more colloquially as hydrogen bombs (abbreviated as H-bombs), as they rely on fusion reactions between isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium and tritium). All such weapons derive a significant portion of their energy from fission reactions used to \"trigger\" fusion reactions, and fusion reactions can themselves trigger additional fission reactions.\n\n### Other Types\n\nThere are other types of nuclear weapons as well. For example, a boosted fission weapon is a fission bomb that increases its explosive yield through a small number of fusion reactions, but it is not a fusion bomb. In the boosted bomb, the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions serve primarily to increase the efficiency of the fission bomb. There are two types of boosted fission bomb: internally boosted, in which a deuterium-tritium mixture is injected into the bomb core, and externally boosted, in which concentric shells of lithium-deuteride and depleted uranium are layered on the outside of the fission bomb core.\n\n### Tactical Nuclear Weapons\n\nSome nuclear weapons are designed for special purposes; most of these are for non-strategic (decisively war-winning) purposes and are referred to as tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n**Weapons Delivery**\n\nThe system used to deliver a nuclear weapon to its target is an important factor affecting both nuclear weapon design and nuclear strategy. The design, development, and maintenance of delivery systems are among the most expensive parts of a nuclear weapons program; they account, for example, for 57% of the financial resources spent by the United States on nuclear weapons projects since 1940.\n\n**Nuclear Strategy**\n\nNuclear warfare strategy is a set of policies that deal with preventing or fighting a nuclear war. The policy of trying to prevent an attack by a nuclear weapon from another country by threatening nuclear retaliation is known as the strategy of nuclear deterrence. The goal in deterrence is to always maintain a second strike capability (the ability of a country to respond to a nuclear attack with one of its own) and potentially to strive for first strike status (the ability to destroy an enemy's nuclear forces before they could retaliate).\n\n**Governance, Control, and Law**\n\nBecause they are weapons of mass destruction, the proliferation and possible use of nuclear weapons are important issues in international relations and diplomacy. In most countries, the use of nuclear force can only be authorized by the head of government or head of state. Despite controls and regulations governing nuclear weapons, there is an inherent danger of \"accidents, mistakes, false alarms, blackmail, theft, and sabotage.\"\n\n**Disarmament**\n\nNuclear disarmament refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-free world, in which nuclear weapons are eliminated. The United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) is a department of the United Nations Secretariat established in January 1998 as part of the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan's plan to reform the UN as presented in his report to the General Assembly in July 1997.\n\n**Controversy**\n\nEven before the first nuclear weapons had been developed, scientists involved with the Manhattan Project were divided over the use of the weapon. The role of the two atomic bombings of the country in Japan's surrender and the U.S.'s ethical justification for them has been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades. The question of whether nations should have nuclear weapons, or test them, has been continually and nearly universally controversial.\n\n**Notable Nuclear Weapons Accidents**\n\nOver 500 atmospheric nuclear weapons tests were conducted at various sites around the world from 1945 to 1980. Radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when the Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb test at the Pacific Proving Grounds contaminated the crew and catch of the Japanese fishing boat Lucky Dragon. One of the fishermen died in Japan seven months later, and the fear of contaminated tuna led to a temporary boycotting of the popular staple in Japan.\n\n**Public Opposition**\n\nPeace movements emerged in Japan and in 1954 they converged to form a unified \"Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.\" Japanese opposition to nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific Ocean was widespread, and \"an estimated 35 million signatures were collected on petitions calling for bans on nuclear weapons.\"\n\n**Costs and Technology Spin-Offs**\n\nAccording to an audit by the Brookings Institution, between 1940 and 1996, the U.S spent $11.3 trillion in present-day terms on nuclear weapons programs; 57% of which was spent on building nuclear weapons delivery systems. 6.3% of the total, 709 billion in present-day terms, was spent on environmental remediation and nuclear waste management, for example cleaning up the Hanford site, and 7% of the total, 795 billion was spent on making nuclear weapons themselves.\n\n**Non-Weapons Uses**\n\nPeaceful nuclear explosions are nuclear explosions conducted for non-military purposes, such as activities related to economic development including the creation of canals.

blanket the earth, cutting out sunlight for years on end, causing the disruption of food chains, in what is termed a nuclear winter [88] [89]\n\n\nEffects of nuclear explosions on human health\nSome

nuclear weapons would have an immediate, short term and long-term effects on the climate, potentially causing cold weather known as a \"nuclear winter\" [94] [95] In 1982, Brian Martin estimated that a US–Soviet nuclear exchange might kill 400–450 million directly, mostly in the United States, Europe and Russia, and maybe several hundred million more through follow-up consequences in those same areas [96] Many scholars have posited that a global thermonuclear war with Cold War-era stockpiles, or even with the current smaller stockpiles, may lead to the extinction of the human race [97] The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War believe that nuclear war could indirectly contribute to human extinction via secondary effects, including environmental consequences, societal breakdown, and economic collapse It has been estimated that a relatively small-scale nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan involving 100 Hiroshima yield (15 kilotons) weapons, could cause a nuclear winter and kill more than a billion people [98]\n\n\nPublic opposition\nPeace movements emerged in Japan and in 1954 they converged to form a unified \"Japan Council against Atomic and

The agent predicts that the plane will land in Lahore, but it actually lands in Amritsar, leading to his dismissal. However, his supervisor points out that he is an expert on hijacking analysis and is motivated by personal experience.\n\nThe agent, along with his team, must take down the hijackers and prevent a catastrophic outcome.

{"title": "Central_Intelligence_Agency", "content": "\nPurpose\nWhen the CIA was created, its purpose was to create a clearinghouse for foreign policy intelligence and analysis, collecting, analyzing, evaluating, and disseminating foreign intelligence, and carrying out covert operations [19] [20]\n\n\nOrganizational structure\nThe CIA has an executive office and five major directorates:\n\n\nExecutive Office\nThe director of the Central Intelligence Agency (D/CIA) is appointed by the president with Senate confirmation and reports directly to the director of national intelligence (DNI); in practice, the CIA director interfaces with the director of national intelligence (DNI), Congress, and the White House, while the deputy director (DD/CIA) is the internal executive of the CIA and the chief operating officer (COO/CIA), known as executive director until 2017, leads the day-to-day work [21] as the third-highest post of the CIA [22] The deputy director is formally appointed by the director without Senate confirmation, [22] [23] but as the president's opinion plays a great role in the decision, [23] the deputy director is generally considered a political position, making the chief operating officer the most senior non-political position for CIA career officers [24]\n\n\nDirectorate of Analysis\nThe Directorate of Analysis, through much of its history known as the Directorate of Intelligence (DI), is tasked with helping \"the President and other policymakers make informed decisions about our country's national security\" by looking \"at all the available information on an issue and organiz [ing] it for policymakers\" [26] The directorate has four regional analytic groups, six groups for transnational issues, and three that focus on policy, collection, and staff support [27] There are regional analytical offices covering the Near East and South Asia, Russia, and Europe; and the Asia–Pacific, Latin America, and Africa.\n\n\nDirectorate of Operations\nThe Directorate of Operations is responsible for collecting foreign intelligence (mainly from clandestine HUMINT sources), and for covert action The name reflects its role as the coordinator of human intelligence activities between other elements of the wider U.S intelligence community with their HUMINT operations This directorate was created in an attempt to end years of rivalry over influence, philosophy, and budget between the United States Department of Defense (DOD) and the CIA In spite of this, the Department of Defense announced in 2012 its intention to organize its own global clandestine intelligence service, the Defense Clandestine Service (DCS), [28] under the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Contrary to some public and media misunderstanding, DCS is not a \"new\" intelligence agency but rather a consolidation, expansion and realignment of existing Defense HUMINT activities, which have been carried out by DIA for decades under various names, most recently as the Defense Human Intelligence Service [29]\n\n\nDirectorate of Science & Technology\nThe Directorate of Science & Technology was established to research, create, and manage technical collection disciplines and equipment Many of its innovations were transferred to other intelligence organizations, or, as they became more overt, to the military services.\n\n\nDirectorate of Support\nThe Directorate of Support has organizational and administrative functions to significant units including:\n\n\nDirectorate of Digital Innovation\nThe Directorate of Digital Innovation (DDI) focuses on accelerating innovation across the Agency's mission activities It is the Agency's newest directorate The Langley, Virginia-based office's mission is to streamline and integrate digital and cybersecurity capabilities into the CIA's espionage, counterintelligence, all-source analysis, open-source intelligence collection, and covert action operations [32] It provides operations personnel with tools and techniques to use in cyber operations It works with information technology infrastructure and practices cyber tradecraft [33] This means retrofitting the CIA for cyberwarfare DDI officers help accelerate the integration of innovative methods and tools to enhance the CIA's cyber and digital capabilities on a global scale and ultimately help safeguard the United States They also apply technical expertise to exploit clandestine and publicly available information (also known as open-source data) using specialized methodologies and digital tools to plan, initiate and support the technical and human-based operations of the CIA [34] Before the establishment of the new digital directorate, offensive cyber operations were undertaken by the CIA's Information Operations Center [35] Little is known about how the office specifically functions or if it deploys offensive cyber capabilities [32]\n\n\nOffice of Congressional Affairs\nThe Office of Congressional Affairs (OCA) serves as the liaison between the CIA and the US Congress The OCA states that it aims to ensures that Congress is fully and currently informed of intelligence activities [39]\n\n\nTraining\nThe CIA established its first training facility, the Office of Training and Education, in 1950 Following the end of the Cold War, the CIA's training budget was slashed, which had a negative effect on employee retention [41] [42]\n\n\nBudget\nDetails of the overall United States intelligence budget are classified [3] Under the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, the Director of Central Intelligence is the only federal government employee who can spend \"un-vouchered\" government money [49] The government showed its 1997 budget was $26.6 billion for the fiscal year [50] The government has disclosed a total figure for all non-military intelligence spending since 2007; the fiscal 2013 figure is $52.6 billion According to the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures, the CIA's fiscal 2013 budget is $14.7 billion, 28% of the total and almost 50% more than the budget of the National Security Agency CIA's HUMINT budget is $2.3 billion, the SIGINT budget is $1.7 billion, and spending for security and logistics of CIA missions is $2.5 billion \"Covert action programs,\" including a variety of activities such as the CIA's drone fleet and anti-Iranian nuclear program activities, accounts for $2.6 billion [3]\n\n\nRelationship with other intelligence agencies\nThe role and functions of the CIA are roughly equivalent to those of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) in Germany, MI6 in the United Kingdom, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) in Australia, the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE) in France, the Foreign Intelligence Service in Russia, the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in China, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in India, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in Pakistan, the General Intelligence Service in Egypt, Mossad in Israel, and the National Intelligence Service (NIS) in South Korea \n\n\nForeign intelligence services\nThe role and functions of the CIA are roughly equivalent to those of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) in Germany, MI6 in the United Kingdom, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) in Australia, the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE) in France, the Foreign Intelligence Service in Russia, the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in China, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in India, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in Pakistan, the General Intelligence Service in Egypt, Mossad in Israel, and the National Intelligence Service (NIS) in South Korea \n\n\nHistory\nThe success of the British Commandos during World War II prompted U.S President Franklin D Roosevelt to authorize the creation of an intelligence service modeled after the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), and Special Operations Executive This led to the creation of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) by a Presidential military order issued by President Roosevelt on June 13, 1942 The idea for a centralized intelligence organization was first proposed by General William J Donovan, who envisioned an intelligence service that could operate globally to counter communist threats and provide crucial intelligence directly to the President [59]\n\n\nImmediate predecessors\nThe success of the British Commandos during World War II prompted U.S President Franklin D Roosevelt to authorize the creation of an intelligence service modeled after the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), and Special Operations Executive This led to the creation of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) by a

intelligence service that could operate globally to counter communist threats and provide crucial intelligence directly to the President [59]\n\n\nCreation\nThe Central Intelligence Agency was created on July 26, 1947, when President Truman signed the National Security Act into law A major impetus for the creation of the agency was growing tensions with the USSR following the end of World War II [69]\n\n\nKorean War\nAt the beginning of the Korean War, CIA officer Hans Tofte claimed to have turned a thousand North Korean expatriates into a guerrilla force tasked with infiltration, guerrilla warfare, and pilot rescue [90] In 1952 the CIA sent 1,500 more expatriate agents north Seoul station chief Albert Haney would openly celebrate the capabilities of those agents and the information they sent [90] In September 1952 Haney was replaced by John Limond Hart, a Europe veteran with a vivid memory for bitter experiences of misinformation [90] Hart was suspicious of the parade of successes reported by Tofte and Haney and launched an investigation which determined that the entirety of the information supplied by the Korean sources was false or misleading [91] After the war, internal reviews by the CIA would corroborate Hart's findings The CIA's station in Seoul had 200 officers, but not a single speaker of Korean [91] Hart reported to Washington that Seoul station was hopeless, and could not be salvaged Loftus Becker, deputy director of intelligence, was sent personally to tell Hart that the CIA had to keep the station open to save face Becker returned to Washington, D.C., pronouncing the situation to be \"hopeless,\" and that, after touring the CIA's Far East operations, the CIA's ability to gather intelligence in the far east was \"almost negligible\" [91] He then resigned Air Force Colonel James Kallis stated that CIA director Allen Dulles continued to praise the CIA's Korean force, despite knowing that they were under enemy control [92] When China entered the war in 1950, the CIA attempted a number of subversive operations in the country, all of which failed due to the presence of double agents Millions of dollars were spent in these efforts [93] These included a team of young CIA officers airdropped into China who were ambushed, and CIA funds being used to set up a global heroin empire in Burma's Golden Triangle following a betrayal by another double agent [93]\n\n\n1953 Iranian coup d'état\nIn 1951, Mohammad Mosaddegh, a member of the National Front, was elected Iranian prime-minister [94] As prime minister, he nationalized the Anglo-Persian Oil Company which his predecessor had supported The nationalization of the British-funded Iranian oil industry, including the largest oil refinery in the world, was disastrous for Mosaddegh A British naval embargo closed the British oil facilities, which Iran had no skilled workers to operate In 1952, Mosaddegh resisted the royal refusal to approve his Minister of War and resigned in protest The National Front took to the streets in protest Fearing a loss of control, the military pulled its troops back five days later, and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi gave in to Mosaddegh's demands Mosaddegh quickly replaced military leaders loyal to the Shah with those loyal to him, giving him personal control over the military Given six months of emergency powers, Mosaddegh unilaterally passed legislation When that six months expired, his powers were extended for another year In 1953, Mossadegh dismissed parliament and assumed dictatorial powers This power grab triggered the Shah to exercise his constitutional right to dismiss Mosaddegh Mosaddegh launched a military coup, and the Shah fled the country.\n\n\n1954 Guatemalan coup d'état\nThe return of the Shah to power, and the impression, cultivated by Allen Dulles, that an effective CIA had been able to guide that nation to friendly and stable relations with the West triggered planning for Operation PBSuccess, a plan to overthrow Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz [100] The plan was exposed in major newspapers before it happened after a CIA agent left plans for the coup in his Guatemala City hotel room [101]\n\n\nSyria\nIn 1949, Colonel Adib Shishakli rose to power in Syria in a CIA-backed coup Four years later, he would be overthrown by the military, Ba'athists, and communists The CIA and MI6 started funding right-wing members of the military but suffered a huge setback in the aftermath of the Suez Crisis CIA Agent Rocky Stone, who had played a minor role in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état, was working at the Damascus embassy as a diplomat but was the station chief Syrian officers on the CIA dole quickly appeared on television stating that they had received money from \"corrupt and sinister Americans\" \"in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of Syria.\" [113] Syrian forces surrounded the embassy and rousted Agent Stone, who confessed and subsequently made history as the first American diplomat expelled from an Arab nation This strengthened ties between Syria and Egypt, helping establish the United Arab Republic, and poisoning the well for the US for the foreseeable future [113]\n\n\nIndonesia\nThe charismatic leader of Indonesia was President Sukarno His declaration of neutrality in the Cold War put the suspicions of the CIA on him After Sukarno hosted Bandung Conference, promoting the Non-Aligned Movement, the Eisenhower White House responded with NSC 5518 authorizing \"all feasible covert means\" to move Indonesia into the Western sphere [114]\n\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\nIn the election of Patrice Lumumba as prime minister, and his acceptance of Soviet support during the Congo Crisis, the CIA saw another possible Cuba This view swayed the White House Eisenhower ordered that Lumumba be \"eliminated.\" In September 1960, President Joseph Kasa-Vubu ordered the dismissal of Lumumba and his cabinet The CIA delivered a quarter of a million dollars to Joseph Mobutu in October, their favored Congolese political figure Lumumba was imprisoned by Mobutu in December and then handed over to Katangan authorities who, with the aid of Belgium, executed him by firing squad in January 1961 [122]\n\n\n1960 U-2 incident\nAfter the bomber gap came the missile gap Eisenhower wanted to use the U-2 to disprove the Missile Gap, but he had banned U-2 overflights of the USSR after meeting Secretary Khrushchev at Camp David Another reason the President objected to the use of the U-2 was that, in the nuclear age, the intelligence he needed most was on their intentions, without which, the US would face a paralysis of intelligence He was particularly worried that U-2 flights could be seen as preparations for first-strike attacks He had high hopes for an upcoming meeting with Khrushchev in Paris Eisenhower finally gave in to CIA pressure to authorize a 16-day window for flights, which was extended an additional six days because of poor weather On May 1, 1960, the Soviet Air Forces shot down a U-2 flying over Soviet territory To Eisenhower, the ensuing coverup destroyed his perceived honesty and his hope of leaving a legacy of thawing relations with Khrushchev Eisenhower later said that the U-2 coverup was the greatest regret of his presidency [123]: 160 \n\n\nDominican Republic\nIn the Dominican Republic, the human rights abuses of Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo lasted more than three decades before the United States severed diplomatic relations with the nation in August 1960 The CIA's Special Group armed Dominicans to assassinate Trujillo, but Kennedy paused the plan when he became president Kennedy allowed the distribution of four additional machine guns, and Trujillo died from gunshot wounds two weeks later, on May 30, 1961 In the aftermath, Robert Kennedy wrote that the CIA had succeeded where it had failed many times in the past, but in the face of that success, it was caught flatfooted, having failed to plan what to do next [124]\n\n\nBay of Pigs\nThe CIA welcomed Fidel Castro on his visit to Washington, D.C., and gave him a face-to-face briefing The CIA hoped that Castro would bring about a friendly democratic government and planned to support his government with money and guns By December 11, 1959, however, a memo reached the DCI's desk recommending Castro's \"elimination.\" Dulles replaced the word \"elimination\" with \"removal,\" and set the scheme into action By mid-August 1960, Dick Bissell sought, with the full backing of the CIA, to hire the Mafia to assassinate Castro [126]\n\n\nCuba: Terrorism and sabotage\nAfter the failure of the attempted invasion at the Bay of Pigs, the CIA proposed a program of sabotage and terrorist attacks against civilian and military targets in Cuba, with the stated intent to bring down the Cuban administration and institute a new government It was authorized by President Kennedy in November 1961 [127] [128] [129] [130] The operation saw the CIA engage in an extensive campaign of terrorist attacks against civilians and economic targets, killing significant numbers of civilians, and carry out covert operations against the Cuban government [128] [131] [132] [133]\n\n\nCold War operations\nThe CIA was involved in anti-Communist activities in Burma, Guatemala, Laos, and the Democratic Republic [142] Operations in Laos continued well into the 1970s [143]\n\n\nBrazil\nThe CIA and the United States government were involved in the 1964 Brazilian coup d'état The coup occurred from March 31 to April 1, which resulted in the Brazilian Armed Forces ousting President João Goulart The United States saw Goulart as a left-wing threat in Latin America Secret cables written by the US Ambassador to Brazil, Lincoln Gordon, confirmed that the CIA was involved in covert action in Brazil The CIA encouraged \"pro-democracy street rallies\" in Brazil, for instance, to create dissent against Goulart [146]\n\n\nIndochina, Tibet, and the Vietnam War (1954–1975)\nThe OSS Patti mission arrived in Vietnam near the end of World War II and had significant interaction with the leaders of many Vietnamese factions, including Ho Chi Minh [147]\n\n\nJohnson\nIn the face of the failure of Project Tiger, the Pentagon wanted CIA paramilitary forces to participate in their Op Plan 64A This resulted in the CIA's foreign paramilitaries being put under the command of the DOD, a move seen as a slippery slope inside the CIA, a slide from covert action towards militarization [151]\n\n\nNixon\nIn 1971, the NSA and CIA were engaged in domestic spying; the DOD was eavesdropping on Henry Kissinger The White House and Camp David were wired for sound Nixon and Kissinger were eavesdropping on their aides, as well as reporters Famously, Nixon's Plumbers had in their number many former CIA officers, including Howard Hunt, Jim McCord, and Eugenio Martinez On July 7, 1971, John Ehrlichman, Nixon's domestic policy chief, told DCI Cushman, Nixon's hatchet-man in the CIA, to let Cushman \"know that  [Hunt] was, in fact, doing some things for the President.. you should consider he has pretty much carte blanche\" [154]\n\n\nCongressional investigations\nActing Attorney General Laurence Silberman learned of the existence of the Family Jewels and issued a subpoena for them, prompting eight congressional investigations on the domestic spying activities of the CIA Bill Colby's short tenure as DCI would end with the Halloween Massacre His replacement was George H W Bush At the time, the DOD had control of 80% of the intelligence budget [161] Communication and coordination between the CIA and the DOD would suffer greatly under Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld The CIA's budget for hiring clandestine officers had been squeezed out by the paramilitary operations in Southeast Asia, and the government's poor popularity further strained hiring This left the agency bloated with middle management, and anemic in younger officers With employee training taking five years, the agency's only hope would be on the trickle of new officers coming to fruition years in the future The CIA would see another setback as communists would take Angola William J Casey, a member of Ford's Intelligence Advisory Board, obtained Bush's approval to allow a team from outside the CIA to produce Soviet military estimates as a \"Team B\" The \"B\" team was composed of hawks Their estimates were the highest that could be justified, and they painted a picture of a growing Soviet military when the Soviet military was indeed shrinking Many of their reports found their way to the press \n\n\nChad\nChad's neighbor Libya was a major source of weaponry to communist rebel forces The CIA seized the opportunity to arm and finance Chad's Prime Minister, Hissène Habré, after he created a breakaway government in western Sudan, [162] even giving him Stinger missiles [163]\n\n\nAfghanistan\nIn Afghanistan, the CIA funneled several billion dollars' worth of weapons, [164] including FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missiles, [165] to Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)—which funneled them to tens of thousands of Afghan mujahideen resistance fighters in order to fight the Soviets and the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan War [166] [167] [168] In total, the CIA sent approximately 2,300 Stingers to Afghanistan, creating a substantial black market for the weapons throughout the Middle East, Central Asia, and even parts of Africa that persisted well into the 1990s Perhaps 100 Stingers were acquired by Iran The CIA later operated a program to recover the Stingers through cash buybacks [169]\n\n\nNicaragua\nUnder President Jimmy Carter, the CIA was conducting covertly funded support for the Contras in their war against the Sandinistas In March 1981, Reagan told Congress that the CIA would protect El Salvador by preventing the Sandinistas from shipping arms to communist rebels in El Salvador The CIA also began arming and training the Contras in Honduras in hopes that they could depose the Sandinistas in Nicaragua [170] DCI William J Casey formed the Central American Task Force, staffed with yes men from Covert Action [170]\n\n\nLebanon\nThe CIA's prime source in Lebanon was Bashir Gemayel, a member of the Christian Maronite sect The uprising against the Maronite minority blindsided the CIA Israel invaded Lebanon, and, along with the CIA, propped up Gemayel This secured Gemayel's assurance that Americans would be protected in Lebanon Thirteen days later he was assassinated Imad Mughniyah, a Hezbollah assassin, targeted Americans in retaliation for the Israeli invasion, the Sabra and Shatila massacre, and the US Marines of the Multi-National Force for their role in opposing the PLO in Lebanon On April 18, 1983, a 2,000 lb car bomb exploded in the lobby of the American embassy in Beirut, killing 63 people, including 17 Americans and 7 CIA officers, including Robert Ames, one of the CIA's Middle East experts America's fortunes in Lebanon suffered more as America's poorly directed retaliation for the bombing was interpreted by many as support for the Maronite minority On October 23, 1983, two bombs (1983 Beirut Bombing) were set off in Beirut, including a 10-ton bomb at a US military barracks that killed 242 people.\n\n\nPakistan\nIt has been alleged by such authors as Ahmed Rashid that the CIA and ISI have been waging a clandestine war \n\n\nIndia–Pakistan geopolitical tensions\nOn May 11, 1998, CIA Director George Tenet and his agency were taken aback by India's second nuclear test The test prompted concerns from its nuclear-capable adversary, Pakistan, and, \"remade the balance of power in the world.\" The nuclear test was New Delhi's calculated response to Pakistan previously testing new missiles in its expanding arsenal This series of events subsequently revealed the CIA's \"failure of espionage, a failure to read photographs, a failure to comprehend reports, a failure to think, and a failure to see.\" [172]\n\n\nPoland, 1980–1989\nUnlike the Carter administration, the Reagan administration supported the Solidarity movement in Poland, and – based on CIA intelligence – waged a public relations campaign to deter what the Carter administration felt was \"an imminent move by large Soviet military forces into Poland.\" Colonel Ryszard Kukliński, a senior officer on the Polish General Staff, was secretly sending reports to the CIA [173]\n\n\nOperation Gladio\nDuring the Cold War, the CIA and NATO were involved in Operation Gladio [182] [183] As part of Operation Gladio, the CIA supported the Italian government, and allegedly supported neo-fascist organizations [184] [185] [186] such as National Vanguard, New Order and the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari during the Years of Lead in Italy.\n\n\nOperation Desert Storm\nDuring the Iran–Iraq War, the CIA had backed both sides The CIA had maintained a network of spies in Iran, but in 1989 a CIA mistake compromised every agent they had in there, and the CIA had no agents in Iraq In the weeks before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the CIA downplayed the military buildup During the war, CIA estimates of Iraqi abilities and intentions flip-flopped and were rarely accurate In one particular case, the DOD had asked the CIA to identify military targets to bomb One target the CIA identified was an underground shelter The CIA did not know that it was a civilian bomb shelter In a rare instance, the CIA correctly determined that the coalition forces efforts were coming up short in their efforts to destroy SCUD missiles Congress took away the CIA's role in interpreting spy-satellite photos, putting the CIA's satellite intelligence operations under the auspices of the military The CIA created its office of military affairs, which operated as \"second-echelon support for the Pentagon . answering .. questions from military men  [like] 'how wide is this road?'\" [189]\n\n\nFall of the Soviet Union\nMikhail Gorbachev's announcement of the unilateral reduction of 500,000 Soviet troops took the CIA by surprise Moreover, Doug MacEachin, the CIA's Chief of Soviet analysis, said that even if the CIA had told the President, the NSC, and Congress about the cuts beforehand, it would have been ignored \"We never would have been able to publish it.\" [190] All the CIA numbers on the Soviet Union's economy were wrong Too often the CIA relied on inexperienced people supposedly deemed experts Bob Gates had preceded Doug MacEachin as Chief of Soviet analysis, and he had never visited the Soviet Union Few officers, even those stationed in the country, spoke the language of the people on whom they spied And the CIA could not send agents to respond to developing situations The CIA analysis of Russia during the Cold War was either driven by ideology, or by politics William J Crowe, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, noted that the CIA \"talked about the Soviet Union as if they weren't reading the newspapers, much less developed clandestine intelligence.\" [191]\n\n\nClinton\nOn January 25, 1993, Mir Qazi opened fire at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, killing two officers and wounding three others On February 26, Al-Qaeda terrorists led by Ramzi Yousef bombed the parking garage below the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, killing six people and injuring 1,402 others.\n\n\nAldrich Ames\nBetween 1985 and 1986, the CIA lost every spy it had in Eastern Europe The details of the investigation into the cause were obscured from the new Director, and the investigation had little success and has been widely criticized On February 21, 1994, FBI agents pulled Aldrich Ames out of his Jaguar [199] In the investigation that ensued, the CIA discovered that many of the sources for its most important analyses of the USSR were based on Soviet disinformation fed to the CIA by controlled agents On top of that, it was discovered that, in some cases, the CIA suspected at the time that the sources were compromised, but the information was sent up the chain as genuine [200] [201]\n\n\nOsama bin Laden\nAgency files show that it is believed Osama bin Laden was funding the Afghan rebels against the USSR in the 1980s [202] In 1991, bin Laden returned to his native Saudi Arabia protesting the presence of troops, and Operation Desert Storm He was expelled from the country In 1996, the CIA created a team to hunt bin Laden They were trading information with the Sudanese until, on the word of a source that would later be found to be a fabricator, the CIA closed its Sudan station later that year In 1998, bin Laden would declare war on America, and, on August 7, strike in Tanzania and Nairobi On October 12, 2000, Al Qaeda bombed the USS Cole In the first days of George W Bush's presidency, Al Qaeda threats were ubiquitous in daily presidential CIA briefings, but it may have become a case of false alarm The agency's predictions were dire but carried little weight, and the focus of the president and his defense staff were elsewhere The CIA arranged the arrests of suspected Al Qaeda members through cooperation with foreign agencies, but the CIA could not definitively say what effect these arrests have had, and it could not gain hard intelligence from those captured The President had asked the CIA if Al Qaeda could plan attacks in the US On August 6, Bush received a daily briefing with the headline, not based on current, solid intelligence, \"Al Qaeda determined to strike inside the US.\" The US had been hunting bin Laden since 1996 and had had several opportunities, but neither Clinton, nor Bush had wanted to risk taking an active role in a murky assassination plot, and the perfect opportunity had never materialized for a DCI that would have given him the reassurances he needed to take the plunge That day, Richard A Clarke sent National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice warning of the risks, and decrying the inaction of the CIA [203]\n\n\nAl-Qaeda and the Global War on Terrorism\nIn January 1996, the CIA created an experimental \"virtual station,\" the Bin Laden Issue Station, under the Counterterrorist Center, to track bin Laden's developing activities Al-Fadl, who defected to the CIA in spring 1996, began to provide the Station with a new image of the Al Qaeda leader: he was not only a terrorist financier but a terrorist organizer as well FBI Special Agent Dan Coleman (who together with his partner Jack Cloonan had been \"seconded\" to the bin Laden Station) called him Qaeda's \"Rosetta Stone\" [204]\n\n\nSeptember 11 attacks and its aftermath\nOn September 11, 2001, 19 Al-Qaeda members hijacked four passenger jets within the Northeastern United States in a series of coordinated terrorist attacks Two planes crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, the third into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, and the fourth inadvertently into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania The attacks cost the lives of 2,996 people (including the 19 hijackers), caused the destruction of the Twin Towers, and damaged the western side of the Pentagon Soon after 9/11, The New York Times released a story stating that the CIA's New York field office was destroyed in the wake of the attacks According to unnamed CIA sources, while first responders, military personnel and volunteers were conducting rescue efforts at the World Trade Center site, a special CIA team was searching the rubble for both digital and paper copies of classified documents This was done according to well-rehearsed document recovery procedures put in place after the Iranian takeover of the United States Embassy in Tehran in 1979 \n\n\nFailures in intelligence analysis\nA major criticism is a failure to forestall the September 11 attacks The 9/11 Commission Report identified failures in the IC as a whole One problem, for example, was the FBI failing to \"connect the dots\" by sharing information among its decentralized field offices.\n\n\nAbuses of CIA authority, 1970s–1990s\nConditions worsened in the mid-1970s, around the time of Watergate A dominant feature of political life during that period were the attempts of Congress to assert oversight of the U.S presidency and the executive branch of the U.S government Revelations about past CIA activities, such as assassinations and attempted assassinations of foreign leaders (most notably Fidel Castro and Rafael Trujillo) and illegal domestic spying on U.S citizens, provided the opportunities to increase Congressional oversight of U.S intelligence operations [159] CIA involvement in Contra cocaine trafficking in Nicaragua [219] [220] and complicity in the actions of the death squads in El Salvador and Honduras also came to light [221] [222]\n\n\nYugoslav wars\nIn 1989; Yugoslavia officially dissolved into six republics, with borders drawn along ethnic and historical lines: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia This quickly dissolved into ethnic tensions between Serbs and other Balkan ethnicities In 1991, the CIA predicted that tension in the region would evolve into a full blown Civil war [226] In 1992, the U.S embargoed the trafficking of weapons into both Bosnia and Serbia in order to not prolong the war and the destruction of impacted communities In May 1994, the CIA reported that the embargo had been ignored by countries such as Malaysia and Iran who moved weapons into Bosnia [227]\n\n\nIraq War\nSeventy-two days after the 9/11 attacks, President Bush told Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to update the US plan for an invasion of Iraq, but not to tell anyone Rumsfeld asked Bush if he could bring DCI Tenet into the loop, to which Bush agreed [228]\n\n\n2004, DNI takes over CIA top-level functions\nThe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 created the office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), who took over some of the government and intelligence community (IC)-wide functions that had previously been the CIA's The DNI manages the United States Intelligence Community and in so doing it manages the intelligence cycle Among the functions that moved to the DNI were the preparation of estimates reflecting the consolidated opinion of the 16 IC agencies, and preparation of briefings for the president On July 30, 2008, President Bush issued Executive Order 13470 [235] amending Executive Order 12333 to strengthen the role of the DNI [236]\n\n\nOperation Neptune Spear\nOn May 1, 2011, President Barack Obama announced that Osama bin Laden was killed earlier that day by \"a small team of Americans\" operating in Abbottabad, Pakistan, during a CIA operation [237] [238] The raid was executed from a CIA forward base in Afghanistan by elements of the U.S Navy's Naval Special Warfare Development Group and CIA paramilitary operatives [239]\n\n\nSyrian Civil War\nUnder the aegis of operation Timber Sycamore and other clandestine activities, CIA operatives and U.S special operations troops have trained and armed nearly 10,000 rebel fighters at a cost of $1 billion a year [249] The CIA has been sending weapons to anti-government rebels in Syria since at least 2012 [250] These weapons have been reportedly falling into hands of extremists, such as al-Nusra Front and ISIL [251] [252] [253] Around February 2017, the CIA was instructed to halt military aid to Syrian rebels (Free Syrian Army or FSA), which also included training, ammunition, guided missiles, and salaries Sources state that the hold on aid was not related to the transitions from Obama's administration to Trump's, but rather due to issues faced by the FSA Based on responses by rebel officials, they believe that the aid freeze is related to concerns that weapons and funds will fall into the hands of ISIL Based on information obtained by Reuters, five FSA groups have confirmed that they received funding and military support from a source called \"MOM operations room.\" [clarification needed] On April 6, 2017, Al-Jazeera reported that funding to the FSA was partially restored Based on the information provided by two FSA sources, the new military operation room will receive its funds from the coalition \"Friends of Syria.\" The coalition consists of members from the U.S., Turkey, Western Europe, and Gulf states, which previously supported the military operation known as MOM [254]\n\n\nReorganization\nOn March 6, 2015, the office of the D/CIA issued an unclassified edition of a statement by the director, titled \"Our Agency's Blueprint for the Future\", as a press release for public consumption The press release announced sweeping plans for the reorganization and reform of the CIA, which the director believes will bring the CIA more in line with the agency doctrine called the 'Strategic Direction.' Among the key changes disclosed include the establishment of a new directorate, the Directorate of Digital Innovation, which is responsible for designing and crafting the digital technology to be used by the agency, to keep the CIA always ahead of its enemies The Directorate of Digital Innovation will also train CIA staff in the use of this technology, to prepare the CIA for the future, and it will also use the technological revolution to deal with cyber-terrorism and other perceived threats The new directorate will be the chief cyber-espionage arm of the agency going forward [256]\n\n\nDrones\nA new policy introduced by President Barack Obama removed the authority of the CIA to launch drone attacks and allowed these attacks only under Department of Defense command This change was reversed by President Donald Trump, who authorized CIA drone strikes on suspected terrorists [257]\n\n\nEncryption devices sold through front company\nFor decades until 2018, the CIA secretly owned Crypto AG, a small Swiss company that made encryption devices, in association with West German intelligence The company sold compromised encryption devices to over 120 countries, allowing Western intelligence to eavesdrop on communications that the users believed to be secure [258] [259]\n\n\nOpen-source intelligence\nUntil the 2004 reorganization of the intelligence community, one of the \"services of common concern\" that the CIA provided was open-source intelligence from the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) [260] FBIS, which had absorbed the Joint Publication Research Service, a military organization that translated documents, [261] moved into the National Open Source Enterprise under the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n\nOutsourcing and privatization\nMany of the duties and functions of Intelligence Community activities, not the CIA alone, are being outsourced and privatized Mike McConnell, former Director of National Intelligence, was about to publicize an investigation report of outsourcing by U.S intelligence agencies, as required by Congress [267] However, this report was then classified [268] [269] Hillhouse speculates that this report includes requirements for the CIA to report: [268] [270]\n\n\nControversies\nThroughout its history, the CIA has been the subject of numerous controversies, both at home and abroad The agency ran an operation code-named \"Chaos\" that ran from 1967 to 1974 where they routinely performed surveillance on Americans who were a part of various peace groups protesting the Vietnam War The operation was authorized by order of President Lyndon B Johnson in October 1967 as the CIA gathered the information of 300,000 American people and organizations and extensive files on 7,200 citizens The program was exposed by the Church Committee in 1975 as a part of the investigation into the Watergate scandal [218] [276]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Central Intelligence Agency**\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating foreign intelligence to support the national security of the United States. The CIA is one of the main components of the United States Intelligence Community (IC) and plays a key role in the country's foreign policy and national security.\n\n**Purpose**\n\nThe CIA was created in 1947 with the signing of the National Security Act, which aimed to unify the country's intelligence efforts and provide a centralized intelligence organization. The CIA's primary purpose is to collect and analyze foreign intelligence, including human intelligence (HUMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), and open-source intelligence (OSINT). The agency's intelligence is used to support the President, the National Security Council, and other government agencies in making informed decisions about national security and foreign policy.\n\n**Organizational Structure**\n\nThe CIA has an executive office and five major directorates:\n\n**Executive Office**\n\nThe Executive Office is headed by the Director of Central Intelligence (D/CIA), who is appointed by the President with Senate confirmation. The D/CIA reports directly to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and is responsible for overseeing the entire CIA organization. The Deputy Director (DD/CIA) is the internal executive of the CIA and is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the agency.\n\n**Directorate of Analysis**\n\nThe Directorate of Analysis, formerly known as the Directorate of Intelligence (DI), is responsible for analyzing and evaluating foreign intelligence to provide policymakers with informed decisions. The directorate has four regional analytic groups, six groups for transnational issues, and three that focus on policy, collection, and staff support.\n\n**Directorate of Operations**\n\nThe Directorate of Operations is responsible for collecting foreign intelligence through HUMINT sources and conducting covert operations. The directorate was created to end the rivalry between the CIA and the Department of Defense (DOD) over influence, philosophy, and budget.\n\n**Directorate of Science & Technology**\n\nThe Directorate of Science & Technology was established to research, create, and manage technical collection disciplines and equipment. The directorate's innovations were transferred to other intelligence organizations or, as they became more overt, to the military services.\n\n**Directorate of Support**\n\nThe Directorate of Support has organizational and administrative functions, including human resources, finance, and logistics. The directorate also oversees the CIA's headquarters and provides support to other CIA directorates.\n\n**Directorate of Digital Innovation**\n\nThe Directorate of Digital Innovation (DDI) was established in 2015 to design and craft digital technology for the CIA. The directorate is responsible for keeping the CIA ahead of its enemies and training CIA staff in the use of digital technology.\n\n**Office of Congressional Affairs**\n\nThe Office of Congressional Affairs serves as the liaison between the CIA and the US Congress. The office aims to ensure that Congress is fully and currently informed of intelligence activities.\n\n**Training**\n\nThe CIA established its first training facility, the Office of Training and Education, in 1950. The agency's training budget was slashed after the end of the Cold War, which had a negative effect on employee retention.\n\n**Budget**\n\nThe details of the overall United States intelligence budget are classified. Under the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, the Director of Central Intelligence is the only federal government employee who can spend \"un-vouchered\" government money.

created, its purpose was to create a clearinghouse for foreign policy intelligence and analysis, collecting, analyzing, evaluating, and disseminating foreign intelligence, and carrying out covert operations [19] [20]\n\n\nOrganizational structure\nThe CIA has an executive office and five major directorates:\n\n\nExecutive Office\nThe director of the Central Intelligence Agency (D/CIA) is appointed by the president with Senate confirmation and reports directly to the director of national intelligence (DNI); in practice, the CIA director interfaces with the director of national intelligence (DNI), Congress, and the White House, while the deputy director (DD/CIA) is the internal executive of the CIA and the chief operating officer (COO/CIA), known as executive director until 2017, leads the day-to-day work [21] as the third-highest post of the CIA [22] The deputy director is formally appointed by the director without Senate confirmation, [22] [23] but as the president's opinion plays a great role in the decision, [23] the deputy director is generally considered a political position, making the chief operating officer the most senior non-political position for CIA career officers [24]\n\n\nDirectorate of Analysis\nThe Directorate of Analysis, through much of its history known as the Directorate of Intelligence (DI), is tasked with helping \"the President and other policymakers make informed decisions about our country's national security\" by looking \"at all the available information on an issue and organiz [ing] it for policymakers\" [26] The directorate has four regional analytic groups, six groups for transnational issues, and three that focus on policy, collection, and staff support [27] There are regional analytical offices covering the Near East and South Asia, Russia, and Europe; and the Asia–Pacific, Latin America, and Africa.\n\n\nDirectorate of Operations\nThe Directorate of Operations is responsible for collecting foreign intelligence (mainly from clandestine HUMINT sources), and for covert action The name reflects its role as the coordinator of human intelligence activities between other elements of the wider U.S intelligence community with their HUMINT operations This directorate was created in an attempt to end years of rivalry over influence, philosophy, and budget between the United States Department of Defense (DOD) and the CIA In spite of this, the Department of Defense announced in 2012 its intention to organize its own global clandestine intelligence service, the Defense Clandestine Service (DCS), [28] under the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Contrary to some public and media misunderstanding, DCS is not a \"new\" intelligence agency but rather a consolidation, expansion and realignment of existing Defense HUMINT activities, which have been carried out by DIA for decades under various names, most recently as the Defense Human Intelligence Service [29]\n\n\nDirectorate of Science & Technology\nThe Directorate of Science & Technology was established to research, create, and manage technical collection disciplines and equipment Many of its innovations were transferred to other intelligence organizations, or, as they became more overt, to the military services.\n\n\nDirectorate of Support\nThe Directorate of Support has organizational and administrative functions to significant units including:\n\n\nDirectorate of Digital Innovation\nThe Directorate of Digital Innovation (DDI) focuses on accelerating innovation across the Agency's mission activities It is the Agency's newest directorate The Langley, Virginia-based office's mission is to streamline and integrate digital and cybersecurity capabilities into the CIA's espionage, counterintelligence, all-source analysis, open-source intelligence collection, and covert action operations [32] It provides operations personnel with tools and techniques to use in cyber operations It works with information technology infrastructure and practices cyber tradecraft [33] This means retrofitting the CIA for cyberwarfare DDI officers help accelerate the integration of innovative methods and tools to enhance the CIA's cyber and digital capabilities on a global scale and ultimately help safeguard the United States They also apply technical expertise to exploit clandestine and publicly available information (also known as open-source data) using specialized methodologies and digital tools to plan, initiate and support the technical and human-based operations of the CIA [34] Before the establishment of the new digital directorate, offensive cyber operations were undertaken by the CIA's Information Operations Center [35] Little is known about how the office specifically functions or if it deploys offensive cyber capabilities [32]\n\n\nOffice of Congressional Affairs\nThe Office of Congressional Affairs (OCA) serves as the liaison between the CIA and the US Congress The OCA states that it aims to ensures that Congress is fully and currently informed of intelligence activities [39]\n\n\nTraining\nThe CIA established its first training facility, the Office of Training and Education, in 1950 Following the end of the Cold War, the CIA's training budget was slashed, which had a negative effect on employee retention [41] [42]\n\n\nBudget\nDetails of the overall United States intelligence budget are classified [3] Under the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, the Director of Central Intelligence is the only federal government employee who can spend \"un-vouchered\" government money [49] The government showed its 1997 budget was $26.6 billion for the fiscal year [50] The government has disclosed a total figure for all non-military intelligence spending since 2007; the fiscal 2013 figure is $52.6 billion According to the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures, the CIA's fiscal 2013 budget is $14.7 billion, 28% of the total and almost 50% more than the budget of the National Security Agency CIA's HUMINT budget is $2.3 billion, the SIGINT budget is $1.7 billion, and spending for security and logistics of CIA missions is $2.5 billion \"Covert action programs,\" including a variety of activities such as the CIA's drone fleet and anti-Iranian nuclear program activities, accounts for $2.6 billion [3]\n\n\nRelationship with other intelligence agencies\nThe role and functions of the CIA are roughly equivalent to those of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) in Germany, MI6 in the United Kingdom, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) in Australia, the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE) in France, the Foreign Intelligence Service in Russia, the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in China, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in India, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in Pakistan, the General Intelligence Service in Egypt, Mossad in Israel, and the National Intelligence Service (NIS) in South Korea \n\n\nForeign intelligence services\nThe role and functions of the CIA are roughly equivalent to those of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) in Germany, MI6 in the United Kingdom, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) in Australia, the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE) in France, the Foreign Intelligence Service in Russia, the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in China, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in India, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in Pakistan, the General Intelligence Service in Egypt, Mossad in Israel, and the National Intelligence Service (NIS) in South Korea \n\n\nHistory\nThe success of the British Commandos during World War II prompted U.S President Franklin D Roosevelt to authorize the creation of an intelligence service modeled after the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), and Special Operations Executive This led to the creation of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) by a Presidential military order issued by President Roosevelt on June 13, 1942 The idea for a centralized intelligence organization was first proposed by General William J Donovan, who envisioned an intelligence service that could operate globally to counter communist threats and provide crucial intelligence directly to the President [59]\n\n\nImmediate predecessors\nThe success of the British Commandos during World War II prompted U.S President Franklin D Roosevelt to authorize the creation of an intelligence service modeled after the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), and Special Operations Executive This led to the creation of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) by a Presidential military order issued by President Roosevelt on June 13, 1942 The idea for a centralized intelligence organization was first proposed by General William J Donovan, who envisioned an intelligence service that could operate globally to counter communist threats and provide crucial intelligence directly to the President [59]\n\n\nCreation\nThe Central Intelligence Agency was created on July 26, 1947, when President Truman signed the National Security Act into law A major impetus for the creation of the agency was growing tensions with the USSR following the end of World War II [69]\n\n\nKorean War\nAt the beginning of the Korean War, CIA officer Hans Tofte claimed to have turned a thousand North Korean expatriates into a guerrilla force tasked with infiltration, guerrilla warfare, and pilot rescue [90] In 1952 the CIA sent 1,500 more expatriate agents north Seoul station chief Albert Haney would openly celebrate the capabilities of those agents and the information they sent [90] In September 1952 Haney was replaced by John Limond Hart, a Europe veteran with a vivid memory for bitter experiences of misinformation [90] Hart was suspicious of the parade of successes reported by Tofte and Haney and launched an investigation which determined that the entirety of the information supplied by the Korean sources was false or misleading [91] After the war, internal reviews by the CIA would corroborate Hart's findings The CIA's station in Seoul had 200 officers, but not a single speaker of Korean [91] Hart reported to Washington that Seoul station was hopeless, and could not be salvaged Loftus Becker, deputy director of intelligence, was sent personally to tell Hart that the CIA had to keep the station open to save face Becker returned to Washington, D.C., pronouncing the situation to be \"hopeless,\" and that, after touring the CIA's Far East operations, the CIA's ability to gather intelligence in the far east was \"almost negligible\" [91] He then resigned Air Force Colonel James Kallis stated that CIA director Allen Dulles continued to praise the CIA's Korean force, despite knowing that they were under enemy control [92] When China entered the war in 1950, the CIA attempted a number of subversive operations in the country, all of which failed due to the presence of double agents Millions of dollars were spent in these efforts [93] These included a team of young CIA officers airdropped into China who were ambushed, and CIA funds being used to set up a global heroin empire in Burma's Golden Triangle following a betrayal by another double agent [93]\n\n\n1953 Iranian coup d'état\nIn 1951, Mohammad Mosaddegh, a member of the National Front, was elected Iranian prime-minister [94] As prime minister, he nationalized the Anglo-Persian Oil Company which his predecessor had supported The nationalization of the British-funded Iranian oil industry, including the largest oil refinery in the world, was disastrous for Mosaddegh A British naval embargo closed the British oil facilities, which Iran had no skilled workers to operate In 1952, Mosaddegh resisted the royal refusal to approve his Minister of War and resigned in protest The National Front took to the streets in protest Fearing a loss of control, the military pulled its troops back five days later, and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi gave in to Mosaddegh's demands Mosaddegh quickly replaced military leaders loyal to the Shah with those loyal to him, giving him personal control over the military Given six months of emergency powers, Mosaddegh unilaterally passed legislation When that six months expired, his powers were extended for another year In 1953, Mossadegh dismissed parliament and assumed dictatorial powers This power grab triggered the Shah to exercise his constitutional right to dismiss Mosaddegh Mosaddegh launched a military coup, and the Shah fled the country.\n\n\n1954 Guatemalan coup d'état\nThe return of the Shah to power, and the impression, cultivated by Allen Dulles, that an effective CIA had been able to guide that nation to friendly and stable relations with the West triggered planning for Operation PBSuccess, a plan to overthrow Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz [100] The plan was exposed in major newspapers before it happened after a CIA agent left plans for the coup in his Guatemala City hotel room [101]\n\n\nSyria\nIn 1949, Colonel Adib Shishakli rose to power in Syria in a CIA-backed coup Four years later, he would be overthrown by the military, Ba'athists, and communists The CIA and MI6 started funding right-wing members of the military but suffered a huge setback in the aftermath of the Suez Crisis CIA Agent Rocky Stone, who had played a minor role in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état, was working at the Damascus embassy as a diplomat but was the station chief Syrian officers on the CIA dole quickly appeared on television stating that they had received money from \"corrupt and sinister Americans\" \"in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of Syria.\" [113] Syrian forces surrounded the embassy and rousted Agent Stone, who confessed and subsequently made history as the first American diplomat expelled from an Arab nation This strengthened ties between Syria and Egypt, helping establish the United Arab Republic, and poisoning the well for the US for the foreseeable future [113]\n\n\nIndonesia\nThe charismatic leader of Indonesia was President Sukarno His declaration of neutrality in the Cold War put the suspicions of the CIA on him After Sukarno hosted Bandung Conference, promoting the Non-Aligned Movement, the Eisenhower White House responded with NSC 5518 authorizing \"all feasible covert means\" to move Indonesia into the Western sphere [114]\n\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\nIn the election of Patrice Lumumba as prime minister, and his acceptance of Soviet support during the Congo Crisis, the CIA saw another possible Cuba This view swayed the White House Eisenhower ordered that Lumumba be \"eliminated.\" In September 1960, President Joseph Kasa-Vubu ordered the dismissal of Lumumba and his cabinet The CIA delivered a quarter of a million dollars to Joseph Mobutu in October, their favored Congolese political figure Lumumba was imprisoned by Mobutu in December and then handed over to Katangan authorities who, with the aid of Belgium, executed him by firing squad in January 1961 [122]\n\n\n1960 U-2 incident\nAfter the bomber gap came the missile gap Eisenhower wanted to use the U-2 to disprove the Missile Gap, but he had banned U-2 overflights of the USSR after meeting Secretary Khrushchev at Camp David Another reason the President objected to the use of the U-2 was that, in the nuclear age, the intelligence he needed most was on their intentions, without which, the US would face a paralysis of intelligence He was particularly worried that U-2 flights could be seen as preparations for first-strike attacks He had high hopes for an upcoming meeting with Khrushchev in Paris Eisenhower finally gave in to CIA pressure to authorize a 16-day window for flights, which was extended an additional six days because of poor weather On May 1, 1960, the Soviet Air Forces shot down a U-2 flying over Soviet territory To Eisenhower, the ensuing coverup destroyed his perceived honesty and his hope of leaving a legacy of thawing relations with Khrushchev Eisenhower later said that the U-2 coverup was the greatest regret of his presidency [123]: 160 \n\n\nDominican Republic\nIn the Dominican Republic, the human rights abuses of Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo lasted more than three decades before the United States severed diplomatic relations with the nation in August 1960 The CIA's Special Group armed Dominicans to assassinate Trujillo, but Kennedy paused the plan when he became president Kennedy allowed the distribution of four additional machine guns, and Trujillo died from gunshot wounds two weeks later, on May 30, 1961 In the aftermath, Robert Kennedy wrote that the CIA had succeeded where it had failed many times in the past, but in the face of that success, it was caught flatfooted, having failed to plan what to do next [124]\n\n\nBay of Pigs\nThe CIA welcomed Fidel Castro on his visit to Washington, D.C., and gave him a face-to-face briefing The CIA hoped that Castro would bring about a friendly democratic government and planned to support his government with money and guns By December 11, 1959, however, a memo reached the DCI's desk recommending Castro's \"elimination.\" Dulles replaced the word \"elimination\" with \"removal,\" and set the scheme into action By mid-August 1960, Dick Bissell sought, with the full backing of the CIA, to hire the Mafia to assassinate Castro [126]\n\n\nCuba: Terrorism and sabotage\nAfter the failure of the attempted invasion at the Bay of Pigs, the CIA proposed a program of sabotage and terrorist attacks against civilian and military targets in Cuba, with the stated intent to bring down the Cuban administration and institute a new government It was authorized by President Kennedy in November 1961 [127] [128] [129] [130] The operation saw the CIA engage in an extensive campaign of terrorist attacks against civilians and economic targets, killing significant numbers of civilians, and carry out covert operations against the Cuban government [128] [131] [132] [133]\n\n\nCold War operations\nThe CIA was involved in anti-Communist activities in Burma, Guatemala, Laos, and the Democratic Republic [142] Operations in Laos continued well into the 1970s [143]\n\n\nBrazil\nThe CIA and the United States government were involved in the 1964 Brazilian coup d'état The coup occurred from March 31 to April 1, which resulted in the Brazilian Armed Forces ousting President João Goulart The United States saw Goulart as a left-wing threat in Latin America Secret cables written by the US Ambassador to Brazil, Lincoln Gordon, confirmed that the CIA was involved in covert action in Brazil The CIA encouraged \"pro-democracy street rallies\" in Brazil, for instance, to create dissent against Goulart [146]\n\n\nIndochina, Tibet, and the Vietnam War (1954–1975)\nThe OSS Patti mission arrived in Vietnam near the end of World War II and had significant interaction with the leaders of many Vietnamese factions, including Ho Chi Minh [147]\n\n\nJohnson\nIn the face of the failure of Project Tiger, the Pentagon wanted CIA paramilitary forces to participate in their Op Plan 64A This resulted in the CIA's foreign paramilitaries being put under the command of the DOD, a move seen as a slippery slope inside the CIA, a slide from covert action towards militarization [151]\n\n\nNixon\nIn 1971, the NSA and CIA were engaged in domestic spying; the DOD was eavesdropping on Henry Kissinger The White House and Camp David were wired for sound Nixon and Kissinger were eavesdropping on their aides, as well as reporters Famously, Nixon's Plumbers had in their number many former CIA officers, including Howard Hunt, Jim McCord, and Eugenio Martinez On July 7, 1971, John Ehrlichman, Nixon's domestic policy chief, told DCI Cushman, Nixon's hatchet-man in the CIA, to let Cushman \"know that  [Hunt] was, in fact, doing some things for the President.. you should consider he has pretty much carte blanche\" [154]\n\n\nCongressional investigations\nActing Attorney General Laurence Silberman learned of the existence of the Family Jewels and issued a subpoena for them, prompting eight congressional investigations on the domestic spying activities of the CIA Bill Colby's short tenure as DCI would end with the Halloween Massacre His replacement was George H W Bush At the time, the DOD had control of 80% of the intelligence budget [161] Communication and coordination between the CIA and the DOD would suffer greatly under Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld The CIA's budget for hiring clandestine officers had been squeezed out by the paramilitary operations in Southeast Asia, and the government's poor popularity further strained hiring This left the agency bloated with middle management, and anemic in younger officers With employee training taking five years, the agency's only hope would be on the trickle of new officers coming to fruition years in the future The CIA would see another setback as communists would take Angola William J Casey, a member of Ford's Intelligence Advisory Board, obtained Bush's approval to allow a team from outside the CIA to produce Soviet military estimates as a \"Team B\" The \"B\" team was composed of hawks Their estimates were the highest that could be justified, and they painted a picture of a growing Soviet military when the Soviet military was indeed shrinking Many of their reports found their way to the press \n\n\nChad\nChad's neighbor Libya was a major source of weaponry to communist rebel forces The CIA seized the opportunity to arm and finance Chad's Prime Minister, Hissène Habré, after he created a breakaway government in western Sudan, [162] even giving him Stinger missiles [163]\n\n\nAfghanistan\nIn Afghanistan, the CIA funneled several billion dollars' worth of weapons, [164] including FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missiles, [165] to Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)—which funneled them to tens of thousands of Afghan mujahideen resistance fighters in order to fight the Soviets and the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan War [166] [167] [168] In total, the CIA sent approximately 2,300 Stingers to Afghanistan, creating a substantial black market for the weapons throughout the Middle East, Central Asia, and even parts of Africa that persisted well into the 1990s Perhaps 100 Stingers were acquired by Iran The CIA later operated a program to recover the Stingers through cash buybacks [169]\n\n\nNicaragua\nUnder President Jimmy Carter, the CIA was conducting covertly funded support for the Contras in their war against the Sandinistas In March 1981, Reagan told Congress that the CIA would protect El Salvador by preventing the Sandinistas from shipping arms to communist rebels in El Salvador The CIA also began arming and training the Contras in Honduras in hopes that they could depose the Sandinistas in Nicaragua [170] DCI William J Casey formed the Central American Task Force, staffed with yes men from Covert Action [170]\n\n\nLebanon\nThe CIA's prime source in Lebanon was Bashir Gemayel, a member of the Christian Maronite sect The uprising against the Maronite minority blindsided the CIA Israel invaded Lebanon, and, along with the CIA, propped up Gemayel This secured Gemayel's assurance that Americans would be protected in Lebanon Thirteen days later he was assassinated Imad Mughniyah, a Hezbollah assassin, targeted Americans in retaliation for the Israeli invasion, the Sabra and Shatila massacre, and the US Marines of the Multi-National Force for their role in opposing the PLO in Lebanon On April 18, 1983, a 2,000 lb car bomb exploded in the lobby of the American embassy in Beirut, killing 63 people, including 17 Americans and 7 CIA officers, including Robert Ames, one of the CIA's Middle East experts America's fortunes in Lebanon suffered more as America's poorly directed retaliation for the bombing was interpreted by many as support for the Maronite minority On October 23, 1983, two bombs (1983 Beirut Bombing) were set off in Beirut, including a 10-ton bomb at a US military barracks that killed 242 people.\n\n\nPakistan\nIt has been alleged by such authors as Ahmed Rashid that the CIA and ISI have been waging a clandestine war \n\n\nIndia–Pakistan geopolitical tensions\nOn May 11, 1998, CIA Director George Tenet and his agency were taken aback by India's second nuclear test The test prompted concerns from its nuclear-capable adversary, Pakistan, and, \"remade the balance of power in the world.\" The nuclear test was New Delhi's calculated response to Pakistan previously testing new missiles in its expanding arsenal This series of events subsequently revealed the CIA's \"failure of espionage, a failure to read photographs, a failure to comprehend reports, a failure to think, and a failure to see.\" [172]\n\n\nPoland, 1980–1989\nUnlike the Carter administration, the Reagan administration supported the Solidarity movement in Poland, and – based on CIA intelligence – waged a public relations campaign to deter what the Carter administration felt was \"an imminent move by large Soviet military forces into Poland.\" Colonel Ryszard Kukliński, a senior officer on the Polish General Staff, was secretly sending reports to the CIA [173]\n\n\nOperation Gladio\nDuring the Cold War, the CIA and NATO were involved in Operation Gladio [182] [183] As part of Operation Gladio, the CIA supported the Italian government, and allegedly supported neo-fascist organizations [184] [185] [186] such as National Vanguard, New Order and the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari during the Years of Lead in Italy.\n\n\nOperation Desert Storm\nDuring the Iran–Iraq War, the CIA had backed both sides The CIA had maintained a network of spies in Iran, but in 1989 a CIA mistake compromised every agent they had in there, and the CIA had no agents in Iraq In the weeks before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the CIA downplayed the military buildup During the war, CIA estimates of Iraqi abilities and intentions flip-flopped and were rarely accurate In one particular case, the DOD had asked the CIA to identify military targets to bomb One target the CIA identified was an underground shelter The CIA did not know that it was a civilian bomb shelter In a rare instance, the CIA correctly determined that the coalition forces efforts were coming up short in their efforts to destroy SCUD missiles Congress took away the CIA's role in interpreting spy-satellite photos, putting the CIA's satellite intelligence operations under the auspices of the military The CIA created its office of military affairs, which operated as \"second-echelon support for the Pentagon . answering .. questions from military men  [like] 'how wide is this road?'\" [189]\n\n\nFall of the Soviet Union\nMikhail Gorbachev's announcement of the unilateral reduction of 500,000 Soviet troops took the CIA by surprise Moreover, Doug MacEachin, the CIA's Chief of Soviet analysis, said that even if the CIA had told the President, the NSC, and Congress about the cuts beforehand, it would have been ignored \"We never would have been able to publish it.\" [190] All the CIA numbers on the Soviet Union's economy were wrong Too often the CIA relied on inexperienced people supposedly deemed experts Bob Gates had preceded Doug MacEachin as Chief of Soviet analysis, and he had never visited the Soviet Union Few officers, even those stationed in the country, spoke the language of the people on whom they spied And the CIA could not send agents to respond to developing situations The CIA analysis of Russia during the Cold War was either driven by ideology, or by politics William J Crowe, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, noted that the CIA \"talked about the Soviet Union as if they weren't reading the newspapers, much less developed clandestine intelligence.\" [191]\n\n\nClinton\nOn January 25, 1993, Mir Qazi opened fire at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, killing two officers and wounding three others On February 26, Al-Qaeda terrorists led by Ramzi Yousef bombed the parking garage below the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, killing six people and injuring 1,402 others.\n\n\nAldrich Ames\nBetween 1985 and 1986, the CIA lost every spy it had in Eastern Europe The details of the investigation into the cause were obscured from the new Director, and the investigation had little success and has been widely criticized On February 21, 1994, FBI agents pulled Aldrich Ames out of his Jaguar [199] In the investigation that ensued, the CIA discovered that many of the sources for its most important analyses of the USSR were based on Soviet disinformation fed to the CIA by controlled agents On top of that, it was discovered that, in some cases, the CIA suspected at the time that the sources were compromised, but the information was sent up the chain as genuine [200] [201]\n\n\nOsama bin Laden\nAgency files show that it is believed Osama bin Laden was funding the Afghan rebels against the USSR in the 1980s [202] In 1991, bin Laden returned to his native Saudi Arabia protesting the presence of troops, and Operation Desert Storm He was expelled from the country In 1996, the CIA created a team to hunt bin Laden They were trading information with the Sudanese until, on the word of a source that would later be found to be a fabricator, the CIA closed its Sudan station later that year In 1998, bin Laden would declare war on America, and, on August 7, strike in Tanzania and Nairobi On October 12, 2000, Al Qaeda bombed the USS Cole In the first days of George W Bush's presidency, Al Qaeda threats were ubiquitous in daily presidential CIA briefings, but it may have become a case of false alarm The agency's predictions were dire but carried little weight, and the focus of the president and his defense staff were elsewhere The CIA arranged the arrests of suspected Al Qaeda members through cooperation with foreign agencies, but the CIA could not definitively say what effect these arrests have had, and it could not gain hard intelligence from those captured The President had asked the CIA if Al Qaeda could plan attacks in the US On August 6, Bush received a daily briefing with the headline, not based on current, solid intelligence, \"Al Qaeda determined to strike inside the US.\" The US had been hunting bin Laden since 1996 and had had several opportunities, but neither Clinton, nor Bush had wanted to risk taking an active role in a murky assassination plot, and the perfect opportunity had never materialized for a DCI that would have given him the reassurances he needed to take the plunge That day, Richard A Clarke sent National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice warning of the risks, and decrying the inaction of the CIA [203]\n\n\nAl-Qaeda and the Global War on Terrorism\nIn January 1996, the CIA created an experimental \"virtual station,\" the Bin Laden Issue Station, under the Counterterrorist Center, to track bin Laden's developing activities Al-Fadl, who defected to the CIA in spring 1996, began to provide the Station with a new image of the Al Qaeda leader: he was not only a terrorist financier but a terrorist organizer as well FBI Special Agent Dan Coleman (who together with his partner Jack Cloonan had been \"seconded\" to the bin Laden Station) called him Qaeda's \"Rosetta Stone\" [204]\n\n\nSeptember 11 attacks and its aftermath\nOn September 11, 2001, 19 Al-Qaeda members hijacked four passenger jets within the Northeastern United States in a series of coordinated terrorist attacks Two planes crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, the third into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, and the fourth inadvertently into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania The attacks cost the lives of 2,996 people (including the 19 hijackers), caused the destruction of the Twin Towers, and damaged the western side of the Pentagon Soon after 9/11, The New York Times released a story stating that the CIA's New York field office was destroyed in the wake of the attacks According to unnamed CIA sources, while first responders, military personnel and volunteers were conducting rescue efforts at the World Trade Center site, a special CIA team was searching the rubble for both digital and paper copies of classified documents This was done according to well-rehearsed document recovery procedures put in place after the Iranian takeover of the United States Embassy in Tehran in 1979 \n\n\nFailures in intelligence analysis\nA major criticism is a failure to forestall the September 11 attacks The 9/11 Commission Report identified failures in the IC as a whole One problem, for example, was the FBI failing to \"connect the dots\" by sharing information among its decentralized field offices.\n\n\nAbuses of CIA authority, 1970s–1990s\nConditions worsened in the mid-1970s, around the time of Watergate A dominant feature of political life during that period were the attempts of Congress to assert oversight of the U.S presidency and the executive branch of the U.S government Revelations about past CIA activities, such as assassinations and attempted assassinations of foreign leaders (most notably Fidel Castro and Rafael Trujillo) and illegal domestic spying on U.S citizens, provided the opportunities to increase Congressional oversight of U.S intelligence operations [159] CIA involvement in Contra cocaine trafficking in Nicaragua [219] [220] and complicity in the actions of the death squads in El Salvador and Honduras also came to light [221] [222]\n\n\nYugoslav wars\nIn 1989; Yugoslavia officially dissolved into six republics, with borders drawn along ethnic and historical lines: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia This quickly dissolved into ethnic tensions between Serbs and other Balkan ethnicities In 1991, the CIA predicted that tension in the region would evolve into a full blown Civil war [226] In 1992, the U.S embargoed the trafficking of weapons into both Bosnia and Serbia in order to not prolong the war and the destruction of impacted communities In May 1994, the CIA reported that the embargo had been ignored by countries such as Malaysia and Iran who moved weapons into Bosnia [227]\n\n\nIraq War\nSeventy-two days after the 9/11 attacks, President Bush told Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to update the US plan for an invasion of Iraq, but not to tell anyone Rumsfeld asked Bush if he could bring DCI Tenet into the loop, to which Bush agreed [228]\n\n\n2004, DNI takes over CIA top-level functions\nThe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 created the office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), who took over some of the government and intelligence community (IC)-wide functions that had previously been the CIA's The DNI manages the United States Intelligence Community and in so doing it manages the intelligence cycle Among the functions that moved to the DNI were the preparation of estimates reflecting the consolidated opinion of the 16 IC agencies, and preparation of briefings for the president On July 30, 2008, President Bush issued Executive Order 13470 [235] amending Executive Order 12333 to strengthen the role of the DNI [236]\n\n\nOperation Neptune Spear\nOn May 1, 2011, President Barack Obama announced that Osama bin Laden was killed earlier that day by \"a small team of Americans\" operating in Abbottabad, Pakistan, during a CIA operation [237] [238] The raid was executed from a CIA forward base in Afghanistan by elements of the U.S Navy's Naval Special Warfare Development Group and CIA paramilitary operatives [239]\n\n\nSyrian Civil War\nUnder the aegis of operation Timber Sycamore and other clandestine activities, CIA operatives and U.S special operations troops have trained and armed nearly 10,000 rebel fighters at a cost of $1 billion a year [249] The CIA has been sending weapons to anti-government rebels in Syria since at least 2012 [250] These weapons have been reportedly falling into hands of extremists, such as al-Nusra Front and ISIL [251] [252] [253] Around February 2017, the CIA was instructed to halt military aid to Syrian rebels (Free Syrian Army or FSA), which also included training, ammunition, guided missiles, and salaries Sources state that the hold on aid was not related to the transitions from Obama's administration to Trump's, but rather due to issues faced by the FSA Based on responses by rebel officials, they believe that the aid freeze is related to concerns that weapons and funds will fall into the hands of ISIL Based on information obtained by Reuters, five FSA groups have confirmed that they received funding and military support from a source called \"MOM operations room.\" [clarification needed] On April 6, 2017, Al-Jazeera reported that funding to the FSA was partially restored Based on the information provided by two FSA sources, the new military operation room will receive its funds from the coalition \"Friends of Syria.\" The coalition consists of members from the U.S., Turkey, Western Europe, and Gulf states, which previously supported the military operation known as MOM [254]\n\n\nReorganization\nOn March 6, 2015, the office of the D/CIA issued an unclassified edition of a statement by the director, titled \"Our Agency's Blueprint for the Future\", as a press release for public consumption The press release announced sweeping plans for the reorganization and reform of the CIA, which the director believes will bring the CIA more in line with the agency doctrine called the 'Strategic Direction.' Among the key changes disclosed include the establishment of a new directorate, the Directorate of Digital Innovation, which is responsible for designing and crafting the digital technology to be used by the agency, to keep the CIA always ahead of its enemies The Directorate of Digital Innovation will also train CIA staff in the use of this technology, to prepare the CIA for the future, and it will also use the technological revolution to deal with cyber-terrorism and other perceived threats The new directorate will be the chief cyber-espionage arm of the agency going forward [256]\n\n\nDrones\nA new policy introduced by President Barack Obama removed the authority of the CIA to launch drone attacks and allowed these attacks only under Department of Defense command This change was reversed by President Donald Trump, who authorized CIA drone strikes on suspected terrorists [257]\n\n\nEncryption devices sold through front company\nFor decades until 2018, the CIA secretly owned Crypto AG, a small Swiss company that made encryption devices, in association with West German intelligence The company sold compromised encryption devices to over 120 countries, allowing Western intelligence to eavesdrop on communications that the users believed to be secure [258] [259]\n\n\nOpen-source intelligence\nUntil the 2004 reorganization of the intelligence community, one of the \"services of common concern\" that the CIA provided was open-source intelligence from the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) [260] FBIS, which had absorbed the Joint Publication Research Service, a military organization that translated documents, [261] moved into the National Open Source Enterprise under the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n\nOutsourcing and privatization\nMany of the duties and functions of Intelligence Community activities, not the CIA alone, are being outsourced and privatized Mike McConnell, former Director of National Intelligence, was about to publicize an investigation report of outsourcing by U.S intelligence agencies, as required by Congress [267] However, this report was then classified [268] [269] Hillhouse speculates that this report includes requirements for the CIA to report: [268] [270]\n\n\nControversies\nThroughout its history, the CIA has been the subject of numerous controversies, both at home and abroad The agency ran an operation code-named \"Chaos\" that ran from 1967 to 1974 where they routinely performed surveillance on Americans who were a part of various peace groups protesting the Vietnam War The operation was authorized by order of President Lyndon B Johnson in October 1967 as the CIA gathered the information of 300,000 American people and organizations and extensive files on 7,200 citizens The program was exposed by the Church Committee in 1975 as a part of the investigation into the Watergate scandal [218] [276]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Nanjing_Massacre", "content": "\nMilitary situation\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War commenced on July 7, 1937, following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, and rapidly escalated into a full-scale war in northern China between the Chinese and Japanese armies [12] The Chinese Nationalist Forces, however, wanted to avoid a decisive conflict in the northern region and instead opened a second front by launching offensives against Japanese forces in Shanghai [12] In response, Japan deployed an army led by General Iwane Matsui, to fight the Chinese forces in Shanghai [13]\n\n\nStrategy for the defense of Nanjing\nIn a press release to foreign reporters, Tang Shengzhi announced the city would not surrender and would fight to the death Tang gathered a garrison force of some 81,500 soldiers, [18] many of whom were untrained conscripts, or troops exhausted from the Battle of Shanghai The Chinese government left for relocation on December 1, and the president left on December 7, leaving the administration of Nanjing to an International Committee led by John Rabe, a German national and Nazi Party member.\n\n\nApproach of the Imperial Japanese Army\nAlthough the massacre is generally described as having occurred over a six-week period after the fall of Nanjing, the crimes committed by the Japanese army were not limited to that period Numerous atrocities were committed as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanjing, including rape, torture, arson and murder.\n\n\nJapanese war crimes on the march to Nanjing\nAlthough the massacre is generally described as having occurred over a six-week period after the fall of Nanjing, the crimes committed by the Japanese army were not limited to that period Numerous atrocities were committed as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanjing, including rape, torture, arson and murder.\n\n\nRetreating Chinese Troops' Scorched-Earth Policy\nThe Nanjing garrison force set fire to buildings and houses in the areas close to Xiaguan to the north as well as in the environs of the eastern and southern city gates Targets within and outside of the city walls—such as military barracks, private homes, the Chinese Ministry of Communication, forests and even entire villages—were completely burnt down, at an estimated value of US$20–30 million (1937) [35] [36] [37]\n\n\nEstablishment of the Nanking Safety Zone\nMany Westerners were living in the city at that time, conducting trade or on missionary trips As the Japanese army approached Nanjing, most of them fled the city, leaving 27 foreigners Five of these were journalists who remained in the city a few days after it was captured, leaving the city on December 16 Fifteen of the remaining 22 foreigners formed a committee, called the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone in the western quarter of the city [38]\n\n\nEstablishment of refugee camp at cement factory\nAt the age of 26, a Dane named Bernhard Arp Sindberg began his role as a guard at a cement factory in Nanjing in December 1937, days before the Japanese invasion of Nanjing [41] As the massacre began, Sindberg and Karl Gunther, a German colleague, converted the cement factory into a makeshift refugee camp where they offered refuge and medical assistance to approximately 6,000 to 10,000 Chinese civilians [42] [43]\n\n\nPrince Asaka appointed as commander\nIn a memorandum for the palace rolls, Hirohito singled Prince Yasuhiko Asaka out for censure as the one imperial kinsman whose attitude was \"not good.\" He assigned Asaka to Nanjing as an opportunity to make amends [44]\n\n\nBattle of Nanjing\nThe Japanese military continued to move forward, breaching several lines of Chinese resistance, and arrived outside the city gates of Nanjing on December 9.\n\n\nSiege of the city\nThe Japanese military continued to move forward, breaching several lines of Chinese resistance, and arrived outside the city gates of Nanjing on December 9.\n\n\nDemand for surrender\nIn the meantime, members of the Committee contacted Tang and proposed a plan for three-day cease-fire, during which the Chinese troops could withdraw without fighting while the Japanese troops would stay in their present position.\n\n\nAssault and capture of Nanjing\nDespite resisting the assault fiercely, the Chinese defenders were hampered by rising casualties and Japanese strengths in firepower and numbers Combined with fatigue and a breakdown in communications, the garrison was gradually overwhelmed in the four day battle for the city, and finally collapsed on the night of December 12 [50]\n\n\nPursuit and \"mopping-up operations\"\nThe conflict in Nanjing persisted beyond the night of December 12–13, following the Japanese Army's capture of the remaining gates and entrance into the city The Japanese army continued to encounter sporadic resistance from remaining Chinese forces for several additional days The Japanese military determined that they needed to eliminate any remaining Chinese soldiers hidden within the city However, the search process used an arbitrary criteria for identifying former Chinese soldiers Chinese males who were deemed to be in good health were automatically presumed to be a soldier During this operation, Japanese forces committed atrocities against the Chinese population [51]\n\n\nCivilian population and evacuation\nWith the relocation of the capital of China, constant bombing raids, and reports of Japanese brutality, much of Nanjing's civilian population had fled out of fear Wealthy families were the first to flee, leaving Nanjing in automobiles, followed by the evacuation of the middle class and then the poor Those that remained were mainly the destitute lowest class such as the ethnic Tanka boat people, and those with assets that could not be easily moved, like shopkeepers [9]\n\n\nMassacre\nFrom December 13, 1937, the Japanese Army engaged in random murder, torture, wartime rape, looting, arson, and other war crimes Such crime continued from three to six weeks depending on the types of crime The first three weeks were more intense [note 1] A group of foreign expatriates headed by Rabe had formed a 15-man International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone on November 22 and mapped out the Nanking Safety Zone in order to safeguard civilians in the city [56]\n\n\nCauses\nThe Nanjing Massacre's occurrence and nature were influenced by several factors The Japanese population was taught militaristic and racist ideologies The Japanese government's fascist doctrine further propagated the belief in Japanese superiority over all other peoples Other factors include the dehumanization of Japanese soldiers by their commanders and the challenging combat environment in China [57]\n\n\nMassacre contest\nIn 1937, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun and its sister newspaper, the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, covered a contest between two Japanese officers, Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda of the Japanese 16th Division The two men were described as vying to be the first to kill 100 people with a sword before the capture of Nanjing From Jurong to Tangshan (two cities in Jiangsu Province, China), Mukai had killed 89 people while Noda had killed 78 The contest continued because neither had killed 100 people By the time they had arrived at Zijin Mountain, Noda had killed 105 people while Mukai had killed 106 people Both officers supposedly surpassed their goal during the heat of battle, making it impossible to determine which officer had actually won the contest Therefore, according to journalists Asami Kazuo and Suzuki Jiro, writing in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun of December 13, they decided to begin another contest to kill 150 people [64]\n\n\nRape\nThe International Military Tribunal for the Far East estimated that in the first month of the occupation, Japanese soldiers committed approximately 20,000 cases of rape in the city [67] Some estimates claim 80,000 cases of rape [4] According to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, rapes of all ages, including children and elderly women, were commonplace, and there were many instances of sadistic and violent behavior related to these rapes Following the rapes, many women were killed and their bodies were mutilated [68] A large number of rapes were done systematically by the Japanese soldiers as they went from door to door, searching for girls, with many women being captured and gang-raped [69]\n\n\nMassacre of civilians\nFor about three weeks since December 13, 1937, [7] the Imperial Japanese Army entered the Nanking Safety Zone to search for former Chinese soldiers hidden among refugees Many innocent men were misidentified and killed [7]\n\n\nExtrajudicial killing of Chinese prisoners of war and male civilians\nSoon after the fall of the city, Japanese troops made a thorough search for Chinese soldiers and summarily arrested thousands of young Chinese men Many were taken to the Yangtze River, where they were machine-gunned to death What was probably the single largest massacre of Chinese troops, the Straw String Gorge Massacre, occurred along the banks of the Yangtze River on December 18 For most of the morning, Japanese soldiers tied the POWs' hands together At dusk, the soldiers divided POWs into four columns and opened fire Unable to escape, the POWs could only scream and thrash desperately It took an hour for the sounds of death to stop and even longer for the Japanese to bayonet each individual The majority of the bodies were dumped directly into the Yangtze River [96]\n\n\nLooting and arson\n\"In the first days of the occupation the soldiers  [...] took a great deal of bedding, cooking utensils and food from the refugees Practically every building in the city was entered many, many times by these roving gangs of soldiers throughout the first six or seven weeks of the occupation\" [7] \" [T]here was no burning until the Japanese troops had been in the city five or six days Beginning, I believe, on the 19th or 20th of December, burning was carried on regularly for six weeks.\" [7]\n\n\nNanking Safety Zone and the role of foreigners\nThe Japanese troops did respect the Zone to an extent; until the Japanese occupation, no shells entered that part of the city except a few stray shots During the chaos following the attack of the city, some were killed in the Safety Zone, but the crimes that occurred in the rest of the city were far greater by all accounts [107]\n\n\nLiterature\nEyewitness accounts include testimonies of expatriates engaged in humanitarian work (mostly physicians, professors, missionary and businessmen), journalists (both Western and Japanese), as well as the field diaries of military personnel American missionary John Magee stayed behind to provide a 16 mm film documentary and first-hand photographs of the Nanjing Massacre Rabe and American missionary Lewis S C Smythe, secretary of the International Committee and a professor of sociology at the University of Nanjing, recorded the actions of the Japanese troops and filed complaints with the Japanese embassy.\n\n\nMatsui's reaction to the massacre\n\nOn December 18, 1937, as General Iwane Matsui began to comprehend the full extent of the rape, torture, murder, and looting in the city, he grew increasingly dismayed He reportedly told one of his civilian aides:\n\nEnd of the massacre\nIn late January 1938, the Japanese army forced all refugees in the Safety Zone to return home, immediately claiming to have \"restored order\" After the establishment of the weixin zhengfu(Chinese: 维新政府; pinyin: Wéixīn zhèngfǔ) (the collaborating government) in 1938, order was gradually restored in Nanjing and atrocities by Japanese troops lessened considerably [citation needed]\n\n\nRecall of Matsui and Asaka\nIn February 1938, both Prince Asaka and General Matsui were recalled to Japan Matsui returned to retirement, but Prince Asaka remained on the Supreme War Council until the end of the war in August 1945 He was promoted to the rank of general in August 1939, though he held no further military commands [46]\n\n\nEvidence collection\nThe Japanese either destroyed or concealed important documents, severely reducing the amount of evidence available for confiscation Between the declaration of a ceasefire on August 15, 1945, and the arrival of American troops in Japan on August 28, \"the Japanese military and civil authorities systematically destroyed military, naval, and\ngovernment archives, much of which was from the period 1942–1945.\" [115] Overseas troops in the Pacific and East Asia were ordered to destroy incriminating evidence of war crimes [115] Approximately 70 percent of the Japanese army's wartime records were destroyed [115]\nIn regards to the Nanjing Massacre, Japanese authorities deliberately concealed wartime records, eluding confiscation from American authorities [116] Some of the concealed information was made public a few decades later For example, a two-volume collection of military documents related to the Nanjing operations was published in 1989; and disturbing excerpts from Kesago Nakajima's diary, a commander at Nanjing, was published in the early 1980s [116]\n\n\nDeath toll estimates\nNumerous factors complicate the estimation of an accurate death toll [122] [123]\n\n\nRange and duration\nThe duration of the incident is naturally defined by its geography: the earlier the Japanese entered the area, the longer the duration The Battle of Nanking ended on December 13, when the divisions of the Japanese Army entered the walled city of Nanjing The Tokyo War Crime Tribunal defined the period of the massacre to the ensuing six weeks More conservative estimates say that the massacre started on December 14, when the troops entered the Safety Zone, and that it lasted for six weeks Historians who define the Nanjing Massacre as having started from the time that the Japanese Army entered Jiangsu province push the beginning of the massacre to around mid-November to early December (Suzhou fell on November 19), and extended the end of the massacre to late March 1938 [citation needed]\n\n\nWar crimes tribunals\nShortly after the surrender of Japan, the primary officers in charge of the Japanese troops at Nanjing were put on trial General Matsui was indicted before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East for \"deliberately and recklessly\" ignoring his legal duty \"to take adequate steps to secure the observance and prevent breaches\" of the Hague Convention.\n\n\nGrant of immunity to Prince Asaka\nOn May 1, 1946, SCAP officials interrogated Prince Asaka, who was the ranking officer in the city at the height of the atrocities, about his involvement in the Nanjing Massacre and the deposition was submitted to the International Prosecution Section of the Tokyo tribunal Asaka denied the existence of any massacre and claimed never to have received complaints about the conduct of his troops [144]\n\n\nEvidence and testimony\nThe prosecution began the Nanjing phase of its case in July 1946 Dr Robert O Wilson, a surgeon and a member of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone, testified [145]\nOther members of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone who took the witness stand included Miner Searle Bates [146] and John Magee [147] George A Fitch, [148] Lewis S C Smythe, [149] and James McCallum filed affidavits with their diaries and letters [150]\n\n\nMatsui's defense\nMatsui asserted that he had never ordered the execution of Chinese POWs He further argued that he had directed his army division commanders to discipline their troops for criminal acts, and was not responsible for their failure to carry out his directives At trial, Matsui went out of his way to protect Prince Asaka by shifting blame to lower-ranking division commanders [152]\n\n\nVerdict\nKōki Hirota, Prime Minister of Japan at an earlier stage of the war, and a diplomat during the atrocities at Nanjing, was convicted of participating in \"the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy\" (count 1), waging \"a war of aggression and a war in violation of international laws, treaties, agreements and assurances against the Republic of China\" (count 27) and count 55 Matsui was convicted by a majority of the judges at the Tokyo tribunal who ruled that he bore ultimate responsibility for the \"orgy of crime\" at Nanjing because, \"He did nothing, or nothing effective, to abate these horrors.\"\n\n\nSentence\nOn November 12, 1948, Matsui and Hirota, along with five other convicted Class-A war criminals, were sentenced to death by hanging Eighteen others received lesser sentences The death sentence imposed on Hirota, a six-to-five decision by the eleven judges, shocked the general public and prompted a petition on his behalf, which soon gathered over 300,000 signatures but did not succeed in commuting the Minister's sentence All of them were hanged on 23 December 1948 [153] [154]\n\n\nOther trials\nHisao Tani, a lieutenant general for the 6th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, was tried by the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal in China [152] He was found guilty of war crimes, sentenced to death, and executed by shooting on 26 April 1947 However, according to historian Tokushi Kasahara, the evidence used to convict Hisao Tani was not convincing [155] Kasahara said that if there was a full investigation of the massacre, many other high ranking authorities, which include higher level commanders, army leaders and emperor Hirohito, could have been implicated [155]\n\n\nMemorials\nOn October 9, 2015, Documents of the Nanjing Massacre have been listed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register [137]\n\n\nControversy\nAccording to Japanese historian Fujiwara Akira, \"When Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration and surrendered in August 1945, the state officially acknowledged the war of aggression and the Nanjing massacre committed by the Japanese army.\" [162]\n\n\nDebate in Japan\nDavid Askew, formerly an associate professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, noted that in Japan views concerning the massacre were divided between two mutually exclusive groups The \"Great Massacre School\" group accepts the findings of the Tokyo Trials, and concludes that there were at least 200,000 casualties and at least 20,000 rape cases; whereas \"The Illusion School\" group rejects the tribunal's findings as \"victor's justice\" According to Askew, the \"Great Massacre School\" is more sophisticated, and the credibility of its conclusions are supported by a large number of authoritative academics [163] Askew estimates that the city's population was 224,500 from December 24, 1937, to January 5, 1938 [164]\n\n\nDenials of the massacre in Japan\nFor the past several decades, Japanese politicians who express no remorse for the Nanjing massacre have exacerbated ongoing tensions in Sino-Japanese relations, with numerous Japanese government officials and a few historians in Japan either denying or dismissing the atrocity [172] [173] [174] [175]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe memory of the Nanjing Massacre has been a point of contention in Sino-Japanese relations since the early 1970s [180] Trade between the two nations is worth over $200 billion annually Despite this, many Chinese people still have a strong sense of mistrust due to the memory of the atrocity and failure of reconciliation measures This sense of mistrust is strengthened by Japan's unwillingness to admit to and apologize for the atrocities [181]\n\n\nEffect on international relations\nThe memory of the Nanjing Massacre has been a point of contention in Sino-Japanese relations since the early 1970s [180] Trade between the two nations is worth over $200 billion annually Despite this, many Chinese people still have a strong sense of mistrust due to the memory of the atrocity and failure of reconciliation measures This sense of mistrust is strengthened by Japan's unwillingness to admit to and apologize for the atrocities [181]\n\n\nAs a component of national identity\nYoshida asserts that \"Nanjing has figured in the attempts of all three nations  [China, Japan and the United States] to preserve and redefine national and ethnic pride and identity, assuming different kinds of significance based on each country's changing internal and external enemies.\" [191]\n\n\nChina\nIris Chang, In her book Rape of Nanjing, asserted that the politics of the Cold War encouraged Chairman Mao to stay relatively silent about Nanjing in order to keep a trade relationship with Japan [192] Jung Chang and Jon Halliday's biography of Mao claims Mao never made any comment either contemporaneously or later in his life about the massacre, but did frequently remark with enduring bitterness about a political struggle between himself and Wang Ming which also occurred in December 1937 [193]\n\n\nJapan\nFollowing the end of World War II, some circles of civil society in Japan reflected on the extent of the massacre and the participation of ordinary soldiers Notably, the novelist Hotta Yoshie  [ja] wrote a novel, Time (Jikan) in 1953, portraying the massacre from the point of view of a Chinese intellectual watching it happen This novel has been translated into Chinese and Russian Other eyewitnesses to the massacre also expressed their opinions in Japanese magazines in the 1950s and 1960s, but political shifts slowly eroded this tide of confessions.\n\n\nAustralia\nDockworkers in Australia were horrified by the massacre and refused to load pig iron onto ships heading for Japan, leading to the Dalfram Dispute of 1938 [207]\n\n\nRecords\nIn December 2007, the PRC government published the names of 13,000 people who were killed by Japanese troops in the Nanjing Massacre According to Xinhua News Agency, it is the most complete record to date The report consists of eight volumes and was released to mark the 70th anniversary of the start of the massacre It also lists the Japanese army units that were responsible for each of the deaths and states the way in which the victims were killed Zhang Xianwen, editor-in-chief of the report, states that the information collected was based on \"a combination of Chinese, Japanese and Western raw materials, which is objective and just and is able to stand the trial of history\" [208] This report formed part of a 55-volume series about the massacre, the Collection of Historical Materials of Nanjing Massacre (南京大屠杀史料集 pinyin: Nánjīng dà túshā shǐliào jí) [209]\n\n\nSee also\n32°03′N

Numerous atrocities were committed as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanjing, including rape, torture, arson and murder.\n\n\nJapanese war crimes on the march to Nanjing\nAlthough the massacre is generally described as having occurred over a six-week period after the fall of Nanjing, the crimes committed by the Japanese army were not limited to that period Numerous atrocities were committed as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanjing, including rape, torture, arson and murder.\n\n\nRetreating Chinese Troops' Scorched-Earth Policy\nThe Nanjing garrison force set fire to buildings and houses in the areas close to Xiaguan to the north as well as in the environs of the eastern and southern city gates Targets within and outside of the city walls—such as military barracks, private homes, the Chinese Ministry of Communication, forests and even entire villages—were completely burnt down, at an estimated value of US$20–30 million (1937) [35] [36] [37]\n\n\nEstablishment of the Nanking Safety Zone\nMany Westerners were living in the city at that time, conducting trade or on missionary trips As the Japanese army approached Nanjing, most of them fled the city, leaving 27 foreigners Five of these were journalists who remained in the city a few days after it was captured, leaving the city on December 16 Fifteen of the remaining 22 foreigners formed a committee, called the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone in the western quarter of the city [38]\n\n\nEstablishment of refugee camp at cement factory\nAt the age of 26, a Dane named Bernhard Arp Sindberg began his role as a guard at a cement factory in Nanjing in December 1937, days before the Japanese invasion of Nanjing [41] As the massacre began, Sindberg and Karl Gunther, a German colleague, converted the cement factory into a makeshift refugee camp where they offered refuge and medical assistance to approximately 6,000 to 10,000 Chinese civilians [42] [43]\n\n\nPrince Asaka appointed as commander\nIn a memorandum for the palace rolls, Hirohito singled Prince Yasuhiko Asaka out for censure as the one imperial kinsman whose attitude was \"not good.\" He assigned Asaka to Nanjing as an opportunity to make amends [44]\n\n\nBattle of Nanjing\nThe Japanese military continued to move forward, breaching several lines of Chinese resistance, and arrived outside the city gates of Nanjing on December 9.\n\n\nSiege of the city\nThe Japanese military continued to move forward, breaching several lines of Chinese resistance, and arrived outside the city gates of Nanjing on December 9.\n\n\nDemand for surrender\nIn the meantime, members of the Committee contacted Tang and proposed a plan for three-day cease-fire, during which the Chinese troops could withdraw without fighting while the Japanese troops would stay in their present position.\n\n\nAssault and capture of Nanjing\nDespite resisting the assault fiercely, the Chinese defenders were hampered by rising casualties and Japanese strengths in firepower and numbers Combined with fatigue and a breakdown in communications, the garrison was gradually overwhelmed in the four day battle for the city, and finally collapsed on the night of December 12 [50]\n\n\nPursuit and \"mopping-up operations\"\nThe conflict in Nanjing persisted beyond the night of December 12–13, following the Japanese Army's capture of the remaining gates and entrance into the city The Japanese army continued to encounter sporadic resistance from remaining Chinese forces for several additional days The Japanese military determined that they needed to eliminate any remaining Chinese soldiers hidden within the city However, the search process used an arbitrary criteria for identifying former Chinese soldiers Chinese males who were deemed to be in good health were automatically presumed to be a soldier During this operation, Japanese forces committed atrocities against the Chinese population [51]\n\n\nCivilian population and evacuation\nWith the relocation of the capital of China, constant bombing raids, and reports of Japanese brutality, much of Nanjing's civilian population had fled out of fear Wealthy families were the first to flee, leaving Nanjing in automobiles, followed by the evacuation of the middle class and then the poor Those that remained were mainly the destitute lowest class such as the ethnic Tanka boat people, and those with assets that could not be easily moved, like shopkeepers [9]\n\n\nMassacre\nFrom December 13, 1937, the Japanese Army engaged in random murder, torture, wartime rape, looting, arson, and other war crimes Such crime continued from three to six weeks depending on the types of crime The first three weeks were more intense [note 1] A group of foreign expatriates headed by Rabe had formed a 15-man International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone on November 22 and mapped out the Nanking Safety Zone in order to safeguard civilians in the city [56]\n\n\nCauses\nThe Nanjing Massacre's occurrence and nature were influenced by several factors The Japanese population was taught militaristic and racist ideologies The Japanese government's fascist doctrine further propagated the belief in Japanese superiority over all other peoples Other factors include the dehumanization of Japanese soldiers by their commanders and the challenging combat environment in China [57]\n\n\nMassacre contest\nIn 1937, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun and its sister newspaper, the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, covered a contest between two Japanese officers, Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda of the Japanese 16th Division The two men were described as vying to be the first to kill 100 people with a sword before the capture of Nanjing From Jurong to Tangshan (two cities in Jiangsu Province, China), Mukai had killed 89 people while Noda had killed 78 The contest continued because neither had killed 100 people By the time they had arrived at Zijin Mountain, Noda had killed 105 people while Mukai had killed 106 people Both officers supposedly surpassed their goal during the heat of battle, making it impossible to determine which officer had actually won the contest Therefore, according to journalists Asami Kazuo and Suzuki Jiro, writing in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun of December 13, they decided to begin another contest to kill 150 people [64]\n\n\nRape\nThe International Military Tribunal for the Far East estimated that in the first month of the occupation, Japanese soldiers committed approximately 20,000 cases of rape in the city [67] Some estimates claim 80,000 cases of rape [4] According to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, rapes of all ages, including children and elderly women, were commonplace, and there were many instances of sadistic and violent behavior related to these rapes Following the rapes, many women were killed and their bodies were mutilated [68] A large number of rapes were done systematically by the Japanese soldiers as they went from door to door, searching for girls, with many women being captured and gang-raped [69]\n\n\nMassacre of civilians\nFor about three weeks since December 13, 1937, [7] the Imperial Japanese Army entered the Nanking Safety Zone to search for former Chinese soldiers hidden among refugees Many innocent men were misidentified and killed [7]\n\n\nExtrajudicial killing of Chinese prisoners of war and male civilians\nSoon after the fall of the city, Japanese troops made a thorough search for Chinese soldiers and summarily arrested thousands of young Chinese men Many were taken to the Yangtze River, where they were machine-gunned to death What was probably the single largest massacre of Chinese troops, the Straw String Gorge Massacre, occurred along the banks of the Yangtze River on December 18 For most of the morning, Japanese soldiers tied the POWs' hands together At dusk, the soldiers divided POWs into four columns and opened fire Unable to escape, the POWs could only scream and thrash desperately It took an hour for the sounds of death to stop and even longer for the Japanese to bayonet each individual The majority of the bodies were dumped directly into the Yangtze River [96]\n\n\nLooting and arson\n\"In the first days of the occupation the soldiers  [...] took a great deal of bedding, cooking utensils and food from the refugees Practically every building in the city was entered many, many times by these roving gangs of soldiers throughout the first six or seven weeks of the occupation\" [7] \" [T]here was no burning until the Japanese troops had been in the city five or six days Beginning, I believe, on the 19th or 20th of December, burning was carried on regularly for six weeks.\" [7]\n\n\nNanking Safety Zone and the role of foreigners\nThe Japanese troops did respect the Zone to an extent; until the Japanese occupation, no shells entered that part of the city except a few stray shots During the chaos following the attack of the city, some were killed in the Safety Zone, but the crimes that occurred in the rest of the city were far greater by all accounts [107]\n\n\nLiterature\nEyewitness accounts include testimonies of expatriates engaged in humanitarian work (mostly physicians, professors, missionary and businessmen), journalists (both Western and Japanese), as well as the field diaries of military personnel American missionary John Magee stayed behind to provide a 16 mm film documentary and first-hand photographs of the Nanjing Massacre Rabe and American missionary Lewis S C Smythe, secretary of the International Committee and a professor of sociology at the University of Nanjing, recorded the actions of the Japanese troops and filed complaints with the Japanese embassy.\n\n\nMatsui's reaction to the massacre\n\nOn December 18, 1937, as General Iwane Matsui began to comprehend the full extent of the rape, torture, murder, and looting in the city, he grew increasingly dismayed He reportedly told one of his civilian aides:\n\nEnd of the massacre\nIn late January 1938, the Japanese army forced all refugees in the Safety Zone to return home, immediately claiming to have \"restored order\" After the establishment of the weixin zhengfu(Chinese: 维新政府; pinyin: Wéixīn zhèngfǔ) (the collaborating government) in 1938, order was gradually restored in Nanjing and atrocities by Japanese troops lessened considerably [citation needed]\n\n\nRecall of Matsui and Asaka\nIn February 1938, both Prince Asaka and General Matsui were recalled to Japan Matsui returned to retirement, but Prince Asaka remained on the Supreme War Council until the end of the war in August 1945 He was promoted to the rank of general in August 1939, though he held no further military commands [46]\n\n\nEvidence collection\nThe Japanese either destroyed or concealed important documents, severely reducing the amount of evidence available for confiscation Between the declaration of a ceasefire on August 15, 1945, and the arrival of American troops in Japan on August 28, \"the Japanese military and civil authorities systematically destroyed military, naval, and\ngovernment archives, much of which was from the period 1942–1945.\" [115] Overseas troops in the Pacific and East Asia were ordered to destroy incriminating evidence of war crimes [115] Approximately 70 percent of the Japanese army's wartime records were destroyed [115]\nIn regards to the Nanjing Massacre, Japanese authorities deliberately concealed wartime records, eluding confiscation from American authorities [116] Some of the concealed information was made public a few decades later For example, a two-volume collection of military documents related to the Nanjing operations was published in 1989; and disturbing excerpts from Kesago Nakajima's diary, a commander at Nanjing, was published in the early 1980s [116]\n\n\nDeath toll estimates\nNumerous factors complicate the estimation of an accurate death toll [122] [123]\n\n\nRange and duration\nThe duration of the incident is naturally defined by its geography: the earlier the Japanese entered the area, the longer the duration The Battle of Nanking ended on December 13, when the divisions of the Japanese Army entered the walled city of Nanjing The Tokyo War Crime Tribunal defined the period of the massacre to the ensuing six weeks More conservative estimates say that the massacre started on December 14, when the troops entered the Safety Zone, and that it lasted for six weeks Historians who define the Nanjing Massacre as having started from the time that the Japanese Army entered Jiangsu province push the beginning of the massacre to around mid-November to early December (Suzhou fell on November 19), and extended the end of the massacre to late March 1938 [citation needed]\n\n\nWar crimes tribunals\nShortly after the surrender of Japan, the primary officers in charge of the Japanese troops at Nanjing were put on trial General Matsui was indicted before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East for \"deliberately and recklessly\" ignoring his legal duty \"to take adequate steps to secure the observance and prevent breaches\" of the Hague Convention.\n\n\nGrant of immunity to Prince Asaka\nOn May 1, 1946, SCAP officials interrogated Prince Asaka, who was the ranking officer in the city at the height of the atrocities, about his involvement in the Nanjing Massacre and the deposition was submitted to the International Prosecution Section of the Tokyo tribunal Asaka denied the existence of any massacre and claimed never to have received complaints about the conduct of his troops [144]\n\n\nEvidence and testimony\nThe prosecution began the Nanjing phase of its case in July 1946 Dr Robert O Wilson, a surgeon and a member of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone, testified [145]\nOther members of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone who took the witness stand included Miner Searle Bates [146] and John Magee [147] George A Fitch, [148] Lewis S C Smythe, [149] and James McCallum filed affidavits with their diaries and letters [150]\n\n\nMatsui's defense\nMatsui asserted that he had never ordered the execution of Chinese POWs He further argued that he had directed his army division commanders to discipline their troops for criminal acts, and was not responsible for their failure to carry out his directives At trial, Matsui went out of his way to protect Prince Asaka by shifting blame to lower-ranking division commanders [152]\n\n\nVerdict\nKōki Hirota, Prime Minister of Japan at an earlier stage of the war, and a diplomat during the atrocities at Nanjing, was convicted of participating in \"the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy\" (count 1), waging \"a war of aggression and a war in violation of international laws, treaties, agreements and assurances against the Republic of China\" (count 27) and count 55 Matsui was convicted by a majority of the judges at the Tokyo tribunal who ruled that he bore ultimate responsibility for the \"orgy of crime\" at Nanjing because, \"He did nothing, or nothing effective, to abate these horrors.\"\n\n\nSentence\nOn November 12, 1948, Matsui and Hirota, along with five other convicted Class-A war criminals, were sentenced to death by hanging Eighteen others received lesser sentences The death sentence imposed on Hirota, a six-to-five decision by the eleven judges, shocked the general public and prompted a petition on his behalf, which soon gathered over 300,000 signatures but did not succeed in commuting the Minister's sentence All of them were hanged on 23 December 1948 [153] [154]\n\n\nOther trials\nHisao Tani, a lieutenant general for the 6th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, was tried by the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal in China [152] He was found guilty of war crimes, sentenced to death, and executed by shooting on 26 April 1947 However, according to historian Tokushi Kasahara, the evidence used to convict Hisao Tani was not convincing [155] Kasahara said that if there was a full investigation of the massacre, many other high ranking authorities, which include higher level commanders, army leaders and emperor Hirohito, could have been implicated [155]\n\n\nMemorials\nOn October 9, 2015, Documents of the Nanjing Massacre have been listed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register [137]\n\n\nControversy\nAccording to Japanese historian Fujiwara Akira, \"When Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration and surrendered in August 1945, the state officially acknowledged the war of aggression and the Nanjing massacre committed by the Japanese army.\" [162]\n\n\nDebate in Japan\nDavid Askew, formerly an associate professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, noted that in Japan views concerning the massacre were divided between two mutually exclusive groups The \"Great Massacre School\" group accepts the findings of the Tokyo Trials, and concludes that there were at least 200,000 casualties and at least 20,000 rape cases; whereas \"The Illusion School\" group rejects the tribunal's findings as \"victor's justice\" According to Askew, the \"Great Massacre School\" is more sophisticated, and the credibility of its conclusions are supported by a large number of authoritative academics [163] Askew estimates that the city's population was 224,500 from December 24, 1937, to January 5, 1938 [164]\n\n\nDenials of the massacre in Japan\nFor the past several decades, Japanese politicians who express no remorse for the Nanjing massacre have exacerbated ongoing tensions in Sino-Japanese relations, with numerous Japanese government officials and a few historians in Japan either denying or dismissing the atrocity [172] [173] [174] [175]\n\n\nLegacy\nThe memory of the Nanjing Massacre has been a point of contention in Sino-Japanese relations since the early 1970s [180] Trade between the two nations is worth over $200 billion annually Despite this, many Chinese people still have a strong sense of mistrust due to the memory of the atrocity and failure of reconciliation measures This sense of mistrust is strengthened by Japan's unwillingness to admit to and apologize for the atrocities [181]\n\n\nEffect on international relations\nThe memory of the Nanjing Massacre has been a point of contention in Sino-Japanese relations since the early 1970s [180] Trade between the two nations is worth over $200 billion annually Despite this, many Chinese people still have a strong sense of mistrust due to the memory of the atrocity and failure of reconciliation measures This sense of mistrust is strengthened by Japan's unwillingness to admit to and apologize for the atrocities [181]\n\n\nAs a component of national identity\nYoshida asserts that \"Nanjing has figured in the attempts of all three nations  [China, Japan and the United States] to preserve and redefine national and ethnic pride and identity, assuming different kinds of significance based on each country's changing internal and external enemies.\" [191]\n\n\nChina\nIris Chang, In her book Rape of Nanjing, asserted that the politics of the Cold War encouraged Chairman Mao to stay relatively silent about Nanjing in order to keep a trade relationship with Japan [192] Jung Chang and Jon Halliday's biography of Mao claims Mao never made any comment either contemporaneously or later in his life about the massacre, but did frequently remark with enduring bitterness about a political struggle between himself and Wang Ming which also occurred in December 1937 [193]\n\n\nJapan\nFollowing the end of World War II, some circles of civil society in Japan reflected on the extent of the massacre and the participation of ordinary soldiers Notably, the novelist Hotta Yoshie  [ja] wrote a novel, Time (Jikan) in 1953, portraying the massacre from the point of view of a Chinese intellectual watching it happen This novel has been translated into Chinese and Russian Other eyewitnesses to the massacre also expressed their opinions in Japanese magazines in the 1950s and 1960s, but political shifts slowly eroded this tide of confessions.\n\n\nAustralia\nDockworkers in Australia were horrified by the massacre and refused to load pig iron onto ships heading for Japan, leading to the Dalfram Dispute of 1938 [207]\n\n\nRecords\nIn December 2007, the PRC government published the names of 13,000 people who were killed by Japanese troops in the Nanjing Massacre According to Xinhua News Agency, it is the most complete record to date The report consists of eight volumes and was released to mark the 70th anniversary of the start of the massacre It also lists the Japanese army units that were responsible for each of the deaths and states the way in which the victims were killed Zhang Xianwen, editor-in-chief of the report, states that the information collected was based on \"a combination of Chinese, Japanese and Western raw materials, which is objective and just and is able to stand the trial of history\" [208] This report formed part of a 55-volume series about the massacre, the Collection of Historical Materials of Nanjing Massacre (南京大屠杀史料集 pinyin: Nánjīng dà túshā shǐliào jí) [209]\n\n\nSee also\n32°03′N

{"title": "Al-Aqsa_Mosque", "content": "\nDefinition\nThe \"Al-Aqsa Mosque\" translates into \"the Farthest Mosque\" in English.\n\n\nHistory\nThe mosque is located on the southern part of the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif, an enclosure expanded by King Herod the Great beginning in 20 BCE during his reconstruction of the Second Jewish Temple [28] The mosque resides on an artificial platform that is supported by arches constructed by Herod's engineers to overcome the difficult topographic conditions resulting from the southward expansion of the enclosure into the Tyropoeon and Kidron valleys [29] During the late Second Temple period, the present site of the mosque was occupied by the Royal Stoa, a basilica running the southern wall of the enclosure [29] The Royal Stoa was destroyed along with the Temple during the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE.\n\n\nPre-construction\nThe mosque is located on the southern part of the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif, an enclosure expanded by King Herod the Great beginning in 20 BCE during his reconstruction of the Second Jewish Temple [28] The mosque resides on an artificial platform that is supported by arches constructed by Herod's engineers to overcome the difficult topographic conditions resulting from the southward expansion of the enclosure into the Tyropoeon and Kidron valleys [29] During the late Second Temple period, the present site of the mosque was occupied by the Royal Stoa, a basilica running the southern wall of the enclosure [29] The Royal Stoa was destroyed along with the Temple during the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE.\n\n\nUmayyad period\nA mostly wooden, rectangular mosque on the Temple Mount site with a capacity for 3,000 worshippers is attested by the Gallic monk Arculf during his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in c. 679–682 [36] [37] Its precise location is not known [37] The art historian Oleg Grabar deems it likely that it was close to the present mosque, [37] while the historian Yildirim Yavuz asserts it stood at the present site of the Dome of Rock [38] The architectural historian K A C Creswell notes that Arculf's attestation lends credibility to claims by some Islamic traditions and medieval Christian chronicles, which he otherwise deems legendary or unreliable, that the second Rashidun caliph, Umar (r. 634–644), ordered the construction of a primitive mosque on the Temple Mount However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of Caliph Mu'awiya I (r. 661–680), founder of the Syria-based Umayyad Caliphate [36] Mu'awiya had been governor of Syria, including Palestine, for about twenty years before becoming caliph and his accession ceremony was held in Jerusalem The 10th-century Jerusalemite scholar al-Mutahhar ibn Tahir al-Maqdisi claims Mu'awiya built a mosque on the Haram [39]\n\n\nAbbasid period\nThe Abbasids generally exhibited little interest in Jerusalem, [56] though the historian Shelomo Dov Goitein notes they \"paid special tribute\" to the city during the early part of their rule, [54] and Grabar asserts that the early Abbasids' work on the mosque suggests \"a major attempt to assert Abbasid sponsorship of holy places\" [57] Nevertheless, in contrast to the Umayyad period, maintenance of the al-Aqsa Mosque during Abbasid rule often came at the initiative of the local Muslim community, rather than from the caliph [55] [48] The second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur (r. 754–775), visited Jerusalem in 758, on his return from the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca He found the structures on the Haram in ruins from the 746 earthquake, including the al-Aqsa Mosque According to the tradition cited by Mujir al-Din, the caliph was beseeched by the city's Muslim residents to fund the buildings' restoration In response, he had the gold and silver plaques covering the mosque's doors converted into dinars and dirhams to finance the reconstruction [56]\n\n\nFatimid period\nIn 970, the Egypt-based Fatimid Caliphate conquered Palestine from the Ikhshidids, nominal allegiants of the Abbasids Unlike the Abbasids and the Muslim inhabitants of Jerusalem, who were Sunnis, the Fatimids followed Shia Islam in its Isma'ili form [64] In 1033, another earthquake severely damaged the mosque The Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036) had the mosque reconstructed between 1034 and 1036, though work was not completed until 1065, during the reign of Caliph al-Mustansir (r. 1036–1094) [57]\n\n\nCrusader/Ayyubid period\nJerusalem was captured by the Crusaders in 1099, during the First Crusade They named the mosque Templum Solomonis (Solomon's Temple), distinguishing it from the Dome of the Rock, which they named Templum Domini (Temple of God) While the Dome of the Rock was turned into a Christian church under the care of the Augustinians, [79] the al-Aqsa Mosque was used as a royal palace and also as a stable for horses In 1119, the Crusader king accommodated the headquarters of the Knights Templar next to his palace within the building During this period, the mosque underwent some structural changes, including the expansion of its northern porch, and the addition of an apse and a dividing wall A new cloister and church were also built at the site, along with various other structures [80] The Templars constructed vaulted western and eastern annexes to the building; the western currently serves as the women's mosque and the eastern as the Islamic Museum [81]\n\n\nOttoman/modern period\nAfter the Ottomans assumed power in 1517, they did not undertake any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but they did to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole This included the building of the Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527), the restoration of the Pool of Raranj, and the building of three free-standing domes—the most notable being the Dome of the Prophet built in 1538 All construction was ordered by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem and not the sultans themselves [84] The sultans did make additions to existing minarets, however [84]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe rectangular al-Aqsa Mosque and its precincts cover 14.4 hectares (36 acres), although the mosque itself is about 1.1 acres (0.46 ha) in area and can hold up to 5,000 worshippers [96] It is 83 m (272 ft) long, 56 m (184 ft) wide [96] Unlike the Dome of the Rock, which reflects classical Byzantine architecture, the Aqsa Mosque is characteristic of early Islamic architecture [97]\n\n\nDome\nNothing remains of the original dome built by Abd al-Malik The present-day dome mimicks that of az-Zahir, which consisted of wood plated with lead enamelwork, but which was destroyed by fire in 1969 Today it is made of concrete with lead sheeting [92]\n\n\nFacade and porch\nThe facade of the mosque was built in 1065 CE on the instructions of the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir Billah It was crowned with a balustrade consisting of arcades and small columns The Crusaders damaged the facade, but it was restored and renovated by the Ayyubids One addition was the covering of the facade with tiles [81] The second-hand material of the facade's arches includes sculpted, ornamental material taken from Crusader structures in Jerusalem [99] The facade consists of fourteen stone arches, [100] [dubious – discuss] most of which are of a Romanesque style The outer arches added by the Mamluks follow the same general design The entrance to the mosque is through the facade's central arch [101]\n\n\nInterior\nThe al-Aqsa Mosque has seven aisles of hypostyle naves with several additional small halls to the west and east of the southern section of the building [102] There are 121 stained glass windows in the mosque from the Abbasid and Fatimid eras About a fourth of them were restored in 1924 [86] The spandrels of the arch opposite the main entrance include a mosaic decoration and inscription dating back to Fatimid period [103]\n\n\nMinbar\nThe minbar of the mosque was built by a craftsman named Akhtarini from Aleppo on the orders of the Zengid sultan Nur ad-Din It was intended to be a gift for the mosque when Nur ad-Din would capture Jerusalem from the Crusaders and took six years to build (1168–74) Nur ad-Din died and the Crusaders still controlled Jerusalem, but in 1187, Saladin captured the city and the minbar was installed The structure was made of ivory and carefully crafted wood Arabic calligraphy, geometrical and floral designs were inscribed in the woodwork [104]\n\n\nCurrent situation\nThe administrative body responsible for the whole Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is known as \"the Jerusalem Waqf\", an organ of the Jordanian government [107]\n\n\nAdministration\nThe administrative body responsible for the whole Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is known as \"the Jerusalem Waqf\", an organ of the Jordanian government [107]\n\n\nAccess\nMuslims who are residents of Israel or visiting the country and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally allowed to enter the Temple Mount and pray at al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions [111] Due to security measures, the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time At times, restrictions have prevented all men under 45, unmarried men under 50 and women under 45 from entering Sometimes the restrictions are enforced on the occasion of Friday prayers, [112] [113] other times they are over an extended period of time [112] [114] [115] Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank The Israeli government states that the restrictions are in place for security reasons [111]\n\n\nExcavations\nSeveral excavations outside the Temple Mount took place following the 1967 War In 1970, Israeli authorities commenced intensive excavations outside the walls next to the mosque on the southern and western sides Palestinians believed that tunnels were being dug under the Aqsa Mosque in order to undermine its foundations, which was denied by Israelis, who claimed that the closest excavation to the mosque was some 70 meters (230 ft) to its south [117] The Archaeological Department of the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs dug a tunnel near the western portion of the mosque in 1984 [118] According to UNESCO's special envoy to Jerusalem Oleg Grabar, buildings and structures on the Temple Mount are deteriorating due mostly to disputes between the Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian governments over who is actually responsible for the site [119]\n\n\nConflicts\nIn April 2021, during both Passover and Ramadan, the site was a focus of tension between Israeli settlers and Palestinians Jewish settlers broke an agreement between Israel and Jordan and performed prayers and read from the Torah inside the compound, an area normally off limits to non-Muslims [123] On 14 April, Israeli police entered the area and forcibly cut wires to speakers in minarets around the mosque, silencing the call to prayer, claiming the sound was interfering with an event by the Israeli president at the Western Wall [124] On 16 April, seventy thousand Muslims prayed in the compound around the mosque, the largest gathering since the beginning of the COVID pandemic; police barred most from entering the structure itself [125] In May 2021, hundreds of Palestinians were injured following clashes in the compound after reports of Israel's intention to proceed to evict Palestinians from land claimed by Israeli settlers [126] [127]\n\n\nSee also\nIn the

to overcome the difficult topographic conditions resulting from the southward expansion of the enclosure into the Tyropoeon and Kidron valleys [29] During the late Second Temple period, the present site of the mosque was occupied by the Royal Stoa, a basilica running the southern wall of the enclosure [29] The Royal Stoa was destroyed along with the Temple during the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE.\n\n\nUmayyad period\nA mostly wooden, rectangular mosque on the Temple Mount site with a capacity for 3,000 worshippers is attested by the Gallic monk Arculf during his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in c. 679–682 [36] [37] Its precise location is not known [37] The art historian Oleg Grabar deems it likely that it was close to the present mosque, [37] while the historian Yildirim Yavuz asserts it stood at the present site of the Dome of Rock [38] The architectural historian K A C Creswell notes that Arculf's attestation lends credibility to claims by some Islamic traditions and medieval Christian chronicles, which he otherwise deems legendary or unreliable, that the second Rashidun caliph, Umar (r. 634–644), ordered the construction of a primitive mosque on the Temple Mount However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of Caliph Mu'awiya I (r. 661–680), founder of the Syria-based Umayyad Caliphate [36] Mu'awiya had been governor of Syria, including Palestine, for about twenty years before becoming caliph and his accession ceremony was held in Jerusalem The 10th-century Jerusalemite scholar al-Mutahhar ibn Tahir al-Maqdisi claims Mu'awiya built a mosque on the Haram [39]\n\n\nAbbasid period\nThe Abbasids generally exhibited little interest in Jerusalem, [56] though the historian Shelomo Dov Goitein notes they \"paid special tribute\" to the city during the early part of their rule, [54] and Grabar asserts that the early Abbasids' work on the mosque suggests \"a major attempt to assert Abbasid sponsorship of holy places\" [57] Nevertheless, in contrast to the Umayyad period, maintenance of the al-Aqsa Mosque during Abbasid rule often came at the initiative of the local Muslim community, rather than from the caliph [55] [48] The second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur (r. 754–775), visited Jerusalem in 758, on his return from the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca He found the structures on the Haram in ruins from the 746 earthquake, including the al-Aqsa Mosque According to the tradition cited by Mujir al-Din, the caliph was beseeched by the city's Muslim residents to fund the buildings' restoration In response, he had the gold and silver plaques covering the mosque's doors converted into dinars and dirhams to finance the reconstruction [56]\n\n\nFatimid period\nIn 970, the Egypt-based Fatimid Caliphate conquered Palestine from the Ikhshidids, nominal allegiants of the Abbasids Unlike the Abbasids and the Muslim inhabitants of Jerusalem, who were Sunnis, the Fatimids followed Shia Islam in its Isma'ili form [64] In 1033, another earthquake severely damaged the mosque The Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021–1036) had the mosque reconstructed between 1034 and 1036, though work was not completed until 1065, during the reign of Caliph al-Mustansir (r. 1036–1094) [57]\n\n\nCrusader/Ayyubid period\nJerusalem was captured by the Crusaders in 1099, during the First Crusade They named the mosque Templum Solomonis (Solomon's Temple), distinguishing it from the Dome of the Rock, which they named Templum Domini (Temple of God) While the Dome of the Rock was turned into a Christian church under the care of the Augustinians, [79] the al-Aqsa Mosque was used as a royal palace and also as a stable for horses In 1119, the Crusader king accommodated the headquarters of the Knights Templar next to his palace within the building During this period, the mosque underwent some structural changes, including the expansion of its northern porch, and the addition of an apse and a dividing wall A new cloister and church were also built at the site, along with various other structures [80] The Templars constructed vaulted western and eastern annexes to the building; the western currently serves as the women's mosque and the eastern as the Islamic Museum [81]\n\n\nOttoman/modern period\nAfter the Ottomans assumed power in 1517, they did not undertake any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but they did to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole This included the building of the Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527), the restoration of the Pool of Raranj, and the building of three free-standing domes—the most notable being the Dome of the Prophet built in 1538 All construction was ordered by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem and not the sultans themselves [84] The sultans did make additions to existing minarets, however [84]\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe rectangular al-Aqsa Mosque and its precincts cover 14.4 hectares (36 acres), although the mosque itself is about 1.1 acres (0.46 ha) in area and can hold up to 5,000 worshippers [96] It is 83 m (272 ft) long, 56 m (184 ft) wide [96] Unlike the Dome of the Rock, which reflects classical Byzantine architecture, the Aqsa Mosque is characteristic of early Islamic architecture [97]\n\n\nDome\nNothing remains of the original dome built by Abd al-Malik The present-day dome mimicks that of az-Zahir, which consisted of wood plated with lead enamelwork, but which was destroyed by fire in 1969 Today it is made of concrete with lead sheeting [92]\n\n\nFacade and porch\nThe facade of the mosque was built in 1065 CE on the instructions of the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir Billah It was crowned with a balustrade consisting of arcades and small columns The Crusaders damaged the facade, but it was restored and renovated by the Ayyubids One addition was the covering of the facade with tiles [81] The second-hand material of the facade's arches includes sculpted, ornamental material taken from Crusader structures in Jerusalem [99] The facade consists of fourteen stone arches, [100] [dubious – discuss] most of which are of a Romanesque style The outer arches added by the Mamluks follow the same general design The entrance to the mosque is through the facade's central arch [101]\n\n\nInterior\nThe al-Aqsa Mosque has seven aisles of hypostyle naves with several additional small halls to the west and east of the southern section of the building [102] There are 121 stained glass windows in the mosque from the Abbasid and Fatimid eras About a fourth of them were restored in 1924 [86] The spandrels of the arch opposite the main entrance include a mosaic decoration and inscription dating back to Fatimid period [103]\n\n\nMinbar\nThe minbar of the mosque was built by a craftsman named Akhtarini from Aleppo on the orders of the Zengid sultan Nur ad-Din It was intended to be a gift for the mosque when Nur ad-Din would capture Jerusalem from the Crusaders and took six years to build (1168–74) Nur ad-Din died and the Crusaders still controlled Jerusalem, but in 1187, Saladin captured the city and the minbar was installed The structure was made of ivory and carefully crafted wood Arabic calligraphy, geometrical and floral designs were inscribed in the woodwork [104]\n\n\nCurrent situation\nThe administrative body responsible for the whole Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is known as \"the Jerusalem Waqf\", an organ of the Jordanian government [107]\n\n\nAdministration\nThe administrative body responsible for the whole Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is known as \"the Jerusalem Waqf\", an organ of the Jordanian government [107]\n\n\nAccess\nMuslims who are residents of Israel or visiting the country and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally allowed to enter the Temple Mount and pray at al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions [111] Due to security measures, the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time At times, restrictions have prevented all men under 45, unmarried men under 50 and women under 45 from entering Sometimes the restrictions are enforced on the occasion of Friday prayers, [112] [113] other times they are over an extended period of time [112] [114] [115] Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank The Israeli government states that the restrictions are in place for security reasons [111]\n\n\nExcavations\nSeveral excavations outside the Temple Mount took place following the 1967 War In 1970, Israeli authorities commenced intensive excavations outside the walls next to the mosque on the southern and western sides Palestinians believed that tunnels were being dug under the Aqsa Mosque in order to undermine its foundations, which was denied by Israelis, who claimed that the closest excavation to the mosque was some 70 meters (230 ft) to its south [117] The Archaeological Department of the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs dug a tunnel near the western portion of the mosque in 1984 [118] According to UNESCO's special envoy to Jerusalem Oleg Grabar, buildings and structures on the Temple Mount are deteriorating due mostly to disputes between the Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian governments over who is actually responsible for the site [119]\n\n\nConflicts\nIn April 2021, during both Passover and Ramadan, the site was a focus of tension between Israeli settlers and Palestinians Jewish settlers broke an agreement between Israel and Jordan and performed prayers and read from the Torah inside the compound, an area normally off limits to non-Muslims [123] On 14 April, Israeli police entered the area and forcibly cut wires to speakers in minarets around the mosque, silencing the call to prayer, claiming the sound was interfering with an event by the Israeli president at the Western Wall [124] On 16 April, seventy thousand Muslims prayed in the compound around the mosque, the largest gathering since the beginning of the COVID pandemic; police barred most from entering the structure itself [125] In May 2021, hundreds of Palestinians were injured following clashes in the compound after reports of Israel's intention to proceed to evict Palestinians from land claimed by Israeli settlers [126] [127]\n\n\nSee also\nIn the name of God, the Compassionate, the

The university was founded in 1887 by Italian-American Joseph Cataldo, who had come to the Pacific Northwest as a Jesuit missionary in 1865. Over the years, Gonzaga has grown to become one of the top universities in the United States, known for its strong academic programs, research opportunities, and commitment to social justice.\n\n**History**\n\nGonzaga University was founded in 1887 by Italian-American Joseph Cataldo, who had come to the Pacific Northwest as a Jesuit missionary in 1865. Cataldo was concerned about the influence and expansion of Protestant schools on the region's native people, and by 1881 was discussing building a Jesuit college with other Jesuit leaders. In 1880, Cataldo built a schoolhouse on the Peone Prairie, about 10 to 12 miles northeast of Spokane, to serve children of the Upper Spokane Indians. The schoolhouse was the beginning of Gonzaga University, which would eventually grow to become a full-fledged university.\n\n**Founding**\n\nThe founding of Gonzaga University was a significant event in the history of the Pacific Northwest. The university was established to provide education to the region's native people, as well as to offer a Catholic education to the growing number of European-American settlers. The university's early years were marked by challenges, including a lack of resources and a limited student body. However, the university persevered, and by the end of the 19th century, it had established itself as a reputable institution of higher learning.\n\n**Inaugural Class**\n\nThe inaugural class of Gonzaga University consisted of seven boys, who were taught by 17 faculty members, including Jesuit priests and scholastics.

The scandal rocked the university and the Catholic Church, and led to a number of changes in the way that the university and the Church handle allegations of abuse.\n\n**Presidents**\n\nGonzaga University has had a number of notable presidents over the years. One of the most notable was Father James Rebmann, who served as the university's first president from 1887 to 1893.

Rivera was a renowned Mexican-American singer, songwriter, and actress who rose to fame in the 1990s and became one of the most successful and beloved artists in the Latin music industry. Born on July 2, 1969, in Long Beach, California, Rivera was the daughter of a Mexican immigrant family and was raised in a musical household, where she was exposed to traditional Mexican music from a young age.\n\n**Life and Career**\n\nRivera's early life was marked by a tight-knit, musical household, where her parents, Rosa Saavedra and Pedro Rivera, encouraged her to pursue her passion for music. Her brother Lupillo was also a regional Mexican musician, and Rivera's family introduced her to traditional Mexican music, including banda, norteña, and ranchera. She earned straight A's in school until her sophomore year, when she became pregnant with her first child, Janney \"Chiquis\" Marín-Rivera, at the age of 15.\n\nRivera supported her child and herself by selling CDs at flea markets and working towards her GED at a continuation school, graduating as class valedictorian. She later married the baby's father, José Trinidad Marín, and had two more children, Jacqueline and Michael. However, the marriage ended in 1992, citing physical and emotional abuse.\n\n**Music Career**\n\nRivera's music career began in 1992, when she recorded a Father's Day present for her father. She made more recordings and signed with Capitol/EMI's Latin division. Her first album, \"Somos Rivera,\" was released in 1992 and marked the beginning of her successful music career. Rivera's subsequent albums, including \"Parrandera, Rebelde y Atrevida\" and \"La Gran Señora,\" solidified her position as one of the leading artists in the Latin music industry.\n\nRivera's music style was classified as banda, a form of traditional Mexican music popular in Mexico and parts of the United States with large Hispanic populations. However, her music contained a contemporary, outspoken flair, and she sang in both Spanish and English, often addressing personal themes such as domestic violence, divorce, and her weight.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRivera was married three times and had five children.

{"title": "Matt_Gaetz", "content": "\nEarly life and career\nMatthew Louis Gaetz II was born on May 7, 1982, in Hollywood, Florida, to Victoria (née Quertermous) and Don Gaetz, who later became a prominent local politician [14] [15] [16]\n\n\nFlorida House of Representatives\nIn March 2010, after Republican state representative Ray Sansom's resignation on corruption charges in February 2010, [29] Gaetz ran in the special election to succeed Sansom in the 4th district, which included southern Santa Rosa County and Okaloosa County [30] In a crowded Republican primary that included Craig Barker, Kabe Woods, Jerry G Melvin, and Bill Garvie, Gaetz won with 43 percent of the vote [30] In the special general election, Gaetz defeated Democratic nominee Jan Fernald with 66 percent of the vote [31] During his campaign, Gaetz received almost $480,000 in contributions, about five times more than anyone else in the field, and almost 50 times more than Fernald, including $100,000 of his own money [26]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\nIn 2013, Gaetz announced that, in 2016, he would run for the 1st district State Senate seat held by his father, Don Gaetz, who was term-limited in 2016 [47] On March 21, 2016, Gaetz withdrew from the race, choosing instead to run for the U.S House seat representing Florida's 1st congressional district; the incumbent, Jeff Miller, had announced 11 days earlier that he would not seek reelection [48]\n\n\nElections\nIn 2013, Gaetz announced that, in 2016, he would run for the 1st district State Senate seat held by his father, Don Gaetz, who was term-limited in 2016 [47] On March 21, 2016, Gaetz withdrew from the race, choosing instead to run for the U.S House seat representing Florida's 1st congressional district; the incumbent, Jeff Miller, had announced 11 days earlier that he would not seek reelection [48]\n\n\nTenure\nOn September 25, 2016, following the death of Miami Marlins pitcher José Fernández, Gaetz criticized the athletes protesting during the national anthem in a tweet [51] [52]\n\n\n2023 speakership election\nIn the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans regained a narrow House majority Although sitting minority Leader Kevin McCarthy sought the speakership and had the support of 213 members, he needed five more votes to reach a majority to be elected Certain members of the Freedom Caucus, including Gaetz, could contribute the required margin Democrats held 212 votes, with one seat unfilled due to the November death of a holdover incumbent The anti-McCarthy members withheld more than four votes through 14 ballots They were thought to be holding out for substantial concessions regarding House rules and committee chair assignments Their withholding of votes prevented McCarthy earning a majority of votes needed for the speakership [72] Thirteen months earlier, Gaetz had discussed with former president Trump the possibility of getting Trump elected to the speakership, for which House membership is not required [73] Gaetz nominated him once and voted for Trump on the 7th, 8th and 11th ballots [74] After midnight, January 7, on the 15th and last ballot, Gaetz switched his vote to \"present\", lowering the number of votes McCarthy needed and allowing him to win the speakership [75]\n\n\nRemoval of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House, ethics committee investigation\nOn October 2, 2023, Gaetz filed a resolution to oust McCarthy from his role as speaker of the U.S House of Representatives after the latter had negotiated with Democrats to pass a shutdown-averting continuing resolution which did not include fiscally conservative reforms Gaetz's resolution ended up passing by a vote of 216–210 [76] In April 2024, McCarthy accused Gaetz of filing the motion to oust him as a means of protecting himself against allegations of having had sex with a 17 year old minor [77] [78] [79] According to McCarthy, the House ethics committee had been investigating the case since 2021, prior to McCarthy's appointment as speaker of the House [80]\n\n\nEthics controversies\nOn February 26, 2019, the night before the scheduled public hearing of Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, before the House Oversight Committee, Gaetz directed a tweet to Cohen that implied without evidence that Cohen had had multiple extramarital affairs and also suggested his wife might be unfaithful while he was imprisoned due to new information disclosed to her [81] Other members of Congress saw the tweet as an attempt to intimidate a witness [82] [83] Gaetz initially defended his tweet, saying it was part of \"witness testing, not witness tampering\" and \"I don't threaten anybody.\" Asked to clarify, he said his \"tweet speaks for itself\" [84] [85] After sharp criticism from other members of Congress and an implicit rebuke by speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, [86] [87] Gaetz deleted the tweet and posted a tweet in which he apologized [85] [83] [88]\n\n\nCommittee assignments\nFor the 118th Congress: [105]\n\n\nCaucus memberships\nOn November 13, 2024, president-elect Trump announced he would nominate Gaetz to serve as United States attorney general [111] Gaetz resigned from the U.S House of Representatives shortly after the announcement [112] His nomination has led to surprise, alarm, and negative reception from multiple Senate Republicans, several of whom have indicated that they will not support it [113] [10]\n\n\nNomination for Attorney General\nOn November 13, 2024, president-elect Trump announced he would nominate Gaetz to serve as United States attorney general [111] Gaetz resigned from the U.S House of Representatives shortly after the announcement [112] His nomination has led to surprise, alarm, and negative reception from multiple Senate Republicans, several of whom have indicated that they will not support it [113] [10]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nGaetz has self-identified as a \"libertarian populist\" [1] Observers have described his views as far-right [3] In January 2018, Gaetz invited alt-right Holocaust denier Charles C Johnson to attend Donald Trump's State of the Union address [114] Johnson previously raised money for the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer [115] Gaetz defended Johnson in an interview, saying that Johnson was neither a Holocaust denier nor a white supremacist [114] Gaetz has endorsed the white nationalist Great Replacement theory In 2021, he called the Anti-Defamation League a \"racist organization\" after it condemned Tucker Carlson's promotion of Great Replacement theory Gaetz said that Carlson \"is CORRECT about Replacement Theory as he explains what is happening to America.\" [116] [117]\n\n\nCannabis\nGaetz has introduced legislation to reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act [120] [121] He has also introduced legislation to loosen federal restrictions on the cultivation of cannabis for research purposes [122] [123] Gaetz has criticized the federal government for having \"lied to the American people for a generation\" about the medical benefits of cannabis [124] As a member of the Florida House, he sponsored a bill, eventually signed into law, [125] to expand the state's Right to Try Act to include the medical use of cannabis [126] [127] In September 2017, Gaetz keynoted the American Medical Marijuana Physicians Association's annual conference [128]\n\n\nDonald Trump\nOn February 23, 2017, worried about protesters disrupting his appearance at his town hall in Pace, Florida, Gaetz prepared what his staffers called a nonverbal town hall He printed out part of his speech onto giant boards that he would hold up if he was unable to speak [136] Gaetz arrived 30 minutes late to the meeting, where at least 500 constituents crowded into a bowling alley At the meeting, he was questioned about his relationship with Trump, his stance on repealing the Affordable Care Act, and his proposal to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency He said that Trump should release his tax returns, but stopped short of saying Congress should subpoena them Gaetz closed his town hall by shouting Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again\" [137] [138] [139]\n\n\nMueller investigation\nIn November 2017, Gaetz introduced a congressional resolution calling for Robert Mueller to recuse himself as special counsel because of what were said to be conflicts of interest [152] He also asked for a special counsel investigation into the Federal Bureau of Investigation's handling of the Hillary Clinton email controversy, undue interference by U.S attorney general Loretta Lynch in the investigation, and the Russian state corporation Rosatom's acquisition of Uranium One during Mueller's time as FBI director [153] [154] Gaetz said he did not trust Mueller to lead the investigation because of Mueller's alleged involvement in approval of the Uranium One deal and alleged close relationship with dismissed FBI director James Comey, a probable person of interest in a proposed new investigation [155] [156]\n\n\nFirst impeachment of Donald Trump\nIn October 2019, Gaetz organized a \"storming\" of a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility on Capitol Hill by about two dozen Republican congressmen, including House minority whip Steve Scalise, in an effort to sit in on and hear the deposition of a Pentagon official during the impeachment inquiry into Trump The congressmens' cell phones and other devices put the secure facility, and U.S national security, at risk [162] [163] [164]\n\n\nSecond impeachment of Donald Trump\nOn January 7, 2021, after Trump supporters violently broke into the U.S Capitol, Gaetz falsely blamed antifa for the attack, suggesting that rioters were \"masquerading as Trump supporters\" [170] [171]\n\n\nSupport for impeaching President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas\nIn August 2021, Gaetz co-sponsored a resolution by Andy Biggs to impeach Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas [173] Later that month, Gaetz co-sponsored a resolution by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to impeach president Biden [174] In September 2022, he called impeaching Biden a \"priority\" [175] He expressed the belief that many Republicans in Congress were hesitant to impeach Biden, but that Republican voters would feel \"betrayed\" if they did not [176] Very early into the 118th Congress, Gaetz cosponsored another resolution to impeach Mayorkas [177] In May 2023, Gaetz co-sponsored resolutions by Marjorie Taylor Greene to impeach Biden and Mayorkas [178] [179]\n\n\nEconomy\nGaetz voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 [181] He acknowledged that the bill's pass-through tax deduction would benefit Trump, but added, \"so many Americans benefit when commercial real estate becomes easier and more accessible.\" [182]\n\n\nEnvironment\nIn 2016, Gaetz acknowledged global warming but said he disagrees with the scientific consensus on climate change that human activity is the primary cause [184] In April 2017, the Center for American Progress and Vice Media said Gaetz was a climate change denier, citing his 2016 statements [185] [non-primary source needed] [186]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn 2021, Gaetz was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'état that overwhelmingly

following month, Gaetz stated that the United States embassy in Niger was suppressing information related to the decay of Niger-United States diplomatic relations [201] According to Gaetz's report, Niger has not authorized flights for United States Department of Defense efforts, including the sending of food, equipment, mail, or medical supplies [201]\n\n\nUkraine\nIn April 2024, Gaetz voted against the $60 billion military aid package for Ukraine, although much of the money would go to his constituency [202]\n\n\nGeorge Floyd protests\nOn June 1, 2020, during the nationwide George Floyd protests, Gaetz tweeted, \"Now that we clearly see antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East?\" In response, Twitter hid the tweet and labeled it as \" [violating] the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence\" Gaetz called the label a \"badge of honor\", accused Twitter of enabling antifa, and again said that \" [o]ur government should hunt  [Antifa] down\" [203]\n\n\nGun policy\nFormer National Rifle Association president Marion Hammer called Gaetz \"one of the most pro-gun members to have ever served in the Florida Legislature.\" [209] Gaetz is

exist.\" [218]\n\n\nCOVID-19\nIn early March 2020, Gaetz wore a gas mask during a House debate on funds to combat the COVID-19 pandemic [221] Gaetz has claimed that wearing the gas mask was not an act of mockery but a way of \"demonstrating his concern\" [222] Several journalists characterized the decision as a stunt [223] [224] [225] A few days later, on March 9, Gaetz's office reported that he had been in contact with a Conservative Political Action Conference attendee who tested positive for COVID-19 As a result, Gaetz was placed under self-quarantine for 14 days On March 10, he said his test was negative, but that he would stay under self-quarantine until the 14-day period ended on March 12 [226]\n\n\nAbortion\nGaetz opposes abortion On July 23, 2022, he gave a speech at a Student Action Summit gathering in Tampa, Florida, in which he said that overweight or unattractive women were unlikely to become pregnant and mocked them for supporting abortion rights, saying, \"They're like 5'2\", 350 pounds, and they're like, 'Give me my abortions or I'll get up and march and protest.'\" [234] [235] Olivia Julianna, a Texas teenager, tweeted a post mocking Gaetz, who responded with

2017, Gaetz was the only representative to vote against the Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act, a bill allocating additional government resources to help combat human trafficking

that illegal immigrants were \"sucking us dry.\" [244] In January 2018, Gaetz defended a statement by Trump that reportedly said Haiti and African nations were \"shithole\" countries, saying that Haiti was covered by \"sheet metal and garbage\" and in \"disgusting\" condition [245]\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nOn June 23, 2021, Gaetz tweeted that the FBI should be defunded At that time, it was

controversial, with The New York Times noting accusations of: [13] \n\nFederal investigations into child sex trafficking and statutory rape\nIn January 2020, the U.S Secret Service reportedly received a tip that, in April 2018, Gaetz had accompanied Seminole County tax collector Joel Greenberg to a government office where Greenberg was producing fake IDs [265] Greenberg was indicted in August 2020 on an array of charges, including sex trafficking a 17-year-old girl in 2017 and creating fake IDs to facilitate sex trafficking [266] [267] The investigation of Greenberg led federal officials to look into some of Gaetz's related activities [265] In late 2020, the Justice Department opened its investigation of Gaetz for allegedly sex trafficking the same 17-year-old girl in 2017 and whether he had violated federal sex trafficking laws by paying her to travel with him across state lines [266] [268] [269] As part of his plea bargain, Greenberg cooperated with the investigation of Gaetz and others [270] [271]\n\n\nDefense and counter-claim of extortion\nDenying any sexual relationships with minors, Gaetz said on March 30, 2021, that he did not plan to resign from the House [266] Also on March 30, he tweeted that he and his family were \"victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DOJ official seeking $25 million\" [266] [286] This allegedly began on March 16, with a text message to his father demanding money in exchange for making sex trafficking allegations \"go away\" [287] Gaetz and his father purportedly received communications claiming that the FBI had photographs of Gaetz engaged in a \"sexual orgy with underage prostitutes\" The sender demanded millions of dollars to help secure the release of U.S federal agent Robert Levinson (who had disappeared in Iran in 2007 and had already been presumed and declared dead), [288] [289] proposing that president Joe Biden would pardon Gaetz as a reward for freeing Levinson [290] [291] The sender was later identified as Florida developer Stephen Alford, who was arrested on August 31 [292] [293]\n\n\nResponse and other developments\nOn March 31, 2021, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he had no plans to remove Gaetz from his seats on the Judiciary and Armed Services Committees, but that he might change his mind if Gaetz \"gets indicted\" [303] or \"if it comes out to be true\" [304]\n\n\nConclusion of DOJ investigation\nA September 2022 Washington Post article reported that prosecutors have recommended not to charge Gaetz in the sex trafficking investigation, telling Justice Department superiors that a conviction is unlikely in part because of credibility questions about the two central witnesses [335] In February 2023, the DOJ communicated to the attorneys for Gaetz that they had concluded their investigation and would not be laying charges against him, effectively ending a multiyear probe including allegations of misconduct [336]\n\n\nRe-opening of investigation by House Ethics Committee\nThe House Ethics Committee began its probe in April 2021 into Gaetz's alleged misconduct but soon paused it while DOJ investigated Shortly after the February 2023 conclusion of the DOJ investigation, the House Ethics Committee reopened its probe [337] [338] The committee contacted Gaetz's ex-girlfriend who in 2022 had received immunity and testified in the criminal investigation, though reportedly it did not expect her to voluntarily cooperate in the ethics investigation [339] Two women, both represented by attorney Joel Leppard, testified that Gaetz paid them for sex One of those women said that in July 2017 she saw Gaetz having sex with her 17-year-old friend, and that once Gaetz became aware of the girl's age, he paused the relationship until she turned 18 [340]\n\n\nDriving offenses\nIn 2008, Gaetz was arrested for driving under the influence as he was driving back from a nightclub on Okaloosa Island, Florida Police recorded him driving 48 mph (77 km/h) in a 35 mph (56 km/h) zone and noted that he showed physical signs of intoxication [352] Gaetz initially denied that he had drunk alcohol, but later admitted to drinking two beers He failed an eye test twice, then declined field sobriety tests After Gaetz was arrested, he refused to take a breathalyzer test [352]\n\n\nFirebrand book and podcast\nGaetz has a 2020 book and a 2021 podcast, both titled Firebrand In both, he criticizes former House speaker Paul Ryan for joining the board of Fox News's parent company and blames him for canceling Lou Dobbs Tonight [321] [353] In the book, while discussing dating in Washington, he writes, \"I knew going in how many people had been brought down by sexual missteps in this town, so I set some rules to help me err on the safe(r) side ..

resignation on corruption charges in February 2010, [29] Gaetz ran in the special election to succeed Sansom in the 4th district, which included southern Santa Rosa County and Okaloosa County [30] In a crowded Republican primary that included Craig Barker, Kabe Woods, Jerry G Melvin, and Bill Garvie, Gaetz won with 43 percent of the vote [30] In the special general election, Gaetz defeated Democratic nominee Jan Fernald with 66 percent of the vote [31] During his campaign, Gaetz received almost $480,000 in contributions, about five times more than anyone else in the field, and almost 50 times more than Fernald, including $100,000 of his own money [26]\n\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\nIn 2013, Gaetz announced that, in 2016, he would run for the 1st district State Senate seat held

district; the incumbent, Jeff Miller, had announced 11 days earlier that he would not seek reelection [48]\n\n\nElections\nIn 2013, Gaetz announced that, in 2016, he would run for the 1st district

Marlins pitcher José Fernández, Gaetz criticized the athletes protesting during the national anthem in a tweet [51] [52]\n\n\n2023 speakership election\nIn the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans regained a narrow House majority Although sitting minority Leader Kevin McCarthy sought the speakership and had the support of 213 members, he needed five more votes to reach a majority to be elected Certain members of the Freedom Caucus, including Gaetz, could contribute the required margin Democrats held 212 votes, with one seat unfilled due to the November death of a holdover incumbent The anti-McCarthy members withheld more than four votes through 14 ballots They were thought to be holding out for substantial concessions regarding House rules and committee chair assignments Their withholding of votes prevented McCarthy earning a majority of votes needed for the speakership [72] Thirteen months earlier, Gaetz had discussed with former president Trump the possibility of getting Trump elected to the speakership, for which House membership is not required [73] Gaetz nominated him once and voted for Trump on the 7th, 8th and 11th ballots [74] After midnight, January 7, on the

House, ethics committee investigation\nOn October 2, 2023, Gaetz filed a resolution to oust McCarthy from his role as speaker of the U.S House of Representatives after the latter had negotiated with

accused Gaetz of filing the motion to oust him as a means of protecting himself against allegations of having had sex with a 17 year old minor [77] [78] [79] According to McCarthy, the House ethics committee had been investigating the case since 2021, prior to McCarthy's appointment as speaker of the House [80]\n\n\nEthics controversies\nOn February 26, 2019, the night before the scheduled public hearing of Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, before the House Oversight Committee, Gaetz directed a tweet to Cohen that implied without evidence that Cohen had had multiple extramarital affairs and also suggested his wife might be unfaithful while he was imprisoned due to new information disclosed to her [81] Other members of Congress saw the tweet as an attempt to intimidate a witness [82] [83] Gaetz initially defended his tweet, saying it was part of \"witness testing, not witness tampering\" and \"I don't threaten anybody.\" Asked to clarify, he said his \"tweet speaks for itself\" [84] [85] After sharp criticism from other members of Congress and an implicit rebuke by speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, [86] [87] Gaetz deleted the tweet and posted a

acquisition of Uranium One during Mueller's time as FBI director [153] [154] Gaetz said he did not trust Mueller to lead the investigation because of Mueller's alleged involvement in approval of the

in the sex trafficking investigation, telling Justice Department superiors that a conviction is unlikely in part because of credibility questions about the two central witnesses [335] In February 2023, the DOJ communicated to the attorneys for Gaetz that they had concluded their investigation and would not be laying charges against him, effectively ending a multiyear probe including allegations of misconduct [336]\n\n\nRe-opening of investigation by House Ethics Committee\nThe House Ethics Committee began its probe in April 2021 into Gaetz's alleged misconduct but soon paused it

[29]\n\n\nCalifornia\nCalifornia has the largest Hmong population in the United States by state [16] As of 2010, there are 95,120 Hmong Americans in California [28]\n\n\nColorado\nColorado is home to approximately 5,000 Hmong who first settled in the state in the late 1976 to early 1980s Today, most of the Hmong live in the north metro Denver area including Arvada, Brighton, Broomfield, Federal Heights, Lafayette, Northglenn, Thornton and Westminster.\n\n\nKansas\nKansas has a moderately-sized Hmong population Kansas City was one of the first cities to accept Hmong people after the war [35] Its Hmong population declined in the early 80s due to migration from Kansas to California, and the Northern Midwest The population has since stabilized and has more than double every decade since 1990  According to the 2010 Census, 1,732 Hmong people lived in Kansas of which 1,600 lived in the Kansas Side of Kansas City and an estimated more than 400 families and 2,000 Hmong living in the Greater Kansas City Area in 2013 [36] Lao Family was established in Kansas City in the 1980s but the Hmong separated from the organization to create the Hmong American Community, Inc which today is still a functioning entity hosting Hmong New Year celebrations in Kansas City [37] Kansas City has a vast majority Green Hmong population and is greater than 80% converted to Christianity though more and more Hmong people move in every year that still practices the traditional religion Kansas City is home to Hmong churches, multiple Hmong runs and owned manufacturing companies, nail salons, small business such as insurance and barber shops, vendors at the flea market, an organization such as Hmong Village Inc., Vang Organization, and Herr Organization just to name a few.\n\n\nMassachusetts\nThe Hmong community in Massachusetts is small compared to the Vietnamese and Cambodian populations of Massachusetts As of 2011, according to Judy Thao, the director of the United Hmong of Massachusetts, an organization based in Lowell, about 2,000 Hmong resided in the State of Massachusetts Thao said that the largest community, with 60 to 70 families, is located in the Fitchburg/Leominster area As of 2010, there are 412 people of Hmong descent living in Fitchburg (one percent of the city's population) Thao said that about 20 to 30 families each live in the second largest communities, in Springfield and Brockton [38]\n\n\nMichigan\nAs of 1999, fewer than 4,000 Hmong people lived in Detroit [39] As of 2005, Michigan had 5,400 Hmong people; reflecting an increase from 2,300 in the 1990s As of 2005, most Hmong in Michigan lived in Metro Detroit in the cities of Detroit, Pontiac, and Warren [40] As of 2002 the concentrations of Hmong and Laotian people in the Wayne–Macomb–Oakland tri-county area were in northeast Detroit, southern Warren, and central Pontiac [41] That year, Kurt Metzger and Jason Booza, authors of \"Asians in the United States, Michigan and Metropolitan Detroit,\" wrote that \"The 3,943 Hmong living in tri-county area is one of the most concentrated of the Asian groups.\" [41] As of 2007, almost 8,000 Hmong lived in Michigan, most in northeastern Detroit As of 2007, Hmong were increasingly moving to Pontiac and Warren [42]\n\n\nMinnesota\nAs of 1999, Minnesota has the second largest US Hmong population by state [16] As of 2001, the largest Hmong population in the United States by the city is located in St Paul [44] In 2020, the Hmong-American population in Minnesota was about 90,000 and the largest Asian group in the state [45]\n\n\nNorth Carolina\nIn 2010, North Carolina had a population of 10,864 Hmong and has one of the highest rates of employment compared to other states in the US 50% of the Hmong population work in the manufacturing industry [28] The two centers of population are in the Hickory and Greensboro areas respectively [49] [50]\n\n\nPennsylvania\nA group of Hmong refugees settled in Philadelphia after the end of the 1970s Laotian Civil War They were attacked in discriminatory acts, and the city's Commission on Human Relations held hearings on the incidents Anne Fadiman, author of The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, said that lower-class residents resented the Hmong receiving a $100,000 federal grant for employment assistance when they were also out of work; they believed that American citizens should be getting assistance [51] Between 1982 and 1984, three quarters of the Hmong people who had settled in Philadelphia left for other cities in the United States to join relatives who were already there [52]\n\n\nRhode Island\nIn 1976, Hmong members of the U.S Secret Army Special Guerrilla Unit, recruited by the CIA during the Vietnam War, were resettled in Rhode Island as refugees [53] In 1983 their population was estimated at 1,700–2,000 [54] 2010 census results put the number of Rhode Island Hmong at 1,015 [55] [53] The Hmong United Association of Rhode Island puts on a Hmong New Year's festival annually [53] About sixty families are members of the Providence Hmong Church of the Christian and Missionary Alliance; they are known locally for their egg roll fundraiser, held in the spring [56]\n\n\nWisconsin\nAs of 2010, Wisconsin has over 49,000 Hmong people—the largest Asian ethnic group in the state [57] [58]\n\n\nOther locations\nIn December 1999, according to the Hmong National Development Inc., Chicago had about 500 Hmong people [39] There is a sizable Hmong population in Westminster, Colorado (0.8% of the city's population as of 2010).\n\n\nCommunity and social issues\nThe 2000 US Census reveals that 60% of all Hmong above 24 years of age have a highest educational attainment of high school or equivalent, as many of these immigrants came to America as adults or young adults According to a government data collected in 2013, 40% of Hmong Americans drop out of school [59] Among the Hmong population, 38% have not received a high school degree, and 14% have at least a bachelor's degree [60] Educational attainment among Hmong women is significantly lower than among Hmong men, with about one in five Hmong women having a high school diploma [61]\n\n\nLack of education and high dropout rates\nThe 2000 US Census reveals that 60% of all Hmong above 24 years of age have a highest educational attainment of high school or equivalent, as many of these immigrants came to America as adults or young adults According to a government data collected in 2013, 40% of Hmong Americans drop out of school [59] Among the Hmong population, 38% have not received a high school degree, and 14% have at least a bachelor's degree [60] Educational attainment among Hmong women is significantly lower than among Hmong men, with about one in five Hmong women having a high school diploma [61]\n\n\nIncome and poverty rates\n2017 data collected by the US government found that Hmong Americans had a median household income of $48,000 compared to the American average of $53,600 [70] The government estimated that 38% of Hmong Americans lived below the poverty line, compared to 16% of all Americans [71] [72] [59] The 2014 American Community Survey found that per capita income of Hmong Americans was $12,923, significantly lower than the American average of $25,825 When income is compared between US ethnic groups, Hmong Americans are the third lowest earning group [72] In a 2013, NPR discussion, sociologist Rosalind Chou stated that \"when you break it down by specific ethnic groups, the Hmong, the Bangladeshi, they have poverty rates that rival the African-American poverty rate.\" [73]\n\n\nCulture and politics\nThere are many cultural, political, and social issues that are being debated among Hmong American communities Topics include political participation, poverty, gang violence, race relations, and education The Hmong community also retains many ties with the Hmong still in Indochina and remains active in regional politics In the United States, the Hmong clan system continues to exist, but with less influence over younger generations [74]\n\n\nSexuality\nHeterosexuality and heteronormativity are traditionally tied to the Hmong identity and its history [76] but attitudes in Hmong Americans appear to be shifting [74] In the Hmong American community, non-traditional gender and sexual identities have gained increasing cultural, political, and social acceptance over time [77] [76]\n\n\nMental health\nCompared to other Southeast Asian refugees in America, Hmong refugees have the highest rates of mental health disorders, [79] with an overall mental illness incidence rate at around 33.5% [80] This mental health problem has been attributed to traumatic past experiences and problems adjusting to life in the United States [81]\n\n\nHealth disparities\nIn other aspects of health, like cancer, Hmong Americans have the highest cancer mortality rates compared to other Asian American groups Low cancer screenings and lack of interventions to address stigma of utilizing public health services are among some reasons for this trend [83] Access to education can help with increasing health practices like receiving a Pap test for cervical cancer screening [84] A Patient Navigation Program implemented in San Francisco for Hmong Americans led to a 38% increase in Pap test participation, highlighting progress made in increasing participation via education [85] A cross-sectional study of 168 immigrant Hmong Americans found that half of them reported not understanding health information Factors like acculturation and number of years in the US were positively correlated with health literacy rate, and lower health literacy rates were associated with poor health in the participants [86] Acculturation indicators such as language use and social connections, were positively correlated with higher BMI-for-age in Hmong American children 9–18 years old [87]\n\n\nViolence\nHmong Americans have experienced violence after immigrating to the United States Some specific instances of violence against Hmong Americans have been murders, of which a few have occurred while they were engaging in hunting [91] Hmong Americans have hunted because it is a common traditional practice in countries such as Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand These are common countries from which the Hmong ethnic group has immigrated, although they do not have a specific home country Chong Moua Yang, a Hmong American hunter, was murdered in Bath Township, Michigan on November 16, 2018 [92] His murder remained a cold case until 2024, when a man was found guilty of murdering Yang and was sentenced to 22+1⁄2 to 60 years in prison [93] Another example is the murder of Ee Lee, in which a Hmong American woman in Wisconsin was raped and murdered by two teenagers in a racially motivated hate crime One of the teenagers was sentenced to 26 years in prison, and the other to 32 years in prison.\n\n\nLanguages and culture\nThe Hmong language is spoken by approximately 4 million with about 5% residing in the United States There are two main different dialects, Hmong Leeg and Hmong Dawb In America, these are known as Hmong Leeg and White Hmong  Many of the vowel sounds are quite a bit different in these dialects compared to some of the Asian ones In the United States, about 60% speak White Hmong and 40% speak Hmong Leeg The Centers for Disease Control states \"Though some Hmong report difficulty understanding speakers of a dialect not their own, for the most part, White and Hmong Leeg speakers seem to understand one another.\" [95] As of 2012, Hmong in California are developing a Hmong-English online translator, in collaboration with Microsoft [96] Research in nursing shows that when translating from English to Hmong, specifically in the healthcare context, the translator must take into account the absence of equivalent concepts because Hmong comes from an oral tradition For example, the word and concept for \"prostate\" does not exist Cultural sensitivity is another consideration For example, direct translation that mention body parts can cause discomfort [97]\n\n\nWhite Hmong and Leeg Hmong\nWhite Hmong (Hmoob Dawb) and Hmong Leeg (Moob Leeg) are the two primary dialects spoken by Hmong Americans The difference between the two dialects is analogous to the difference between American and British English; thus, both can understand each other easily Green Hmong is named so because of the color used in Green Hmong women's traditional costume [100]\n\n\nHmong American rituals and funerals\nFrom funerals to soul calling, Hmong rituals and ceremonies have been an important part of the Hmong cultural and spiritual experience [103] Since arriving in the United States in the late 1970s, many Hmong families still practice their rituals, but the number of traditional funerals preferred had dwindled due to a large number of Hmong, mostly the younger generations, converting to Christianity, lacking finances, and other reasons Living in the United States also with jobs and school, there is not that much time to take a week off, which is how long most of these funeral rituals take [104]\n\n\nHmongs in the media\nOn June 4, 2007, following a lengthy federal investigation labeled \"Operation Flawed Eagle,\" warrants were issued by a California-based US federal court for the arrest of General Vang Pao, eight other Hmong people, and one non-Hmong person for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government of Laos in violation of the federal Neutrality Acts and various US weapons laws [105]\n\n\n2007 coup conspiracy accusations and arrests\nOn June 4, 2007, following a lengthy federal investigation labeled \"Operation Flawed Eagle,\" warrants were issued by a California-based US federal court for the arrest of General Vang Pao, eight other Hmong people, and one non-Hmong person for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government of Laos in violation of the federal Neutrality Acts and various US weapons laws [105]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe 2008 film Gran Torino, directed by Clint Eastwood, was the first mainstream US film to feature Hmong Americans [48] Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, an elderly, racist Korean War veteran living in Detroit, Michigan who befriends a Hmong teenager named Thao, played by Bee Vang, who previously tries to steal his Gran Torino as an initiation into a local Hmong gang run by his own cousins.\n\n\nNotable people\nAt least two Hmong have been elected to high public office In 2002, Mee Moua became the first Hmong American legislator when she was elected to fill the Minnesota State Senate seat vacated by Randy Kelly when he was elected mayor of St Paul She later became the Senate majority whip Cy Thao is a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives.\n\n\nList\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Hmong

largest communities, in Springfield and Brockton [38]\n\n\nMichigan\nAs of 1999, fewer than 4,000 Hmong people lived in Detroit [39] As of 2005, Michigan had 5,400 Hmong people; reflecting an increase from 2,300 in the 1990s As of 2005, most Hmong in Michigan lived in Metro Detroit in the cities of Detroit, Pontiac, and Warren [40] As of 2002 the concentrations of Hmong and Laotian people in the Wayne–Macomb–Oakland tri-county area were in northeast Detroit, southern Warren, and central Pontiac [41] That year, Kurt Metzger and Jason Booza, authors of \"Asians in the United States, Michigan and Metropolitan Detroit,\" wrote that \"The 3,943 Hmong living in tri-county area is one of the most concentrated of the Asian groups.\" [41] As of 2007, almost 8,000 Hmong lived in Michigan, most in northeastern Detroit As of 2007, Hmong were increasingly moving to Pontiac and Warren [42]\n\n\nMinnesota\nAs of 1999, Minnesota has the second largest US Hmong population by state [16] As of 2001, the largest Hmong population in the United States by the city is located in St Paul [44] In 2020, the Hmong-American population in Minnesota was about 90,000 and the largest Asian group in the state [45]\n\n\nNorth Carolina\nIn 2010, North Carolina had a population of 10,864 Hmong and has one of the highest rates of employment compared to other states in the US 50% of the Hmong population work in the manufacturing industry [28] The two centers of population are in the Hickory and Greensboro areas respectively [49] [50]\n\n\nPennsylvania\nA group of Hmong refugees settled in Philadelphia after the end of the 1970s Laotian Civil War They were attacked in discriminatory acts, and the city's Commission on Human Relations held hearings on the incidents Anne Fadiman, author of The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, said that lower-class residents resented the Hmong receiving a $100,000 federal grant for employment assistance when they were also out of work; they believed that American citizens should be getting assistance [51] Between 1982 and 1984, three quarters of the Hmong people who had settled in Philadelphia left for other cities in the United States to join relatives who were already there [52]\n\n\nRhode Island\nIn 1976, Hmong members of the U.S Secret Army Special Guerrilla Unit, recruited by the CIA during the Vietnam War, were resettled in Rhode Island as refugees [53] In 1983 their population was estimated at 1,700–2,000 [54] 2010 census results put the number of Rhode Island Hmong at 1,015 [55] [53] The Hmong United Association of Rhode Island puts on a Hmong New Year's festival annually [53] About sixty families are members of the Providence Hmong Church of the Christian and Missionary Alliance; they are known locally for their egg roll fundraiser, held in the spring [56]\n\n\nWisconsin\nAs of 2010, Wisconsin has over 49,000 Hmong people—the largest Asian ethnic group in the state [57] [58]\n\n\nOther locations\nIn December 1999, according to the Hmong National Development Inc., Chicago had about 500 Hmong people [39] There is a sizable Hmong population in Westminster, Colorado (0.8% of the city's population as of 2010).\n\n\nCommunity and social issues\nThe 2000 US Census reveals that 60% of all Hmong above 24 years of age have a highest educational attainment of high school or equivalent, as many of these immigrants came to America as adults or young adults According to a government data collected in 2013, 40% of Hmong Americans drop out of school [59] Among the Hmong population, 38% have not received a high school degree, and 14% have at least a bachelor's degree [60] Educational attainment among Hmong women is significantly lower than among Hmong men, with about one in five Hmong women having a high school diploma [61]\n\n\nLack of education and high dropout rates\nThe 2000 US Census reveals that 60% of all Hmong above 24 years of age have a highest educational attainment of high school or equivalent, as many of these immigrants came to America as adults or young adults According to a government data collected in 2013, 40% of Hmong Americans drop out of school [59] Among the Hmong population, 38% have not received a high school degree, and 14% have at least a bachelor's degree [60] Educational attainment among Hmong women is significantly lower than among Hmong men, with about one in five Hmong women having a high school diploma [61]\n\n\nIncome and poverty rates\n2017 data collected by the US government found that Hmong Americans had a median household income of $48,000 compared to the American average of $53,600 [70] The government estimated that 38% of Hmong Americans lived below the poverty line, compared to 16% of all Americans [71] [72] [59] The 2014 American Community Survey found that per capita income of Hmong Americans was $12,923, significantly lower than the American average of $25,825 When income is compared between US ethnic groups, Hmong Americans are the third lowest earning group [72] In a 2013, NPR discussion, sociologist Rosalind Chou stated that \"when you break it down by specific ethnic groups, the Hmong, the Bangladeshi, they have poverty rates that rival the African-American poverty rate.\" [73]\n\n\nCulture and politics\nThere are many cultural, political, and social issues that are being debated among Hmong American communities Topics include political participation, poverty, gang violence, race relations, and education The Hmong community also retains many ties with the Hmong still in Indochina and remains active in regional politics In the United States, the Hmong clan system continues to exist, but with less influence over younger generations [74]\n\n\nSexuality\nHeterosexuality and heteronormativity are traditionally tied to the Hmong identity and its history [76] but attitudes in Hmong Americans appear to be shifting [74] In the Hmong American community, non-traditional gender and sexual identities have gained increasing cultural, political, and social acceptance over time [77] [76]\n\n\nMental health\nCompared to other Southeast Asian refugees in America, Hmong refugees have the highest rates of mental health disorders, [79] with an overall mental illness incidence rate at around 33.5% [80] This mental health problem has been attributed to traumatic past experiences and problems adjusting to life in the United States [81]\n\n\nHealth disparities\nIn other aspects of health, like cancer, Hmong Americans have the highest cancer mortality rates compared to other Asian American groups Low cancer screenings and lack of interventions to address stigma of utilizing public health services are among some reasons for this trend [83] Access to education can help with increasing health practices like receiving a Pap test for cervical cancer screening [84] A Patient Navigation Program implemented in San Francisco for Hmong Americans led to a 38% increase in Pap test participation, highlighting progress made in increasing participation via education [85] A cross-sectional study of 168 immigrant Hmong Americans found that half of them reported not understanding health information Factors like acculturation and number of years in the US were positively correlated with health literacy rate, and lower health literacy rates were associated with poor health in the participants [86] Acculturation indicators such as language use and social connections, were positively correlated with higher BMI-for-age in Hmong American children 9–18 years old [87]\n\n\nViolence\nHmong Americans have experienced violence after immigrating to the United States Some specific instances of violence against Hmong Americans have been murders, of which a few have occurred while they were engaging in hunting [91] Hmong Americans have hunted because it is a common traditional practice in countries such as Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand These are common countries from which the Hmong ethnic group has immigrated, although they do not have a specific home country Chong Moua Yang, a Hmong American hunter, was murdered in Bath Township, Michigan on November 16, 2018 [92] His murder remained a cold case until 2024, when a man was found guilty of murdering Yang and was sentenced to 22+1⁄2 to 60 years in prison [93] Another example is the murder of Ee Lee, in which a Hmong American woman in Wisconsin was raped and murdered by two teenagers in a racially motivated hate crime One of the teenagers was sentenced to 26 years in prison, and the other to 32 years in prison.\n\n\nLanguages and culture\nThe Hmong language is spoken by approximately 4 million with about 5% residing in the United States There are two main different dialects, Hmong Leeg and Hmong Dawb In America, these are known as Hmong Leeg and White Hmong  Many of the vowel sounds are quite a bit different in these dialects compared to some of the Asian ones In the United States, about 60% speak White Hmong and 40% speak Hmong Leeg The Centers for Disease Control states \"Though some Hmong report difficulty understanding speakers of a dialect not their own, for the most part, White and Hmong Leeg speakers seem to understand one another.\" [95] As of 2012, Hmong in California are developing a Hmong-English online translator, in collaboration with Microsoft [96] Research in nursing shows that when translating from English to Hmong, specifically in the healthcare context, the translator must take into account the absence of equivalent concepts because Hmong comes from an oral tradition For example, the word and concept for \"prostate\" does not exist Cultural sensitivity is another consideration For example, direct translation that mention body parts can cause discomfort [97]\n\n\nWhite Hmong and Leeg Hmong\nWhite Hmong (Hmoob Dawb) and Hmong Leeg (Moob Leeg) are the two primary dialects spoken by Hmong Americans The difference between the two dialects is analogous to the difference between American and British English; thus, both can understand each other easily Green Hmong is named so because of the color used in Green Hmong women's traditional costume [100]\n\n\nHmong American rituals and funerals\nFrom funerals to soul calling, Hmong rituals and ceremonies have been an important part of the Hmong cultural and spiritual experience [103] Since arriving in the United States in the late 1970s, many Hmong families still practice their rituals, but the number of traditional funerals preferred had dwindled due to a large number of Hmong, mostly the younger generations, converting to Christianity, lacking finances, and other reasons Living in the United States also with jobs and school, there is not that much time to take a week off, which is how long most of these funeral rituals take [104]\n\n\nHmongs in the media\nOn June 4, 2007, following a lengthy federal investigation labeled \"Operation Flawed Eagle,\" warrants were issued by a California-based US federal court for the arrest of General Vang Pao, eight other Hmong people, and one non-Hmong person for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government of Laos in violation of the federal Neutrality Acts and various US weapons laws [105]\n\n\n2007 coup conspiracy accusations and arrests\nOn June 4, 2007, following a lengthy federal investigation labeled \"Operation Flawed Eagle,\" warrants were issued by a California-based US federal court for the arrest of General Vang Pao, eight other Hmong people, and one non-Hmong person for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government of Laos in violation of the federal Neutrality Acts and various US weapons laws [105]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nThe 2008 film Gran Torino, directed by Clint Eastwood, was the first mainstream US film to feature Hmong Americans [48] Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, an elderly, racist Korean War veteran living in Detroit, Michigan who befriends a Hmong teenager named Thao, played by Bee Vang, who previously tries to steal his Gran Torino as an initiation into a local Hmong gang run by his own cousins.\n\n\nNotable people\nAt least two Hmong have been elected to high public office In 2002, Mee Moua became the first Hmong American legislator when she was elected to fill the Minnesota State Senate seat vacated by Randy Kelly when he was elected mayor of St Paul She later became the Senate majority whip Cy Thao is a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives.\n\n\nList\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

[269]\n\n\nIssues\nThe Houthis and their supporters have engaged in a disinformation campaign to undermine efforts to secure freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and surrounding waters by the United States and its allies and to gain recognition as a regional power [552] On 1 February 2024, the Houthis claimed an attack on a US ship named KOI, but maritime sources told BBC that it was false [553]

anti-ship missiles via Iranian smuggling routes in response to US support for Ukraine during Russia's invasion [566] However it did not follow through due to pushback by the US and Saudi Arabia [567]\n\n\nWar crimes\nThe Houthis have claimed they would target ships that had no military function, which would be a war crime, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and others The HRW also noted that the detention of captured crews could be considered hostage-taking if they are detained to compel a third party to do or abstain from any act as a condition for the hostage's release or safety Hostage-taking is a violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime A statement issued by the HRW called upon the militants to \"end their attacks on civilians caught in the crosshairs of their declared war on Israel.\" [570]\n\n\nImpact\nHouthi attacks have reduced shipping to Israel and local trade Commercial shipping to Eilat has almost completely ceased Commercial ships coming from Asia to Israel, as well as some commercial ships not destined for Israel, have started to go around Africa, which makes the journey three weeks longer and more expensive [573] By 21 December, over 100 container ships had been rerouted to go around Africa, each adding around 6,000 nautical miles to the trip distance [574]\n\n\nIsrael and Egypt\nIn a speech at a manufacturing exposition following the

Abdul-Malik al-Houthi stated, \"Our battle aims to support the Palestinian people, and has no other goals,\" and said that the Houthi's operations would cease once food and medicine was reaching all of Gaza [619] On 30 January, Houthi Minister of Defence Mohamed al-Atifi stated, \"We are prepared for a long-term confrontation with the forces of tyranny.\" [620] A Houthi spokesperson stated on 4 February 2024, \"When the world became alarmed by the bloodiness of what was happening against the Palestinian people, Washington was not ashamed to deny the occurrence of genocide Anyone who can do that can easily deny the connection between what is happening in the Red Sea and Gaza.\" [621]\n\n\nOperation Prosperity Guardian: American-led military coalition\nWhile the US Navy has shot down Houthi rockets and missiles in the Red Sea, it has not retaliated against those firing them [622] [623] In December 2023, after discussions with allies, the US announced the creation of a multilateral naval task force of protective escorts for commercial vessels in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and Gulf of Aden region [623] The operation, codenamed Operation Prosperity Guardian, [624] was formally launched on 23 December 2023 [596] It is similar to past operations protecting commercial vessels from attack, including in the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz during the \"Tanker War\" of the 1980s, [623] and the ongoing maritime security operations of Combined Task Force 153, the US Navy-led task force based in Bahrain [586] The operation has also been compared to the successful multilateral naval campaign a decade earlier to combat Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa, although the Houthis, unlike the Somali pirates, enjoy Iranian support, and better equipment and technology, such as helicopters, drones, missiles, and speedboats [625]\n\n\nIndependent naval patrols for maritime security\nFrance, Italy and India have all independently sent naval assets to the region, with the French frigate Languedoc intercepting drones launched from a Houthi-controlled port while Italy has sent the frigate Virginio Fasan under the Secure Mediterranean operation [15] India has also sent two Kolkata-class destroyers to strengthen maritime security in the Red Sea [19]\n\n\nPro-Palestinian protests\nIn mid-January 2024, reports indicated that pro-Palestinian demonstrators in London voiced support for Houthi militants This occurred shortly after the UK and the US initiated strikes on Houthi targets in response to the group's assaults on ships Some demonstrators were observed chanting slogans like, \"Yemen, Yemen make us proud, turn another ship around,\" while others displayed signs with messages such as \"Hands off Yemen\", \"Thanks Yemen\", and \"UK+US wants war Yemen supports Palestine Gaza wants to live\" [626]\n\n\nInternational\nOn 7 August 2024, the head of United States naval efforts in the Middle East, Vice Admiral George Wikoff stated that the American and British approach to combat the Houthis in the Red sea crisis had failed to dissuade the Houthis and stop attacks on shipping through the region, arguing that strikes and defensive efforts had done little to change the Houthis' behaviour [648]\n\n\nAnalysis\nOn 7 August 2024, the head of United States naval efforts in the Middle East, Vice Admiral George Wikoff stated that the American

2023, involving the Iran-backed Houthi movement and its attacks on commercial vessels and military ships in the Red Sea and surrounding waters. The crisis has had significant economic and humanitarian impacts, and has led to the formation of a multilateral naval task force to protect commercial vessels in the region.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nThe Houthi movement is an Iran-backed Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organization that exercises de facto control over parts of Yemen. The group's takeover in Yemen in 2014 resulted in the acquisition of the capital city of Sanaa, but the anti-Houthi Presidential Leadership Council remains recognized by the international community as Yemen's legitimate government. After this conflict grew into an ongoing civil war, millions of residents were internally displaced, and a Saudi-led coalition responded by imposing a blockade of Yemen. These combined to shrink the economy by half and contributed to famine in Yemen since 2016, one of the worst in the world.\n\nHouthis within Yemen\n-------------------\n\nThe Houthi movement is an Iran-backed Zaydi Shia Islamist militant organization that exercises de facto control over parts of Yemen.

After this conflict grew into an ongoing civil war, millions of residents were internally displaced, and a Saudi-led coalition responded by imposing a blockade of Yemen. These combined to shrink the economy by half and contributed to famine in Yemen since 2016, one of the worst in the world.\n\nHouthis and the Israel-Hamas war\n---------------------------------\n\nFollowing the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the Israel-Hamas war, numerous Iran-backed militant groups across the Middle East, including the Houthis, expressed support for the Palestinians and threatened to attack Israel. Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi warned the United States against intervening in support of Israel, threatening that such an intervention would be met with retaliation by drone and missile strikes. In order to end their attacks in the Red Sea, the Houthis demanded a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and an end to the accompanying Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip.\n\nWeapons used by Houthi militants\n---------------------------------\n\nHouthi weapons are mostly of Russian, Chinese, or Iranian origin. They are known to use surface-to-surface missiles, artillery rockets, loitering munitions, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). They have several missiles and UAVs capable of reaching Israel from Yemen.\n\nTimeline of events\n-------------------\n\n### October 2023\n\nOn 19 October 2023, US officials said the United States Navy destroyer USS Carney shot down three land-attack cruise missiles and several drones heading toward Israel launched by the Houthis in Yemen. This was the first action by the US military to defend Israel since the outbreak of the war.\n\n### November 2023\n\nOn 1 November at 00:45, the IDF intercepted an air threat fired from Yemen and identified south of Eilat. A US MQ-9 Reaper drone was shot down off the coast of Yemen by Houthi air defences on 8 November. On 9 November, the Houthis fired a missile toward the city of Eilat. The missile was intercepted by an Arrow 3 missile, marking the first time it was used in an interception.\n\n### December 2023\n\nOn 6 December 2023, the Houthi movement launched several ballistic missiles at Israeli military posts in Eilat. On the same day, USS Mason shot down a drone launched from Yemen. There were no clear indications of its target.\n\n### January 2024\n\nOn 4 January, just hours after the warning, Houthis launched an unmanned surface vessel (USV) towards US Navy and commercial vessels, but it detonated well over 1 nautical mile from the ships.\n\n### February 2024\n\nOn 2 February, the Houthis claimed that they had fired a ballistic missile towards Eilat. The IDF also said that the Arrow defense system intercepted a missile over the Red Sea. On 3 February, a day after conducting airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, the US and UK conducted strikes against 36 Houthi sites, which included underground facilities, UAV storage and operation sites, missile systems, radars, and helicopters in 13 different locations across Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen in an attempt to degrade their capabilities.\n\n### March 2024\n\nOn 2 March, during Operation Aspides, the Italian destroyer Caio Duilio shot down a Houthi missile over the Red Sea. The missile was within 4 miles of the destroyer before it was shot down.\n\n### April 2024\n\nOn 3 April, Danish chief of defense Flemming Lentfer was fired after failing to report flaws regarding air defenses and weapons systems aboard the Ivar Huitfeldt frigate which emerged after a Houthi attack in March, when the frigate's air defenses failed while engaging with Houthis. A problem also occurred with the frigate's ammunition system, which caused half of the rounds it fired to detonate before hitting their target.\n\n### May 2024\n\nIn early May, Houthi-run Saba News Agency reported that at least 18 people were arrested on suspicions of spying for the US and Israel. According to Saba, the supposed spy network was formed in November. Saba did not provide evidence to support the claim, but said that the men had confessed to spying.\n\n### June 2024\n\nThe Houthis targeted the USS Dwight D Eisenhower, USS Gravely, and three commercial vessels on 1 June. The US Central Command confirmed the attacks, while adding that no casualties or damage was reported, with one drone being intercepted in the southern Red Sea and two others crashing into the water. It also added that it had shot down two anti-ship ballistic missiles targeting USS Gravely.\n\n### July 2024\n\nThe Houthis on 2 July stated that they had carried out a joint operation with the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, claiming to have attacked a \"vital target\" in Haifa with a number of missiles. The Operation Aspides mission stated that two UAVs were destroyed by the Greek frigate Psara in the Gulf of Aden on 7 July.\n\n### August 2024\n\nOn 3 August, the US Central Command announced that US forces had destroyed a Houthi missile and launcher. The group later stated that it had shot down a MQ-9 Reaper drone in the Saada Governorate, publishing a video purporting to show its wreckage. The US Defense Department stated that it was investigating the claim.\n\n### September 2024\n\nOn 2 September, the US Central Command stated that the US forces had destroyed two Houthi missile systems in Houthi-controlled territory over the past day. On the following day, it stated that the US forces had destroyed another Houthi missile system. On 7 September, it stated that the US forces had destroyed a Houthi UAV and a support vehicle in Houthi-controlled territory over the past day.\n\n### October 2024\n\nOn 1 October, the Houthis claimed that they had attacked a military target in Tel Aviv and Eilat with four Samed-4 UAVs. The IDF meanwhile stated that it had intercepted a UAV over the Mediterranean Sea, near the shore of central Israel.\n\nHouthi attacks on commercial vessels\n------------------------------------\n\nIran-backed Houthi forces began attacking shipping vessels affiliated with Israel passing through the Red Sea on 19 November 2023. By February, 40 vessels had been attacked. Global shipping companies, which had typically sailed through the Red Sea, as well as the Suez Canal, instead moved to position their vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, off the Cape Peninsula, South Africa.\n\nIssues\n-------\n\nThe Houthis and their supporters have engaged in a disinformation campaign to undermine efforts to secure freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and surrounding waters by the United States and its allies and to gain recognition as a regional power. On 1 February 2024, the Houthis claimed an attack on a US ship named KOI, but maritime sources told BBC that it was false. Hezbollah-affiliated news outlets such as Islam Times and Al Mayadeen have backed false claims by the Houthis.\n\nForeign involvement\n-------------------\n\nReuters, citing unnamed Iranian sources and \"a security official close to Iran\", has claimed that Iranian personnel are in Yemen, working with Hezbollah militants. Their role involves directing and overseeing Houthi attacks on commercial shipping. The sources also stated that Iran has escalated its provision of advanced drones, anti-ship cruise missiles, precision-strike ballistic missiles, and medium-range missiles to the Houthis, since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nWar crimes\n------------\n\nThe Houthis have claimed they would target ships that had no military function, which would be a war crime, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and others. The HRW also noted that the detention of captured crews could be considered hostage-taking if they are detained to compel a third party to do or abstain from any act as a condition for the hostage's release or safety. Hostage-taking is a violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime.\n\nImpact\n-------\n\nHouthi attacks have reduced shipping to Israel and local trade. Commercial shipping to Eilat has almost completely ceased. Commercial ships coming from Asia to Israel, as well as some commercial ships not destined for Israel, have started to go around Africa, which makes the journey three weeks longer and more expensive. By 21 December, over 100 container ships had been rerouted to go around Africa, each adding around 6,000 nautical miles to the trip distance.\n\nOperation Prosperity Guardian\n-----------------------------\n\nWhile the US Navy has shot down Houthi rockets and missiles in the Red Sea, it has not retaliated against those firing them. In December 2023, after discussions with allies, the US announced the creation of a multilateral naval task force of protective escorts for commercial vessels in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and Gulf of Aden region.

Houthi rockets and missiles in the Red Sea, it has not retaliated against those firing them [622] [623] In December 2023, after discussions with allies, the US announced the creation of a multilateral naval task force of protective escorts for commercial vessels in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and Gulf of Aden region [623] The operation, codenamed Operation Prosperity Guardian, [624] was formally launched on 23 December 2023 [596] It is similar to past operations protecting commercial vessels from attack, including in the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz during the \"Tanker War\" of the 1980s, [623] and the ongoing maritime security operations of Combined Task Force 153, the US Navy-led task force based in Bahrain [586] The operation has also been compared to the successful multilateral naval campaign a decade earlier to combat Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa, although the Houthis, unlike the Somali pirates, enjoy Iranian support, and better equipment and technology, such as helicopters, drones, missiles, and speedboats [625]\n\n\nIndependent naval patrols for maritime security\nFrance, Italy and India have all independently sent naval assets to the region, with the French frigate Languedoc intercepting drones launched from a Houthi-controlled port while Italy has sent the frigate Virginio Fasan under the Secure Mediterranean operation [15] India has also sent two Kolkata-class destroyers to strengthen maritime security in the Red Sea [19]\n\n\nPro-Palestinian protests\nIn mid-January 2024, reports indicated that pro-Palestinian demonstrators in London voiced support for Houthi militants This occurred shortly after the UK and the US initiated strikes on Houthi targets in response to the group's assaults on ships Some demonstrators were observed chanting slogans like, \"Yemen, Yemen make us proud, turn another ship around,\" while others displayed signs with messages such as \"Hands off Yemen\", \"Thanks Yemen\", and \"UK+US wants war Yemen supports Palestine Gaza wants to live\" [626]\n\n\nInternational\nOn 7 August 2024, the head of United States naval efforts in the Middle East, Vice Admiral George Wikoff stated that the American and British approach to combat the Houthis in the Red sea crisis had failed to dissuade the Houthis and stop attacks on shipping through the region, arguing that strikes and defensive efforts had done little to change the Houthis' behaviour [648]\n\n\nAnalysis\nOn 7 August 2024, the head of United States naval efforts in the Middle East, Vice Admiral George Wikoff stated that the American

The movie grossed $114 million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $822 million worldwide.\n\n2008-2010\nHe next starred in Pineapple Express (2008), a stoner comedy co-starring and co-written by Seth Rogen and produced by Judd Apatow. Of Franco's character, Apatow said, \"You tell him, 'Okay, you're going to play a pot dealer', and he comes back with a three-dimensional character you totally believe exists. He takes it very seriously, even when it's comedy.\" In her New York Times review, critic Manohla Dargis wrote: \"He's delightful as Saul, loosey-goosey and goofy yet irrepressibly sexy, despite that greasy curtain of hair and a crash pad with a zero WAF (Woman Acceptance Factor). It's an unshowy, generous performance and it greatly humanizes a movie that, as it shifts genre gears and cranks up the noise, becomes disappointingly sober and self-serious.\" His performance earned him a second Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. He has stated in some interviews that he no longer uses cannabis (although he has occasionally alluded to smoking it, most notably during an extended segment on The Colbert Report). He was awarded High Times magazine's Stoner of the Year Award for his work in Pineapple Express. In 2008 he also appeared in two films by American artist Carter, exhibited at the Yvon Lambert gallery in Paris. On September 20, 2008, he hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL), and a second time on December 19, 2009.\n\n2011-Present\nOn February 23, 2011, Franco made a cameo appearance on NBC's Minute to Win It where the real-life Ralston was participating as a contestant playing for charity. After having an uncredited cameo in the opening scene of The Green Hornet (2011), he starred opposite Natalie Portman and Danny McBride in the Medieval fantasy comedy Your Highness. In the film, he plays Fabious, a prince who teams up with his brother (McBride) to rescue the soon to be bride of Fabious (played by Zooey Deschanel). In May 2010, he was cast to star in Rupert Wyatt's $93 million budgeted Rise of the Planet of the Apes, a reboot of the Planet of the Apes series, which was released on August 5, 2011. Franco starred alongside Winona Ryder in The Letter, originally entitled The Stare, directed by Jay Anania. He was cast as a drug-addicted lawyer in About Cherry, also starring Heather Graham, which started shooting the following month in California. He dropped out of the indie film While We're Young to star in Oz the Great and Powerful, a Disney prequel to L Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900). Filming began in July 2011, and the film was released on March 8, 2013. He has signed to do a sequel to it.\n\nOther Projects\nFranco produced and directed a documentary titled Saturday Night, which documented a week in the production of an episode of SNL. The film began as a short for an NYU class, but grew due to his two episodes as host, while short stories he wrote for other classes appeared in Esquire and McSweeney's. In summer 2010, the fictional Franco from General Hospital held an exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, while the real Franco held an exhibit at the museum based on his experiences on the soap opera.\n\nIn the Media\nViewed as a sex symbol, Franco was named the Sexiest Man Living in 2009 by Salon. There has often been frequent media coverage of Franco, particularly regarding his interest in going to colleges. In addition to that, Franco has also claimed to have been strongly misquoted by reports in the media and news outlets reporting erroneous information about him. This led to the actor being parodied in an episode of SNL's Weekend Update segment, which an Entertainment Weekly writer deemed \"clever.\" In a 2011 interview, he stated:\n\nPersonal Life\nFranco has described himself as Jewish. Regarding his secular upbringing, he told The Guardian that he feels as if he has \"missed out on the Jewish experience,\" but has been told not to worry about that by his Jewish friends. He said in the same interview that he likes \"the idea of religion as a source of community.\" When asked if he was a \"believer,\" he responded, \"In God? I don't know. Yes. To a certain extent. It's a complicated question.\" In 2015, he had an official bar mitzvah ceremony, presided over by a rabbi.\n\nRelationships and Sexuality\nDue to his support for the LGBT community and his portrayal of gay characters in his projects, Franco's sexuality has been a subject of discussion in media sources. In a March 2015 interview with Four Two Nine magazine, Franco again opened up about his sexuality, stating, \"In the twenties and thirties, they used to define homosexuality by how you acted and not by whom you slept with. Sailors would fuck guys all the time, but as long as they behaved in masculine ways, they weren't considered gay. Well, I like to think that I'm gay in my art and straight in my life.\"\n\nEducation\nFranco, dissatisfied with his career's direction, reenrolled at UCLA in autumn 2006 as an English major with a creative writing concentration. He received permission to take as many as 62 course credits per quarter compared to the normal limit of 19, while still continuing to act, receiving many of his credits from independent study for his involvement on the set of Spider-Man 3. He received his undergraduate degree in June 2008 with a GPA of 3.5/4.0.\n\nHealth\nFranco is a teetotaler.\n\nSexual Misconduct Accusations and Lawsuit\nIn 2014, a seventeen-year-old girl posted screenshots of alleged messages between her and Franco on Instagram. The messages showed that Franco, then aged 35, tried to meet her in a hotel room after she told him she was seventeen. He sent multiple pictures of himself to prove his real identity. Franco admitted on Live! With Kelly and Michael that he had written the messages. Franco and his supporters argued that his actions were legal as the age of consent in New York is seventeen. He initially responded to the scandal by tweeting, \"I HOPE PARENTS KEEP THEIR TEENS AWAY FROM ME Thank you.\" Franco also said: \"I'm not going to high schools looking for dates.\" He later stated he was \"embarrassed\" and that \"I learned my lesson.\"\n\nPhilanthropy\nFranco has volunteered at the charity the Art of Elysium, which helps children with serious medical conditions. He said the experience helped save his life. In January 2011, at the Art of Elysium Heaven Gala in Los Angeles, Franco was honored for his work at the hospital, receiving the Spirit of Elysium accolade.\n\nFilmography and Awards\nSelected works\nDiscography\nAlbums\nMusic on other albums\nStage", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"James_Franco\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nJames Edward Franco was born in Palo Alto, California, [8] on April 19, 1978 [9] His mother, Betsy Lou (née Verne), is a children's book author and occasional actress, and his father, Douglas Eugene Franco, ran a Silicon Valley business [10] [11]\n\n\nActing career\nAfter 15 months of training, Franco began auditioning in Los Angeles His first paid role was a television commercial for Pizza Hut, featuring a dancing Elvis Presley [28] He found guest roles on television shows but his first break came in 1999, after he was cast in a leading role on the short-lived but well-reviewed NBC television series Freaks and Geeks, [29] which ran for 18 episodes and was canceled due to low viewership Later, the show became a cult hit among audiences [30] He has since described the series as \"one of the most fun\" work experiences that he has had [31] In another interview, Franco said: \"When we were doing Freaks and Geeks, I didn't quite understand how movies and TV worked, and I would improvise even if the camera wasn't on me ..

Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, [7] [8] while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown [9]\n\n\nEvent\nDuring the Crown Jewel Kickoff pre-show, SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) fought the newly reformed Hurt Business (Cedric Alexander and Shelton Benjamin) in a non-title tag team match In the end, Jimmy performed an Uso Splash on Alexander to win the match [30]\n\n\nPre-show\nDuring the Crown Jewel

end, Jimmy performed an Uso Splash on Alexander to win the match [30]\n\n\nPreliminary matches\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Edge facing Seth Rollins in a Hell in a Cell match At the start, Edge started to attack Rollins in corner with right hands, but Rollins reversed and then did it himself, but Edge reversed and did it a second time Throughout the match, the two used various weapons, including a steel pipe, steel chair, a ladder, tables, and the steel steps One notable moment included Rollins performing a sunset bomb from the top of the ladder on Edge through a table, but it resulted in a nearfall Towards the end, Rollins placed Edge's head onto a chair and attempted a Stomp, however, Edge countered Edge performed multiple superkicks of his own on Rollins Edge untangled the chain around Rollins' foot and applied the Crossface on Rollins using a steel pipe In the end, Edge performed a Stomp of his own on Rollins onto a chair to pin him and win the match [31]\n\n\nMain event\nIn the main event, Roman Reigns (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the Universal Championship against Brock Lesnar During the early half of the match, Lesnar constantly tried to perform a Suplex on Reigns, however, Reigns held the top rope Lesnar eventually performed multiple German Suplexes and an F-5 on Reigns for a nearfall As Lesnar attempted a second F-5, Reigns countered into a Guillotine Choke who fought out with a Spinebuster In the climax, Lesnar performed an F-5 on Reigns, who fell onto the referee, incapacitating him Heyman then tossed the title in the middle of the ring, between both wrestlers, although it was unclear as towards whom Heyman intended to throw the title This led to Reigns and Lesnar engaging into a tug-of-war with the title Although Lesnar gained control of the title, The Usos came out and attacked Lesnar with a Double Superkick Reigns then struck Lesnar over the head with the title A second referee then came out and Reigns pinned Lesnar to retain the title [31]\n\n\nReception\nThe 2021 Crown Jewel received generally positive reviews from fans and critics alike The Hell in a Cell match between Edge and Seth Rollins was widely praised, with Brent Brookhouse of CBS Sports saying it stole the show, [32] John Canton from TJR Wrestling graded the match 5 stars out of 5 [33] and Chris Mueller of Bleacher Report calling it match of the night Additionally, Mueller went on to praise the entire event, giving both the Hell in a Cell match and the triple threat match for the SmackDown Women's Championship a grade of A, while the only poorly received match was Doudrop vs Zelina Vega, which they graded C+ [30] WWE named the Hell in a Cell match the best match out of their top 25 matches in 2021, where it was ranked #1

SmackDown, the night after Crown Jewel This in turn meant that some rivalries, such as the one between WWE Champion Big E and Drew McIntyre, ended at Crown Jewel, as Big E remained on Raw while McIntyre went to SmackDown [35] The draft also impacted the King of the Ring and Queen's Crown tournaments as going into Crown Jewel, King of the Ring winner Xavier Woods had represented Raw but joined the SmackDown roster the following night, while Queen's Crown winner Zelina Vega had represented SmackDown, but moved to Raw [31] Also, Becky Lynch, who was drafted to Raw and had retained the SmackDown Women's Championship at Crown Jewel, exchanged championships with Raw Women's Champion Charlotte Flair, who was drafted to SmackDown This was done to keep the titles on their respective brands, meaning Charlotte became a record 13 time women's champion [36]\n\n\nSmackDown\nAfter Crown Jewel, it was reported that Brock Lesnar said he would be at the following night's SmackDown and would beat Roman Reigns senseless for what transpired at the event Reigns opened SmackDown, and questioned Paul Heyman's allegiance before calling out Lesnar After several minutes of taunting Lesnar, he finally came out and brawled with Reigns The Usos attempted to save Reigns only for Lesnar to take them out, who continued attacking Reigns WWE official Adam Pearce called for several members of SmackDown's roster, as well as security, to restrain Lesnar, who took out the majority of them Lesnar then taunted Reigns and posed in the ring with the Universal Championship as Reigns retreated backstage Following this, Pearce announced that Lesnar was suspended indefinitely for his actions Lesnar responded by performing two F-5s on Pearce [36] In addition to the suspension, Pearce fined Lesnar $1 million [37] Lesnar's suspension was lifted a month later after paying his fine, and he returned on the December 3 episode where he convinced Sami Zayn, who had become the number one contender the previous week, [38] to face Reigns for the title that night WWE official Sonya Deville made it official and that the winner would defend the Universal Championship against Lesnar at Day 1 Just before the match, Lesnar attacked Zayn, which allowed Reigns to quickly defeat Zayn and retain the title, officially scheduling Reigns to defend the championship against Lesnar at Day 1 [39]\n\n\nRaw\nOn the following Raw, Becky Lynch boasted about becoming Raw Women's Champion again as well as for her victory at Crown Jewel Bianca Belair, who was also drafted to Raw, interrupted and pointed out the fact that Lynch did not beat her at Crown Jewel, as Lynch had pinned Sasha Banks in the triple threat match Belair also made the point that she had defeated former Raw Women's Champion Charlotte Flair the previous week and deserved a title match A brawl ensued between the two Following the brawl, Lynch stated that Belair would get a title shot, but not that night The match was

joined the SmackDown roster the following night, while Queen's Crown winner Zelina Vega had represented SmackDown, but moved to Raw [31] Also, Becky Lynch, who was drafted to Raw and had retained the SmackDown Women's Championship at Crown Jewel, exchanged championships with Raw Women's Champion Charlotte Flair, who was drafted to SmackDown This was done to keep the titles on their respective brands, meaning Charlotte became a record 13 time women's champion [36]\n\n\nSmackDown\nAfter Crown Jewel, it was reported that Brock Lesnar said he would be at the following night's SmackDown and would beat Roman Reigns senseless for what transpired at the event Reigns opened SmackDown, and questioned Paul Heyman's allegiance before calling out Lesnar After several minutes of taunting Lesnar, he finally came out and brawled with Reigns The Usos attempted to save Reigns only for Lesnar to take them out, who continued attacking Reigns WWE official Adam Pearce called for several members of SmackDown's roster, as well as security, to restrain Lesnar, who took out the majority of them Lesnar then taunted Reigns and posed in the ring with the Universal Championship as Reigns retreated backstage Following this, Pearce announced that Lesnar was suspended indefinitely for his actions Lesnar responded by performing two F-5s on Pearce [36] In addition to the suspension, Pearce fined Lesnar $1 million [37] Lesnar's suspension was lifted a month later after paying his fine, and he returned on the December 3 episode where he convinced Sami Zayn, who had become the number one contender the previous week, [38] to face Reigns for the title that night WWE official Sonya Deville made it official and that the winner would defend the Universal Championship against Lesnar at Day 1 Just before the match, Lesnar attacked Zayn, which allowed Reigns to quickly defeat Zayn and retain the title, officially scheduling Reigns to defend the championship against Lesnar at Day 1 [39]\n\n\nRaw\nOn the following Raw, Becky Lynch boasted about becoming Raw Women's Champion again as well as for her victory at Crown Jewel Bianca Belair, who was also drafted to Raw, interrupted and pointed out the fact that Lynch did not beat her at Crown Jewel, as Lynch had pinned Sasha Banks in the triple threat match Belair also made the point that she had defeated former Raw Women's Champion Charlotte Flair the previous week and deserved a title match A brawl ensued between the two Following the brawl, Lynch stated that Belair would get a title shot, but not that night The match was scheduled for the following week, [40] where Lynch retained [41]\n\n\nResults\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

October 21, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York, to German-Jewish parents Murray and Ethel Blum Sheindlin is a former  Manhattan Family Court Prosecutor, Supervising Family Court Judge and Judge Judy television series arbitration star of 25 years She is the arbitrator and sole creator of Judy Justice.\n\n\nSupporting cast\nSheindlin's supporting cast is made up of three members: a law clerk, a stenographer, and a bailiff The added positions of a law clerk and stenographer (which is considered a twist for arbitration court shows) seated within the witness stands were described by show executives as a necessary move to create more life, youth and entertainment at the bench It has also been described as instrumental in reflecting Sheindlin's pre-celebrity Manhattan family court roots where there existed a law clerk to one side of her and stenographer to the other, likewise seated near the witness stand areas [19] [20]\n\n\nFill-in supporting Cast\nIn season 3, episode 35, the show began using a fill-in cast The cast members were used on a temporary basis \n\n\nBackstage crew\nSheindlin has spoken highly of the backstage crew that helped her produce and direct the Judge Judy program, sharing that most of them have joined her at Amazon \"That will keep my life on a steady keel,\" explained Sheindlin [30] [31] According to Judge Judy team members, the vast majority of behind-the-scenes crew from Judge Judy were said to have rejoined Sheindlin for Judy Justice [32] Included as part of Sheindlin's backstage crew are former Judge Judy executive producers resuming their same roles in the spin-off:\n\n\nSeries presentation and processes\nIn a court programming trend initiated by the Judge Judy program, each Judy Justice episode commences with a cold open trailer of the forthcoming case to be featured in that airing This is followed by the show's title sequence, presenting the cast Litigants are then shown making entrances to their respective lecterns, one always assigned to plaintiff and the other to defendant Bailiff Kevin Rasco swears in the litigants and then instructs the audience to come to order and rise for Sheindlin's entrance After Sheindlin enters, she herself instructs the audience to be seated Rasco then provides her with case files and the docket number just before the proceedings begin.\n\n\nOn-air format\nIn a court programming

litigants and then instructs the audience to come to order and rise for Sheindlin's entrance After Sheindlin enters, she herself instructs the audience to be seated Rasco then provides her with case files and the docket number just before the proceedings begin.\n\n\nMonetary award limit\nIn a first for standard court shows, the maximum award limit for Judy Justice is $10,000 Conversely, the maximum award limit for most arbitration-based courtroom programming, including Sheindlin's Judge Judy precursor, has historically been $5,000 [9] While the Judy Justice award limit represents an advancement for the court show genre, the norm for actual small claims court in its authentic form outside of televised entertainment has historically allowed complainants to request anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000, depending on jurisdiction [35]\n\n\nFirst-run streaming\nIn March 2020, when Sheindlin initially announced her plans for a new court show, she and her talent agent, Scott Koondel, rejected the option of first-run syndication in favor of first-run streaming [36] Judy Justice is the first standard arbitration-based reality court show to air first-run episodes through streaming The nontraditional comedy court miniseries Gary Busey: Pet Judge (which ran for six episodes in 2020) was a streaming broadcast as well On moving from 25 years in first-run syndication to a streaming service, Sheindlin has stated, \"In three to five years all broadcasting will change Now it’s streaming I’m excited to be in this new venture.\" [16]\n\n\nSet design\nSheindlin has advertised her newer program as more trendy and chic than the precursor, referencing the use of new media, a new robe, and an all new look [16] Judy Justice showcases a similar but refreshed, upscale, modern version of the courtroom set design from Judge Judy,  with a different wood color, marble columns and monitors that are built into the set [37] [34] Sheindlin also presides from a taller, black-colored executive office chair in Judy Justice, discontinuing the burgundy red colored executive office chair used for most of Judge Judy (a reversal on those colors, Sheindlin now sports a burgundy robe in Judy Justice, discontinuing use of her traditionally black robe from Judge Judy) [38] While the American Flag and New York State Flag were behind Sheindlin in Judge Judy, the New York State Flag is replaced in Judy Justice with another Whereas the audience stands were filled with individual chairs in Judge Judy, furnished benches fill the stands in Judy Justice [39] [16]\n\n\nBroadcast and production details\nJudy Justice is notable in that its debut features Sheindlin's return to an in-person/in-studio setup as far as her judicial dispute handling Resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, Judge Judy ended its final season with Sheindlin presented virtually, only the litigants and Byrd appearing in studio and absent of an audience While there exists a studio audience in Judy Justice, it is made up of significantly fewer people, a move that allows the audience members to be vastly separated from one another With COVID-19 still in progress during first season production of Judy Justice, the cast and crew were all met with a host of elaborate challenges and barriers during development of each episode To reduce the chances of potential spread of the virus among cast, crew, litigants, witnesses and audience members, stringent safety measures were enacted: masking, social distancing, regular COVID-19 testing, vaccinations, etc These procedures added even more time to the already involved hours that go into tapings and studio processes, the extra COVID-19 functions described as putting executive producers, in particular, to the test as far as efficiency [40]\n\n\nBehind-the-scenes operations\nJudy Justice is notable in that its debut features Sheindlin's return to an in-person/in-studio setup as far as her judicial dispute handling Resulting from the

more time to the already involved hours that go into tapings and studio processes, the extra COVID-19 functions described as putting executive producers, in particular, to the test as far as efficiency [40]\n\n\nSeason one and episode lengths\nAltogether, the completed first season of Judy Justice contains 120 episodes Per her contract, Sheindlin and her Judy Justice crew were commissioned to produce 120 by December 2021, the largest initial order package for a streaming series [2] Production of the program's first season of 120 episodes was completed in a span of three months, the tapings running from mid-July 2021 through October 2021 [40] As reported by the show's staff, Judy Justice cases span longer and explore more depth and detail than the typical episode of Judge Judy In part, this is  due to less time constraints on streaming platforms in contrast to first-run syndication.\n\n\nEpisode release schedule and channel dedication\nJudy Justice debuted on November 1, 2021, on Amazon-owned IMDb TV with its first four episodes Typically, Judy Justice only releases one new episode (occasionally two) for each weekday, which is the custom of most courtroom programming This contrasts, however, to most streaming service programs which release episodes in large batches at extended hiatus intervals for seasonal binge viewing [2] Following December 17, 2021, the program entered into its winter hiatus and returned 5 weeks later, resuming season 1, on January 24, 2022 On January 20, 2022, midway into the court show's 1st season, IMDb TV announced plans to launch a 24/7 streaming channel dedicated to Judy Justice, elevating the show's presence on their platform [41] On March 8, 2022, IMDb TV renewed Judy Justice for a second season [42] The first season ended on April 15, 2022 [5]\n\n\nFilming locations\nThe court show is filmed in Los Angeles, the same city where Judge Judy was filmed Specifically, the court show is filmed in Culver City, California, at Culver Studios [44]\n\n\nEpisodes\nAmid Sheindlin's displeasure with various salary and programming-related judgment calls made by Judge Judy distributor CBS Media Ventures, as well as recurrent legal claims repeatedly filed against her and CBS by talent agency Rebel Entertainment to secure allegedly owed profits for uniting her and CBS, she announced the end of Judge Judy [45] [46] It was in a March 2, 2020, appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show when it was first reported by Sheindlin herself that her long-running, top daytime Nielsen-rated courtroom series would conclude in then following 2020–21 television season (the show's 25th-anniversary season) [47]\n\n\nOrigins and development\nAmid Sheindlin's displeasure with various salary and programming-related judgment calls

25th-anniversary season) [47]\n\n\nEstablishing a distributor\nAfter Scott Koondel, one of three executive producers for Judy Justice, shopped Sheindlin's spin-off series around the media to various streaming distributors for several months, it was first announced on October 29, 2020, that Sheindlin had signed a deal with Amazon Studios to stream Judy Justice [45] Some early media reports of the Amazon partnership claimed that Judy Justice would be produced in part by Scott Koondel's Sox Entertainment production company, [52] though updated reports have only cited Amazon Studios as producing the series [53] The information that has remained consistent in both early and later news reports, however, is that Sheindlin hired Koondel to market her new court show around the entertainment industry Koondel's efforts resulted in the partnership between Sheindlin and Amazon [3] [54]\n\n\nPre-production arrangements\nSheindlin returned to Los Angeles—the same city where Judge Judy was filmed—in mid-July 2021 to begin production on Judy Justice, which was 4 months before the program's debut [59] [31] Until September 9, 2021, when numerous Judy Justice details were revealed with significant media publicity and numerous press releases, Sheindlin and the program were largely confidential with journalists on what to expect, feeling that revealing too much would spoil the surprises for viewers Sheindlin had also shared that contract restrictions prevented her from disclosing details in relation to Judy Justice [60] She did, however, note her desires to abandon her trademarked lace collar, as well as the traditionally black colored judicial robe in favor of another colored robe [30] [60] On September 9, 2021, Sheindlin revealed her new robe color as burgundy in the first videography from the program, a teaser trailer in which she declared, \"Court is back in session.\" [7]\n\n\nPartnership with Amazon Studios/IMDb TV\nAs part of her contract with Amazon Studios, Sheindlin has complete ownership rights over Judy Justice [62] It was reported in March 2020 that Sheindlin had committed to at least two seasons of presiding over the program [57]\n\n\nSalary and contracts\nAs part of her contract with Amazon Studios, Sheindlin has complete ownership rights over Judy Justice [62] It was reported in March 2020 that Sheindlin had committed to at least two seasons of presiding over the program [57]\n\n\nAmazon Studios/IMDb TV's future outlook\nAmazon Studios ordered a 120 episode first season of Judy Justice by November 2020, a year prior to its debut Expressing optimism over Judy Justice, Co-Heads of Content and Programming for IMDb TV Lauren Anderson and Ryan Pirozzi were quoted as stating:\n\n\nViewership data\nIt was reported that Judy Justice will be in direct competition with reruns of its predecessor for highest court viewership ratings In early September 2021, veteran syndicated television programming analyst Bill Carroll projected stiff competition from syndicated Judge Judy reruns by CBS, such that will presumably leave Judy Justice defeated by its rival Explaining his rationale, Carroll stated:\n\n\nEarly projections of Amazon MGM's Judy Justice vs Paramount's Judge Judy reruns\nIt was reported that Judy Justice will be in direct competition with reruns of its predecessor for highest court viewership ratings In early September 2021, veteran syndicated television programming analyst Bill Carroll projected stiff competition from syndicated Judge Judy reruns by CBS, such that will presumably leave Judy Justice defeated by its rival Explaining his rationale, Carroll stated:\n\n\nViewership results by season\nJudy Justice came in as the No 1 original program on IMDb TV for its first season, with more than 25 million streaming hours viewed towards the end of that season [72] According to the New York Post, the first season generated more than 75 million hours watched between both the US and the UK as a whole [43] On March 8, 2022, a month prior to its season 1 finale, it was announced that the program had been immediately renewed for season 2, following reports of high viewership In an interview response to this news, Sheindlin stated, “I am over the moon and couldn’t be happier with the Judy Justice reception in streaming Amazon has been a terrific partner, and I look forward to our continued collaboration.” [12] Since Nielsen Media Research does not conduct ratings for streaming services (though this will soon be changing at least for Netflix, which will begin using Nielsen in 2023), [73] viewership for Judy Justice season 1 was measured by hours watched and calculated by IMDb TV themselves.\n\n\nSeason one\nJudy Justice came in as the No 1 original program on IMDb TV

high viewership In an interview response to this news, Sheindlin stated, “I am over the moon and couldn’t be happier with the Judy Justice reception in streaming Amazon has been a terrific partner, and I look forward to our continued collaboration.” [12] Since Nielsen Media Research does not conduct ratings for streaming services (though this will soon be changing at least for Netflix, which

against executive producers\nAmid the spin-off's debut, Executive Producer Randy Douthit came under fire in November 2021 over years of lawsuits and allegations in relation to creating a toxic workplace backstage of Judge Judy Sixteen former Judge Judy producers alleged Douthit came to work drunk; engaged in sexual harassment; made inappropriate comments about the appearance of female litigants or disabled litigants; fired staff due to their age; and said he didn't want African-Americans overrepresented on the show [82] [83] Among examples, a 2009 lawsuit filed by former Senior Producer Jonathan Sebastien alleged that Douthit announced, \"We're not doing any more Black shows I don't want to hear Black people arguing.\" In November 2021, six former Judge Judy staffers confirmed Sebastien's account [84] [82] [83] Douthit, however, denied any wrongdoing and most of the cases were dismissed or settled out of court [citation needed]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal

Justice.\n\n\nSupporting cast\nSheindlin's supporting cast is made up of three members: a law clerk, a stenographer, and a bailiff The added positions of a law clerk and stenographer (which is considered a twist for arbitration court shows) seated within the witness stands were described by show executives as a necessary move to create more life, youth and entertainment at the bench It has also been described as instrumental in reflecting Sheindlin's pre-celebrity Manhattan family court roots where there existed a law clerk to one side of her and stenographer to the other, likewise seated near the witness stand areas [19] [20]\n\n\nFill-in supporting Cast\nIn season 3, episode 35, the show began using a fill-in cast The cast members were used on a temporary basis \n\n\nBackstage crew\nSheindlin has spoken highly of the backstage crew that helped her produce and direct the Judge Judy program, sharing that most of them have joined her at Amazon \"That will keep my life on a steady keel,\" explained Sheindlin [30] [31] According to Judge Judy team members, the vast majority of behind-the-scenes crew from Judge Judy were said to have rejoined Sheindlin for Judy Justice [32] Included as part of Sheindlin's backstage crew are former Judge Judy executive producers resuming their same roles in the spin-off:\n\n\nSeries presentation and processes\nIn a court programming

first for standard court shows, the maximum award limit for Judy Justice is $10,000 Conversely, the maximum award limit for most arbitration-based courtroom programming, including Sheindlin's Judge Judy precursor, has historically been $5,000 [9] While the Judy Justice award limit represents an advancement for the court show genre, the norm for actual small claims court in its authentic form outside of televised entertainment has historically allowed complainants to request anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000, depending on jurisdiction [35]\n\n\nFirst-run streaming\nIn March 2020, when Sheindlin initially announced her plans for a new court show, she and her talent agent, Scott Koondel, rejected the option of first-run syndication in favor of first-run streaming [36] Judy Justice is the first standard arbitration-based reality court show to air first-run episodes through streaming The nontraditional comedy court miniseries Gary Busey: Pet Judge (which ran for six episodes in 2020) was a streaming broadcast as well On moving from 25 years in first-run syndication to a streaming service, Sheindlin has stated, \"In three to five years all broadcasting will change Now it’s streaming I’m excited to be in this new venture.\" [16]\n\n\nSet design\nSheindlin has advertised her newer program as more trendy and chic than the precursor, referencing the use of new media, a new robe, and an all new look [16] Judy Justice showcases a similar but refreshed, upscale, modern version of the courtroom set design from Judge Judy,  with a different wood color, marble columns and monitors that are built into the set [37] [34] Sheindlin also presides from a taller, black-colored executive office chair in Judy Justice, discontinuing the burgundy red colored executive office chair used for most of Judge Judy (a reversal on those colors, Sheindlin now sports a burgundy robe in Judy Justice, discontinuing use of her traditionally black robe from Judge Judy) [38] While the American Flag and New York State Flag were behind Sheindlin in Judge Judy, the New York State Flag is replaced in Judy Justice with another Whereas the audience stands were filled with individual chairs in Judge Judy, furnished benches fill the stands in Judy Justice [39] [16]\n\n\nBroadcast and production details\nJudy Justice is notable in that its debut features Sheindlin's return to an in-person/in-studio setup as far as her judicial dispute handling Resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, Judge Judy ended its final season with Sheindlin presented virtually, only the litigants and Byrd appearing in studio and absent of an audience While there exists a studio audience in Judy Justice, it is made up of significantly fewer people, a move that allows the audience members to be vastly separated from one another With COVID-19 still in progress during first season production of Judy Justice, the cast and crew were all met with a host of elaborate challenges and barriers during development of each episode To reduce the chances of potential spread of the virus among cast, crew, litigants, witnesses and audience members, stringent safety measures were enacted: masking, social distancing, regular COVID-19 testing, vaccinations, etc These procedures added even more time to the already involved hours that go into tapings and studio processes, the extra COVID-19 functions described as putting executive producers, in particular, to the test as far as efficiency [40]\n\n\nBehind-the-scenes operations\nJudy Justice is notable in that its debut features Sheindlin's return

episodes Per her contract, Sheindlin and her Judy Justice crew were commissioned to produce 120 by December 2021, the largest initial order package for a streaming series [2] Production of the program's first season of 120 episodes was completed in a span of three months, the tapings running from mid-July 2021 through October 2021 [40] As reported by the show's staff, Judy Justice cases span longer and explore more depth and detail than the typical episode of Judge Judy In part, this is  due to less time constraints on streaming platforms in contrast to first-run syndication.\n\n\nEpisode release schedule and channel dedication\nJudy Justice debuted on November 1, 2021, on Amazon-owned IMDb TV with its first four episodes Typically, Judy Justice only releases one new episode (occasionally two) for each weekday, which is the custom of most courtroom programming This contrasts, however, to most streaming service programs which release episodes in large batches at extended hiatus intervals for seasonal binge viewing [2] Following December 17, 2021, the program entered into its winter hiatus and returned 5 weeks later, resuming season 1, on January 24, 2022 On January 20, 2022, midway into the court show's 1st season, IMDb TV announced plans to launch a 24/7 streaming channel dedicated to Judy Justice, elevating the show's presence on their

Sox Entertainment production company, [52] though updated reports have only cited Amazon Studios as producing the series [53] The information that has remained consistent in both early and later news reports, however, is that Sheindlin hired Koondel to market her new court show around the entertainment industry Koondel's efforts resulted in the partnership between Sheindlin and Amazon [3] [54]\n\n\nPre-production arrangements\nSheindlin returned to Los Angeles—the same city where Judge Judy was filmed—in mid-July 2021 to begin production on Judy Justice, which was 4 months before the

in sexual harassment; made inappropriate comments about the appearance of female litigants or disabled litigants; fired staff due to their age; and said he didn't want African-Americans overrepresented on the show [82] [83] Among examples, a 2009 lawsuit filed by former Senior Producer Jonathan Sebastien alleged that Douthit announced, \"We're not doing any more Black shows I don't

organizer with Local 299 of the Teamsters in Detroit [10]\n\n\nGrowth of Teamsters\nThe Teamsters, founded in 1903, had 75,000 members in 1933 As a result of Hoffa's work with other union leaders, he consolidated local union trucker groups into regional sections and then into a national body, which Hoffa ultimately completed over two decades; membership grew to 170,000 members by 1936, and three years later, to 420,000 The number grew steadily during World War II and in the postwar boom to eventually top a million members by 1951 [11]\n\n\nRise to power\nHoffa worked to defend the Teamsters from raids by other unions, including the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and he extended the Teamsters' influence in the Midwest from the late 1930s to the late 1940s  Hoffa obtained a deferment from military service in World War II by successfully making a case for his union leadership skills being of more value to the nation by keeping freight running smoothly to assist the war effort  Although he never actually worked as a truck driver, he became president of Local 299 in December 1946 [14] He then rose to lead the combined group of Detroit-area locals shortly afterwards and later advanced to become head of the Michigan Teamsters groups.\n\n\nTeamsters presidency\nHoffa took over the presidency of the Teamsters in 1957, at the convention in Miami Beach, Florida [20] Beck, his predecessor, had appeared before the John L McClellan-led US Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor or Management Field in March 1957 and took the Fifth Amendment 140 times [21]  Beck was under indictment when the IBT convention took place and was convicted and imprisoned in a trial for fraud held in Seattle [22]\n\n\nTeamsters expelled from AFL-CIO\nAt the 1957 AFL-CIO convention, held in Atlantic City, New Jersey, union members voted nearly five to one to expel the IBT Vice-president Walter Reuther led the fight to oust the IBT on charges of Hoffa's corrupt leadership [23] President George Meany gave an emotional speech, advocating the removal of the IBT and stating that he could only agree to further affiliation of the Teamsters if they dismissed Hoffa as their president Meany demanded a response from Hoffa, who replied through the press, \"We'll see.\" At the time, the IBT was bringing in over $750,000 annually to the AFL-CIO [24] [25]\n\n\nNational Master Freight Agreement\nFollowing his re-election as president in 1961, Hoffa worked to expand the union [26] In 1964, he succeeded in bringing virtually all over-the-road truck drivers in North America under a single National Master Freight Agreement, which may have been his biggest achievement in a lifetime of union activity [27] Hoffa then tried to bring airline workers and other transport employees into the union, with limited success He then faced immense personal strain as he was under investigation, on trial, launching appeals of convictions, or imprisoned for virtually all of the 1960s [12]\n\n\nCriminal charges\nHoffa faced major criminal investigations in 1957, as a result of the McClellan Committee On March 14, 1957, Hoffa was arrested for allegedly trying to bribe an aide to the Select Committee [29] Hoffa denied the charges (and was later acquitted), but the arrest triggered additional investigations and more arrests and indictments over the following weeks [30] [31] When John F Kennedy was elected president in 1960, he appointed his younger brother Robert as Attorney General Robert Kennedy had been frustrated in earlier attempts to convict Hoffa, while working as counsel to the McClellan subcommittee As attorney general from 1961, Kennedy pursued a strong attack on organized crime and he carried on with a so-called \"Get Hoffa\" squad of prosecutors and investigators [32] [33]\n\n\nPrison sentences\nIn May 1963, Hoffa was indicted for jury tampering in Tennessee, charged with the attempted bribery of a grand juror during his 1962 conspiracy trial in Nashville Hoffa was convicted on March 4, 1964, and subsequently sentenced to eight years in prison and a $10,000 fine [34] [30] [35] While on bail during his appeal, Hoffa was convicted in a second trial held in Chicago, on July 26, 1964, on one count of conspiracy and three counts of mail and wire fraud for improper use of the Teamsters' pension fund, and sentenced to five years in prison [34] [36]\n\n\nAppointment of Fitzsimmons as caretaker president\nWhen Hoffa entered prison, Frank Fitzsimmons was named acting president of the union, [39] and Hoffa planned to run the union from prison through Fitzsimmons [40] Fitzsimmons was a Hoffa loyalist, fellow Detroit resident, and a longtime member of Teamsters Local 299, who owed his own high position in large part to Hoffa's influence Despite this, Fitzsimmons soon distanced himself from Hoffa's influence and control after 1967, to Hoffa's displeasure Fitzsimmons also decentralized power somewhat within the IBT's administration structure, forgoing much of the control Hoffa took advantage of as union president [12] While still in prison, Hoffa resigned as Teamsters president on June 19, 1971, [38] and Fitzsimmons was elected Teamsters president on July 9, 1971 [41]\n\n\nAfter prison\nOn December 23, 1971, less than five years into his 13-year sentence, Hoffa was released from prison when US President Richard Nixon commuted it to time served [37] As a result of Hoffa's previous resignation, he was awarded a $1.75 million lump sum termination benefit by the Teamsters Retirement and Family Protection Plan [38] That type of pension settlement had never occurred with the Teamsters [42] The IBT then endorsed Nixon, a Republican, in his presidential re-election bid in 1972 In prior elections, the union had normally supported Democratic nominees, but switched and endorsed Nixon in 1960 [43] [page needed]\n\n\nDisappearance\nHoffa's plans to regain the leadership of the union were

of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) from 1957 to 1971. His leadership in the labor movement and his associations with organized crime made him a polarizing figure in American politics and society. Hoffa's disappearance in 1975 remains one of the most infamous unsolved mysteries in American history.\n\nEarly Life and Family\nJimmy Hoffa was born on February 14, 1913, in Brazil, Indiana, to John and Viola (née Riddle) Hoffa. His father was of German descent from what is now referred to as the Pennsylvania Dutch, and his mother was of Irish ancestry. When Hoffa was seven years old, his father died from lung disease. The family moved to Detroit in 1924, where Hoffa was raised and lived for the rest of his life. Hoffa left school at the age of 14 and began working full-time manual labor jobs to help support his family.\n\nEarly Union Activity\nHoffa began union organizational work at the grassroots level as a teenager through his job with a grocery chain, which paid substandard wages and offered poor working conditions with minimal job security. The workers were displeased with that situation and tried to organize a union to better their wages. Hoffa's courage and approachability in that role impressed fellow workers, and he rose to a leadership position. By 1932, after refusing to work for an abusive shift foreman, Hoffa left the grocery chain, partly because of his union activities. He was then invited to become an organizer with Local 299 of the Teamsters in Detroit.\n\nGrowth of Teamsters\nThe Teamsters, founded in 1903, had 75,000 members in 1933. As a result of Hoffa's work with other union leaders, he consolidated local union trucker groups into regional sections and then into a national body, which Hoffa ultimately completed over two decades. Membership grew to 170,000 members by 1936, and three years later, to 420,000. The number grew steadily during World War II and in the postwar boom to eventually top a million members by 1951.\n\nRise to Power\nHoffa worked to defend the Teamsters from raids by other unions, including the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and he extended the Teamsters' influence in the Midwest from the late 1930s to the late 1940s. Hoffa obtained a deferment from military service in World War II by successfully making a case for his union leadership skills being of more value to the nation by keeping freight running smoothly to assist the war effort. Although he never actually worked as a truck driver, he became president of Local 299 in December 1946. He then rose to lead the combined group of Detroit-area locals shortly afterwards and later advanced to become head of the Michigan Teamsters groups.\n\nTeamsters Presidency\nHoffa took over the presidency of the Teamsters in 1957, at the convention in Miami Beach, Florida. Beck, his predecessor, had appeared before the John L McClellan-led US Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor or Management Field in March 1957 and took the Fifth Amendment 140 times.

{"title": "Wilt_Chamberlain", "content": "\nEarly years\nWilton Norman Chamberlain was born on August 21, 1936, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the sixth of nine children to southerners Olivia Ruth (née Johnson), a domestic worker, and William Chamberlain, a welder and handyman [1] [2] The family lived in a middle-class neighborhood in the Haddington section of West Philadelphia [3] Chamberlain was raised as a Baptist [4]\n\n\nHigh school career\nChamberlain stood 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) when he entered Philadelphia's Overbrook High School [9] As an avid track and field athlete, he high jumped 6 feet, 6 inches, ran the 440 yards in 49.0 seconds and the 880 yards in 1:58.3, put the shot 53 feet, 4 inches, and long jumped 22 feet [10]\n\n\nOverbrook High School (1953–1955)\nChamberlain stood 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) when he entered Philadelphia's Overbrook High School [9] As an avid track and field athlete, he high jumped 6 feet, 6 inches, ran the 440 yards in 49.0 seconds and the 880 yards in 1:58.3, put the shot 53 feet, 4 inches, and long jumped 22 feet [10]\n\n\n1953: city runner-up\nChamberlain averaged 31 points per game during his 1953 high-school season and led his team to a 71–62 win over the Northeast High School team of Hall of Fame guard Guy Rodgers Chamberlain scored 34 points as Overbrook won the Philadelphia Public League title and gained a spot in the city championship game against West Catholic High School, the winner of the rival Catholic league [17] In that game, West Catholic quadruple-teamed Chamberlain throughout the game, and despite his 29 points, the Hilltoppers lost 54–42 [17]\n\n\n1954: city champions\nIn his second season, Chamberlain led Overbrook to a 19–0 season He scored a high-school record 71 points against Roxborough [18] The Hilltoppers comfortably won the Public League title after again beating Northeast High, as Chamberlain scored 40 points Overbrook then won the city title by defeating South Catholic 74–50 Chamberlain scored 32 points and Overbrook finished the season undefeated [18]\n\n\n1955: city champions\nIn Chamberlain's third and final Overbrook season, he continued his high scoring, logging 74, 78, and 90 points in three consecutive games [22] The Hilltoppers suffered just one loss, to Farrell High 59–58 [23] Overbrook won the Public League a third time, beating West Philadelphia 78–60; in the city championship game, they again played West Catholic Chamberlain scored 35 points and led Overbrook to an 83–42 victory; [22] he has been retroactively honored as Mr Basketball USA for 1955, the earliest-such selection [24]\n\n\nChristian Street YMCA\nIn 1953, while still a sophomore in high school, Chamberlain won his first championship He led Christian Street YMCA to the title in the national YMCA tournament in High Point, North Carolina, beating the local favorite and defending champion High Point team 85–79 [25] [26] Chamberlain was the youngest member of the team [27]\n\n\nQuakertown Fays\nAt the ages of 16 and 17, Chamberlain, using the pseudonym George Marcus, played several games for the semi-professional team Quakertown Fays of Quakertown, Pennsylvania [28] The games were reported in Philadelphia publications but Chamberlain tried to keep them secret from the Amateur Athletic Union [29]\n\n\nCollege career\nAfter his last Overbrook season, more than 200 universities tried to recruit Chamberlain [9] Among others, UCLA offered Chamberlain the opportunity to become a movie star, the University of Pennsylvania wanted to buy him diamonds, and Cecil Mosenson, Chamberlain's coach at Overbrook, was offered a coaching position if he could persuade Chamberlain to accept an offer [22]\n\n\nUniversity of Kansas (1956–1958)\nIn 1955, Chamberlain entered the University of Kansas (KU); he was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity and was president of his pledge class [31] As he had at Overbrook, Chamberlain displayed his diverse athletic talent at KU He ran the 100-yard dash in 10.9 seconds, shot-putted fifty-six feet (17 m), triple jumped more than fifty feet (15 m), and won the high jump in the Big Eight Conference track-and-field championships in three consecutive years [32] [d] Chamberlain allegedly dunked on an experimental 12-foot basket set up by Phog Allen [34]\n\n\nSophomore season (1957): national runner-up to North Carolina\nOn December 3, 1956, Chamberlain made his varsity basketball debut as a center for the Kansas Jayhawks In his first game, he scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds, breaking both all-time Kansas records in an 87–69 win against the Northwestern Wildcats, a team with Chamberlain's future NBA teammate Joe Ruklick playing center [44] Chamberlain led a talented squad of starters, including Maurice King, Gene Elstun, John Parker, and Ron Lonesky; the Jayhawks went 13–1 until they lost a game 56–54 against the Oklahoma State Cowboys, who held the ball for the last three-and-a -half minutes with no intention of scoring a basket, which was still possible in the days before the shot clock, introduced by the NCAA in 1984 [44]\n\n\nJunior season (1958)\nIn Chamberlain's junior season of 1957–58, the Jayhawks' matches were increasingly frustrating for him Knowing how good he was, opponents resorted to freeze-ball tactics and routinely used three or more players to guard him [47] Teammate Bob Billings commented, \"It was not fun basketball .. we were just out chasing people throwing the basketball back and forth\" [47] Chamberlain averaged 30.1 points for the season and led the Jayhawks to an 18–5 record—three of the losses came while he was out with a urinary infection [47] The Jayhawks' season ended because KU came second in the league and only conference winners were invited to the NCAA tournament Chamberlain was again named an All-American, along with future NBA Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor of Seattle University, Oscar Robertson of Cincinnati, and Guy Rodgers, who was now playing for Temple University [47]\n\n\nProfessional career\nAfter his frustrating junior year, Chamberlain wanted to become a professional player [50] At that time, the NBA did not accept players until after their college graduating class had been completed; Chamberlain decided to play for the Harlem Globetrotters in 1958 for $50,000 [14] [16] [i] The team enjoyed a sold-out tour of the Soviet Union in 1959; they were greeted by General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev prior to the start of a game at Moscow's Lenin Central Stadium [52] One Globetrotter skit involved Captain Meadowlark Lemon collapsing to the ground; instead of helping him up, Chamberlain threw him several feet into the air and caught him like a doll Lemon, who at that time weighed 210 lb (95 kg), later said Chamberlain was \"the strongest athlete who ever lived\" [53]\n\n\nHarlem Globetrotters (1958–1959)\nAfter his frustrating junior year, Chamberlain wanted to become a professional player [50] At that time, the NBA did not accept players until after their college graduating class had been completed; Chamberlain decided to play for the Harlem Globetrotters in 1958 for $50,000 [14] [16] [i] The team enjoyed a sold-out tour of the Soviet Union in 1959; they were greeted by General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev prior to the start of a game at Moscow's Lenin Central Stadium [52] One Globetrotter skit involved Captain Meadowlark Lemon collapsing to the ground; instead of helping him up, Chamberlain threw him several feet into the air and caught him like a doll Lemon, who at that time weighed 210 lb (95 kg), later said Chamberlain was \"the strongest athlete who ever lived\" [53]\n\n\nPhiladelphia/San Francisco Warriors (1959–1965)\nChamberlain made his NBA debut on October 24, 1959, starting for the Philadelphia Warriors [14] He was listed as 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) tall and 258 lb (117 kg) [55] [j] He became the NBA's highest-paid player when he signed for $30,000 in his rookie contract [k] In comparison, the previous top earner was Bob Cousy of the Celtics with $25,000, the same sum Eddie Gottlieb used to buy the Warriors franchise in 1952 [57]\n\n\n1959–60 NBA season: MVP, All-Star Game MVP and Rookie of the Year\nIn the 1959–60 NBA season, Chamberlain joined a Philadelphia Warriors squad that was coached by Neil Johnston All five starters were native Philadelphians: Chamberlain, Tom Gola, Guy Rodgers, Hall-of-Fame forward Paul Arizin, and Ernie Beck In his first NBA game, played against the New York Knicks, Chamberlain scored 43 points and grabbed 28 rebounds [58] In his third game, Chamberlain recorded 41 points and a then-career-high 40 rebounds in a 124–113 win over the visiting Syracuse Nationals [59] In his fourth game, Philadelphia played the reigning champion Boston Celtics—who were coached by Auerbach, whose offer Chamberlain had rejected several years before—and Bill Russell, who was lauded as one of the best defensive pivots in the game [58]\n\n\n1960–61 NBA season: scoring, rebounding, durability, and field goal titles\nChamberlain's 1960–61 NBA season started with a 42-point and 31-rebound performance in a 133–123 road win against the Syracuse Nationals [68] On November 24, 1960, Chamberlain grabbed an NBA-record 55 rebounds, [16] along with 34 points and 4 assists, in a 132–129 home loss against the Russell-led Boston Celtics [69] On November 29, Chamberlain recorded 44 points, 38 rebounds, and a then-career-high 7 assists in a 122–121 road win over the Los Angeles Lakers [70]\n\n\n1961–62 NBA season: 100-point game and 42-point All-Star Game record\nIn the 1961–62 NBA season, the Warriors were coached by Frank McGuire, who had masterminded Chamberlain's triple-overtime loss in the NCAA championship against the Tar Heels In that year, Chamberlain set several all-time records which have since never been threatened; he averaged 50.4 points and grabbed 25.7 rebounds per game [71]\n\n\n1962–63 NBA season: individual success, move to San Francisco, and playoff miss\nIn the 1962–63 NBA season, Gottlieb sold the Warriors franchise for $850,000 [q] to a group of businessmen led by Franklin Mieuli from San Francisco and the team relocated and were renamed the San Francisco Warriors under new coach Bob Feerick [82] This meant the Warriors team dispersed; Arizin chose to retire rather than move away from his family and his job at IBM in Philadelphia, coach McGuire resigned rather than move to the West Coast, and Gola was homesick and requesting a trade to the New York Knicks halfway through the season [83] With both secondary scorers gone, Chamberlain continued exceeding his own statistics, averaging 44.8 points and 24.3 rebounds per game that year [71] Despite his individual success, the Warriors lost 49 of their 80 games and missed the playoffs [84]\n\n\n1963–64 NBA season: first NBA Finals loss to the Celtics\nIn the 1963–64 NBA season, Chamberlain got another new coach, former NBA player and ex-soldier Alex Hannum, and was joined by rookie center Nate Thurmond, who later entered the Hall of Fame Hannum, who later entered the Hall of Fame as a coach, was a crafty psychologist who emphasized defense and passing, and was not afraid to stand up to the dominant Chamberlain, who would not communicate with coaches he did not like [85] Backed up by Thurmond, Chamberlain recorded 36.9 points and 22.3 rebounds per game, [71] and the Warriors reached the NBA Finals In that series, they again succumbed to Russell's Boston Celtics, losing 4–1 [86] According to Cherry, Chamberlain and Hannum deserved much credit because Hannum had taken the previous year's 31–49 squad plus Thurmond, and became an NBA Finals contender [87]\n\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers (1965–1968)\nIn the 1964–65 NBA season, the NBA widened the lane from 12 to 16 feet (3.7 to 4.9 m), especially because of centers like Chamberlain The Warriors' season began poorly and they experienced financial trouble At the 1965 All-Star Weekend, Chamberlain was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, the renamed former-rival and relocated Syracuse Nationals Chamberlain did not like Sixers' coach Dolph Schayes, who he thought had made several disrespectful remarks when they were rival players [90] The Warriors received $150,000 [r] and Paul Neumann, Connie Dierking, and Lee Shaffer—who opted to retire rather than report to the Warriors [14] [16] When Chamberlain left the Warriors, owner Franklin Mieuli said: \"Chamberlain is not an easy man to love .. the fans in San Francisco never learned to love him Wilt is easy to hate .. people came to see him lose.\" [50]\n\n\n1964–65 NBA season: trade to the 76ers, division finals loss to the Celtics\nIn the 1964–65 NBA season, the NBA widened the lane from 12 to 16 feet (3.7 to 4.9 m), especially because of centers like Chamberlain The Warriors' season began poorly and they experienced financial trouble At the 1965 All-Star Weekend, Chamberlain was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, the renamed former-rival and relocated Syracuse Nationals Chamberlain did not like Sixers' coach Dolph Schayes, who he thought had made several disrespectful remarks when they were rival players [90] The Warriors received $150,000 [r] and Paul Neumann, Connie Dierking, and Lee Shaffer—who opted to retire rather than report to the Warriors [14] [16] When Chamberlain left the Warriors, owner Franklin Mieuli said: \"Chamberlain is not an easy man to love .. the fans in San Francisco never learned to love him Wilt is easy to hate .. people came to see him lose.\" [50]\n\n\n1965–66 NBA season: MVP and second division finals loss to the Celtics\nIn the 1965–66 NBA season, Ike Richman, the Sixers' co-owner as well as Chamberlain's confidant and lawyer, died of a heart attack while attending a road game in Boston The Sixers posted a 55–25 regular-season record and Chamberlain won his second MVP award [45] In that season, Chamberlain again dominated his opposition by recording 33.5 points and 24.6 rebounds a game, leading the league in both categories [71] In one game, Chamberlain dislocated the shoulder of Baltimore Bullets player Gus Johnson by blocking his dunk attempt [97]\n\n\n1966–67 NBA season: back-to-back MVP and first NBA title\nPrior to the 1966–67 NBA season, Schayes was replaced by the more-assertive Alex Hannum According to Cherry, in a locker room meeting, Hannum addressed several key issues he observed during the last season, several of them putting Chamberlain in an unfavorable light Sixers forward Walker said on several occasions, players had to pull Chamberlain and Hannum apart to prevent a fistfight [99] Cunningham commented Hannum \"never backed down\" and \"showed who was the boss\", winning Chamberlain's respect [99] When emotions dissipated, Hannum told Chamberlain he was also trying to win a title but that to achieve this, Chamberlain had to \"act like a man\" both on and off the court [99] Hannum persuaded Chamberlain to change his style of play and wanted Chamberlain to concentrate more on defense than on trying to score [16] [100] Kerr was traded to the Baltimore Bullets for point guard Wali Jones, and shooting guard Matt Guokas was selected in the first round of the 1966 NBA draft.\n\n\n1967–68 NBA season: third straight MVP and assist champion\nIn the 1967–68 NBA season, the relationship between Chamberlain and Sixers' owner Kosloff continued to deteriorate In 1965, Chamberlain said he and Richman had worked out a deal that would give Chamberlain 25% of the franchise once he ended his career [108] Although there is no written proof of this agreement, Schayes and Sixers' lawyer Alan Levitt assumed Chamberlain was correct [103] Kosloff declined the request, angering

He was listed as 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) tall and 258 lb (117 kg) [55] [j] He became the NBA's highest-paid player when he signed for $30,000 in his rookie contract [k] In comparison, the previous top earner was Bob Cousy of the Celtics with $25,000, the same sum Eddie Gottlieb used to buy the Warriors franchise in 1952 [57]\n\n\n1959–60 NBA season: MVP, All-Star Game MVP and Rookie of the Year\nIn the 1959–60 NBA season, Chamberlain joined a Philadelphia Warriors squad that was coached by Neil Johnston All five starters were native Philadelphians: Chamberlain, Tom Gola, Guy Rodgers, Hall-of-Fame forward Paul Arizin, and Ernie Beck In his first NBA game, played against the New York Knicks, Chamberlain scored 43 points and grabbed 28 rebounds [58] In his third game, Chamberlain recorded 41 points and a then-career-high 40 rebounds in a 124–113 win over the visiting Syracuse Nationals [59] In his fourth game, Philadelphia played the reigning champion Boston Celtics—who were coached by Auerbach, whose offer Chamberlain had rejected several years before—and Bill Russell, who was lauded as one of the best defensive pivots in the game [58]\n\n\n1960–61 NBA season: scoring, rebounding, durability, and field goal titles\nChamberlain's 1960–61 NBA season started with a 42-point and 31-rebound performance in a 133–123 road win against the Syracuse Nationals [68] On November 24, 1960, Chamberlain grabbed an NBA-record 55 rebounds, [16] along with 34 points and 4 assists, in a 132–129 home loss against the Russell-led Boston Celtics [69] On November 29, Chamberlain recorded 44 points, 38 rebounds, and a then-career-high 7 assists in a 122–121 road win over the Los Angeles Lakers [70]\n\n\n1961–62 NBA season: 100-point game and 42-point All-Star Game record\nIn the 1961–62 NBA season, the Warriors were coached by Frank McGuire, who had masterminded Chamberlain's triple-overtime loss in the NCAA championship against the Tar Heels In that year, Chamberlain set several all-time records which have since never been threatened; he averaged 50.4 points and grabbed 25.7 rebounds per game [71]\n\n\n1962–63 NBA season: individual success, move to San Francisco, and playoff miss\nIn the 1962–63 NBA season, Gottlieb sold the Warriors franchise for $850,000 [q] to a group of businessmen led by Franklin Mieuli from San Francisco and the team relocated and were renamed the San Francisco Warriors under new coach Bob Feerick [82] This meant the Warriors team dispersed; Arizin chose to retire rather than move away from his family and his job at IBM in Philadelphia, coach McGuire resigned rather than move to the West Coast, and Gola was homesick and requesting a trade to the New York Knicks halfway through the season [83] With both secondary scorers gone, Chamberlain continued exceeding his own statistics, averaging 44.8 points and 24.3 rebounds per game that year [71] Despite his individual success, the Warriors lost 49 of their 80 games and missed the playoffs [84]\n\n\n1963–64 NBA season: first NBA Finals loss to the Celtics\nIn the 1963–64 NBA season, Chamberlain got another new coach, former NBA player and ex-soldier Alex Hannum, and was joined by rookie center Nate Thurmond, who later entered the Hall of Fame Hannum, who later entered the Hall of Fame as a coach, was a crafty psychologist who emphasized defense and passing, and was not afraid to stand up to the dominant Chamberlain, who would not communicate with coaches he did not like [85] Backed up by Thurmond, Chamberlain recorded 36.9 points and 22.3 rebounds per game, [71] and the Warriors reached the NBA Finals In that series, they again succumbed to Russell's Boston Celtics, losing 4–1 [86] According to Cherry, Chamberlain and Hannum deserved much credit because Hannum had taken the previous year's 31–49 squad plus Thurmond, and became an NBA Finals contender [87]\n\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers (1965–1968)\nIn the 1964–65 NBA season, the NBA widened the lane from 12 to 16 feet (3.7 to 4.9 m), especially because of centers like Chamberlain The Warriors' season began poorly and they experienced financial trouble At the 1965 All-Star Weekend, Chamberlain was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, the renamed former-rival and relocated Syracuse Nationals Chamberlain did not like Sixers' coach Dolph Schayes, who he thought had made several disrespectful remarks when they were rival players [90] The Warriors received $150,000 [r] and Paul Neumann, Connie Dierking, and Lee Shaffer—who opted to retire rather than report to the Warriors [14] [16] When Chamberlain left the Warriors, owner Franklin Mieuli said: \"Chamberlain is not an easy man to love .. the fans in San Francisco never learned to love him Wilt is easy to hate .. people came to see him lose.\" [50]\n\n\n1964–65 NBA season: trade to the 76ers, division finals loss to the Celtics\nIn the 1964–65 NBA season, the NBA widened the lane from 12 to 16 feet (3.7 to 4.9 m), especially because of

said: \"Chamberlain is not an easy man to love .. the fans in San Francisco never learned to love him Wilt is easy to hate .. people came to see him lose.\" [50]\n\n\n1965–66 NBA season: MVP and second division finals loss to the Celtics\nIn the 1965–66 NBA season, Ike Richman, the Sixers' co-owner as well as Chamberlain's confidant and lawyer, died of a heart attack while attending a road game in Boston The Sixers posted a 55–25 regular-season record and Chamberlain won his second MVP award [45] In that season, Chamberlain again dominated his opposition by recording 33.5 points and 24.6 rebounds a game, leading the league in both categories [71] In one game, Chamberlain dislocated the shoulder of Baltimore Bullets player Gus Johnson by blocking his dunk attempt [97]\n\n\n1966–67 NBA season: back-to-back MVP and first NBA title\nPrior to the 1966–67 NBA season, Schayes was replaced by the more-assertive Alex Hannum According to Cherry, in a locker room meeting, Hannum addressed several key issues he observed during the last season, several of them putting Chamberlain in an unfavorable light Sixers forward Walker said on several occasions, players had to pull Chamberlain and Hannum apart to prevent a fistfight [99] Cunningham commented Hannum \"never backed down\" and \"showed who was the boss\", winning Chamberlain's respect [99] When emotions dissipated, Hannum told Chamberlain he was also trying to win a title but that to achieve this, Chamberlain had to \"act like a man\" both on and off the court [99] Hannum persuaded Chamberlain to change his style of play and wanted Chamberlain to concentrate more on defense than on trying to score [16] [100] Kerr was traded to the Baltimore Bullets for point guard Wali Jones, and shooting guard Matt Guokas was selected in the first round of the 1966 NBA draft.\n\n\n1967–68 NBA season: third straight MVP and assist champion\nIn the 1967–68 NBA season, the relationship between Chamberlain and Sixers' owner Kosloff continued to deteriorate In 1965, Chamberlain said he and Richman had worked out a deal that would give Chamberlain 25% of the franchise once he ended his career [108] Although there is no written proof of this agreement, Schayes and Sixers' lawyer Alan Levitt assumed Chamberlain was correct [103] Kosloff declined the request, angering Chamberlain, who was willing to move to the rival American Basketball Association (ABA) once his contract ended in 1967 Kosloff and Chamberlain worked out a truce and later signed a one-year, $250,000 contract [103]\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (1968–1973)\nOn July 9, 1968, the trade between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Sixers was completed, making it the first time a reigning NBA MVP was traded the next season [121] Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke gave Chamberlain an unprecedented contract, paying him $250,000 after taxes—about $2.2 million in real value; in comparison, previous Lakers top earner Jerry West was paid $100,000 before taxes—about $880,000 in real value [122]\n\n\n1968–69 NBA season: second NBA finals loss to the Celtics\nOn July 9, 1968, the trade between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Sixers was completed, making it the first time a reigning NBA MVP was traded the next season [121] Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke gave Chamberlain an unprecedented contract, paying him $250,000 after taxes—about $2.2 million in real value; in comparison, previous Lakers top earner Jerry West was paid $100,000 before taxes—about $880,000 in real value [122]\n\n\n1969–70 NBA season: first NBA finals loss to the Knicks\nChamberlain began the 1969–70 NBA season under new coach Joe Mullaney strongly, averaging 32.2 points and 20.6 rebounds per game over the first nine games of the season [125] During the ninth game, he had a serious knee injury, suffering a rupture of the patellar tendon at the base of his right kneecap, [126] and he missed several months before appearing in the final three games of the 82-game regular season, the first season he failed to reach 20 rebounds per game Owing to his strong start, he still put up a season-average 27.3 points, 18.4 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game [71]\n\n\n1970–71 NBA season: conference finals loss and challenge to Muhammad Ali\nIn the 1970–71 NBA season, the Lakers signed Gail Goodrich, who had returned from the Suns Chamberlain averaged 20.7 points, 18.2 rebounds, and 4.3 assists; [71] he once again led the NBA in rebounding and the Lakers won the Pacific Division title When Hall-of-Fame Detroit Pistons center Bob Lanier, who was 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) and 250 lb (110 kg) as a rookie, [129] was asked about the most memorable moment of his career, Lanier answered: \"When Wilt Chamberlain lifted me up and moved me like a coffee cup so he could get a favorable position\" [54]\n\n\n1971–72 NBA season: finals MVP and second NBA title\nIn the 1971–72 NBA season, the Lakers hired former Celtics star guard Bill Sharman as head coach Sharman introduced morning shoot-arounds, in which the perennial latecomer Chamberlain regularly participated, in contrast to earlier years with Schayes, and transformed him into a defensive-minded, low-scoring post defender in the style of Russell [139] Sharman told Chamberlain to use his rebounding and passing skills to quickly initiate fastbreaks to his teammates [140] While no longer being the main scorer, Chamberlain was named the Lakers' new captain After rupturing his Achilles tendon, perennial captain Baylor retired and was replaced with Chamberlain Initially, Sharman wanted Chamberlain and West to share this duty but West declined, stating he was injury-prone and wanted to concentrate on the game [141] Chamberlain accepted his new roles and posted an all-time low 14.8 points per game but also 19.2 rebounds per game, and led the league with a .649 field-goal percentage [71] Powered by his defensive presence, the Lakers had an unprecedented 33-game winning streak, leading to a then-record 69 wins in the regular season According to Flynn Robinson, after the record-setting streak, Lakers owner Cooke sought to reward each of his players, who may have been expecting a trip to Hawaii, with a $5 pen set In response, Chamberlain had everybody put the pens in the middle of the floor and stepped on them [142]\n\n\n1972–73 NBA season: second NBA finals loss to the Knicks\nThe 1972–73 NBA season was Chamberlain's last; the Lakers lost substance—Happy Hairston was injured, Robinson and LeRoy Ellis had left, and West struggled with injury [146] Chamberlain averaged 13.2 points and 18.6 rebounds to win the rebounding title for the 11th time in his career He also shot an NBA record 0.727 for the season, bettering his own mark of 0.683 from the 1966–67 season [71] It was the ninth time Chamberlain led the league in field-goal percentage The Lakers won 60 games in the regular season and reached the NBA Finals against the New York Knicks, a franchise that had a healthy team with a rejuvenated Reed whereas the Lakers were handicapped by several injuries [146] In that series, the Lakers began with a 115–112 win but the Knicks won Games 2 and 3; and West again injured his hamstring In Game 4, the shorthanded Lakers were defeated by the Knicks In Game 5, the valiant-but-injured West and Hairston had bad games, and the Lakers lost the game 102–93 and the series 4–1 despite Chamberlain scoring 23 points and grabbing 21 rebounds After the Knicks finished the game with a late flourish led by Phil Jackson and Earl Monroe, Chamberlain made a dunk with one second left, which was the last play of his NBA career [147] [148]\n\n\nCoaching career\nIn 1973, the San Diego Conquistadors, a member of the NBA-rival league ABA signed Chamberlain as a player-coach for a $600,000 salary [149] According to Chamberlain, part of the reason for leaving the Lakers was his belief he had the right to renegotiate his contract after winning the 1971-72 NBA championship, and was upset the Lakers did not contact him until September 1972, before which they were trying to acquire UCLA star-center Bill Walton, who ultimately decided to return to school for the 1972–73 season [150] The Lakers sued Chamberlain and prevented him from playing for the Conquistadors because he still owed the Lakers the option year of his contract [16] According to the two-year contract Chamberlain had signed prior to the 1971–72 season, if he failed to sign and mail back his next contract, his contract with the Lakers would be deemed to be renewed [151] The Lakers said they mailed Chamberlain a new contract in July 1973 but Chamberlain did not sign it so the old contract should be deemed to have been renewed for the 1973–74 season [151] On October 10, 1973, the opening day of the Conquistadors' season, a judge ruled Chamberlain could coach the Conquistadors but could not play for any team other than the Lakers for 1973–74 [152]\n\n\nSan Diego Conquistadors (1973–1974)\nIn 1973, the San Diego Conquistadors, a member of the NBA-rival league ABA signed Chamberlain as a player-coach for a $600,000 salary [149] According to Chamberlain, part of the reason

1998, he signed with Ian Ng Cheng Hin, CEO of Northern Cinema House Entertainment, to produce his own bio-pic, wanting to tell his life story his way [162] He had been working on the screenplay notes for over a year at the time of his death [163]\n\n\nDeath\nChamberlain, who had a history of cardiovascular disease, was briefly hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat in 1992 [164] According to

of the most extraordinary and dominant basketball players in NBA history, [45] [9] [14] and is often suggested as the greatest NBA player of all time, ahead of Michael Jordan [174] [175] [176] Contemporaneous colleagues were often terrified of playing against Chamberlain Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain, [50] and Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court \"comical\" [171]\n\n\nRule changes\nPart of Chamberlain's impact on basketball is his direct responsibility for several rule changes in the NBA, including a widening of the lane to try to keep big men more distant from the basket, the instituting of offensive goaltending, a ban on dunking to convert free throws, and a revision of rules governing inbounding the ball, such as making it illegal to inbound the ball over the backboard [9] [158] [198] In basketball history, pundits have stated the only other player who forced such a massive change of rules is 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) Minneapolis Lakers center George Mikan, who played a decade before Chamberlain and also caused many rule changes designed to thwart dominant centers, such as a widening the lane and defensive goaltending [139]\n\n\nChamberlain–Russell rivalry\nThe on-court rivalry between Chamberlain and Bill Russell is cited as one of the greatest of all time [45] [y] Russell won 11 NBA titles in his career while Chamberlain won two [200] Chamberlain was named All-NBA First Team seven times in comparison to Russell's three but Russell was named the NBA MVP—then selected by players—five times against

playoffs Russell's teams won all four series-deciding seventh games against Chamberlain's by a combined margin of nine points [178]\n\n\nReputation as a loser\nAlthough Chamberlain accumulated some of the most-impressive statistics in the history of professional sports, he was often called selfish and a loser because he won only two NBA championships and lost seven out of eight playoff series against Bill Russell's Celtics teams [49] Frank Deford of ESPN said Chamberlain was caught in a no-win situation: \"If you win, everybody says, 'Well, look at him, he's that big' If you lose, everybody says, 'How could he lose, a guy that size?' \" [49] Quoting coach Alex Hannum's explanation of his situation, Chamberlain often said: \"Nobody roots for Goliath\" [16]\n\n\nPersonal

teenager, he later became known for his womanizing According to his lawyer Seymour Goldberg, \"Some people collect stamps, Wilt collected women\" [211] Swedish Olympic high jumper Annette Tånnander, who met Chamberlain when he was 40 and she was 19, said he was a pick-up artist who was extremely confident yet respectful, saying: \"I think Wilt hit on everything that moved .. he never was bad or rude\" [211] Los Angeles Times columnist David Shaw said Chamberlain was \"rude and sexist toward his own date, as he usually was\" during a dinner with Shaw and his wife; he added at one point Chamberlain left the table to get the telephone number of an attractive woman at a nearby table [216]\n\n\nRelationships\nAccording to Cherry, although Chamberlain was an egotist, he had good relationships with many of his contemporaries and enjoyed a great deal of respect He was lauded for his good rapport with his fans, often providing tickets and signing autographs Jack Ramsay said Chamberlain regularly took walks in downtown Philadelphia and acknowledged honking horns with the air of a man enjoying the attention [100] Jerry West called Chamberlain a \"complex .. very nice person\", [223] and NBA rival Jack McMahon said: \"The best thing that happened to the NBA is that God made Wilt a nice person .. he could have killed us all with his left hand\" [224] Celtics

supposedly forced Peterson to perform oral sex after offering to show her a closet containing his NBA jerseys Peterson stated she had blamed herself and was almost \"convinced that I was a very bad person for letting that happen\" until the Me Too movement made her reconsider the experience Peterson felt the assault was \"creepier\" because Chamberlain had been a friend [229] [230]\n\n\nSee

He was known for his work on a range of films, including action movies, thrillers, and dramas. Born in Tynemouth, Northumberland, Scott came from a family of artists and engineers, and his work often reflected his interests in art, design, and technology.\n\n## Early Life\n\nTony Scott was born on June 21, 1944, in Tynemouth, Northumberland, North East England. He was the youngest of three sons of Elizabeth (née Williams) and Colonel Francis Percy Scott, who served in the Royal Engineers. Scott's family was known for their artistic and engineering talents, with his grandfather, Fletcher Scott, being a photographer and his uncle, Dixon Scott, being a pioneer of the cinema chain. One Tyneside Cinema, in Newcastle, is the last remaining newsreel cinema operating in the United Kingdom.\n\nScott was a pupil at Rosebank School in Hartlepool and later attended West Hartlepool College of Art. He graduated from Sunderland Art School with a fine arts degree. At the age of 16, he appeared in the short film Boy and Bicycle, Ridley Scott's directorial debut.\n\n## Film Career\n\nThe success of his elder brother's fledgling television commercial production outfit, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), drew Tony's attention to film. Ridley Scott recounted, \"Tony had wanted to do documentaries at first. I told him, 'Don't go to the BBC, come to me first.' I knew that he had a fondness for cars, so I told him, 'Come work with me and within a year you'll have a Ferrari.' And he did!\"\n\nTony Scott directed many television commercials for RSA while also overseeing the company's operation while his brother was developing his feature film career. He stated, \"My goal was to make films but I got sidetracked into commercials and then I took off. I had 15 years making them, and it was a blast. We were very prolific, and that was our training ground. You'd shoot 100 days in a year, then we gravitated from that to film.\"\n\nDeveloping his own distinctive visual style while making commercials, Scott states, \"I cornered the market in sexy, rock'n'roll stuff.\"\n\n## Commercials\n\nTony Scott directed many high-profile commercials during his career, including ads for BMW, Apple, and Pepsi.

He worked with a range of actors, including Tom Cruise, Michael Douglas, and Kevin Costner, and was known for his ability to handle complex action sequences and dramatic performances.\n\n## Hollywood Success\n\nFollowing the success of Top Gun, Scott found himself on Hollywood's A-list of action directors. He re-teamed with Simpson and Bruckheimer in 1987 to direct Beverly Hills Cop II, which left critics underwhelmed but was among the year's highest-grossing films. That year, in 1987, Tony Scott had signed a deal with Paramount Pictures to develop films for a non-exclusive agreement, which would serve as producers and directors on the studio.\n\nHis next feature, Revenge (1990), a thriller of adultery and revenge set in Mexico, starred Kevin Costner, Madeleine Stowe, and Anthony Quinn. Once again directing Tom Cruise, Scott returned to the Simpson-Bruckheimer fold to helm the big-budget racing film Days of Thunder (1990). Scott later stated that it was difficult to find the drama in racing cars in circles, so he \"stole from all race movies to date...then tried to build on them.\"\n\nScott's next film was the cult action thriller The Last Boy Scout (1991) starring Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans and written by Shane Black.\n\n## Unrealised Projects\n\nTom Cruise was with Scott just two days prior to the director's suicide, scouting locations for a sequel to Top Gun, scheduled for production in 2013.

I think it's a very old-fashioned way of filmmaking. I'm a fan of moving the camera, of moving the audience, of moving the story.\"\n\n## Personal Life\n\nScott married three times. His first marriage was to TV production designer Gerry Boldy (1944-2007) in 1967; they were divorced in 1974. His second marriage was in 1986 to advertising executive Glynis Sanders; they divorced a year later when his affair with Brigitte Nielsen (married to Sylvester Stallone at the time), whom he met on the set of Beverly Hills Cop II, became public.

He started his football career in the youth ranks of local side Olhanense in 2009, before joining Loulé in 2011. Shortly after, Ramos had several trials with Sporting CP, but was rejected due to his slight frame. This led him to join their crosstown rivals, Benfica, in 2013 at the age of 12.\n\n**Benfica**\n\nRamos made his professional debut with Benfica's reserve team in 2019, coming on as an 84th-minute substitute in a 3-2 home loss to Braga B in LigaPro. He made his first-team debut with Benfica in 2020, coming on as an 85th-minute substitute in a 4-0 away win over Desportivo das Aves in the Primeira Liga. During that season, Ramos played in the 2019-20 UEFA Youth League, in which he was a key part of Benfica reaching the final of the competition, lost to Real Madrid (3-2). In the finals, he scored a brace and finished as joint-top scorer in the tournament with eight goals.\n\nRamos' breakthrough season began in 2022, where he scored his first career hat-trick on August 2 in a 4-1 home win over Midtjylland in the first leg of the 2022-23 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round. His prolific form saw him score two more goals and provide two assists, as part of a partnership with newly signed teammate David Neres. Ramos was named the league's Player of the Month and Forward of the Month for the months of October and November.\n\n**Paris Saint-Germain**\n\nOn August 7, 2023, Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain announced the signing of Ramos on a season-long loan, with an option-to-buy at the end of the season for a reported fee of €65 million, with an additional €15 million in potential bonuses.\n\n**International Career**\n\nRamos participated in the 2018 UEFA European Under-17 Championship in England with the Portugal under-17s.

He usually drops deep to help his team build their attacking play by bringing his teammates into play and creating chances for other players. Due to his awareness and willingness to follow instructions, he understands how to rotate positions in ways in which to benefit the ball-holder with his movement, short or long passes. When he is offering short, he aims to be positive in his control of the ball, he attempts to open his body up each time, with either foot, being able to hold up the ball and act as his team focal point in attack.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRamos' father, Manuel Ramos, originally from Amareleja, in Alentejo Province, is also a former Portugal youth international who represented Farense among other Portuguese clubs.\n\n**Career Statistics**\n\nBenfica\n\n| Season | Club | League | Apps | Goals | Assists |\n| 2019-2020 | Benfica B | LigaPro | 19 | 5 | 4 |\n| 2020-2021 | Benfica | Primeira Liga | 15 | 3 | 2 |\n| 2021-2022 | Benfica | Primeira Liga | 24 | 10 | 6 |\n| 2022-2023 | Benfica | Primeira Liga | 15 | 5 | 4 |\n\nBenfica\n\n| Season | Club | Apps | Goals | Assists |\n| 2022 | Portugal | 6 | 4 | 2 |\n| 2023 | Portugal | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n\nHonours\n\n* UEFA Champions League runner-up: 2020\n* UEFA Youth League runner-up: 2020\n* Primeira Liga champion: 2021-22\n* Taça da Liga runner-up: 2021-22\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* Official website\n* Gonçalo Ramos at Soccerway\n* Gonçalo Ramos at Transfermarkt\n* Gonçalo Ramos at ESPN FC\n* Gonçalo Ramos at UEFA.com", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Gonçalo_Ramos\" following this outline:\n\n\nClub career\nBorn in Olhão, [2] Algarve on 20 June 2001, Ramos started his football career in the youth ranks of local side Olhanense in 2009, before joining Loulé in 2011 Shortly Ramos had several trials with Sporting CP aged 9, but was rejected due to his slight frame, leading him to join their crosstown rivals youth system Benfica in 2013 at the age of 12 [3]\n\n\nEarly career\nBorn in Olhão, [2] Algarve on 20 June 2001, Ramos started his football career in the youth ranks of local side Olhanense in 2009, before joining Loulé in 2011 Shortly Ramos had several trials with Sporting CP aged 9, but was rejected due to his slight frame, leading him to join their crosstown rivals youth system Benfica in 2013 at the age of 12 [3]\n\n\nBenfica\nOn 13 January 2019, he made his professional debut with Benfica's reserve team as an 84th-minute substitute for Nuno Tavares in a 3–2 home loss to Braga B in LigaPro [4] On 21 July 2020, he made first-team debut with Benfica as an 85th-minute substitute for Pizzi in a 4–0 away win over Desportivo das Aves in the Primeira Liga, netting a brace in 8 minutes [5] During that season, Ramos played in the 2019–20 UEFA Youth League, in which he was a key part of Benfica reaching the final of the competition, lost to Real Madrid (3–2), in which he scored a brace in the finals;

unsuccessful, with Williams retaining the Liberal preselection, and resulted in media reports of significant party infighting and Perrottet publicly apologising Eventually, Perrottet abandoned the Hawkesbury preselection, and he settled on his second-choice, the equally safe seat of Epping [31] [32] [33] At the 2019 state election Perrottet was elected as Member for Epping and reappointed as Treasurer in the second Berejiklian ministry [34]\n\n\nicare controversy\nPerrottet's record as NSW Treasurer was marred by allegations that his department mismanaged the state's workers compensation scheme, icare A combined investigation by The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and ABC TV's Four Corners found that icare had underpaid as many as 52,000 injured workers by up to $80 million and that

elected leader by the Liberal party room when it met on 5 October, and was sworn in as premier later that day [49] At 39 years of age, Perrottet became the youngest premier in New South Wales history,

stated that he had warned Perrottet about his political opponents knowing that he had worn the uniform and one of them was conspiring to use it against him [67]\n\n\n2023 state election loss and resignation as Liberal leader\nAs much of the vote came in for the election, speculation emerged if Perrottet would maintain his seat of Epping after there was 'tossup' between Labor candidate Alan

Perrottet abandoned the Hawkesbury preselection, and he settled on his second-choice, the equally safe seat of Epping [31] [32] [33] At the 2019 state election Perrottet was elected as Member for Epping and reappointed as Treasurer in the second Berejiklian ministry [34]\n\n\nicare controversy\nPerrottet's record as NSW Treasurer was marred by allegations that his department mismanaged the state's workers compensation scheme, icare A combined investigation by The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and ABC TV's Four Corners found that icare had underpaid as many as 52,000 injured workers by up to $80 million and that the organisation was close to collapse [35] Following the investigation, NSW's workers' compensation regulator State Insurance Regulatory Authority (SIRA) announced in August 2020 that it would be applying increased scrutiny to icare's 2020 financial audit [36] icare was also accused of improperly handling private sector contracts The Information and Privacy Commission NSW found that icare had not publicly registered 422 contracts since 2015, each worth more than $150,000 These contracts include some being awarded without a competitive tender to companies associated with Liberal Party figures, such as marketing firm IVE Group being awarded millions of dollars in contracts IVE Group is run by former NSW Liberal party president Geoff Selig [37]\n\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nPerrottet advocated strongly for business activity in the face of lockdowns and advice from health officials During the northern beaches lockdown at the end of 2020, he suggested that the state's chief health officer, Kerry Chant, take a pay cut if Sydney or its suburbs were unnecessarily locked down [41] Perrottet also pushed the federal government to reinstate JobKeeper payments for Sydney residents in July 2021 as a new wave of infections was beginning [42]\n\n\nPremier of New South Wales (2021–2023)\nOn 3 October 2021, following the resignation of Premier Gladys Berejiklian, Perrottet was nominated to run as NSW Liberal Party leader, with Stuart Ayres, the Minister for Jobs, Investment, Tourism and Western Sydney, as his deputy Having struck a deal with party powerbrokers, he was elected leader by the Liberal party room when it met on 5 October, and was sworn in as premier later that day [49] At 39 years of age, Perrottet became the youngest premier in New South Wales history, surpassing the previous record held by Nathan Rees, who was 40 when he first took office [50]\n\n\nNazi uniform scandal\nOn 12 January 2023, Perrottet revealed that he had worn a Nazi uniform as fancy dress at his 21st birthday, apologising at a media conference after a cabinet minister was made aware of the incident [65] [66] Rumours circulated that a photo of Perrottet and the uniform had been uncovered, but Perrottet denied any knowledge of the photograph and stated that his parents explained to him why the costume was inappropriate the day after the party Transport Minister David Elliott stated that he had warned Perrottet about his political opponents knowing that he had worn the uniform and one of them was conspiring to use it against him [67]\n\n\n2023 state election loss and resignation as Liberal leader\nAs much of the vote came in for the election, speculation emerged if Perrottet would maintain his seat of Epping after there was 'tossup' between Labor candidate Alan Mascarenhas and himself Eventually, ABC's Antony Green announced that Perrottet would retain his seat with a ~8-point swing to Labor, challenging a traditionally 'safe' Liberal seat [70]\n\n\nPolitical positions\nPerrottet has been described as both conservative [44] [74] [75] [76] [77] and moderate or liberal [78] [79] [80] [81]\n\n\nPersonal life\nPerrottet is married to Helen and has seven children [86] [92]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Discovered in 1989 by a local fisherman and naturalist, Chito Shedden, Pocho's life was marked by a remarkable series of events that turned him into a local celebrity. For over two decades, Pocho entertained tourists from around the world with his weekly performances in a artificial lake at Finca Las Tilapias in Siquirres, Costa Rica. Pocho's story is a testament to the complex bond between humans and animals, and his legacy continues to inspire and educate people to this day.\n\n**Discovery of Pocho**\nIn 1989, Chito Shedden, a fisherman, tour guide, and naturalist from Siquirres, Limón Province, Costa Rica, discovered an emaciated and dehydrated male crocodile weighing 70 kg (150 lb) on the banks of the Reventazón River. Shedden, who had been working with the local wildlife for many years, immediately recognized the importance of the discovery and decided to take the crocodile home to care for it. However, upon closer examination, Shedden discovered that the crocodile had been shot in the head through the left eye by a local cattle farmer because the crocodile had been preying on a herd of cows. Shedden took the crocodile home in his boat along with the reluctant help of some friends.\n\n**Improved Health**\nAfter the crocodile's health improved, Shedden released the crocodile - now named Pocho, meaning \"strong\" in the local dialect - in a nearby river to return it to the wild. However, the crocodile refused to go back to its natural habitat, and so Shedden decided to allow the crocodile to live in the water outside his home. Pocho was considered a member of Shedden's family, alongside his wife and daughter. Over time, Pocho grew to trust Shedden, and the two developed a strong bond.\n\n**Public Performances**\nFor more than a decade, Chito and Pocho performed a weekly act on Sunday afternoons in a 100 m2 (1,100 sq ft) artificial lake at Finca Las Tilapias in Siquirres, Costa Rica. The performances were a sight to behold, with Pocho swimming and playing in the water for tourists from around the world. The 2014 video documentary \"Dragon's Feast\" was made about Chito and Pocho by South African wildlife cinematographer Roger Horrocks shortly before Pocho's death. Horrocks speculated in his documentary that the gunshot wound to Pocho's head might have damaged the crocodile's brain, resulting in a change in its usual instinctive behavior. Horrocks noted examples where humans had been attacked by their reptilian pets even after a decade or more of close ownership, and felt that Shedden's life was always in danger when he stepped into the water with the crocodile.\n\nHowever, Shedden disagreed, stating: \"After two or three years, something could happen, maybe... but after 23 years of loving each other, nothing has ever happened, so I don't think so.\" Despite the risks, the bond between Shedden and Pocho remained strong, and their performances continued to captivate audiences.\n\n**Death and Legacy**\nPocho died of natural causes in the water outside Shedden's home in Siquirres on 12 October 2011.

She has one brother, Ivan Bombokka. Her family moved to London, England, when she was eight years old, and she attended Northumberland Park Community School. Wright's early life was marked by a love for acting, which she developed through performing in school plays.\n\nWright's desire to become a professional actress was inspired by the 2006 film Akeelah and the Bee, starring Keke Palmer. The role of Akeelah Anderson resonated with Wright, and she has credited the film as one of the reasons why she pursued a career in acting. At the age of 16, Wright enrolled in the Identity School of Acting, where she honed her craft and developed her skills as a performer.\n\nCareer\n-------\n\nWright's breakthrough role came in 2018 with the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Black Panther, where she played the role of Shuri, the younger sister of King T'Challa. Her performance in the film earned her widespread critical acclaim and recognition, including a nomination for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture.\n\nWright's success in Black Panther led to a surge in her career, with her being cast in a range of high-profile films, including Ready Player One, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Guava Island. Her performances in these films have cemented her status as one of the leading actresses in Hollywood.\n\nIn addition to her film work, Wright has also made appearances on television, including a guest role in the popular British drama series Top Boy. She has also lent her voice to several animated films and television shows, including the Disney animated film The One and Only Ivan.\n\nPersonal Life\n-------------\n\nWright has been open about her struggles with depression, which she first experienced at the age of 20. In an interview with Vanity Fair, she revealed that she was in a dark place, going through many bad things. However, she credits her Christian faith with helping her overcome the depression.\n\nWright discovered her Christian faith after attending a London actors' Bible study meeting. She has since spoken publicly about the impact that her faith has had on her life and career, and has used her platform to share her experiences with others.\n\nIn 2018, Wright turned down several film roles in order to focus on her recovery and her faith.

of the event comes from WWE's established Money in the Bank ladder match, in which multiple wrestlers use ladders to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship of their choosing at any time within the next year [1] The 2021 event featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions; male wrestlers competed for a contract to grant them a match for either Raw's WWE Championship or SmackDown's Universal Championship, while female wrestlers competed for a Raw Women's Championship or SmackDown Women's Championship match contract While the previous year's event had featured a \"Corporate Ladder\" gimmick, which took place at WWE's Titan Towers headquarters and had only six competitors in each match due to the COVID-19 pandemic, [2] the 2021 event reverted to the standard version of the titular ladder match as well as returning to having eight competitors for both

international markets, and was the first Money in the Bank to livestream on Peacock after the American version of the WWE Network merged under Peacock in March [5]\n\n\nStorylines\nThe event comprised seven matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, [10] [11] while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, Monday Night Raw and Friday Night SmackDown [12]\n\n\nCanceled match\nAt Hell in a Cell, Bianca Belair defeated Bayley in a Hell in a Cell match to retain the SmackDown Women's Championship [18] On the following episode of SmackDown, both were involved in a mixed tag team match in which Bayley pinned Belair [14] The following week, Bayley claimed that Belair's Hell in a Cell victory was a fluke, citing her own victory over Belair in the mixed tag team match Belair then came out and challenged Bayley to an \"I Quit\" match with the title on the line at Money in the Bank and Bayley accepted [16] On July 9, however, WWE announced that Bayley suffered a legitimate injury while training that would sideline her for up to nine months; this was followed by an announcement that a replacement for Bayley would be revealed on that night's SmackDown [32] Carmella was revealed as the replacement and the match was changed to a regular singles match that would instead occur on the July 16 episode of SmackDown, [19] where Belair retained [30] This also resulted in WWE moving the Raw Tag Team Championship match between AJ Styles and Omos (c) and The Viking Raiders from the July 12 episode of Raw to the Money In The Bank event in order to fill the slot in the match card vacated by the cancellation of the former [33]\n\n\nEvent\nDuring the Money in the Bank Kickoff pre-show, The Mysterios (Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio) defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) During the match, Jey caught Rey with a Superkick in mid-air and then performed the Uso Splash on Rey for a nearfall In the end, as Rey attempted a 619 on Jey, Jimmy protected Jey with Jimmy receiving the 619 instead Jey then performed a roll-up on Rey with an assist from Jimmy to win the titles for the fifth time, and their seventh overall tag team championship in WWE [34] This would mark the beginning of The Usos' record-setting title reign, which currently stands as the longest tag team title reign in WWE at 622 days [35]\n\n\nPre-show\nDuring the Money in the Bank Kickoff pre-show, The Mysterios (Rey Mysterio

A.S.H from Raw and Liv Morgan, Zelina Vega, and WWE Women's Tag Team Champions, Natalya and Tamina, from SmackDown During the match, Bliss used her supernatural powers to try and lower the contract into her hands only for Vega to stop her Later atop a ladder, Bliss hypnotized Vega into climbing down the ladder and allowing Bliss an opportunity to unhook the briefcase, however, Natalya intercepted Bliss The rest of the competitors eventually buried Bliss under a pile of ladders, taking Bliss out for the remainder of the match With three ladders positioned under the briefcase, Asuka, Naomi, Morgan, Vega, Natalya, and Tamina all fought atop of the three ladders Nikki, who had been down outside the ring, used the opportunity to quickly climb the middle ladder and reach over the other competitors to unhook the briefcase and win the match [36]\n\n\nMain event\nIn the main event, Roman Reigns (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended SmackDown's Universal Championship against Edge During the match, Reigns and Edge brawled at ringside As Reigns attempted the Spear, Edge moved out of the way and Reigns went through the barricade Edge then performed a Spear on Reigns through the remainder of the barricade Back in the ring, as Reigns performed the Superman Punch on Edge, Edge incapacitated the referee Reigns obtained a broken piece of a chair and attempted to apply the Crossface on Edge, however, Edge reversed and applied the Crossface on Reigns The Usos (Jey and Jimmy) then came out and attempted to interfere in the match, however this was thwarted by Rey and Dominik Mysterio, who attacked them before they reached the ring Seth Rollins, frustrated over losing the Money in the Bank ladder match earlier as well as for Edge receiving the championship match before him, then came out and performed a Superkick on Edge As Reigns attempted a Spear, Edge performed a Spear of his own for a nearfall Rollins then returned to the ring, only for Edge to knock him off the apron This brief distraction allowed Reigns to perform a Spear on Edge and retain the title Following the match, as Reigns and Rollins had a stare down, Edge attacked Rollins and they brawled into the crowd As Reigns obtained a microphone and proclaimed that the whole world needed to acknowledge him, John Cena made a surprise return—in his first appearance since WrestleMania 36 in April 2020—and entered the ring where Cena had a stare down with Reigns and performed his \"You Can't See Me\" taunt at Reigns to end the event [36]\n\n\nReception\nThough the event itself was well-received, [37] Peacock's streaming of the event in the United States was poorly received due to technical issues occurring throughout, particularly during the men's Money in the Bank ladder match [38] [39]\n\n\nAftermath\nFollowing his dominant victory over Kofi Kingston, Bobby Lashley (accompanied by MVP) held an open challenge for the WWE Championship on the following night's episode of Raw The challenge was accepted by a returning Keith Lee, who had been out with health issues since February, but lost to Lashley Following the match, Lashley and MVP were confronted by WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg, appearing for the first time since the Royal Rumble in January Goldberg proclaimed that he would be Lashley's next challenger, [41] which was scheduled for SummerSlam

returned to SmackDown the previous week [46] An altercation occurred during the contract signing the following week, which ultimately led to Cena signing the match contract, officially scheduling

movement was split by Lenin's New Economic Policy [23] While Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mine-owners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours [24]\n\n\nKaganovich protégé\nKhrushchev met Lazar Kaganovich as early as 1917 In 1925, Kaganovich became Party head in Ukraine [31] and Khrushchev, falling under his patronage, [32] was rapidly promoted He was appointed second in command of Stalin's party apparatus in late 1926 Within nine months his superior, Konstantin Moiseyenko, was ousted, which, according to Taubman, was due to Khrushchev's instigation [31] Kaganovich transferred Khrushchev to Kharkov, then the capital of Ukraine, as head of the Organizational Department of the Ukrainian Party's Central Committee [33] In 1928, Khrushchev was transferred to Kiev, where he served as head of the organizational department, [34] second-in-command of the Party organization there [35]\n\n\nInvolvement in purges\nStalin's office records show meetings at which Khrushchev was present as early as 1932 The two increasingly built a good relationship Khrushchev greatly admired the dictator and treasured informal meetings with him and invitations to Stalin's dacha, while Stalin felt warm affection for his young subordinate [41] Beginning in 1934, Stalin began a campaign of political repression known as the Great Purge, during which many were executed or sent to the Gulag Central to this campaign were the Moscow Trials, a series of show trials of the purged top leaders of the party and the military In 1936, as the trials proceeded, Khrushchev expressed his vehement support:\n\n\nWorld War II\nWhen Soviet troops, pursuant to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, invaded the eastern portion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin's direction A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the western portion of Ukraine Many inhabitants initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent Khrushchev's role was to ensure that the occupied areas voted for union with the USSR Through a combination of propaganda, deception as to what was being voted for, and outright fraud, the Soviets ensured that the assemblies elected in the new territories would unanimously petition for union with the USSR When the new assemblies did so, their petitions were granted by the USSR Supreme Soviet, and Western Ukraine became a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on 1 November 1939 [54] Clumsy actions by the Soviets, such as staffing Western Ukrainian organizations with Eastern Ukrainians, and giving confiscated land to collective farms (kolkhozes) rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians, damaging Khrushchev's efforts to achieve unity [55]\n\n\nInvasion of Poland and subsequent occupation\nWhen Soviet troops, pursuant to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, invaded the eastern portion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin's direction A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today

collective farms (kolkhozes) rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians, damaging Khrushchev's efforts to achieve unity [55]\n\n\nWar against Germany\nWhen Nazi Germany invaded the USSR, in June 1941, Khrushchev was still at his post in Kiev [56] Stalin appointed him a political commissar, and Khrushchev served on a number of fronts as an intermediary between the local military commanders and the political rulers in Moscow Stalin used Khrushchev to keep commanders on a tight leash, while the commanders sought to have him influence Stalin [57]\n\n\nRise to power\nAlmost all of Ukraine had been occupied by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained [74] One out of every six Ukrainians were killed in World War II [75]\n\n\nReturn to Ukraine\nAlmost all of Ukraine had been occupied by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation Ukraine's industry had been

[74] One out of every six Ukrainians were killed in World War II [75]\n\n\nStalin's final years\nFrom mid-December 1949, Khrushchev served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province His biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to Moscow to balance the influence of Georgy Malenkov and security chief Lavrentiy Beria, who were widely seen as Stalin's heirs [94] The aging leader rarely called Politburo meetings Instead, much of the high-level work of government took place at dinners hosted by Stalin for his inner circle of Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Nikolai Bulganin Khrushchev took early naps so that he would not fall asleep in Stalin's presence; he noted in his memoirs, \"Things went badly for those who dozed off at Stalin's table.\" [95]\n\n\nStruggle for power\nOn 6 March 1953, Stalin's death was announced, as was the new leadership Malenkov was the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers, with Beria (who consolidated his hold over the security agencies), Kaganovich, Bulganin, and former Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov as first vice-chairmen Those members of the Presidium of the Central Committee who had been recently promoted by Stalin were demoted Khrushchev was relieved of his duties as Party head for Moscow to concentrate on unspecified duties in the Party's Central Committee [103] The New York Times listed Malenkov and Beria first and second among the ten-man Presidium—and Khrushchev last [104]\n\n\nLeader of the Soviet Union (1955–1964)\nAfter the demotion of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially worked together well Molotov even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible due to a lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then occupying part of the country to leave Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty [125] Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position [126]\n\n\nDomestic policies\nAfter the demotion of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially worked together well Molotov even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in

attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position [126]\n\n\nLiberalization and the arts\nAfter assuming power, Khrushchev allowed a modest amount of freedom in the arts Vladimir Dudintsev's novel Not by Bread Alone, [139] about an idealistic engineer opposed by rigid bureaucrats, was allowed to be published in 1956, though Khrushchev called the novel \"false at its base\" [140] In 1958, however, Khrushchev ordered a fierce attack on Boris Pasternak after his novel Doctor Zhivago was published abroad (he was denied permission to publish it in the Soviet Union) Pravda described the novel as \"low-grade reactionary hackwork\", and the author was expelled from the Writer's Union [141] Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, but under heavy pressure he declined it Once he did so, Khrushchev ordered a halt to the attacks on Pasternak In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that he agonized over the novel, very nearly allowed it to be published, and later regretted not doing so [141] After his fall from power, Khrushchev read the novel (he had earlier read only excerpts) and stated, \"We shouldn't have banned it I should have read it myself There's nothing anti-Soviet in it.\" [142]\n\n\nPolitical reform\nUnder Khrushchev, the special tribunals operated by security agencies were abolished These tribunals, known as troikas, had often ignored laws and procedures Under the reforms, no prosecution for a political crime could be brought even in the regular courts unless approved by the local Party committee This rarely happened; there were no major political trials under Khrushchev, and at most several hundred political prosecutions overall Instead, other sanctions were imposed on Soviet dissidents, including loss of job or university position, or expulsion from the Party During Khrushchev's rule, forced hospitalization for the \"socially dangerous\" was introduced [151] According to author Roy Medvedev, who wrote an early analysis of Khrushchev's years in power, \"political terror as an everyday method of government was replaced under Khrushchev by administrative means of repression\" [151]\n\n\nAgricultural policy\nKhrushchev was an expert on agricultural policies and sensed an urgent need to reform the backward, inefficient system with ideas that worked in the US He looked especially at collectivism, state farms, liquidation of machine-tractor stations, planning decentralization, economic incentives, increased labor and capital investment, new crops, and new production programs Henry Ford had been at the center of American technology transfer to the Soviet Union in the 1930s; he sent over factory designs, engineers, and skilled craftsmen, as well as tens of thousands of Ford tractors By the 1940s Khrushchev was keenly interested in American agricultural innovations, especially on large-scale family-operated farms in the Midwest In the 1950s he sent several delegations to visit farms and land grant colleges, looking at successful farms that utilized high-yielding seed varieties, very large and powerful tractors and other machines, all guided by modern management techniques [155] Especially after his visit to the US in 1959, he was keenly aware of the need to emulate and even match American superiority and agricultural technology [156] [157]\n\n\nEducation\n\nWhile visiting the United States in 1959, Khrushchev was impressed by the agricultural education program at Iowa State University, and sought to imitate it in the Soviet Union At the time, the main agricultural college in the USSR was in Moscow, and students did not do the manual labor of farming Khrushchev proposed moving the programs to rural areas He was unsuccessful, due to resistance from professors and students, who never actually disagreed with the premier, but who did not carry out his proposals [175] Khrushchev recalled in his memoirs: \n\nAnti-religious campaign\nThe anti-religious campaign of the Khrushchev era began in 1959, coinciding with the 21st Party Congress It was carried out by mass closures of churches [183] [184] (reducing the number from 22,000 in 1959 [185] to 13,008 in 1960 and to 7,873 by 1965 [186]), monasteries, convents, and seminaries The campaign also included a restriction on parental rights to teach religion to their children; a ban on the presence of children at church services; and a ban on the administration of the Eucharist to children over the age of four Khrushchev additionally banned all services held outside of churches' walls, renewed enforcement of 1929 legislation banning pilgrimages, and recorded the personal identities of all adults requesting church baptisms, weddings, or funerals [187] He disallowed the ringing of church bells and services in daytime in some rural settings from May to the end of October under the pretext of fieldwork requirements Non-fulfillment of these regulations by clergy would lead to disallowance of state registration (meaning clergy could no longer do any pastoral or liturgical work without special state permission) According to Dimitry Pospielovsky, the state carried out forced retirement, arrests, and prison sentences for clergymen on \"trumped-up charges,\" but in reality, he writes, said state actions were taken against clergy who resisted the closure of churches; delivered sermons attacking the USSR's state atheism and anti-religious campaign; conducted Christian charity; or made religion popular by personal example [188]\n\n\nForeign and defense policies\nFrom 1950 to 1953 Khrushchev was well-placed to closely observe and evaluate Stalin's foreign policy Khrushchev considered the entire Cold War to be a serious mistake on Stalin's part In the long term, it created an unnecessary and expensive militarized struggle with NATO It diverted attention away from the neutral developing world, where progress could be made, and it weakened Moscow's relationship with its East European satellites Basically Khrushchev was much more optimistic about the future than Stalin or Molotov, and was more of an internationalist He believed the working classes and the common peoples of the world would eventually find their way towards socialism and even communism, and that conflicts like the Cold War diverted their attention from this eventual goal Peaceful coexistence of the sort that Lenin himself had practiced at first would allow the Soviet Union and its satellite states to build up their economies and their standard of living Khrushchev decided that Stalin had made a series of mistakes, such as heavy-handed pressure in Turkey and Iran in 1945 and 1946, and especially heavy pressure on Berlin that led to the failed Berlin blockade in 1948 Germany was a major issue for Khrushchev, not because he feared a NATO invasion eastward, but because it weakened the East German regime, which economically paled in comparison to the economic progress of West Germany Khrushchev blamed Molotov for being unable to resolve the conflict with Yugoslavia, and largely ignoring the needs of the East European communist satellites.\n\n\nUnited States and NATO\nKhrushchev sought to find a lasting solution to the problem of a divided Germany and of the enclave of West Berlin In November 1958, calling West Berlin a \"malignant tumor\", he gave the United States, United Kingdom and France six months to conclude a peace treaty with both German states and the Soviet Union If one was not signed, Khrushchev stated, the Soviet Union would conclude a peace treaty with East Germany This would leave East Germany, which was not a party to treaties giving the Western Powers access to Berlin, in control of the routes to the city They proposed making Berlin a free city, which meant no outside military forces would be stationed there West Germany, United States and France strongly opposed the ultimatum, but Britain wanted to consider it as a starting point for negotiations No one wanted to risk war over the issue At Britain's request, Khrushchev extended and ultimately dropped the ultimatum, as the Berlin issue became part of the complex agenda of high-level summit meetings [193]\n\n\nEarly relations and U.S. visit (1957–1960)\nKhrushchev sought to find a lasting solution to the problem of a divided Germany and of the enclave of West Berlin In November 1958, calling West Berlin a \"malignant tumor\", he gave the United States, United Kingdom and France six months to conclude a peace treaty with both German states and the Soviet Union If one was not signed, Khrushchev stated, the Soviet Union would conclude a peace treaty with East

No one wanted to risk war over the issue At Britain's request, Khrushchev extended and ultimately dropped the ultimatum, as the Berlin issue became part of the complex agenda of high-level summit meetings [193]\n\n\nU-2 and Berlin crisis (1960–1961)\nA constant irritant in Soviet–U.S relations was the overflight of the Soviet Union by American U-2 spy aircraft On 9 April 1960, the U.S resumed such flights after a lengthy break The Soviets had protested the flights in the past but had been ignored by Washington Content in what he thought was a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower, Khrushchev was confused and angered by the flights' resumption, and concluded that they had been ordered by CIA Director Allen Dulles without Eisenhower's knowledge Khrushchev planned to visit the U.S to meet Eisenhower, but the visit was canceled when Soviet Air Defence Forces brought down the U.S U-2 [215] On 1 May, a U-2 was shot down, its pilot, Francis Gary Powers, captured alive [216] Believing Powers to have been killed, the U.S announced that a weather plane had been lost near the Turkish-Soviet border Khrushchev risked destroying the summit, due to start on 16 May in Paris, if he announced the shootdown, but would look weak in the eyes of his military and security forces if he did nothing [216] On 5 May, Khrushchev announced the shootdown and Powers' capture, blaming the overflight on \"imperialist circles and militarists, whose stronghold is the Pentagon\", and suggesting the plane had been sent without Eisenhower's knowledge [217] Eisenhower could not have it thought that there were rogue elements in the Pentagon operating without his knowledge, and admitted that he had ordered the flights, calling them \"a distasteful necessity\" [218] The admission stunned Khrushchev and turned the U-2 affair from a possible triumph to a disaster for him, and he even appealed to U.S Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson for help [219]\n\n\nCuban Missile Crisis and the test ban treaty (1962–1964)\nSuperpower tensions culminated in the Cuban Missile Crisis (in the USSR, the \"Caribbean crisis\") of October 1962, as the Soviet Union sought to install medium-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, about 90 miles (140 km) from the U.S coast [32] Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro was reluctant to accept the missiles, and, once he was persuaded, warned Khrushchev against transporting the missiles in secret Castro stated, thirty years later, \"We had a sovereign right to accept the missiles We were not violating international law Why do it secretly—as if we had no right to do it? I warned Nikita that secrecy would give the imperialists the advantage.\" [230]\n\n\nEastern Europe\nThe Secret Speech, combined with the death of the Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut, who suffered a heart attack while reading the Speech, sparked considerable liberalization in Poland and Hungary In Poland, a worker's strike in Poznań developed into disturbances that left more than 50 dead in June 1956 [241] When Moscow blamed the disturbances on Western agitators, Polish leaders ignored the claim and made concessions to the workers With anti-Soviet displays becoming more common in Poland, and crucial Polish leadership elections upcoming, Khrushchev and other Presidium members flew to Warsaw on 19 October to meet with the Polish Presidium The Soviets agreed to allow the new Polish leadership to take office, on the assurance there would be no change to the Soviet-Polish relationship [241] [242] [243] A period of at least partial liberalization, known as the Polish October, followed.\n\n\nChina\nAfter completing his takeover of mainland China in 1949, Mao Zedong sought material assistance from the USSR, and also called for the return to China of territories taken from it under the Tsars [32] Khrushchev increased aid to China, even sending a small corps of experts to help develop the new communist country [252] This assistance was described by historian William C Kirby as \"the greatest transfer of technology in world history\" [253] The Soviet Union spent 7% of its national income between 1954 and 1959 on aid to China [254] On his 1954 visit to China, Khrushchev agreed to return Port Arthur and Dalian to China, though Khrushchev was annoyed by Mao's insistence that the Soviets leave their artillery [255]\n\n\nWest Africa\nUnder Khrushchev, the Soviet Union provided considerable aid to the newly independent Ghana and Guinea These were seen as ideal places to test the \"socialist model of development\" because of their critical dependence on economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, in contrast to larger Third World nations like Egypt and Indonesia This project proved to be a resounding failure, although the lessons learned would have an important influence on Soviet foreign policy towards Africa in the following decades The Soviet Union's display of ineptitude during the Congo Crisis, where it failed to prevent both the newly independent Republic of the Congo from descending into chaos and the substantial military intervention by Western powers, led to a further cooling of relations between the Soviet Union and its Ghanaian and Guinean partners [263]\n\n\nRemoval\nBeginning in March 1964, Supreme Soviet presidium chairman and thus nominal head of state Leonid Brezhnev began plotting Khrushchev's removal with his colleagues [264] While Brezhnev considered having Khrushchev arrested as he returned from a trip to Scandinavia in June, he instead persuaded members of the Central Committee to support the ousting of Khrushchev, remembering how crucial the committee's support had been to Khrushchev in defeating the Anti-Party Group plot [264] Brezhnev had ample time for his conspiracy, as Khrushchev was absent from Moscow for a total of five months between January and September 1964 [265]\n\n\nLife in retirement\nKhrushchev was granted a pension of 500 rubles per month and was given a house, a dacha and a car [274] Following his removal, he fell into deep depression He received few visitors, especially since his security guards reported all visits [275] His pension was reduced to 400 rubles per month, though his retirement remained comfortable by Soviet standards [276] [277] One of his grandsons was asked what the ex-premier was doing in retirement, and the boy replied, \"Grandfather cries.\" [278] Khrushchev was made a non-person to such an extent that the thirty-volume Great Soviet Encyclopedia omitted him from the list of prominent political commissars during the Great Patriotic War [32]\n\n\nDeath\nKhrushchev died of a heart attack around noon in the Moscow Central Clinical Hospital on 11 September 1971, at the age of 77 He was denied a state funeral with interment in the Kremlin Wall and was instead buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow Fearing demonstrations, the authorities did not announce Khrushchev's death until the hour of his wake, held in a morgue in the southern suburbs of Moscow, [284] and surrounded the cemetery with troops Even so, some artists and writers joined the family for the interment [285]\n\n\nLegacy\nMany of Khrushchev's innovations were reversed after his fall The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, as was the division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors His vocational education program for high school students was dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures [288]\n\n\nSee

served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964 and as the Premier of the Soviet Union from 1958 to 1964. He played a key role in the post-Stalin Soviet Union, implementing policies that aimed to reform the country's economy, politics, and society.\n\n**Early years**\n\nNikita Khrushchev was born on 15 April 1894, in Kalinovka, a village in what is now Russia's Kursk Oblast. His parents, Sergei Khrushchev and Kseniya Khrushcheva, were poor Russian peasants. Khrushchev's family moved to Yuzovka, now Donetsk, Ukraine, when he was six or seven years old, returning to Kalinovka when he was a teenager. Khrushchev's father worked as a railwayman, a miner, and a laborer in a brick factory, with wages higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region. Khrushchev's father generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning when he had enough money.\n\n**Party official**\n\nKhrushchev was assigned as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbas region in 1921. There were few Bolsheviks in the area at the time, and the movement was split by Lenin's New Economic Policy. Khrushchev involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years. He helped restart the machines and wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours. Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, but he was also involved in the practicalities of the mine.\n\n**Donbass years**\n\nKhrushchev's years in the Donbas region were marked by his involvement in the practicalities of the mine and his role as assistant director for political affairs. He helped restart the machines and wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours. Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, but he was also involved in the practicalities of the mine.\n\n**Kaganovich protégé**\n\nKhrushchev met Lazar Kaganovich as early as 1917. In 1925, Kaganovich became Party head in Ukraine, and Khrushchev, falling under his patronage, was rapidly promoted. Khrushchev was appointed second in command of Stalin's party apparatus in late 1926. Within nine months, his superior, Konstantin Moiseyenko, was ousted, which was due to Khrushchev's instigation.\n\n**Involvement in purges**\n\nStalin's office records show meetings at which Khrushchev was present as early as 1932.

Beginning in 1934, Stalin began a campaign of political repression known as the Great Purge, during which many were executed or sent to the Gulag. Khrushchev expressed his vehement support for the purge.\n\n**World War II**\n\nWhen Soviet troops, pursuant to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, invaded the eastern portion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin's direction. A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the western portion of Ukraine. Many inhabitants initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent. Khrushchev's role was to ensure that the occupied areas voted for union with the USSR.\n\n**Return to Ukraine**\n\nAlmost all of Ukraine had been occupied by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. One out of every six Ukrainians were killed in World War II.\n\n**Stalin's final years**\n\nFrom mid-December 1949, Khrushchev served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province.

Those members of the Presidium of the Central Committee who had been recently promoted by Stalin were demoted. Khrushchev was relieved of his duties as Party head for Moscow to concentrate on unspecified duties in the Party's Central Committee.\n\n**Leader of the Soviet Union (1955-1964)**\n\nAfter the demotion of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially worked together well. Molotov even proposed that Khrushchev replace Malenkov as premier. However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy. Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, while Khrushchev felt it was feasible due to a lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force.\n\n**Domestic policies**\n\nUnder Khrushchev, the special tribunals operated by security agencies were abolished.

\"Nikita_Khrushchev\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly years\nKhrushchev was born on 15 April 1894, [d] [2] in Kalinovka, [3] a village in what is now Russia's Kursk Oblast (then Kursk Governorate), near the present Ukrainian border [4] His parents, Sergei Khrushchev and Kseniya Khrushcheva, were poor Russian peasants, [5] and had a daughter two years Nikita's junior, Irina [2] Sergei Khrushchev was employed in a number of positions in the Donbas area of far eastern Ukraine, working as a railwayman, as a miner, and laboring in a brick factory Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning when he had enough money [6] When Nikita was six or seven, the family moved to Yuzovka (now Donetsk, Ukraine) for about a year before returning to Kalinovka [7]\n\n\nParty official\nThrough the intervention of a friend, Khrushchev was assigned in 1921 as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbas region, where he had previously worked [23] There were as yet few Bolsheviks in the area At that time, the movement was split by Lenin's New Economic Policy [23] While Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mine-owners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours [24]\n\n\nDonbass years\nThrough the intervention of a friend, Khrushchev was

the mine after the chaos of the war years He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mine-owners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours [24]\n\n\nKaganovich protégé\nKhrushchev met Lazar Kaganovich as early as 1917 In 1925, Kaganovich became Party head in Ukraine [31] and Khrushchev, falling under his patronage, [32] was rapidly promoted He was appointed second in command of Stalin's party apparatus in late 1926 Within nine months his superior, Konstantin Moiseyenko, was ousted, which, according to Taubman, was due to Khrushchev's instigation [31] Kaganovich transferred Khrushchev to Kharkov, then the capital of Ukraine, as head of the Organizational Department of the Ukrainian Party's Central Committee [33] In 1928, Khrushchev was transferred to Kiev, where he served as head of the organizational department, [34] second-in-command of the Party organization there [35]\n\n\nInvolvement in purges\nStalin's office records show meetings at which Khrushchev was present as early as 1932 The two increasingly built a good relationship Khrushchev greatly admired the dictator and treasured informal meetings with him and invitations to Stalin's dacha, while Stalin felt warm affection for his young subordinate [41] Beginning in 1934, Stalin began a campaign of political repression known as the Great Purge, during which many were executed or sent to the Gulag Central to this campaign were the Moscow Trials, a series of show trials of the purged top leaders of the party and the military In 1936, as the trials proceeded, Khrushchev expressed his vehement support:\n\n\nWorld War II\nWhen Soviet troops, pursuant to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, invaded the eastern portion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin's direction A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the western portion of Ukraine Many inhabitants initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent Khrushchev's role was to ensure that the occupied areas voted for union with the USSR Through a combination of propaganda, deception as to what was being voted for, and outright fraud, the Soviets ensured that the assemblies elected in the new territories would unanimously petition for union with the USSR When the new assemblies did so, their petitions were granted by the USSR Supreme Soviet, and Western Ukraine became a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on 1 November 1939 [54] Clumsy actions by the Soviets, such as staffing Western Ukrainian organizations with Eastern Ukrainians, and giving confiscated land to collective farms (kolkhozes) rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians, damaging Khrushchev's efforts to achieve unity [55]\n\n\nInvasion of Poland and subsequent occupation\nWhen Soviet troops, pursuant to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, invaded the eastern portion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin's direction A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today

collective farms (kolkhozes) rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians, damaging Khrushchev's efforts to achieve unity [55]\n\n\nWar against Germany\nWhen Nazi Germany invaded the USSR, in June 1941, Khrushchev was still at his post in Kiev [56] Stalin appointed him a political commissar, and Khrushchev served on a number of fronts as an intermediary between the local military commanders and the political rulers in Moscow Stalin used Khrushchev to keep commanders on a tight leash, while the commanders sought to have him influence Stalin [57]\n\n\nRise to power\nAlmost all of Ukraine had been occupied by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained [74] One out of every six Ukrainians were killed in World War II [75]\n\n\nReturn to Ukraine\nAlmost all of Ukraine had been occupied by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation Ukraine's industry had been

[74] One out of every six Ukrainians were killed in World War II [75]\n\n\nStalin's final years\nFrom mid-December 1949, Khrushchev served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province His biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to Moscow to balance the influence of Georgy Malenkov and security chief Lavrentiy Beria, who were widely seen as Stalin's heirs [94] The aging leader rarely called Politburo meetings Instead, much of the high-level work of government took place at dinners hosted by Stalin for his inner circle of Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Nikolai Bulganin Khrushchev took early naps so that he would not fall asleep in Stalin's presence; he noted in his memoirs, \"Things went badly for those who dozed off at Stalin's table.\" [95]\n\n\nStruggle for power\nOn 6 March 1953, Stalin's death was announced, as was the new leadership Malenkov was the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers, with Beria (who consolidated his hold over the security agencies), Kaganovich, Bulganin, and former Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov as first vice-chairmen Those members of the Presidium of the Central Committee who had been recently promoted by Stalin were demoted Khrushchev was relieved of his duties as Party head for Moscow to concentrate on unspecified duties in the Party's Central Committee [103] The New York Times listed Malenkov and Beria first and second among the ten-man Presidium—and Khrushchev last [104]\n\n\nLeader of the Soviet Union (1955–1964)\nAfter the demotion of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially worked together well Molotov even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible due to a lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then occupying part of the country to leave Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty [125] Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position [126]\n\n\nDomestic policies\nAfter the demotion of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially worked together well Molotov even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible due to a lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after

delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty [125] Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position [126]\n\n\nConsolidation of power and \"Secret Speech\"\nAfter the demotion of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov

attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position [126]\n\n\nLiberalization and the arts\nAfter assuming power, Khrushchev allowed a modest amount of freedom in the arts Vladimir Dudintsev's novel Not by Bread Alone, [139] about an idealistic engineer opposed by rigid bureaucrats, was allowed to be published in 1956, though Khrushchev called the novel \"false at its base\" [140] In 1958, however, Khrushchev ordered a fierce attack on Boris Pasternak after his novel Doctor Zhivago was published abroad (he was denied permission to publish it in the Soviet Union) Pravda described the novel as \"low-grade reactionary hackwork\", and the author was expelled from the Writer's Union [141] Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, but under heavy pressure he declined it Once he did so, Khrushchev ordered a halt to the attacks on Pasternak In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that he agonized over the novel, very nearly allowed it to be published, and later regretted not doing so [141] After his fall from power, Khrushchev read the novel (he had earlier read only excerpts) and stated, \"We shouldn't have banned it I should have read it myself There's nothing anti-Soviet in it.\" [142]\n\n\nPolitical reform\nUnder Khrushchev, the special tribunals operated by security agencies were abolished These tribunals, known as troikas, had often ignored laws and procedures Under the reforms, no prosecution for a political crime could be brought even in the regular courts unless approved by the local Party committee This rarely happened; there were no major political trials under Khrushchev, and at most several hundred political prosecutions overall Instead, other sanctions were imposed on Soviet dissidents, including loss of job or university position, or expulsion from the Party During Khrushchev's rule, forced hospitalization for the \"socially dangerous\" was introduced [151] According to author Roy Medvedev, who wrote an early analysis of Khrushchev's years in power, \"political terror as an everyday method of government was replaced under Khrushchev by administrative means of repression\" [151]\n\n\nAgricultural policy\nKhrushchev was an expert on agricultural policies and sensed an urgent need to reform the backward, inefficient system with ideas that worked in the US He looked especially at collectivism, state farms, liquidation of machine-tractor stations, planning decentralization, economic incentives, increased labor and capital investment, new crops, and new production programs Henry Ford had been at the center of American technology transfer to the Soviet Union in the 1930s; he sent over factory designs, engineers, and skilled craftsmen, as well as tens of thousands of Ford tractors By the 1940s Khrushchev was keenly interested in American agricultural innovations, especially on large-scale family-operated farms in the Midwest In the 1950s he sent several delegations to visit farms and land grant colleges, looking at successful farms that utilized high-yielding seed varieties, very large and powerful tractors and other machines, all guided by modern management techniques [155] Especially after his visit to the US in 1959, he was keenly aware of the need to emulate and even match American superiority and agricultural technology [156] [157]\n\n\nEducation\n\nWhile visiting the United States in 1959, Khrushchev was impressed by the agricultural education program at Iowa State University, and sought to imitate it in the Soviet Union At the time, the main agricultural college in the USSR was in Moscow, and students did not do the manual labor of farming Khrushchev proposed moving the programs to rural areas He was unsuccessful, due to resistance from professors and students, who never actually disagreed with the premier, but who did not carry out his proposals [175] Khrushchev recalled in his memoirs: \n\nAnti-religious campaign\nThe anti-religious campaign of the Khrushchev era began in 1959, coinciding with the 21st Party Congress It was carried out by mass closures of churches [183] [184] (reducing the number from 22,000 in 1959 [185] to 13,008 in 1960 and to 7,873 by 1965 [186]), monasteries, convents, and seminaries The campaign also included a restriction on parental rights to teach religion to their children; a ban on the presence of children at church services; and a ban on the administration of the Eucharist to children over the age of four Khrushchev additionally banned all services held outside of churches' walls, renewed enforcement of 1929 legislation banning pilgrimages, and recorded the personal identities of all adults requesting church baptisms, weddings, or funerals [187] He disallowed the ringing of church bells and services in daytime in some rural settings from May to the end of October under the pretext of fieldwork requirements Non-fulfillment of these regulations by clergy would lead to disallowance of state registration (meaning clergy could no longer do any pastoral or liturgical work without special state permission) According to Dimitry Pospielovsky, the state carried out forced retirement, arrests, and prison sentences for clergymen on \"trumped-up charges,\" but in reality, he writes, said state actions were taken against clergy who resisted the closure of churches; delivered sermons attacking the USSR's state atheism and anti-religious campaign; conducted Christian charity; or made religion popular by personal example [188]\n\n\nForeign and defense policies\nFrom 1950 to 1953 Khrushchev was well-placed to closely observe and evaluate Stalin's foreign policy Khrushchev considered the entire Cold War to be a serious mistake on Stalin's part In the long term, it created an unnecessary and expensive militarized struggle with NATO It diverted attention away from the neutral developing world, where progress could be made, and it weakened Moscow's relationship with its East European satellites Basically Khrushchev was much more optimistic about the future than Stalin or Molotov, and was more of an internationalist He believed the working classes and the common peoples of the world would eventually find their way towards socialism and even communism, and that conflicts like the Cold War diverted their attention from this eventual goal Peaceful coexistence of the sort that Lenin himself had practiced at first would allow the Soviet Union and its satellite states to build up their economies and their standard of living Khrushchev decided that Stalin had made a series of mistakes, such as heavy-handed pressure in Turkey and Iran in 1945 and 1946, and especially heavy pressure on Berlin that led to the failed Berlin blockade in 1948 Germany was a major issue for Khrushchev, not because he feared a NATO invasion eastward, but because it weakened the East German regime, which economically paled in comparison to the economic progress of West Germany Khrushchev blamed Molotov for being unable to resolve the conflict with Yugoslavia, and largely ignoring the needs of the East European communist satellites.\n\n\nUnited States and NATO\nKhrushchev sought to find a lasting solution to the problem of a divided Germany and of the enclave of West Berlin In November 1958, calling West Berlin a \"malignant tumor\", he gave the United States, United Kingdom and France six months to conclude a peace treaty with both German states and the Soviet Union If one was not signed, Khrushchev stated, the Soviet Union would conclude a peace treaty with East Germany This would leave East Germany, which was not a party to treaties giving the Western Powers access to Berlin, in control of the routes to the city They proposed making Berlin a free city, which meant no outside military forces would be stationed there West Germany, United States and France strongly opposed the ultimatum, but Britain wanted to consider it as a starting point for negotiations No one wanted to risk war over the issue At Britain's request, Khrushchev extended and ultimately dropped the ultimatum, as the Berlin issue became part of the complex agenda of high-level summit meetings [193]\n\n\nEarly relations and U.S. visit (1957–1960)\nKhrushchev sought to find a lasting solution to the problem of a divided Germany and of the enclave of West Berlin In November 1958, calling West Berlin a \"malignant tumor\", he gave the United States, United Kingdom and France six months to conclude a peace treaty with both German states and the Soviet Union If one was not signed, Khrushchev stated, the Soviet Union would conclude a peace treaty with East Germany This would leave East Germany, which was not a party to treaties giving the Western Powers access to Berlin, in control of the routes to the city They proposed making Berlin a free city, which

No one wanted to risk war over the issue At Britain's request, Khrushchev extended and ultimately dropped the ultimatum, as the Berlin issue became part of the complex agenda of high-level summit meetings [193]\n\n\nU-2 and Berlin crisis (1960–1961)\nA constant irritant in Soviet–U.S relations was the overflight of the Soviet Union by American U-2 spy aircraft On 9 April 1960, the U.S resumed such flights after a lengthy break The Soviets had protested the flights in the past but had been ignored by Washington Content in what he thought was a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower, Khrushchev was confused and angered by the flights' resumption, and concluded that they had been ordered by CIA Director Allen Dulles without Eisenhower's knowledge Khrushchev planned to visit the U.S to meet Eisenhower, but the visit was canceled when Soviet Air Defence Forces brought down the U.S U-2 [215] On 1 May, a U-2 was shot down, its pilot, Francis Gary Powers, captured alive [216] Believing Powers to have been killed, the U.S announced that a weather plane had been lost near the Turkish-Soviet border Khrushchev risked destroying the summit, due to start on 16 May in Paris, if he announced the shootdown, but would look weak in the eyes of his military and security forces if he did nothing [216] On 5 May, Khrushchev announced the shootdown and Powers' capture, blaming the overflight on \"imperialist circles and militarists, whose stronghold is the Pentagon\", and suggesting the plane had been sent without Eisenhower's knowledge [217] Eisenhower could not have it thought that there were rogue elements in the Pentagon operating without his knowledge, and admitted that he had ordered the flights, calling them \"a distasteful necessity\" [218] The admission stunned Khrushchev and turned the U-2 affair from a possible triumph to a disaster for him, and he even appealed to U.S Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson for help [219]\n\n\nCuban Missile Crisis and the test ban treaty (1962–1964)\nSuperpower tensions culminated in the Cuban Missile Crisis (in the USSR, the \"Caribbean crisis\") of October 1962, as the Soviet Union sought to install medium-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, about 90 miles (140 km) from the U.S coast [32] Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro was reluctant to accept the missiles, and, once he was persuaded, warned Khrushchev against transporting the missiles in secret Castro stated, thirty years later, \"We had a sovereign right to accept the missiles We were not violating international law Why do it secretly—as if we had no right to do it? I warned Nikita that secrecy would give the imperialists the advantage.\" [230]\n\n\nEastern Europe\nThe Secret Speech, combined with the death of the Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut, who suffered a heart attack while reading the Speech, sparked considerable liberalization in Poland and Hungary In Poland, a worker's strike in Poznań developed into disturbances that left more than 50 dead in June 1956 [241] When Moscow blamed the disturbances on Western agitators, Polish leaders ignored the claim and made concessions to the workers With anti-Soviet displays becoming more common in Poland, and crucial Polish leadership elections upcoming, Khrushchev and other Presidium members flew to Warsaw on 19 October to meet with the Polish Presidium The Soviets agreed to allow the new Polish leadership to take office, on the assurance there would be no change to the Soviet-Polish relationship [241] [242] [243] A period of at least partial liberalization, known as the Polish October, followed.\n\n\nChina\nAfter completing his takeover of mainland China in 1949, Mao Zedong sought material assistance from the USSR, and also called for the return to China of territories taken from it under the Tsars [32] Khrushchev increased aid to China, even sending a small corps of experts to help develop the new communist country [252] This assistance was described by historian William C Kirby as \"the greatest transfer of technology in world history\" [253] The Soviet Union spent 7% of its national income between 1954 and 1959 on aid to China [254] On his 1954 visit to China, Khrushchev agreed to return Port Arthur and Dalian to China, though Khrushchev was annoyed by Mao's insistence that the Soviets leave their artillery [255]\n\n\nWest Africa\nUnder Khrushchev, the Soviet Union provided considerable aid to the newly independent Ghana and Guinea These were seen as ideal places to test the \"socialist model of development\" because of their critical dependence on economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, in contrast to larger Third World nations like Egypt and Indonesia This project proved to be a resounding failure, although the lessons learned would have an important influence on Soviet foreign policy towards Africa in the following decades The Soviet Union's display of ineptitude during the Congo Crisis, where it failed to prevent both the newly independent Republic of the Congo from descending into chaos and the substantial military intervention by Western powers, led to a further cooling of relations between the Soviet Union and its Ghanaian and Guinean partners [263]\n\n\nRemoval\nBeginning in March 1964, Supreme Soviet presidium chairman and thus nominal head of state Leonid Brezhnev began plotting Khrushchev's removal with his colleagues [264] While Brezhnev considered having Khrushchev arrested as he returned from a trip to Scandinavia in June, he instead persuaded members of the Central Committee to support the ousting of Khrushchev, remembering how crucial the committee's support had been to Khrushchev in defeating the Anti-Party Group plot [264] Brezhnev had ample time for his conspiracy, as Khrushchev was absent from Moscow for a total of five months between January and September 1964 [265]\n\n\nLife in retirement\nKhrushchev was granted a pension of 500 rubles per month and was given a house, a dacha and a car [274] Following his removal, he fell into deep depression He received few visitors, especially since his security guards reported all visits [275] His pension was reduced to 400 rubles per month, though his retirement remained comfortable by Soviet standards [276] [277] One of his grandsons was asked what the ex-premier was doing in retirement, and the boy replied, \"Grandfather cries.\" [278] Khrushchev was made a non-person to such an extent that the thirty-volume Great Soviet Encyclopedia omitted him from the list of prominent political commissars during the Great Patriotic War [32]\n\n\nDeath\nKhrushchev died of a heart attack around noon in the Moscow Central Clinical Hospital on 11 September 1971, at the age of 77 He was denied a state funeral with interment in the Kremlin Wall and was instead buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow Fearing demonstrations, the authorities did not announce Khrushchev's death until the hour of his wake, held in a morgue in the southern suburbs of Moscow, [284] and surrounded the cemetery with troops Even so, some artists and writers joined the family for the interment [285]\n\n\nLegacy\nMany of Khrushchev's innovations were reversed after his fall The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, as was the division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors His vocational education program for high school students was dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures [288]\n\n\nSee

Ghani: \"It's time, Mr President We have to leave.\" [61] Later that day, President Ghani and members of his family and inner circle quietly fled from Afghanistan [62] [63] [64] [65] Their own top lieutenants, important government members, and US officials were not informed they would escape until after they had already left [15] When told about Ashraf Ghani fled Kabul, President Biden exploded in frustration and later said \"Give Me a Break\" [66]\n\n\nImpact on civilians\nThe Taliban's advances alarmed many Kabul residents Some locals, especially women, were fearful for the restoration of Taliban rule and reported feeling betrayed and abandoned by the Ghani government and NATO allies; a minority of residents celebrated the Taliban advance [47] [72] [73] [74]\n\n\nKabul Airport evacuations\nSince the Taliban had seized all border crossings, the Hamid Karzai International Airport remained the only secure route out of Afghanistan for those seeking to escape, as the US military and its NATO partners continued to provide security for the airport and airfield [86] The streets of Kabul were gridlocked with residents rushing towards the airport, with some abandoning their cars to make their way on foot through the traffic [87] Residents who had worked with the government and international organisations reported destroying their IDs to avoid being targeted by the Taliban, and many of those fleeing for the airport took no possessions with them [88] Long queues were reported outside of the airport and foreign embassies, with residents waiting in the heat in the hopes of being able to secure visas or flights out of the country [89]\n\n\nSuicide bombing and US drone strikes\nOn 26 August, a suicide bombing occurred at Kabul Airport, killing over 180 people and injuring over 150 Among the casualties were 169 Afghan civilians and 13 American troops Earlier that day an intelligence report indicated that a \"very lethal terror attack\" was likely to take place at the airport within a few hours [94] The Islamic State's Afghanistan affiliate (ISIL-KP) claimed responsibility for the attack [95] According to reports, the US gave Taliban the names of Americans and Afghan allies to evacuate [96]\n\n\nReactions\nFormer Afghan president Hamid Karzai pressed publicly for a peaceful transition of power, promising he would remain in Kabul with his daughters [100] Other figures closely associated with the US-backed Afghan government, including Gul Agha Sherzai, the former governor of Nangahar province, congratulated Taliban on their victory [15]\n\n\nAnalysis\nMultiple commentators and public figures described the fall of Kabul and of the Islamic republic as a significant disaster and a failure for NATO German politician Armin Laschet, minister-president of North Rhine-Westphalia and successor to Angela Merkel as CDU/CSU leader, stated that it was \"the biggest debacle that NATO has suffered since its creation and it's a change of era that we are confronted with\" British parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee chairman Tom Tugendhat stated that the collapse was \"the biggest single policy disaster since Suez\" [137] Journalist Nick Turse argued that \"without a true reevaluation this time around, the US risks falling into well-worn patterns that may, one day, make the military debacles in Southeast and Southwest Asia look terribly small\" [138]\n\n\nCauses\nUS intelligence assessments originally concluded Kabul would fall within months or weeks following withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan, though the security situation rapidly deteriorated, leading President Joe Biden to concede on 16 August that \"this did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated\" [21] [22]\n\n\nCollapse of Afghan government and security forces\nUS intelligence assessments originally concluded Kabul would fall within months or weeks following withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan, though the security situation rapidly deteriorated, leading President Joe Biden to concede on 16 August that \"this did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated\" [21] [22]\n\n\nNATO withdrawal\nDavid E Sanger, a New York Times correspondent, analyzed the decision to leave Afghanistan by Joe Biden, and consequently the manner of the fall of Kabul, as the result of four basic assumptions, or miscalculations: that there was enough time before the Afghan government collapsed for the US to withdraw, that the Afghan forces had \"the same drive\" to win as the Taliban did, that there was \"a well-planned system for evacuating the embassy\" and Afghans who had helped the US and their families, and that if the Taliban made it to Kabul, that there would be a \"bloody block-by-block civil war\" taking place in its streets [149]\n\n\nComparisons\nIn an article in The Conversation, William Maley, an emeritus at the Australian National University, compared the fall of Kabul to the 1956 Suez Crisis and its effects on the perception of the United Kingdom as a global power, stating that Biden had \"failed the people of Afghanistan and tarnished US credibility around the world\", stating that the United States \"increasingly appears a fading power internationally\" According to Maley, the collapse of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is due to Biden's inexperience in the field of foreign policy, Western lack of understanding of Afghan society, and the legitimization that the Taliban received with the Trump-led US–Taliban deal He concluded by quoting former British prime minister David Lloyd George, who said in 1940 that \"our promissory notes are now rubbish on the market\", stating that, as a result of its failures over Afghanistan, the Biden administration is rapidly heading in a similar direction [150]\n\n\nEgypt 1956\nIn an article in The Conversation, William Maley, an emeritus at the Australian National University, compared the fall of Kabul to the 1956 Suez Crisis and its effects

direction [150]\n\n\nCuba 1961\nFormer American defense secretary Leon Panetta compared the fall of Kabul to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in 1961, saying that \"President Kennedy took responsibility for what took place I strongly recommend to President Biden that he take responsibility .. admit the mistakes that were made\" [151]\n\n\nVietnam 1975\nThe events were compared by many commentators and the public to the Fall of Saigon at the end of Vietnam War in April 1975 [153] [154] [155] [156] [157] A month before the Taliban arrived in Kabul, American president Joe Biden had rejected the comparison, stating that \"the Taliban is not the North Vietnamese Army.. There's going to be no circumstance for you to see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy of the United States from Afghanistan It is not at all comparable\" [158]\n\n\nAfghanistan 1992\nRoss Douthat of The New York Times compared the 1992 fall of Kabul with the fall in 2021 and remarked that the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan managed to survive against the Afghan mujahideen for 3 years after the withdrawal of Soviet forces, compared to the few months for the American-backed Islamic Republic of Afghanistan [161] Zamir Kubalov, the Russian envoy for Afghanistan also remarked that the \"regime created by the Americans tumbled down even before they left\" in comparison to the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan [162]\n\n\nIraq 2014\nIbrahim al-Marashi of California State University, San Marcos compared it to the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, in which IS overran large parts of Iraq and proclaimed a caliphate, arguing that the collapses were caused by the imposition of \"rigid, hierarchical American military doctrine\" on the Afghan and Iraqi militaries, that the Taliban and Daesh were more cohesive armed groups, and that the NATO-backed Afghan and Iraqi governments had \"allowed networks of patronage and corruption to take root\" [163] The Iraqi government and army were equally plagued by structural corruption and unknown number of ghost soldiers.\n\n\nUkraine\nSecurity Council of Russia secretary Nikolai Patrushev compared the situation to Ukraine–United States relations, stating that \"a similar situation awaits supporters of the American choice in Ukraine\" [164] The collapse led to the Biden administration receiving immense criticism, and has challenged Biden's policy of pro-activeness in aiding US allies [165] [166] [167] [168] Russia invaded Ukraine six months after the fall of Kabul; former Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt wrote in The Diplomatic Courier that failure in Afghanistan may have caused Russia to feel safer to  attack Ukraine [169]\n\n\nTaiwan\nState-run media in China compared the situation in Afghanistan to the United States' relations with Taiwan It questioned the former's commitment to defend the latter if China decides to take control of Taiwan, which it claims to be its province, by force [170]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe day after the fall of Kabul, 16 August, most of the city's streets had been deserted, save for those leading to the airport, with businesses shuttered and security checkpoints unmanned Taliban fighters, however, were sighted parading their flag and weapons and taking selfies next to Kabul landmarks [171] Taliban soldiers were also sighted going door-to-door searching for Afghan government workers and human rights activists [172] In the days after the fall, some residents reported that the Taliban had re-imposed a ban on women leaving their homes without a male guardian present Furthermore, multiple female-owned businesses in the city were shut down [173] Local television stations began to censor foreign and entertainment broadcasts, while state-owned broadcasters stopped broadcasting almost all but Taliban statements and Islamic sermons [174] [175] The Taliban had also started to remove female journalists from their positions [176]\n\n\nRefugees\nAfter the fall of Kabul and the Islamic Republic, a surge in refugees trying to escape from the Taliban was to be expected Therefore, in the days following the toppling of the Islamic Republic, numerous governments announced their plans regarding the number of refugees they were going to take in [190] [191] After the capture of Kabul, more than 300,000 Afghan civilians who worked for the US were at risk of Taliban retaliation [192] As a result, an internationally organized airlift was conducted to prevent any harm from befalling these civilians This operation was spearheaded by the US and on 30 August, the mission concluded with more than 123,000 people being escorted out of the country via airlift [193]\n\n\nResistance\nWith the fall of Kabul, former Northern Alliance members and other anti-Taliban forces based in the province Panjshir, led by Ahmad Massoud and former vice president Amrullah Saleh, became the primary organized resistance to the Taliban in Afghanistan [203] [7] [204] The Afghan embassy in Tajikistan replaced their presidential portrait of Ghani with one of Saleh and submitted a request to Interpol to have arrest warrants issued for Ghani, along with his chief advisor Fazel Mahmood and National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib, on charges of having stolen from the Afghan treasury [205] Massoud has stated his desire to negotiate with the Taliban [206]\n\n\nPanjshir conflict\nWith the fall of Kabul, former Northern Alliance members and other anti-Taliban forces based in the province Panjshir, led by Ahmad Massoud and former vice president Amrullah Saleh, became the primary organized resistance to the Taliban in Afghanistan [203] [7] [204] The Afghan embassy in Tajikistan replaced their presidential portrait of Ghani with one of Saleh and submitted a request to Interpol to have arrest warrants issued for Ghani, along with his chief advisor Fazel Mahmood and National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib, on charges of having stolen from the Afghan treasury [205] Massoud has stated his desire to negotiate with the Taliban [206]\n\n\nProtests\nOn 17 August, a small protest was held by several women in Kabul demanding equal rights for women, the first reported women's protest against the new government [209] On 18 August, larger protests also attended by men emerged in three eastern Pashtun-dominated cities: Jalalabad, Khost, and Asadabad, with protestors waving the flag of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and taking down the Taliban flag [210] [211] [212] In Jalalabad, the Taliban opened fire, killing three and wounding over a dozen [213] On 19 August, demonstrations spread to various parts of Kabul, including one large protest near Kabul Airport where cars and people waved the flag of the republic, and another with over 200 people [214] gathered near the presidential palace in Kabul before it was violently dispersed by the Taliban [215] [216] Protests continued in Khost and Asadabad as well, with the Taliban using violence to disperse protests in both In Asadabad, protests were reported as swelling to the hundreds [213] The response of the Taliban came as they fired into the crowd, shooting and killing at least two people [217]\n\n\nWomen\nThe withdrawal of the US army and most diplomatic international presence has changed the way of life for many Afghan women At the beginning of September 2021, the focus on a male-dominated society returned, as the new regime appointed only men for the government positions [221] Besides not being represented by their government, the Taliban has also altered the access to education for females In various parts of the country, girls were taken out of high school and women were barred from universities due to reasons of \"capacity\" [222] After six months without education for these Afghan women, the Taliban had promised to reopen the schools in March 2022 but retracted their statement, which resulted in a protest [223] [224]\n\n\nMental health\nA recent study between August and November 2021 was completed by 214 Afghan students with a majority of 73.7% being female Accurate studies in crisis areas like Afghanistan are difficult to conduct because it is hard to have a large number of participants and a smaller sample size weakens the results Despite this, the research presents that 69.7% of participants suffer from depression and 70% from PTSD due to the fall of Kabul and the crisis that came after Women are affected more than men and the general scores are higher than those of prior studies in Afghanistan [228]\n\n\nHealth\nMany women in Afghanistan have experienced gender-based violence (GBV) in their lives Even though it was already in place before the Taliban rule, it has increased since the fall of Kabul The Taliban have been accused of removing Afghan women from public life, which includes the political, economic and social spheres [229] An example of the increasing restrictions that affect female health is that women are banned from travelling for more than 72 kilometers without the presence of a mahram, a male guardian [230] The geographical reduction of their access to health care in combination with the fact that women cannot be examined by males aggravates the problem [227] The deteriorating humanitarian and economic situation increases the further risk of GBV as there are fewer help services or ways to escape the violence [227]\n\n\nAnniversary\nIn 2022, 15 August was declared a national holiday by the Taliban upon the first anniversary of the fall of Kabul [231]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Fall of

[206]\n\n\nProtests\nOn 17 August, a small protest was held by several women in Kabul demanding equal rights for women, the first reported women's protest against the new government [209] On 18 August, larger protests also attended by men emerged in three eastern Pashtun-dominated cities: Jalalabad, Khost, and Asadabad, with protestors waving the flag of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and taking down the Taliban flag [210] [211] [212] In Jalalabad, the Taliban opened fire, killing three and wounding over a dozen [213] On 19 August, demonstrations spread to various parts of Kabul, including one large protest near Kabul Airport where cars and people waved the flag of the republic, and another with over 200 people [214] gathered near the presidential palace in Kabul before it was violently dispersed by the Taliban [215] [216] Protests continued in Khost and Asadabad as well, with the Taliban using violence to disperse protests in both In Asadabad, protests were reported as swelling to the hundreds [213] The response of the Taliban came as they fired into the crowd, shooting and killing at least two people [217]\n\n\nWomen\nThe withdrawal of the US army and most diplomatic international presence has changed the way of life for many Afghan women At the beginning of September 2021, the focus on a male-dominated society returned, as the new regime appointed only men for the government positions [221] Besides not being represented by their government, the Taliban has also altered the access to education for females In various parts of the country, girls were taken out of high school and women were barred from universities due to reasons of \"capacity\" [222] After six months without education for these Afghan women, the Taliban had promised to reopen the schools in March 2022 but retracted their statement, which resulted in a protest [223] [224]\n\n\nMental health\nA recent study between August and November 2021 was completed by 214 Afghan students with a majority of 73.7% being female Accurate studies in crisis areas like Afghanistan are difficult to conduct because it is hard to have a large number of participants and a smaller sample size weakens the results Despite this, the research presents that 69.7% of participants suffer from depression and 70% from PTSD due to the fall of Kabul and the crisis that came after Women are affected more than men and the general scores are higher than those of prior studies in Afghanistan [228]\n\n\nHealth\nMany women in Afghanistan have experienced gender-based violence (GBV) in their lives Even though it was already in place before the Taliban rule, it has increased since the fall of Kabul The Taliban have been accused of removing Afghan women from public life, which includes the political, economic and social spheres [229] An example of the increasing restrictions that affect female health is that women are banned from travelling for more than 72 kilometers without the presence of a mahram, a male guardian [230] The geographical reduction of their access to health care in combination with the fact that women cannot be examined by males aggravates the problem [227] The deteriorating humanitarian and economic situation increases the further risk of GBV as there are fewer help services or ways to escape the violence [227]\n\n\nAnniversary\nIn 2022, 15 August was declared a national holiday by the Taliban upon the first anniversary of the fall of Kabul [231]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "Tullimonstrum", "content": "\nDescription\nTullimonstrum probably reached lengths of up to 35 centimetres (14 in); the smallest individuals are about 8 cm (3.1 in) long [2]\n\n\nHistory of discovery\nAmateur collector Francis Tully  [ia] found the first of these fossils in 1955 in a fossil bed known as the Mazon Creek formation He took the strange creature to the Field Museum of Natural History, but paleontologists were stumped as to which phylum Tullimonstrum belonged in [7] The species Tullimonstrum gregarium (\"Tully's common monster\"), as these fossils later were named, takes its genus name from Tully, [2] whereas the species name, gregarium, means \"common\", and reflects its abundance [8] The term monstrum (\"monster\") relates to the creature's outlandish appearance and strange body plan.\n\n\nClassification\nThe classification of Tullimonstrum has been an ongoing debate since the creature was first described, [4] [5] with many scientists presenting evidence of a vertebrate affinity, and others of an invertebrate affinity [5] [13] [14] [15] [4]\n\n\nArguments in favor of vertebrate affinities\nIn 2016 two studies were released simultaneously showing that Tullimonstrum may have been a basal vertebrate, thus a member of the phylum Chordata [4] [5] McCoy et al undertook a morphological study of several specimens; their analysis indicated that Tullimonstrum may be closely related to modern lampreys [5] This affinity was attributed based on pronounced cartilaginous vertebral structures known as arcualia, a dorsal fin and asymmetric caudal fin, keratinous teeth, a single nostril, and tectal cartilages like in lampreys While McCoy et al raised the possibility that Tullimonstrum belong to the ancestral group of lamprey, [5] [16] it also has many features not found in Cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes) [17]\n\n\nMcCoy et al. (2016)\nIn 2016 two studies were released simultaneously showing that Tullimonstrum may have been a basal vertebrate, thus a member of the phylum Chordata [4] [5] McCoy et al undertook a morphological study of several specimens; their analysis indicated that Tullimonstrum may be closely related to modern lampreys [5] This affinity was attributed based on pronounced cartilaginous vertebral structures known as arcualia, a dorsal fin and asymmetric caudal fin, keratinous teeth, a single nostril, and tectal cartilages like in lampreys While McCoy et al raised the possibility that Tullimonstrum belong to the ancestral group of lamprey, [5] [16] it also has many features not found in Cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes) [17]\n\n\nClements et al. (2016)\nA second study, by Clements et al (2016), came to the conclusion that Tullimonstrum was a stem-vertebrate based on its eye anatomy Close examination revealed that the animal had a camera-like eye, with preserved lenses and the presence of cylindrical and spheroid melanosomes arranged in distinct layers These ocular pigments and their unique structure was interpreted to be a retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), offering strong support that the bar organs were indeed eyes [4] The dark pigments in the eye were chemically tested and found to be fossilized melanin, as opposed to ommochromes or pterins (which are ocular pigments used by many invertebrate groups) While the authors admitted that the ocular pigments of many invertebrate groups have been poorly investigated, at the time of publication the presence of RPE and two distinct melanosome morphology is a uniquely vertebrate trait [4]\n\n\nMcCoy et al. (2020); Wiemann et al. (2022)\nIn 2020, McCoy, Wiemann and colleagues used Raman spectroscopy to identify the molecular bonds present in the organic material preserved with Tullimonstrum Based on samples from multiple points in the body, they identified the organic material as representing the decay products of chordate tissues as opposed to the polysaccharide-based chitin (as is seen in arthropods), offering independent and rather unambiguous evidence for the interpretation that Tullimonstrum is a chordate or vertebrate [18] In 2022, Wiemann and colleagues replicated these spectral signals in collaboration with independent laboratories using Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy [19] Comparable tissue signatures have been detected in preserved carbonaceous remains of a diversity of other animals [13] [14]\n\n\nArguments in favour of non-vertebrate affinities\nIn 2017 Sallan et al rejected the identification of the Tully monster as a vertebrate Firstly, they noted that even the presence of the two melanosome types is variable among vertebrates; hagfish lack them altogether, and extant sharks as well as extinct forms found in the Mazon Creek area, such as Bandringa, only have spheroid melanosomes Additionally, the supposed notochord extends in front of the level of the eyes, which is not the case in any other vertebrate, although is seen in lancelets Even if the structure was a notochord, the presence of notochords is not limited to vertebrates either [15] [20]\n\n\nSallan et al. (2017)\nIn 2017 Sallan et al rejected the identification of the Tully monster as a vertebrate Firstly, they noted that even the presence of the two melanosome types is variable among vertebrates; hagfish lack them altogether, and extant sharks as well as extinct forms found in the Mazon Creek area, such as Bandringa, only have spheroid melanosomes Additionally, the supposed notochord extends in front of the level of the eyes, which is not the case in any other vertebrate, although is seen in lancelets Even if the structure was a notochord, the presence of notochords is not limited to vertebrates either [15] [20]\n\n\nRogers et al. (2019)\nRegardless, Rogers et al (2019) demonstrated that certain squid (Loligo vulgaris) and cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) species do in fact have two different melanosome forms which can decay to look like an RPE-like layer, similar to that observed in vertebrates and Tullimonstrum fossils [21] On a plot of trace metal signatures in the eyes of Mazon Creek fossils, Tullimonstrum is clearly distinct from both vertebrates (which have a higher concentration of zinc) and the eyespots of the putative cephalopod Pohlsepia (however, no evidence of melanosomes were found in Pohlsepia, and some studies deny its affinity as cephalopod [22] [23]) - although it should be noted however that these signals are influenced by the fossilisation process The authors doubt that Tullimonstrum was a cephalopod (in the absence of other supporting traits), they argue that eye structure and chemistry alone cannot disprove invertebrate affinities [21]\n\n\nMikami et al. (2023)\nIn 2023, Mikami et al (2023) scanned 153 specimens of Tullimonstrum by 3D scanner, as well as other taxa from Mazon Creek They concluded that some of the characters used by McCoy et al (2016) to justify a vertebrate identity (tri-lobed brain, tectal cartilages, fin rays) are not comparable to those of vertebrates The authors also determined that Tullimonstrum has segmentation extending to the preoptic region, which is clearly different from vertebrates Alternative classifications were discussed in detail, but Tullimonstrum could be a non-vertebrate chordate (due to its segmentation resembling the myomeres of Esconichthys apopyris, an enigmatic jawed vertebrate from Mazon Creek) or a protostome [24]\n\n\nPaleoecology\nTullimonstrum was probably a free-swimming carnivore that dwelt in open marine water, and was occasionally washed to the near-shore setting in which it was preserved [2] This means it swam freely in the water and not clamped to a hard surface or benthic environment [2]\n\n\nTaphonomy\nThe formation of the Mazon Creek fossils is unusual When the creatures died, they were rapidly buried in silty outwash The bacteria that began to decompose the plant and animal remains in the mud produced carbon dioxide in the sediments around the remains The carbonate combined with iron from the groundwater around the remains, forming encrusting nodules of siderite The organism was entombed, retarding decay and allowing an impression or carbonaceous remains [18] [13] of the organism to be preserved The first insights into the mechanisms of carbonaceous preservation in the Mazon Creek are provided as part of a large fossil data set, [13] however, the details are still subject of ongoing research [25]\n\n\nPaleontologist's prank\nA 1966–1968 prank promulgated by paleontologist Bryan Patterson suggested that modern representatives could possibly be found in remote lakes of Kenya, known under the local name \"Ekurut Loedonkakini\" These \"dancing worms of Turkana\" could supposedly kill a man with a bite, produced some sort of milk, and were known even to school-age children.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn 1989, Tullimonstrum gregarium was officially designated the state fossil of Illinois [31] Artwork of it is featured on U-Haul rental vehicles from the state [32] [33]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Tullimonstrum**\n\nTullimonstrum is a genus of extinct animals that lived during the Carboniferous period, around 309 to 295 million years ago. The name \"Tullimonstrum\" comes from the Latin words \"tullius,\" meaning \"of Tully,\" and \"monstrum,\" meaning \"monster.\" This refers to the creature's unusual appearance and body plan.\n\n**Description**\n\nTullimonstrum probably reached lengths of up to 35 centimeters (14 inches), with the smallest individuals measuring about 8 centimeters (3.1 inches) in length. The exact shape and structure of the creature's body are still a subject of debate among scientists, with some researchers suggesting that it may have had a more elongated or snake-like body.\n\n**History of Discovery**\n\nThe first Tullimonstrum fossil was discovered in 1955 by amateur collector Francis Tully in a fossil bed known as the Mazon Creek formation. Tully took the fossil to the Field Museum of Natural History, but paleontologists were stumped as to which phylum Tullimonstrum belonged to. The species Tullimonstrum gregarium, as these fossils later were named, takes its genus name from Tully, while the species name, gregarium, means \"common,\" and reflects its abundance.\n\n**Classification**\n\nThe classification of Tullimonstrum has been an ongoing debate since the creature was first described, with many scientists presenting evidence of a vertebrate affinity, and others of an invertebrate affinity. The debate continues to this day, with some researchers arguing that Tullimonstrum may have been a basal vertebrate, while others suggest that it may have been a non-vertebrate chordate or protostome.\n\n**Arguments in Favor of Vertebrate Affinities**\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that Tullimonstrum may have been a vertebrate. For example, a 2016 study by McCoy et al. found that Tullimonstrum may be closely related to modern lampreys, based on the presence of cartilaginous vertebral structures, a dorsal fin, and asymmetric caudal fin. Another study by Clements et al. in 2016 found that Tullimonstrum had a camera-like eye, with preserved lenses and the presence of cylindrical and spheroid melanosomes arranged in distinct layers, which is a unique trait found in vertebrates.\n\n**Arguments in Favor of Non-Vertebrate Affinities**\n\nHowever, other researchers have argued that Tullimonstrum may not have been a vertebrate. For example, a 2017 study by Sallan et al. found that the supposed notochord of Tullimonstrum extends in front of the level of the eyes, which is not the case in any other vertebrate. Additionally, Rogers et al. in 2019 found that certain squid and cuttlefish species have two different melanosome forms that can decay to look like an RPE-like layer, similar to that observed in vertebrates and Tullimonstrum fossils.\n\n**Paleoecology**\n\nTullimonstrum was probably a free-swimming carnivore that dwelt in open marine water, and was occasionally washed to the near-shore setting in which it was preserved. This means it swam freely in the water and not clamped to a hard surface or benthic environment.\n\n**Taphonomy**\n\nThe formation of the Mazon Creek fossils is unusual. When the creatures died, they were rapidly buried in silty outwash. The bacteria that began to decompose the plant and animal remains in the mud produced carbon dioxide in the sediments around the remains. The carbonate combined with iron from the groundwater around the remains, forming encrusting nodules of siderite. The organism was entombed, retarding decay and allowing an impression or carbonaceous remains of the organism to be preserved.\n\n**Paleontologist's Prank**\n\nA 1966-1968 prank promulgated by paleontologist Bryan Patterson suggested that modern representatives could possibly be found in remote lakes of Kenya, known under the local name \"Ekurut Loedonkakini.\" These \"dancing worms of Turkana\" could supposedly kill a man with a bite, produced some sort of milk, and were known even to school-age children.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nIn 1989, Tullimonstrum gregarium was officially designated the state fossil of Illinois. Artwork of it is featured on U-Haul rental vehicles from the state.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Fossil record of Illinois\n* Mazon Creek fossils\n* Paleontology of the Carboniferous period\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Field Museum of Natural History: Tullimonstrum\n* Paleontology Database: Tullimonstrum\n* Encyclopedia Britannica: Tullimonstrum", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Tullimonstrum\" following this outline:\n\n\nDescription\nTullimonstrum probably reached lengths of up to 35 centimetres (14 in); the smallest individuals are about 8 cm (3.1 in) long [2]\n\n\nHistory of discovery\nAmateur collector Francis Tully  [ia] found the first of these fossils in 1955 in a fossil bed known as the Mazon Creek formation He took the strange creature to the Field Museum of Natural History, but paleontologists were stumped as to which phylum Tullimonstrum belonged in [7] The species Tullimonstrum gregarium (\"Tully's common monster\"), as these fossils later were named, takes its genus name from Tully, [2] whereas the species name, gregarium, means \"common\", and reflects its abundance [8] The term monstrum (\"monster\") relates to the creature's outlandish appearance and strange body plan.\n\n\nClassification\nThe classification of Tullimonstrum has been an ongoing debate since the creature was first described, [4] [5] with many scientists presenting evidence of a vertebrate affinity, and others of an invertebrate affinity [5] [13] [14] [15] [4]\n\n\nArguments in favor of vertebrate affinities\nIn 2016 two studies were released simultaneously showing that Tullimonstrum may have been a basal vertebrate, thus a member of the phylum Chordata [4] [5] McCoy et al undertook a morphological study of several specimens; their analysis indicated that Tullimonstrum may be closely related to modern lampreys [5] This affinity was attributed based on pronounced cartilaginous vertebral structures known as arcualia, a dorsal fin and asymmetric caudal fin, keratinous teeth, a single nostril, and tectal cartilages like in lampreys While McCoy et al raised the possibility that Tullimonstrum belong to the ancestral group of lamprey, [5] [16] it also has many features not found in Cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes) [17]\n\n\nMcCoy et al. (2016)\nIn 2016 two studies were released simultaneously showing that Tullimonstrum may have been a basal vertebrate, thus a member of the phylum Chordata [4] [5] McCoy et al undertook a morphological study of several specimens; their analysis indicated that Tullimonstrum may be closely related to modern lampreys [5] This affinity was attributed based on pronounced cartilaginous vertebral structures known as arcualia, a dorsal fin and asymmetric caudal fin, keratinous teeth, a single nostril, and tectal cartilages like in lampreys While McCoy et al raised the possibility that Tullimonstrum belong to the ancestral group of lamprey, [5] [16] it also has many features not found in Cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes) [17]\n\n\nClements et al. (2016)\nA second study, by Clements et al (2016), came to the conclusion that Tullimonstrum was a stem-vertebrate based on its eye anatomy Close examination revealed that the animal had a camera-like eye, with preserved lenses and the presence of cylindrical and spheroid melanosomes arranged in distinct layers These ocular pigments and their unique structure was interpreted to be a retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), offering strong support that the bar organs were indeed eyes [4] The dark pigments in the eye were chemically tested and found to be fossilized melanin, as opposed to ommochromes or pterins (which are ocular pigments used by many invertebrate groups) While the authors admitted that the ocular pigments of many invertebrate groups have been poorly investigated, at the time of publication the presence of RPE and two distinct melanosome morphology is a uniquely vertebrate trait [4]\n\n\nMcCoy et al. (2020); Wiemann et al. (2022)\nIn 2020, McCoy, Wiemann and colleagues used Raman spectroscopy to identify the molecular bonds present in the organic material preserved with Tullimonstrum Based on samples from multiple points in the body, they identified the organic material as representing the decay products of chordate tissues as opposed to the polysaccharide-based chitin (as is seen in arthropods), offering independent and rather unambiguous evidence for the interpretation that Tullimonstrum is a chordate or vertebrate [18] In 2022, Wiemann and colleagues replicated these spectral signals in collaboration with independent laboratories using Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy [19] Comparable tissue signatures have been detected in preserved carbonaceous remains of a diversity of other animals [13] [14]\n\n\nArguments in favour of non-vertebrate affinities\nIn 2017 Sallan et al rejected the identification of the Tully monster as a vertebrate Firstly, they noted that even the presence of the two melanosome types is variable among vertebrates; hagfish lack them altogether, and extant sharks as well as extinct forms found in the Mazon Creek area, such as Bandringa, only have spheroid melanosomes Additionally, the supposed notochord extends in front of the level of the eyes, which is not the case in any other vertebrate, although is seen in lancelets Even if the structure was a notochord, the presence of notochords is not limited to vertebrates either [15] [20]\n\n\nSallan et al. (2017)\nIn 2017 Sallan et al rejected the identification of the Tully monster as a vertebrate Firstly, they noted that even the presence of the two melanosome types is variable among vertebrates; hagfish lack them altogether, and extant sharks as well as extinct forms found in the Mazon Creek area, such as Bandringa, only have spheroid melanosomes Additionally, the supposed notochord extends in front of the level of the eyes, which is not the case in any other vertebrate, although is seen in lancelets Even if the structure was a notochord, the presence of notochords is not limited to vertebrates either [15] [20]\n\n\nRogers et al. (2019)\nRegardless, Rogers et al (2019) demonstrated that certain squid (Loligo vulgaris) and cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) species do in fact have two different melanosome forms which can decay to look like an RPE-like layer, similar to that observed in vertebrates and Tullimonstrum fossils [21] On a plot of trace metal signatures in the eyes of Mazon Creek fossils, Tullimonstrum is clearly distinct from both vertebrates (which have a higher concentration of zinc) and the eyespots of the putative cephalopod Pohlsepia (however, no evidence of melanosomes were found in Pohlsepia, and some studies deny its affinity as cephalopod [22] [23]) - although it should be noted however that these signals are influenced by the fossilisation process The authors doubt that Tullimonstrum was a cephalopod (in the absence of other supporting traits), they argue that eye structure and chemistry alone cannot disprove invertebrate affinities [21]\n\n\nMikami et al. (2023)\nIn 2023, Mikami et al (2023) scanned 153 specimens of Tullimonstrum by 3D scanner, as well as other taxa from Mazon Creek They concluded that some of the characters used by McCoy et al (2016) to justify a vertebrate identity (tri-lobed brain, tectal cartilages, fin rays) are not comparable to those of vertebrates The authors also determined that Tullimonstrum has segmentation extending to the preoptic region, which is clearly different from vertebrates Alternative classifications were discussed in detail, but Tullimonstrum could be a non-vertebrate chordate (due to its segmentation resembling the myomeres of Esconichthys apopyris, an enigmatic jawed vertebrate from Mazon Creek) or a protostome [24]\n\n\nPaleoecology\nTullimonstrum was probably a free-swimming carnivore that dwelt in open marine water, and was occasionally washed to the near-shore setting in which it was preserved [2] This means it swam freely in the water and not clamped to a hard surface or benthic environment [2]\n\n\nTaphonomy\nThe formation of the Mazon Creek fossils is unusual When the creatures died, they were rapidly buried in silty outwash The bacteria that began to decompose the plant and animal remains in the mud produced carbon dioxide in the sediments around the remains The carbonate combined with iron from the groundwater around the remains, forming encrusting nodules of siderite The organism was entombed, retarding decay and allowing an impression or carbonaceous remains [18] [13] of the organism to be preserved The first insights into the mechanisms of carbonaceous preservation in the Mazon Creek are provided as part of a large fossil data set, [13] however, the details are still subject of ongoing research [25]\n\n\nPaleontologist's prank\nA 1966–1968 prank promulgated by paleontologist Bryan Patterson suggested that modern representatives could possibly be found in remote lakes of Kenya, known under the local name \"Ekurut Loedonkakini\" These \"dancing worms of Turkana\" could supposedly kill a man with a bite, produced some sort of milk, and were known even to school-age children.\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn 1989, Tullimonstrum gregarium was officially designated the state fossil of Illinois [31] Artwork of it is featured on U-Haul rental vehicles from the state [32] [33]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

when Baldry discovered Stewart was a singer as well, he offered him a job for £35 a week, after securing the approval of Stewart's mother [54] Quitting his day job at the age of nineteen, Stewart gradually overcame his shyness and nerves and became a visible enough part of the act that he was sometimes added to the billing as \"Rod the Mod\" Stewart, [42] [54] [55] the nickname coming from his dandyish style of grooming and dress [38] Baldry touted Stewart's abilities to Melody Maker magazine and the group enjoyed a weekly residence at London's fabled Marquee Club [55] In June 1964, Stewart made his recording début (without label credit) on \"Up Above My Head\", the B-side to a Baldry and Hoochie Coochie Men single [57] While still with Baldry, Stewart embarked on a simultaneous solo career [58] He made some demo recordings, [nb 5] was scouted by Decca Records at the Marquee Club, and signed to a solo contract in August 1964 [59] He appeared on several regional television shows around the country and recorded his first single in September 1964 [58] [59]\n\n\n1967–1969: Jeff Beck Group period\nGuitarist Jeff Beck recruited Stewart for his new post-Yardbirds venture, [69] and in February 1967, Stewart joined the Jeff Beck Group as vocalist and sometime songwriter [70] This would become the big break of his early career [38] There he first played with Ronnie Wood [64] whom he had first met in a London pub in 1964; [59] the two soon became fast friends [69] During its first year, the group experienced frequent changes of drummers and conflicts involving manager Mickie Most wanting to reduce Stewart's role They toured the UK and released a couple of singles that featured Stewart on their B-sides [70] [71] Stewart's sputtering solo career also continued with the March 1968 release of non-hit \"Little Miss Understood\" on Immediate Records [70]\n\n\n1969–1975: Solo career established and Faces albums\nMercury Records A&R man Lou Reizner had seen Stewart perform with Beck, and on 8 October 1968 signed him to a solo contract;

Born on January 10, 1945, in Highgate, London, Stewart has become one of the most successful and enduring artists of all time, with a career spanning multiple genres, including rock, pop, and soul.\n\n## Early Life\n\nRoderick David Stewart was born to Robert Joseph Stewart, a Scottish master builder, and Elsie Rebecca Gilbart, an English woman. Stewart was the youngest of five children, and his family moved to Highgate, where he spent most of his childhood. His father's Scottish heritage and his mother's English background influenced Stewart's early life and would later shape his music.\n\n## Music Career\n\nStewart's music career began in the early 1960s, when he worked in a North Finchley funeral parlour and as a fence erector and sign writer. In 1961, he went to Denmark Street with The Raiders and got a singing audition with well-known record producer Joe Meek. Although Meek stopped the session abruptly, Stewart continued to develop his musical style, listening to British and American topical folk artists such as Ewan MacColl, Alex Campbell, Woody Guthrie, and Derroll Adams.\n\n### 1961-1963: Early Work and The Dimensions\n\nStewart's early work included singing with The Dimensions, a group he formed in 1962. The band released several singles, but they failed to achieve significant commercial success. Despite this, Stewart continued to develop his skills as a singer and songwriter, and he began to draw attention from other musicians and industry professionals.\n\n### 1964-1967: Steampacket and \"Rod the Mod\" Image\n\nIn 1964, Stewart met Long John Baldry, who invited him to join his band, Long John Baldry and the All Stars. Stewart's performance with the group caught the attention of Melody Maker magazine, and he became known as \"Rod the Mod\" Stewart due to his dandyish style of grooming and dress. With Baldry, Stewart embarked on a simultaneous solo career, recording demo tracks and performing on regional television shows.\n\n### 1967-1969: Jeff Beck Group Period\n\nIn 1967, guitarist Jeff Beck recruited Stewart for his new post-Yardbirds venture, the Jeff Beck Group. Stewart joined the group as vocalist and sometime songwriter and played with Ronnie Wood, who would later become a longtime collaborator. During this period, the group experienced frequent changes of drummers and conflicts involving their manager, Mickie Most.\n\n### 1969-1975: Solo Career Established and Faces Albums\n\nIn 1968, Stewart signed a solo contract with Mercury Records, and his debut album, An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down, was released in 1969. However, contractual complexities delayed Stewart's recording for the label until 1969. In May 1969, Steve Marriott left The Small Faces, and Ron Wood replaced him as guitarist. Stewart followed Wood to the band and joined the remaining members, Ronnie Lane, Ian McLagan, and Kenney Jones, to form Faces.\n\n## 1975-1988: Height of Fame and Critical Reaction\n\nIn 1975, Stewart moved to Los Angeles and released the Atlantic Crossing album, which marked a return to form and a return to the Top 10 of the Billboard album charts.

when Baldry discovered Stewart was a singer as well, he offered him a job for £35 a week, after securing the approval of Stewart's mother [54] Quitting his day job at the age of nineteen, Stewart gradually overcame his shyness and nerves and became a visible enough part of the act that he was sometimes added to the billing as \"Rod the Mod\" Stewart, [42] [54] [55] the nickname coming from his dandyish style of grooming and dress [38] Baldry touted Stewart's abilities to Melody Maker magazine and the group enjoyed a weekly residence at London's fabled Marquee Club [55] In June 1964, Stewart made his recording début (without label credit) on \"Up Above My Head\", the B-side to a Baldry and Hoochie Coochie Men single [57] While still with Baldry, Stewart embarked on a simultaneous solo career [58] He made some demo recordings, [nb 5] was scouted by Decca Records at the Marquee Club, and signed to a solo contract in August 1964 [59] He appeared on several regional television shows around the country and recorded his first single in September 1964 [58] [59]\n\n\n1967–1969: Jeff Beck Group period\nGuitarist Jeff Beck recruited Stewart for his new post-Yardbirds venture, [69] and in February 1967, Stewart joined the Jeff Beck Group as vocalist and sometime songwriter [70] This would become the big break of his early career [38] There he first played with Ronnie Wood [64] whom he had first met in a London pub in 1964; [59] the two soon became fast friends [69] During its first year, the group experienced frequent changes of drummers and conflicts involving manager Mickie Most wanting to reduce Stewart's role They toured the UK and released a couple of singles that featured Stewart on their B-sides [70] [71] Stewart's sputtering solo career also continued with the March 1968 release of non-hit \"Little Miss Understood\" on Immediate Records [70]\n\n\n1969–1975: Solo career established and Faces albums\nMercury Records A&R man Lou Reizner had seen Stewart perform with Beck, and on 8 October 1968 signed him to a solo contract; [70] but contractual complexities delayed Stewart's recording for him until July 1969 [76] [80] Meanwhile, in May 1969, guitarist and singer Steve Marriott left English band The Small Faces [76] Ron Wood replaced him as guitarist in June and on 18 October 1969, Stewart followed his friend and became the band's new singer [76] The two joined existing members Ronnie Lane, Ian McLagan, and Kenney Jones, who soon decided to call the new line-up Faces [81]\n\n\n1975–1988: Height of fame and critical reaction\nIn 1975, Stewart moved to Los Angeles; that year, he released the Atlantic Crossing album for his new record company, using producer Tom Dowd and a different sound based on the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section Atlantic Crossing marked both a return to form and a return to the Top 10 of the Billboard album charts The first single, a cover of the Sutherland Brothers song \"Sailing\", was a number-one hit in the UK, charted high in other European countries and in Australia, but only reached the Top 60 of the US and Canadian charts The single returned to the UK Top 10 a year later when used as the theme music for a BBC documentary series about HMS Ark Royal Having been a hit twice over, \"Sailing\" became, and remains, Stewart's biggest-selling single in the UK His Holland-Dozier-Holland cover \"This Old Heart of Mine\" was also a Top 100 hit in 1976 [84] In 1976, Stewart covered The Beatles' song \"Get Back\" for the musical documentary All This and World War II [91]\n\n\n1988–1994: Out of Order Tour, Vagabond Heart and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\nIn 1988, Stewart returned with Out of Order, produced by Duran Duran's Andy Taylor and by Bernard Edwards of Chic \"Lost in You\", \"Forever Young\", \"Crazy About Her\", and \"My Heart Can't Tell You No\" from that album were all top 15 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and mainstream rock charts, with the latter even reaching the Top Five \"Forever Young\" was an unconscious revision of Bob Dylan's song of the same name; the artists reached an agreement about sharing royalties The song reached No 12 in the US [84] In September 1988, Stewart performed \"Forever Young\" at the 1988 MTV Video Music Awards at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, and in 1989 he received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for the song [97]\n\n\n1995–2001: New ventures and record labels\nBy the early 1990s, Stewart had mostly abandoned creating his own material, saying that he was not a natural songwriter and that the tepid response to his recent efforts was not rewarding [100] In 1995, Stewart released A Spanner in the Works containing a single written by Tom Petty, \"Leave Virginia Alone\", which reached the Top 10 of the adult contemporary charts The latter half of the 1990s was not as commercially successful though the 1996 album If We Fall in Love Tonight reached number 8 in the UK and went gold and hit No 19 on the Billboard album chart [84]\n\n\n2002–2010: The Great American Songbook series and Soulbook\nIn June 2002, Stewart performed \"Handbags and Gladrags\" at the Party at the Palace held at Buckingham Palace Garden, a concert which celebrated the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II and featured stars from five decades of music [102]\n\n\n2011–2012: Christmas album and autobiography\nIn 2011, Stewart performed with Stevie Nicks on their Heart & Soul Tour Starting on 20 March in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the tour visited arena concerts in North America – with performances in New York, Toronto, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, Tampa and Montreal, among others [114]\n\n\n2013–2015: Return to songwriting – Time and Another Country\nIn May 2013, Stewart released Time, a rock album of his own original material It marked a return to songwriting after what Stewart termed \"a dark period of twenty years\"; he said that writing his autobiography gave him the impetus to write music again [46] The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 1, setting a new British record for the longest gap between chart-topping albums by an artist [129] Stewart's last No 1 on the chart had been Greatest Hits Volume 1 in 1979 and his last studio album to top the chart was 1976's A Night on the Town [130]\n\n\n2016–present: Continuing to record – Blood Red Roses and The Tears of Hercules\nStewart recorded vocals with Joe Walsh on the Frankie Miller album Frankie Miller's Double Take, which was released on 30 September 2016 [133] [better source needed] He sang his cover of the Beatles' \"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" as Sgt Pepper for Beat Bugs episode 17b, which debuted 18 November 2016 on Netflix [134] At the same, Stewart was quoted responding to John Lennon's 1980 assertion that Stewart's hit \"The Killing of Georgie (Part 1 and 2)\" plagiarised his song \"Don't Let Me Down\", declaring to The Guardian: \"It does sound like it,  [...] Nothing wrong with a good steal!\" [135] [136] [137]\n\n\nPersonal life\nIn May 2000, Stewart was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, for which he underwent surgery the same month It had been previously reported he suffered from a benign vocal cord nodule [154] Besides being a major health scare, the resulting surgery also threatened his voice, and he had to re-learn how to sing [155] Since then he has been active in raising funds for The City of Hope Foundation charity to find cures for all forms of cancer, especially those affecting children [154] In September 2019, Stewart revealed that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2017, and was given the all-clear after treatment [156]\n\n\nRelationships and family\nStewart has eight children, by five mothers:\n\n\nAwards and recognition\nDuring his career, Rod Stewart has been a member of a number of groups including:\n\n\nList of bands\nDuring his career, Rod Stewart has been a member of a number of groups including:\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nStudio albums\n\n\nTours\n\n\nResidency show\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

the season, a 2–0 win over Stevenage at Broadhall Way [9]\n\n\n2013–14 season\nThe 2013–14 season saw Alli break into the MK Dons first team on a regular basis He started the Dons' first league match of the season, a 0–0 draw away at Shrewsbury Town [10] In his first Football League Trophy appearance, Alli scored to help MK Dons beat Northampton Town 2–0 and thus progress to the second round of the tournament [11] On 28 September, Alli scored his first professional league goal in a 4–1 win against Stevenage [12] After injury setbacks in late 2013, Alli subsequently established himself as a first-choice player in 2014 He scored the opening goal in the 3–2 win over Shrewsbury Town at Stadium MK on 11 January, with a header from Stephen Gleeson's pinpoint pass [13]\n\n\n2014–15 season\nWith the departure of Gleeson to Birmingham City in June 2014, [16] Alli became the first-choice central midfield partner to Darren Potter He started the season brightly, playing the first league match of the season as the Dons overcame a 2–0 deficit to defeat Gillingham, 4–2 [17] He then helped the team to a 3–1 win over arch-enemies, AFC Wimbledon, in the League Cup first round [18] His first goal of the 2014–15 season came in the first away league match, a 3–2 defeat to Peterborough United, where he scored a tap-in from Will Grigg's deflected shot [19]\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\nOn 2 February 2015, Alli signed for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur in the last hours of the mid-season transfer window on a five-and-a-half-year deal for an initial fee of £5 million [26]\n\n\nLoan to Milton Keynes Dons\nFollowing his transfer to Tottenham Hotspur, Alli was immediately loaned back to MK Dons for the remainder of the 2014–15 season [26] On 19 April, he was chosen as the Young Player of the Year at the Football League Awards [27] The season ended on 3 May with Milton Keynes Dons promoted automatically to the Championship as runners-up behind Bristol City, after a 5–1 home win over relegated Yeovil Town [28]\n\n\n2015–16 season\nOn 8 August 2015, Alli made his Tottenham debut against Manchester United in the Premier League as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat away at Old Trafford, playing the last 13 minutes in place of Eric Dier [29] Two weeks later, he scored his first goal for the club after coming on for Christian Eriksen in the 1–1 draw against Leicester City [30]\n\n\n2016–17 season\nAhead of the season, Alli changed his kit name to Dele, saying that he had \"no connection\" to his legal surname due to his separation from his mother [42] His first goal of the season came in a 4–0 win against Stoke City on 10 September 2016 [43] Four days later, he made his UEFA Champions League debut in a 1–2 loss to AS Monaco at Wembley Stadium [44] His first Champions League goal came against CSKA Moscow at the same stadium on 7 December 2016 [45] Between 18 December 2016 and 21 January 2017, Alli scored eight goals in six league matches, earning the award of Premier League Player of the Month award for January 2017 This included three consecutive braces against Southampton, Watford and Chelsea [46]\n\n\n2017–18 season\nAlli scored his first goal of the season in the opening game of the 2017–18 season away at Newcastle that finished in a 2–0 win [53] However, he was criticised for his inconsistency this season, failing to perform as well as the previous season [54] [55] On 1 April 2018, Alli scored twice in the away fixture against Chelsea, helping Tottenham win 3–1, which was their first win in 28 years at Stamford Bridge [56]\n\n\n2018–19 season\nOn 11 August 2018, Alli scored his first goal of the season, scoring the winning goal in the opening league match against Newcastle United [57]\n\n\n2019–20 season\nAlli missed the start of the season due to a hamstring injury [62] He returned to the team in the North London Derby on 1 September 2019, coming on as a substitute [63] He scored his first goal of the season in the match against Watford, drawing 1–1 [64] In November 2019, Mauricio Pochettino was dismissed by the club to be replaced by José Mourinho Mourinho played Alli as an attacking player just behind Harry Kane, reverting to his earlier position after playing in a deeper midfield role the previous two years According to Mourinho, \"Dele is not a midfield player\" [65] [66] The attacking role gave Alli greater freedom to score, and he scored three goals in his first three games under Mourinho, two of which came in the game against Bournemouth [67]\n\n\n2020–21 season\nIn the first half of 2020–21 season, Alli was reportedly out of favour with Mourinho, making few starts in games [71] [72] [73] Most of his starts in games were in the UEFA Europa League, and he scored his first goal of the season in the Europa League play-off match against Maccabi Haifa on 1 October 2020 to cap a 7–2 win for Tottenham [74] In the Europa last-32 match against Wolfsberg on 24 February 2021, he scored a notable goal with a bicycle kick, starting a 4–0 rout with two further assists [75] [76] He made his first start in six months in the Premier League on 4 March, in the match against Fulham that ended in a 1–0 win when his shot at goal was deflected off a defender for an own-goal [77] He started seven Premier League games this season [78]\n\n\n2021–22 season\nOn 22 August 2021, Alli scored his first goal of the season, scoring the only goal in a 1–0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers This was Alli's first Premier League goal since March 2020 [79] He continued to struggle to regain his form Manager Nuno Espírito Santo tried to bring him back into the squad, [80] which proved short-lived as Nuno was replaced by Antonio Conte in early November Dele failed to find a role under the new manager, [81] and became a fringe player in Conte's plan for Tottenham [82] After starting only eight league games (two under Conte) in the 2021–22 campaign, Alli was made available for transfer by Tottenham in the January 2022 window [78]\n\n\nEverton\nAlli moved to fellow Premier League side Everton on 31 January 2022 on an initial free transfer, [83] which could rise to £40 million if certain performance benchmarks are met The first £10 million would be due after 20 appearances for Everton [84] He signed a two-and-a-half-year contract, running until the end of the 2023–24 season Upon signing for the club, Alli cited the opportunity to work under new manager Frank Lampard as a major reason for joining Everton [85] He made his debut on 8 February as a late substitute in a 3–1 loss against Newcastle United [86] He failed to make an impact at Everton, making 11 appearances and only 1 start in the 2021–22 season, and two further appearances in the 2022–23 season He did not score or register an assist in 13 games [87]\n\n\nLoan to Beşiktaş\nOn 25 August 2022, Alli joined Turkish team Beşiktaş on loan for the remainder of the 2022–23 season with an option to buy for the Turkish club [88] He scored his first goal in over a year in his second appearance for the club, helping the club win 3–2 against Ankaragücü on 4 September 2022 [89] [90] When Şenol Güneş took over as new head coach on 28 October, he stated that Alli was \"below expectations in terms of efficiency,\" pointing to his struggles for Beşiktaş [91] Alli did not play any games for Beşiktaş after 26 February 2023, and with only two goals scored in 13 games playing for the team, he returned to Everton in April for an assessment of a hip injury he picked up, while Beşiktaş sought to cancel his season-long loan [92] [93]\n\n\nReturn to Everton from loan\nBy April 2024, Alli had not played for Everton in the 2023–24 season after sustaining a groin injury at the end of

"en", "article": "**Dele Alli**\n\nDele Alli is an English professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder or striker for Premier League club Everton and the England national team.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDele Alli is a talented and versatile footballer who has made a significant impact in the English Premier League. Born in Milton Keynes, England, Alli rose through the ranks of the Milton Keynes Dons youth academy before making his professional debut at the age of 16. He quickly established himself as one of the best young players in the league, earning a transfer to Tottenham Hotspur in 2015. Alli's impressive performances for Tottenham earned him a call-up to the England national team, where he has represented the country at various youth levels and the senior team.\n\n**Club Career**\n\n**Milton Keynes Dons**\n\nAlli joined the youth system at Milton Keynes Dons when he was 11 years old after playing for City Colts. He made his debut for the first team as a sixteen-year-old on 2 November 2012, coming on as a 64th-minute substitute for Jay O'Shea in a 0–0 draw with Southern Football League club Cambridge City in the FA Cup first round at Milton Road. His first touch in professional football was a back-heeled pass. His first goal came in the replay against Cambridge eleven days later, where he scored in a 6–1 win at Stadium MK on his first start.\n\nAlli made his league debut in a 2–3 defeat to Coventry City at home on 29 December, where he played 71 minutes before being replaced by Zeli Ismail. His only other league appearance in the 2012–13 Football League One season came as a second-half substitute for Patrick Bamford in the last match of the season, a 2–0 win over Stevenage at Broadhall Way.\n\n**Tottenham Hotspur**\n\nOn 2 February 2015, Alli signed for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur in the last hours of the mid-season transfer window on a five-and-a-half-year deal for an initial fee of £5 million.\n\n**Loan to Milton Keynes Dons**\n\nFollowing his transfer to Tottenham Hotspur, Alli was immediately loaned back to MK Dons for the remainder of the 2014–15 season. On 19 April, he was chosen as the Young Player of the Year at the Football League Awards. The season ended on 3 May with Milton Keynes Dons promoted automatically to the Championship as runners-up behind Bristol City, after a 5–1 home win over relegated Yeovil Town.\n\n**2015–16 season**\n\nOn 8 August 2015, Alli made his Tottenham debut against Manchester United in the Premier League as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat away at Old Trafford, playing the last 13 minutes in place of Eric Dier. Two weeks later, he scored his first goal for the club after coming on for Christian Eriksen in the 1–1 draw against Leicester City.\n\n**2016–17 season**\n\nAhead of the season, Alli changed his kit name to Dele, saying that he had \"no connection\" to his legal surname due to his separation from his mother. His first goal of the season came in a 4–0 win against Stoke City on 10 September 2016. Four days later, he made his UEFA Champions League debut in a 1–2 loss to AS Monaco at Wembley Stadium. His first Champions League goal came against CSKA Moscow at the same stadium on 7 December 2016.\n\nBetween 18 December 2016 and 21 January 2017, Alli scored eight goals in six league matches, earning the award of Premier League Player of the Month award for January 2017. This included three consecutive braces against Southampton, Watford and Chelsea.\n\n**2017–18 season**\n\nAlli scored his first goal of the season in the opening game of the 2017–18 season away at Newcastle that finished in a 2–0 win. However, he was criticised for his inconsistency this season, failing to perform as well as the previous season. On 1 April 2018, Alli scored twice in the away fixture against Chelsea, helping Tottenham win 3–1, which was their first win in 28 years at Stamford Bridge.\n\n**2018–19 season**\n\nOn 11 August 2018, Alli scored his first goal of the season, scoring the winning goal in the opening league match against Newcastle United.\n\n**2019–20 season**\n\nAlli missed the start of the season due to a hamstring injury. He returned to the team in the North London Derby on 1 September 2019, coming on as a substitute. He scored his first goal of the season in the match against Watford, drawing 1–1. In November 2019, Mauricio Pochettino was dismissed by the club to be replaced by José Mourinho. Mourinho played Alli as an attacking player just behind Harry Kane, reverting to his earlier position after playing in a deeper midfield role the previous two years. According to Mourinho, \"Dele is not a midfield player.\"\n\n**2020–21 season**\n\nIn the first half of 2020–21 season, Alli was reportedly out of favour with Mourinho, making few starts in games. Most of his starts in games were in the UEFA Europa League, and he scored his first goal of the season in the Europa League play-off match against Maccabi Haifa on 1 October 2020 to cap a 7–2 win for Tottenham. In the Europa last-32 match against Wolfsberg on 24 February 2021, he scored a notable goal with a bicycle kick, starting a 4–0 rout with two further assists.\n\n**2021–22 season**\n\nOn 22 August 2021, Alli scored his first goal of the season, scoring the only goal in a 1–0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. He continued to struggle to regain his form. Manager Nuno Espírito Santo tried to bring him back into the squad, which proved short-lived as Nuno was replaced by Antonio Conte in early November. Dele failed to find a role under the new manager, and became a fringe player in Conte's plan for Tottenham. After starting only eight league games (two under Conte) in the 2021–22 campaign, Alli was made available for transfer by Tottenham in the January 2022 window.\n\n**Everton**\n\nAlli moved to fellow Premier League side Everton on 31 January 2022 on an initial free transfer, which could rise to £40 million if certain performance benchmarks are met. The first £10 million would be due after 20 appearances for Everton. He signed a two-and-a-half-year contract, running until the end of the 2023–24 season. Upon signing for the club, Alli cited the opportunity to work under new manager Frank Lampard as a major reason for joining Everton.\n\n**Loan to Beşiktaş**\n\nOn 25 August 2022, Alli joined Turkish team Beşiktaş on loan for the remainder of the 2022–23 season with an option to buy for the Turkish club. He scored his first goal in over a year in his second appearance for the club, helping the club win 3–2 against Ankaragücü on 4 September 2022.\n\n**Return to Everton from loan**\n\nBy April 2024, Alli had not played for Everton in the 2023–24 season after sustaining a groin injury at the end of 2023.\n\n**International career**\n\nAlli has made several appearances at U17 and U18 levels for England. On 27 August 2014, Alli was called up to the England U19 squad following an impressive start to the campaign. He made his debut for England U19 in the 1–1 draw against Germany U19.

received bookings for simulation [116] [117] [118] [119] [120]\n\n\nStyle of play\nEarly in his career, Alli was widely considered one of the best young midfielders of his generation, [109] [110] [111] and won PFA Young Player of the Year two years running [112] He was praised for his all-round skillset and his goalscoring prowess, particularly when playing as a second striker [113] Alli's

widely accused of diving, and has received bookings for simulation [116] [117] [118] [119] [120]\n\n\nPerceived decline in form\nIn 2018, Alli was considered the world's most expensive midfielder from a transfer value perspective by the CIES [121] However, Alli's form faded in subsequent seasons, resulting in him losing his place in the England team in 2019 and becoming a fringe player for Spurs in the following years [122] In 2022, after Alli was loaned to Beşiktaş from Everton, Phil McNulty described his career trajectory as a \"dramatic decline.. from the golden boy of English football to lost talent\" [123]\n\n\nPersonal life\nAlli was born in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, [124] to a Yoruba Nigerian father, Kehinde, [125] and an English mother, Denise Kehinde moved to the United

He was a prominent figure in the courts of Normandy and was involved in several high-profile cases, including a dramatic trial by combat that has become a legendary episode in French history.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nJacques le Gris was born in the 1330s, the son of Guillaume le Gris, a minor Norman squire. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Le Gris received an education and took minor orders as a cleric in the church. He was able to read sufficiently well to officiate at mass, a rare skill for a man of his social class. Le Gris followed in his father's footsteps and became a man-at-arms, serving in the entourage of Robert d'Alençon, a powerful nobleman. He also participated in several military campaigns in Normandy, where he distinguished himself as a skilled and courageous warrior.\n\n**Legal Difficulties**\n\nIn 1381, Le Gris became embroiled in a bitter dispute over the ownership of th", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Jacques_Le_Gris\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nJacques le Gris was born in the 1330s, the son of Guillaume le Gris, a minor Norman squire Unusual for the time, he was educated, taking minor orders as a cleric in the church, and able to read sufficiently well to officiate at mass [4] Like his father, Le Gris was first a man-at-arms, and then a squire, in the service of the Count of Perche, a role at which he excelled He also participated in several minor military campaigns in Normandy, in the entourage of Robert d'Alençon [5]\n\n\nLegal difficulties\nIn 1381, Le Gris and Carrouges engaged in a public argument over the domain of Aunou-le-Faucon Carrouges had returned from the wars with a new bride, Marguerite de Thibouville, daughter of a controversial Norman squire who, until recently, had owned Aunou Although the lands had been legally bought by Count Pierre in 1377 for 8,000 livres, Carrouges wanted them back as part of his dowry and took Count Pierre to court to return them [8] Pierre was forced to visit his cousin, the King, to obtain royal approval for his purchase and consequently was furious with Carrouges The eventual result was that Carrouges was isolated from the court and subjected to three years of legal struggles over land with Count Pierre, who denied him the purchase or inheritance of several estates Le Gris was heavily involved in these legal disputes both as the Seigneur of Aunou-le-Faucon and as an adviser to the count He thus became a target of Carrouges, who accused Le Gris of orchestrating the lawsuits against him [9]\n\n\nOn trial for rape\nSome weeks after their encounter, word reached Le Gris of accusations being made against him by Carrouges and his wife [12] Carrouges claimed that on 18 January 1386, whilst Carrouges was still in Paris, Le Gris had entered the chateau of Carrouges' mother Nicole and raped Marguerite [13] According to Marguerite de Carrouges' testimony, a squire in Le Gris' employ named Adam Louvel had knocked on the door of the chateau and demanded entry All the servants were attending to Dame Nicole de Carrouges, who was visiting a neighbouring town on legal business, and so Marguerite was alone when Louvel called Once inside, Louvel gave Marguerite a message that Le Gris was outside and desired to see her because he was passionately in love with her [6] Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris broke into the house and proposed sexual intercourse with her, offering money in exchange When Marguerite refused, Le Gris forcibly raped her on the bed in her chamber with the help of Louvel As Le Gris departed, he threatened her with violence if she told of the encounter [13]\n\n\nJudicial duel\nFaced with such conflicting accounts and unable to reach a conclusion, the Parlement announced on 15 September that the two men would fight to the death on 27 November 1386 to decide guilt in the case If Carrouges lost, then Marguerite would be burnt at the stake for perjury [13] King Charles VI, who was on campaign with his court in Flanders, ordered the duel to be postponed until 29 December as he did not want to miss what was rapidly becoming the event of the season [13]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn the centuries since Le Gris' death, the case has become an important cultural legend in France [15] The duel was one of the last trials by combat ever permitted by the Parlement de Paris or the French Kings and the guilt or innocence of its participants has been a source of great debate among historians and jurists [12] The contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart harbours no question over the guilt of Le Gris, whom he considers a villain [13] Later writers take a different view, including the Grandes Chroniques de France and the works of Jehan de Waurin, who repeat with varying details an unverifiable tale of an unnamed culprit admitting his guilt after being condemned to death for an unidentified crime [6] During the Enlightenment, the duel was revisited by Boucher d'Argis, who repeated this story of the anonymous criminal's confession in Diderot's Encyclopédie, and by Voltaire in his Histoire du Parlement de Paris An imaginative version of the legend was repeated in the Encyclopædia Britannica until the 1970s [33]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Canada's commitment to peacekeeping has been shaped by its values of multilateralism, international cooperation, and a desire to promote peace and stability globally.\n\n**Foreign Relations Context**\n\nCanada's foreign policy of peacekeeping, peace enforcement, peacemaking, and peacebuilding has been intertwined with its tendency to pursue multilateral and international solutions since the end of World War II. Canada's central role in the development of peacekeeping in the mid-1950s gave it credibility and established it as a country fighting for the \"common good\" of all nations. Canada has since been engaged with the United Nations, NATO, and the European Union (EU) in promoting its middle power status into an active role in world affairs.\n\n**History**\n\nLester B. Pearson, the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs, had become a very prominent figure in the United Nations during its infancy and found himself in a peculiar position in 1956 during the Suez Crisis. Pearson and Canada found themselves mediating a conflict involving their closest allies when the United States opposed the British, French, and Israeli invasion of Egypt. During United Nations meetings, Pearson proposed to the security council that a United Nations police force be established to prevent further conflict in the region, allowing the countries involved an opportunity to sort out a resolution. Pearson's proposal would intercede and divide the combatants, and form a buffer zone or 'human shield' between the opposing forces, offering to dedicate 1,000 Canadian soldiers to that cause was seen as a brilliant political move that prevented another war.\n\n**Inception of Modern Peacekeeping**\n\nLester B. Pearson's proposal for a United Nations police force marked the inception of modern peacekeeping. The proposal was adopted by the United Nations Security Council in November 1956, and the first United Nations peacekeeping mission, the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF), was established to monitor the ceasefire between Egypt and Israel. The success of UNEF paved the way for future peacekeeping missions, and Canada continued to play a leading role in the development of peacekeeping doctrine and practice.\n\n**Peacekeeping Efforts**\n\nCanada participated in every UN peacekeeping effort from its inception until 1989. Prior to the creation of the formal UN peacekeeping system, Canada had engaged in UN intervention operations, notably the 1948 mission in the second Kashmir conflict. Since 1953, Canada has been involved in the first international unified command (UNCMAC) in support of the ongoing armistice between North and South Korea, and played a central role in the International Control Commission (ICC), which tried to broker peace in Vietnam beginning in 1954.\n\n**Personnel Contributions**\n\nCanada provided the most amount of UN peacekeepers during the Cold War with approximately 80,000 personnel – equivalent to 10 percent of total UN forces. In all, more than 125,000 Canadian men and women military personnel, civilians, diplomats – including over 4,000 Canadian police officers – have served in peacekeeping operations. Approximately 130 Canadians have died in service of peacekeeping operations, with 123 of these deaths occurring during UN missions.\n\n**Peacekeeping Assessment**\n\nAssessments of peacekeeping operations deemed they are generally successful, usually resulting in long-term peace. The post-Cold War era has seen the concept and practice of peacekeeping evolve significantly. Traditionally focused on ceasefire monitoring and maintaining stability in conflict zones, peacekeeping missions evolved to have a wider range of activities including; peace enforcement, protecting civilians, promoting human rights, and supporting political processes in post-conflict societies.\n\n**Military Reallocation in the 21st Century**\n\nA period of reassessment took place in late 1990s within the Canadian military and the United Nations after the Somalia and Rwanda missions. This led to the UN Security Council reducing the number of new operations, and thus a significant decline in Canadian direct participation in UN peacekeeping efforts. Canada began redeploying its military efforts to multilateral UN-sanctioned operations through NATO, rather than directly to the UN by the turn of the century.\n\n**Financing**\n\nThe unpredictability of peacekeeping operations makes forecasting costs a challenging task for policymakers and budget planners. Canada has always fulfilled its financial commitment to the UN by paying its dues \"in full, on time and without conditions\" unlike other nations. In 2022, Canada was the eighth-largest UN peace operations financial contributor with approximately $198.8 million for ongoing missions worldwide. Canada in total allocated $2.49 billion to multiple UN organizations including those related to peacekeeping, policing, research, training, climate change, and humanitarian efforts such as medicine and food distribution.\n\n**Recognition**\n\nThe Somalia Medal, a campaign medal created in 1992 to recognize Canadian military personnel who participated in the international military coalition invasion to stabilize Somalia, has been awarded to 1,422 individuals. In 1992, Reconciliation: The Peacekeeping Monument was completed, commemorating Canada's role in international peacekeeping and the soldiers and police officers who have participated and are currently participating, both living and dead. The 1995 Canadian one-dollar coin displays the Peacekeeping Monument. This commemoration was followed by the 2001 $10 Canadian banknote named \"remembrance and peacekeeping\" that depicts a female peacekeeper.\n\n**List of UN Missions**\n\nBelow is a list of high-profile UN peacekeeping missions undertaken by Canada from 1947 to present, with Canadian operational names listed when assigned.\n\n* United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) (1956-1967)\n* United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC) (1960-1964)\n* United Nations India-Pakistan Observation Mission (UNIPOM) (1965-1966)\n* United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) (1964-present)\n* United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) (1978-present)\n* United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) (1989-1990)\n* United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM) (1988-1997)\n* United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) (1991-1995)\n* United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) (1998-1999)\n* United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) (1999-2005)\n* United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) (2003-2018)\n* United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) (2004-2017)\n* United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) (1999-present)\n\nSee also:\n\n* Canadian Forces\n* Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade\n* Lester B.

The province is known for its rugged terrain, with the Panjshir River flowing through it. The population of the province is approximately 173,000 people, as of 2021.\n\n**History**\n\nThe territory that is now Panjshir Province has a long and complex history. In the early 16th century, the region was ruled by the Khanate of Bukhara. The Parwan region, which includes the later Panjshir, was conquered by Ahmad Shah Durrani in the mid-18th century. The Durrani Empire officially accepted the region as a part of their empire after a treaty of friendship was signed with Murad Beg of Bukhara in or about 1750. The rule of the Durranis was followed by that of the Barakzai dynasty.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the region became part of the Emirate of Afghanistan. The First Anglo-Afghan War saw British incursions into the region, but the Panjshir Valley remained largely unaffected. The region saw some fighting during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, but the British were ultimately forced to withdraw.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the Panjshir Valley became a stronghold of the anti-British and anti-Kabul resistance. The valley was the site of numerous battles and skirmishes between the resistance fighters and the British-backed government of Afghanistan. After the withdrawal of British forces, the Panjshir Valley continued to be a center of resistance against the communist government of Afghanistan.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Panjshir Valley became a key battleground in the Soviet-Afghan War. The valley was the site of numerous battles and skirmishes between the mujahideen resistance fighters and the Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan. The valley was also the site of numerous human rights abuses, including the forced relocation of villagers and the use of torture and other forms of mistreatment.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of Soviet forces, the Panjshir Valley continued to be a center of resistance against the communist government of Afghanistan. The valley was the site of numerous battles and skirmishes between the mujahideen resistance fighters and the government forces.\n\n**Healthcare**\n\nThe Panjshir Province has made significant progress in improving access to clean drinking water in recent years. According to data from 2005 and 2011, the percentage of households with clean drinking water increased from 16% to 17%. This is a significant improvement, but there is still much work to be done to ensure that all households in the province have access to clean drinking water.\n\nThe province has also made progress in improving access to healthcare. However, the overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) fell from 33% in 2005 to 32% in 2011. This is a concern, as a lack of education can make it difficult for people to access and understand healthcare information.\n\nThe province has a number of healthcare facilities, including a district hospital and several smaller clinics. However, the healthcare system in the province is still underdeveloped, and many people in rural areas have limited access to healthcare services.\n\n**Education**\n\nThe Panjshir Province has a number of educational institutions, including four Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) schools. The Ahmad Shah Massoud TVET school is one of the largest and most well-known schools in the province. The school was established with the help of the Hilfe Paderborn and German Foreign Office, and as of 2014 had about 250 students and 22 staff members.\n\nDespite the presence of these educational institutions, the province still faces significant challenges in terms of education. The overall net enrolment rate (6–13 years of age) fell from 42% in 2005 to 40% in 2011. This is a concern, as a lack of education can make it difficult for people to access and understand healthcare information, as well as to participate fully in society.\n\nThe province also faces challenges in terms of teacher training and retention. Many teachers in the province leave their positions after a short period of time, which can disrupt the education of students and make it difficult for schools to maintain a stable teaching staff.\n\n**Demography**\n\nAs of 2021, the total population of the Panjshir Province is approximately 173,000. The population of the province is diverse, with a number of different ethnic and linguistic groups represented.\n\nThe province is predominantly rural, with many people living in small villages and towns.

engines would continue to be provided by Ferrari [24] [25]\n\n\n2016 season\nRomain Grosjean and Esteban Gutiérrez drove for the team in 2016 [26] [27] In the team's debut at the opening Australian Grand Prix, Grosjean finished 6th, scoring eight points for the team, which became the first American constructor to win points in its first F1 race [28] At the same race, Gutiérrez crashed out in an incident which destroyed former world champion Fernando Alonso's McLaren and caused the race to be temporarily red-flagged [29] Another impressive race followed in Bahrain, where Grosjean finished 5th However, for the rest of the season, the team fell off the pace, only scoring points on three more occasions Grosjean picked up all 29 points en route to 8th in the Constructors' Championship.\n\n\n2017 season\nKevin Magnussen drove alongside Grosjean in 2017, replacing Gutiérrez [30] In the first race of the season, the team scored its best-ever qualifying effort with

[35]\n\n\n2018 season\nIn February 2018, Haas unveiled their new car, the VF-18, although some competitors called for an investigation due to its resemblance to the previous year's Ferrari, the SF70H [22] [37] Following a strong showing during winter testing, Haas again had a competitive weekend in Australia, scoring the team's best-ever starting grid positions with Magnussen starting 5th and Grosjean 6th, respectively [38] During the race, they were running in 4th, and 5th positions which would have given them their best result and half of their 2017 points tally, but both cars retired one lap after their respective pit stops They would eventually match this 4th and 5th-place result in Austria, surpassing their 2017 points total after only nine races At the Singapore Grand Prix, Magnussen scored Haas' first-ever fastest lap [39] 2018 was their best season to date, finishing fifth in the Constructors' Championship, one point short of doubling their previous year's performance.\n\n\n2019 season\nThe team took on Rich Energy as a title sponsor for 2019 This was part of the activation of a multi-year title sponsorship deal with Rich Energy, a British energy drink company that was previously linked to purchasing Force India [40] The team also retained their 2018 driver line up for 2019 consisting of Grosjean and Magnussen for the third consecutive year [41]

Haas at the end of the 2020 Championship [50] They were replaced by Russian Nikita Mazepin, [51] and 2020 Formula 2 Championship winner Mick Schumacher, [52] son of seven-time Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher To survive financially, the team opted to halt the development of the 2021 car, instead focusing resources on the 2022 car They also secured Uralkali, a Russian potash fertilizer producer, of which Mazepin's father Dmitry is a key shareholder, as the title sponsor for the team Uralkali's sponsorship resulted in a livery containing the colors of the Russian flag Steiner denied this was to circumvent a World Anti-Doping Agency ban on the use of the Russian flag and anthem following a state-sponsored doping scandal in the country [8] [53] [54] During the first race, Mazepin spun out on the first lap, while Schumacher finished 16th in his debut, the last of all running cars In the season's final race, Mazepin tested positive for coronavirus and was ruled out of the race Haas would only field one driver, rather than replace Mazepin with reserve driver Pietro Fittipaldi, as he had not fulfilled the requirement of having competed in a practice session for the team.\n\n\n2022 season\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Haas removed the branding of Russian sponsor Uralkali from its cars and the colors of the Russian flag On March 5, the team

The constructor was applauded for pioneering a low-cost model that would allow new teams to enter the sport and be competitive, which had been of concern to the sport for some years. Conversely, Haas's approach was criticized by smaller, privateer teams who had invested in their own infrastructure and expressed concerns about the close relationship between manufacturers and satellite constructors handing more political power to the sport's larger constructors.\n\n**Ferrari**\n\nHaas's partnership with Ferrari is one of the most significant in Formula One, with the team relying heavily on Ferrari's technical expertise and resources. The partnership has been highly successful, with Haas's cars regularly finishing in the points and the team finishing fifth in the constructors' championship in 2018.\n\n**Toyota**\n\nIn October 2024, Haas announced a technical partnership with Toyota, which would see the team integrate the services of Toyota Gazoo Racing. However, engines would continue to be provided by Ferrari.\n\n**2016 season**\n\nRomain Grosjean and Esteban Gutiérrez drove for the team in 2016. In the team's debut at the opening Australian Grand Prix, Grosjean finished 6th, scoring eight points for the team, which became the first American constructor to win points in its first F1 race. At the same race, Gutiérrez crashed out in an incident which destroyed former world champion Fernando Alonso's McLaren and caused the race to be temporarily red-flagged. Another impressive race followed in Bahrain, where Grosjean finished 5th. However, for the rest of the season, the team fell off the pace, only scoring points on three more occasions Grosjean picked up all 29 points en route to 8th in the Constructors' Championship.\n\n**2017 season**\n\nKevin Magnussen drove alongside Grosjean in 2017, replacing Gutiérrez. In the first race of the season, the team scored its best-ever qualifying effort with Grosjean piloting the VF-17 to 6th place. However, in the race, both cars were forced to retire with mechanical failures. The second race weekend proved better for the team with Magnussen finishing 8th, scoring his first points since his 10th-place finish in the 2016 Singapore Grand Prix, and Haas's first points since the 2016 United States Grand Prix, where Grosjean finished 10th.\n\n**2018 season**\n\nIn February 2018, Haas unveiled their new car, the VF-18, although some competitors called for an investigation due to its resemblance to the previous year's Ferrari, the SF70H. Following a strong showing during winter testing, Haas again had a competitive weekend in Australia, scoring the team's best-ever starting grid positions with Magnussen starting 5th and Grosjean 6th, respectively. During the race, they were running in 4th, and 5th positions which would have given them their best result and half of their 2017 points tally, but both cars retired one lap after their respective pit stops. They would eventually match this 4th and 5th-place result in Austria, surpassing their 2017 points total after only nine races. At the Singapore Grand Prix, Magnussen scored Haas' first-ever fastest lap. 2018 was their best season to date, finishing fifth in the Constructors' Championship, one point short of doubling their previous year's performance.\n\n**2019 season**\n\nThe team took on Rich Energy as a title sponsor for 2019. This was part of the activation of a multi-year title sponsorship deal with Rich Energy, a British energy drink company that was previously linked to purchasing Force India. The team also retained their 2018 driver lineup for 2019 consisting of Grosjean and Magnussen for the third consecutive year. Haas' challenger for the 2019 season was the VF-19.\n\n**2020 season**\n\nHaas kept an unchanged lineup of Grosjean and Magnussen for the 2020 season.\n\n**2021 season**\n\nGrosjean and Magnussen left Haas at the end of the 2020 Championship. They were replaced by Russian Nikita Mazepin, and 2020 Formula 2 Championship winner Mick Schumacher, son of seven-time Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher. To survive financially, the team opted to halt the development of the 2021 car, instead focusing resources on the 2022 car. They also secured Uralkali, a Russian potash fertilizer producer, of which Mazepin's father Dmitry is a key shareholder, as the title sponsor for the team. Uralkali's sponsorship resulted in a livery containing the colors of the Russian flag. Steiner denied this was to circumvent a World Anti-Doping Agency ban on the use of the Russian flag and anthem following a state-sponsored doping scandal in the country.\n\n**2022 season**\n\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Haas removed the branding of Russian sponsor Uralkali from its cars and the colors of the Russian flag. On March 5, the team announced it had terminated its title sponsorship deal with Uralkali and its driver contract with Mazepin. Kevin Magnussen, who previously drove for the team from 2017 to 2020, was announced as his replacement.\n\n**2023 season**\n\nHaas signed a title sponsorship deal with MoneyGram for the 2023 season onwards.\n\n**2024 season**\n\nIn August 2023, Haas announced that the 2023 driver lineup of Hülkenberg and Magnussen will be retained for the 2024 season. On January 10, team principal Guenther Steiner's contract was not renewed, with the position being filled by engineer Ayao Komatsu. Technical director Simone Resta also departed. As a result of Alfa Romeo leaving Sauber due to its transition to Audi Sport from 2026, Haas is officially assumed as Ferrari's new satellite team.\n\n**2025 season**\n\nHülkenberg and Magnussen are set to depart the team after the 2024 season; the former will join Kick Sauber and will be replaced by Formula 2 graduate Oliver Bearman, previously a reserve driver for the team. This is the first time that Haas has taken in a rookie driver since the pairing of Nikita Mazepin and Mick Schumacher in 2021. He is set to be joined by Esteban Ocon, who will depart Alpine after five seasons with Team Enstone.\n\n**Complete Formula One results**\n\nSince the team's foundation, multiple drivers have been affiliated with Haas. These include Romain Grosjean, Esteban Gutiérrez, Kevin Magnussen, Nikita Mazepin, Mick Schumacher, and Nico Hülkenberg.\n\n**Driver development program**\n\nSince the team's foundation, multiple drivers have been affiliated with Haas.
