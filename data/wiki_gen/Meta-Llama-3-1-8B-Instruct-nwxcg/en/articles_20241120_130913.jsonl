Born on August 26, 1951, in Baltimore, Maryland, Witten has spent his career exploring the mysteries of space, time, and matter.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nWitten was born to a Jewish family as the eldest of four children. His parents, Lorraine (born Wollach) Witten and Louis Witten, a theoretical physicist specializing in gravitation and general relativity, instilled in him a love for mathematics and science from a young age. Witten's younger siblings, Matt Witten, Jesse Amnon Witten, and Celia M Witten, have also pursued careers in writing, law, and mathematics, respectively.\n\nWitten's early education took place at the Baltimore Laboratory School, where he developed a passion for mathematics and physics. He went on to attend Brandeis University, where he earned his Bachelor's degree in Physics in 1971. Witten then pursued his graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he earned his Ph.D. in Physics in 1976.\n\n**Research**\n\nWitten's research career has been marked by numerous breakthroughs and innovations in the fields of mathematics and physics. In 1990, he was awarded the Fields Medal by the International Mathematical Union, one of the most prestigious awards in mathematics. This recognition was a testament to Witten's work on the topology of manifolds and the structure of gauge theories.\n\n**M-theory**\n\nIn the mid-1990s, physicists working on string theory had developed five different consistent versions of the theory. These versions, known as type I, type IIA, type IIB, and the two flavors of heterotic string theory (SO(32) and E8×E8), were the subject of much debate and research at the time. The thinking was that of these five candidate theories, only one was the actual correct theory of everything, and that theory was the one whose low-energy limit matched the physics observed in our world today.\n\nWitten's work on M-theory, a theoretical framework that attempts to unify the five string theories into a single, coherent theory, was a major contribution to the field. His research showed that M-theory is a 11-dimensional theory that includes all five string theories as special cases, and that it provides a unified description of the fundamental laws of physics.\n\n**Other Work**\n\nAnother of Witten's contributions to physics was to the result of gauge/gravity duality. In 1997, Juan Maldacena formulated a result known as the AdS/CFT correspondence, which establishes a relationship between certain quantum field theories and theories of quantum gravity. Maldacena's discovery has dominated high-energy theoretical physics for the past 15 years because of its applications to theoretical problems in quantum gravity and quantum field theory.\n\nWitten's foundational work following Maldacena's result has shed light on this relationship and has provided new insights into the nature of spacetime and the behavior of particles at the quantum level. His research has also explored the implications of gauge/gravity duality for our understanding of black holes and the holographic principle.\n\n**Awards and Honors**\n\nWitten has been honored with numerous awards and accolades for his contributions to mathematics and physics. These include:\n\n* MacArthur Grant (1982)\n* Fields Medal (1990)\n* Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1997)\n* Nemmers Prize in Mathematics (2000)\n* National Medal of Science (2002)\n* Pythagoras Award (2005)\n* Henri Poincaré Prize (2006)\n* Crafoord Prize (2008)\n* Lorentz Medal (2010)\n* Isaac Newton Medal (2010)\n* Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics (2012)\n\nIn addition to these awards, Witten has been elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (London) and has been appointed a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. He has also been recognized as one of the 100 most influential people of the year by Time magazine.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nWitten has been married to Chiara Nappi, a professor of physics at Princeton University, since 1979. They have two daughters, Ilana B Witten and Daniela Witten, and a son, all of whom have pursued careers in science and mathematics.\n\n**Selected Publications**\n\nWitten has published numerous papers and books on mathematics and physics. Some of his notable publications include:\n\n* \"Global Anomalies in Theoretical Physics\" (1983)\n* \"Quantum Field Theory and the Jones Polynomial\" (1989)\n* \"M-Theory and the Holographic Principle\" (1999)\n* \"Gauge/Gravity Duality and the Holographic Principle\" (2001)\n\nThese publications demonstrate Witten's contributions to our understanding of the universe and his ongoing work in the fields of mathematics and physics.\n\n**External Links**\n\n* Edward Witten's homepage at the Institute for Advanced Study\n* Edward Witten's CV at the Institute for Advanced Study\n* Edward Witten's publications at the arXiv\n* Edward Witten's profile at the Mathematics Genealogy Project", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Edward_Witten\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nWitten was born on August 26, 1951, in Baltimore, Maryland, to a Jewish family, [8] as the eldest of four children His brother Matt Witten became a writer, and his brother Jesse Amnon Witten became a law partner in the firm Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath [9] The three brothers' sister Celia M Witten earned a Ph.D in mathematics from Stanford University [10] and then an M.D from the University of Miami [11] Edward Witten is the son of Lorraine (born Wollach) Witten [12] and Louis Witten, a theoretical physicist specializing in gravitation and general relativity [13]\n\n\nResearch\nWitten was awarded the Fields Medal by the International Mathematical Union in 1990 [21]\n\n\nFields medal work\nWitten was awarded the Fields Medal by the International Mathematical Union in 1990 [21]\n\n\nM-theory\nBy the mid 1990s, physicists working on string theory had developed five different consistent versions of the theory These versions are known as type I, type IIA, type IIB, and the two flavors of heterotic string theory (SO(32) and E8×E8) The thinking was that of these five candidate theories, only one was the actual correct theory of everything, and that theory was the one whose low-energy limit matched the physics observed in our world today [30]\n\n\nOther work\nAnother of Witten's contributions to physics was to the result of gauge/gravity duality In 1997, Juan Maldacena formulated a result known as the AdS/CFT correspondence, which establishes a relationship between certain quantum field theories and theories of quantum gravity [33] Maldacena's discovery has dominated high-energy theoretical physics for the past 15 years because of its applications to theoretical problems in quantum gravity and quantum field theory Witten's foundational work following Maldacena's result has shed light on this relationship [34]\n\n\nAwards and honors\nWitten has been honored with numerous awards including a MacArthur Grant (1982), the Fields Medal (1990), the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1997), [41] the Nemmers Prize in Mathematics (2000), the National Medal of Science [42] (2002), Pythagoras Award [43] (2005), the Henri Poincaré Prize (2006), the Crafoord Prize (2008), the Lorentz Medal (2010) the Isaac Newton Medal (2010) and the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics (2012) Since 1999, he has been a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (London), and in March 2016 was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh [44] [45] Pope Benedict XVI appointed Witten as a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (2006) He also appeared in the list of Time magazine's 100 most influential people of 2004 In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society [46] Witten was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1984, a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1988, and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1993 [47] [48] [49] In May 2022 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Sciences from the University of Pennsylvania [50]\n\n\nPersonal life\nWitten has been married to Chiara Nappi, a professor of physics at Princeton University, since 1979 [52] They have two daughters and a son Their daughter Ilana B Witten is a neuroscientist at Princeton University, [53] and daughter Daniela Witten is a biostatistician at the University of Washington [54]\n\n\nSelected publications\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

was hosted and produced by Canadian games journalist Geoff Keighley; the 30-minute preshow was hosted by Sydnee Goodman [2] [3] Following the success of The Game Awards 2020—which was broadcast virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic—Keighley received suggestions to follow the same format; around mid-2021, he decided the show would return to an in-person event at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles as he \"really missed the energy of people accepting their awards live and the reactions\" [4] Several safety protocols were put in place, including halving live attendance, mandating vaccines, and requiring face masks; [4] contingency plans were also established in case of unexpected COVID-19 variants or other issues [5] Keighley noted an excitement to return to the in-person event, stating it was the first time in two years the industry was able to gather [4]\n\n\nRelationship with Activision Blizzard\nKeighley said he was reevaluating the show's relationship with Activision Blizzard after the company was sued by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing on allegations of sexual harassment and employee discrimination in July 2021, adding he wanted the show to support employees and developers without diminishing individual achievements; [15] Kotaku's Ethan Gach characterized Keighley's statement as a refusal to \"take sides\", and noted the show's advisory board included Activision president Rob Kostich [16] After some criticism, Keighley stated Activision Blizzard would not be part of the ceremony outside of its nominated games, and wrote the show was committed to \"work together to build a better and a more inclusive environment\" [17]\n\n\nAnnouncements\nAccording to Keighley, the show featured around 50 games, with new announcements \"probably in the double digits\"; [4] he later claimed there would be six major reveals and several film trailers [15] He said it was a busy year for announcement pitches, noting the show's popularity and accessibility meant more developers and publishers sought involvement [4] Keighley claimed some studios had specific requests for the placement of their announcements within the show, but he decided about a month prior to allow for all submissions He felt some of the game announcements were taking advantage of the new generation of consoles for the first time [5] Keighley

{"title": "England_national_football_team", "content": "\nHistory\nThe England men's national football team is the joint-oldest in the world; it was formed at the same time as Scotland A representative match between England and Scotland was played on 5 March 1870, having been organised by the Football Association [6] A return fixture was organised by representatives of Scottish football teams on 30 November 1872 This match, played at Hamilton Crescent in Scotland, is viewed as the first official international football match, because the two teams were independently selected and operated, rather than being the work of a single football association [7] Over the next 40 years, England played exclusively with the other three Home Nations—Scotland, Wales and Ireland—in the British Home Championship.\n\n\nEarly years\nThe England men's national football team is the joint-oldest in the world; it was formed at the same time as Scotland A representative match between England and Scotland was played on 5 March 1870, having been organised by the Football Association [6] A return fixture was organised by representatives of Scottish football teams on 30 November 1872 This match, played at Hamilton Crescent in Scotland, is viewed as the first official international football match, because the two teams were independently selected and operated, rather than being the work of a single football association [7] Over the next 40 years, England played exclusively with the other three Home Nations—Scotland, Wales and Ireland—in the British Home Championship.\n\n\nWalter Winterbottom and Alf Ramsey\nAlthough Walter Winterbottom was appointed as England's first full-time manager in 1946, the team was still picked by a committee until Alf Ramsey took over in 1963 [15] [16] The 1966 World Cup was hosted in England and Ramsey guided England to victory with a 4–2 win against West Germany after extra time in the final, during which Geoff Hurst scored a hat-trick [17] In UEFA Euro 1968, the team reached the semi-finals for the first time, being eliminated by Yugoslavia [18]\n\n\nDon Revie, Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson\nFollowing Ramsey's dismissal, Joe Mercer took immediate temporary charge of England for a seven-match spell until Don Revie was appointed as new permanent manager in 1974 [21] Under Revie, the team underperformed and failed to qualify for either Euro 1976 or the 1978 World Cup [22] Revie resigned in 1977 and was replaced by Ron Greenwood, under whom performances improved The team qualified for Euro 1980 without losing any of their games, but exited in the group stage of the final tournament [23] They also qualified for the 1982 World Cup in Spain; despite not losing a game, they were eliminated at the second group stage [24] [25]\n\n\nGraham Taylor, Terry Venables, Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan\nThe 1990s saw four England managers follow Robson, each in the role for a relatively brief period Graham Taylor was Robson's immediate successor [34] England failed to win any matches at Euro 1992, drawing with tournament winners Denmark and later with France, before being eliminated by host nation Sweden The team then failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup after losing a controversial game against the Netherlands in Rotterdam, which resulted in Taylor's resignation Taylor faced much newspaper criticism during his tenure for his tactics and team selections [35]\n\n\nSven-Göran Eriksson and Steve McClaren\nPeter Taylor was appointed as caretaker manager for one match, before Sven-Göran Eriksson took charge between 2001 and 2006, and was the team's first non-English manager [46] [47] Although England's players in this era were dubbed a \"golden generation\" and only lost five competitive matches during Eriksson's tenure, [48] they exited at the quarter-finals of the 2002 World Cup, Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup [49] In January 2006 it was announced that Eriksson would leave the role following that year's World Cup [50] Steve McClaren was selected to succeed Eriksson, but was sacked on 22 November 2007 after just 18 matches in charge as England failed to qualify for Euro 2008 [51] McClaren was criticised for his team selection in his final game - a decisive qualifier against Croatia which England lost 3-2 - particularly the decision to select inexperienced goalkeeper Scott Carson, whose mistake lead to Croatia's first goal [52] [53]\n\n\nFabio Capello, Roy Hodgson and Sam Allardyce\nOn 14 December 2007, Italian manager Fabio Capello was appointed as McClaren's successor, becoming only the second foreign coach to take the job [54] At the 2010 World Cup, England were considered favourites to top their group [55] but drew their opening two games against the United States and Algeria; this led to questions about the team's spirit, tactics and ability to handle pressure [56] Despite this, England progressed to the round of 16, where they were beaten 4–1 by Germany, their heaviest defeat in a World Cup finals tournament match [57] This match became infamous for a ghost goal when Frank Lampard hit a shot from outside the penalty area that bounced down off the crossbar and over the goal line before being cleared by German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, with neither the referee nor the assistant opting to award a goal Had it been given, the goal would have tied the game 2–2 with England coming from two goals down This incident - along with similar mistakes at the tournament - lead to an apology from FIFA president Sepp Blatter and was a factor in the subsequent decision to introduce goal-line technology into football [58] [59] Capello continued as England manager, leading the team's successful qualifying campaign for Euro 2012, before resigning from the role in February 2012 following a disagreement with the FA over their request to remove John Terry from the team captaincy following accusations of racial abuse against the player [60]\n\n\nGareth Southgate and Thomas Tuchel\nAfter Allardyce's resignation, Gareth Southgate, then the coach of the England under-21 team, was put in temporary charge of the national team until November 2016, [69] before being given the position on a permanent basis at the end of that period [70] At the 2018 World Cup, England reached the semi-finals for the third time After finishing second in their group, England faced Colombia in the round of 16 where they won on penalties for the first time at a World Cup, before beating Sweden in the quarter-finals [71] [72] [73] In the semi-final, they were beaten 2–1 in extra time by Croatia and finished fourth after losing the third place play-off match against Belgium [74] [75] England striker Harry Kane finished the tournament as top scorer with six goals and was awarded the golden boot [76]\n\n\nTeam image\nThe motif of the England national football team has three lions passant guardant, the emblem of King Richard I, who reigned from 1189 to 1199

The team is controlled by The Football Association (FA), the governing body for football in England.\n\n## History\n\nThe England men's national football team is the joint-oldest in the world; it was formed at the same time as Scotland. A representative match between England and Scotland was played on 5 March 1870, having been organised by the Football Association. A return fixture was organised by representatives of Scottish football teams on 30 November 1872. This match, played at Hamilton Crescent in Scotland, is viewed as the first official international football match, because the two teams were independently selected and operated, rather than being the work of a single football association. Over the next 40 years, England played exclusively with the other three Home Nations—Scotland, Wales and Ireland—in the British Home Championship.\n\n## Early years\n\nThe England men's national football team is the joint-oldest in the world; it was formed at the same time as Scotland.

Over the next 40 years, England played exclusively with the other three Home Nations—Scotland, Wales and Ireland—in the British Home Championship.\n\n## Walter Winterbottom and Alf Ramsey\n\nAlthough Walter Winterbottom was appointed as England's first full-time manager in 1946, the team was still picked by a committee until Alf Ramsey took over in 1963. The 1966 World Cup was hosted in England, and Ramsey guided England to victory with a 4–2 win against West Germany after extra time in the final, during which Geoff Hurst scored a hat-trick. In UEFA Euro 1968, the team reached the semi-finals for the first time, being eliminated by Yugoslavia.\n\n## Don Revie, Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson\n\nFollowing Ramsey's dismissal, Joe Mercer took immediate temporary charge of England for a seven-match spell until Don Revie was appointed as new permanent manager in 1974. Under Revie, the team underperformed and failed to qualify for either Euro 1976 or the 1978 World Cup. Revie resigned in 1977 and was replaced by Ron Greenwood, under whom performances improved. The team qualified for Euro 1980 without losing any of their games, but exited in the group stage of the final tournament. They also qualified for the 1982 World Cup in Spain; despite not losing a game, they were eliminated at the second group stage.\n\n## Graham Taylor, Terry Venables, Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan\n\nThe 1990s saw four England managers follow Robson, each in the role for a relatively brief period. Graham Taylor was Robson's immediate successor. England failed to win any matches at Euro 1992, drawing with tournament winners Denmark and later with France, before being eliminated by host nation Sweden. The team then failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup after losing a controversial game against the Netherlands in Rotterdam, which resulted in Taylor's resignation. Taylor faced much newspaper criticism during his tenure for his tactics and team selections.\n\n## Sven-Göran Eriksson and Steve McClaren\n\nPeter Taylor was appointed as caretaker manager for one match before Sven-Göran Eriksson took charge between 2001 and 2006. Although England's players in this era were dubbed a \"golden generation\" and only lost five competitive matches during Eriksson's tenure, the team exited at the quarter-finals of the 2002 World Cup, Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup. In January 2006, it was announced that Eriksson would leave the role following that year's World Cup. Steve McClaren was selected to succeed Eriksson, but was sacked on 22 November 2007 after just 18 matches in charge as England failed to qualify for Euro 2008.\n\n## Fabio Capello, Roy Hodgson and Sam Allardyce\n\nOn 14 December 2007, Italian manager Fabio Capello was appointed as McClaren's successor, becoming only the second foreign coach to take the job. At the 2010 World Cup, England were considered favourites to top their group but drew their opening two games against the United States and Algeria; this led to questions about the team's spirit, tactics and ability to handle pressure. Despite this, England progressed to the round of 16, where they were beaten 4–1 by Germany, their heaviest defeat in a World Cup finals tournament match. This match became infamous for a ghost goal when Frank Lampard hit a shot from outside the penalty area that bounced down off the crossbar and over the goal line before being cleared by German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, with neither the referee nor the assistant opting to award a goal.\n\n## Gareth Southgate\n\nAfter Allardyce's resignation, Gareth Southgate, then the coach of the England under-21 team, was put in temporary charge of the national team until November 2016, before being given the position on a permanent basis at the end of that period. At the 2018 World Cup, England reached the semi-finals for the third time. After finishing second in their group, England faced Colombia in the round of 16, where they won on penalties for the first time at a World Cup, before beating Sweden in the quarter-finals. In the semi-final, they were beaten 2–1 in extra time by Croatia and finished fourth after losing the third place play-off match against Belgium. England striker Harry Kane finished the tournament as top scorer with six goals and was awarded the golden boot.\n\n## Team image\n\nThe motif of the England national football team has three lions passant guardant, the emblem of King Richard I, who reigned from 1189 to 1199. In 1872, English players wore white jerseys emblazoned with the three lions crest of the Football Association. The lions, often blue, have had minor changes to colour and appearance. Initially topped by a crown, this was removed in 1949 when the FA was given an official coat of arms by the College of Arms; this introduced ten Tudor roses, one for each of the regional branches of the FA. Since 2003, England top their logo with a star to recognise their World Cup win in 1966.\n\n## Kit suppliers\n\nThe motif of the England national football team has three lions passant guardant, the emblem of King Richard I, who reigned from 1189 to 1199.

England's away qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup were shown on Setanta Sports until that company's collapse. As a result of Setanta Sports's demise, England's World Cup qualifier in Ukraine on 10 October 2009 was shown in the United Kingdom on a pay-per-view basis via the internet only. This one-off event was the first time an England game had been screened in such a way. The number of subscribers, paying between £4.99 and £11.99 each, was estimated at between 250,000 and 300,000 and the total number of viewers at around 500,000. In 2018, Sky Sports broadcast the England Nations League and in-season friendlies, until 2021 and ITV Sport broadcast the European Qualifiers for Euro-World Cups and pre-tournament friendlies (after the Nations League group matches end), until 2022. In April 2022, Channel 4 won the rights for England matches until June 2024, including 2022–23 UEFA Nations League matches, Euro 2024 qualifying games, and friendlies. 2022 World Cup rights remained with the BBC and ITV.\n\n## Results and fixtures\n\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\n## Coaching staff\n\nThe following is a list of the current coaching staff of the England national football team.\n\n## Players\n\nThe following 22 players were named in the squad for the 2024–25 UEFA Nations League matches against Greece and the Republic of Ireland on 14 and 17 November 2024 respectively.\n\n## Recent call-ups\n\nThe following players have also been called up to the England squad within the last twelve months.\n\n## Individual records\n\nEngland first appeared at the 1950 FIFA World Cup, and have subsequently qualified for a total of 16 World Cup tournaments, tied for sixth best by number of appearances.

a retired American professional basketball player who played for the Seattle Storm in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). She is widely regarded as one of the greatest point guards in WNBA history.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nSue Bird was born on October 16, 1980, in Syosset, New York, to Herschel and Nancy Bird. She has one sibling, an older sister named Jen. Her father's ancestry is Russian-Jewish, and her paternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from what later became Ukraine in the 1900s. Upon her grandfather's arrival at Ellis Island in New York, their original last name was switched from \"Boorda\" to \"Bird.\" To avoid European rules, which state that European basketball teams can only have two Americans, Bird obtained Israeli citizenship due to her Jewish father and paternal grandparents. However, she represents the United States, her birth country, in international competitions.\n\n**High School**\n\nBird played her freshman and sophomore years at Syosset High School, but wanted more competition. Consequently, she enrolled at Christ the King Regional High School in Queens, New York. Bird spent two seasons at Christ the King, where she competed on their Lady Royals basketball team. The Royals record was 24–3 in her junior year, and in the second season, her team finished undefeated and won the New York state championship, and the national title. Bird won many awards, including the New York State Player of the Year and the New York Daily News Player of the Year. She was named a WBCA All-American and participated in the Women's Basketball Coaches Association High School All-America Game, scoring 11 points.\n\n**College Career**\n\nBird was recruited by several university teams, including UConn, Stanford, and Vanderbilt. She leaned towards selecting the UConn Huskies, but hesitated when two point guards announced their commitments to the team. After one of the point guards withdrew her commitment, Bird decided to accept UConn's offer. In addition, she favored UConn because it was close to her home and had increased playing opportunities. Eight games into her freshman season, Bird suffered a torn ACL. Since she had played more than 20% of the team's games in the 1998–1999 season, she was not able to redshirt. In her sophomore season (1999–2000), she returned to lead the team to a 36–1 record, the Big East Championship, and the 2000 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. In her junior season (2000–2001), the Huskies went 32–3, with the final loss coming against UConn's Big East rival Notre Dame in the Final Four. However, the Huskies went 39–0 in her senior season (2001–2002), and, subsequently, Bird won the Wade Trophy, Honda Sports Award, and Naismith Award as College Player of the Year.\n\n**College Statistics**\n\nThe Seattle Storm selected Bird with the first overall pick of the 2002 WNBA draft. She would play alongside superstar Lauren Jackson, who was also drafted first overall the year before. In her rookie season, Bird started all 32 games for the Storm and averaged 14.4 ppg. She was selected as a starter on the 2002 WNBA Western Conference All-Star team. Bird was the runner-up for the Rookie of the Year award and one of only two rookies to make the All-WNBA First Team.

His parents divorced when he was four years old, and he and his elder brother Gunnar were raised by their mother in Tenafly. As a single parent, Hexum's mother had to work two jobs to support her sons, and she encouraged their interest in the arts. In an interview, Hexum recalled that his mother exposed him to theater arts and music at a young age, saying \"She was wonderful when we were growing up. Somehow she found money to buy us a piano, we got to go to the theater periodically, and I took singing and dancing lessons.\"\n\nHexum's interest in acting led him to pursue a career in the performing arts. He began his acting career in the early 1980s, landing small roles in film and television. His breakthrough role came in 1984 when he was cast as Mac Harper in the television series \"Cover Up\". The show followed the adventures of a team of agents working for the United States government, and Hexum's character was a young and ambitious agent. The show ran for two seasons, and Hexum's performance earned him a nomination for a Golden Globe Award.\n\nIn addition to his work on \"Cover Up\", Hexum also appeared in several films, including \"Parasite\" and \"Deadly Pursuit\". He was known for his versatility as an actor, and his ability to play a wide range of roles.\n\n**Death**\n\nOn October 12, 1984, the cast and crew of \"Cover Up\" were filming the seventh episode of the series, \"Golden Opportunity\", on Stage 18 of the 20th Century Fox lot. One of the scenes filmed that day called for Hexum's character to load cartridges into a .44 Magnum handgun, so he was provided with a functional gun and blanks. When the scene did not play as the director wanted it to in the master shot, there was a delay in filming. Hexum became restless and impatient during the delay, and began playing around to lighten the mood. He had unloaded all but one blank round, spun it, and—simulating Russian roulette—he put the revolver to his right temple and pulled the trigger.\n\nThe incident was a tragic accident, and Hexum was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. The investigation into the incident found that the gun was loaded with a blank cartridge, and that the wound was self-inflicted. The coroner's report concluded that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head, and that the manner of death was a suicide.\n\n**Filmography**\n\n* Parasite (1982)\n* Deadly Pursuit (1983)\n* Cover Up (1984-1985)\n* MacGyver (1985) (guest appearance)\n\n**See Also**\n\n* List of actors who have died in accidents\n* List of people who have died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds\n\n**References**\n\n* \"Jon-Erik Hexum\".

It is one of the most common types of lung cancer and accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancer cases in the United States.\n\n**Types of Small-Cell Carcinomas**\n\nSmall-cell carcinoma has been divided into two clinicopathological stages, termed limited stage (LS) and extensive stage (ES). The stage is generally determined by the presence or absence of metastases, whether or not the tumor appears limited to the thorax, and whether or not the entire tumor burden within the chest can feasibly be encompassed within a single radiotherapy portal. In general, if the tumor is confined to one lung and the lymph nodes close to that lung, the cancer is said to be LS. If cancer has spread beyond that, it is said to be ES.\n\n**Small-Cell Lung Cancer**\n\nSmall-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is the most common type of small-cell carcinoma and accounts for approximately 80% of all small-cell carcinoma cases. It is often associated with smoking and is typically diagnosed in patients who are 60 years or older.\n\n**Combined Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma**\n\nWhen SCLC is found with one or more differentiated forms of lung cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, the malignant tumor is then diagnosed and classified as a combined small cell lung carcinoma (c-SCLC). Small-cell lung carcinoma can occur in combination with a wide variety of other histological variants of lung cancer, including extremely complex malignant tissue admixtures.\n\n**Extrapulmonary Small-Cell Carcinoma**\n\nVery rarely, the primary site for small-cell carcinoma is outside of the lungs and pleural space; in these cases, it is referred to as extrapulmonary small-cell carcinoma (EPSCC). Outside of the respiratory tract, small-cell carcinoma can appear in the cervix, prostate, liver, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, or bladder. It is estimated to account for 1,000 new cases a year in the U.S.\n\n**Extrapulmonary Small-Cell Carcinoma Localized in the Lymph Nodes**\n\nThis is an extremely rare type of small cell, and there has been little information in the scientific community. It appears to occur in only one or more lymph nodes, and nowhere else in the body. Treatment is similar to small cell lung cancer, but survival rates are much higher than other small-cell carcinomas.\n\n**Small-Cell Carcinoma of the Prostate**\n\nSmall-cell carcinoma of the prostate (SCCP) is a rare form of prostate cancer (approximately 1% of prostate cancers). Symptomatic metastasis of SCCP to the brain is rare, and carries a poor prognosis.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nSmall-cell carcinoma of the lung usually presents in the central airways and infiltrates the submucosa leading to narrowing of bronchial airways. Common symptoms include cough, dyspnea, weight loss, and debility. Over 70% of patients with small-cell carcinoma present with metastatic disease; common sites include liver, adrenals, bone, and brain.\n\n**Genetics**\n\nTP53 is mutated in 70 to 90% of SCLCs. RB1 and the retinoblastoma pathway are inactivated in most SCLCs. PTEN is mutated in 2 to 10%. MYC amplifications and amplification of MYC family members are found in 30% of SCLCs. Loss of heterozygocity on chromosome arm 3p is found in more than 80% of SCLCs, including the loss of FHIT. One hundred translocations have been reported in SCLCs.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nSmall-cell carcinoma is an undifferentiated neoplasm composed of primitive-appearing cells. As the name implies, the cells in small-cell carcinomas are smaller than normal cells, and barely have room for any cytoplasm. Some researchers identify this as a failure in the mechanism that controls the size of the cells.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nIn cases of LS-SCLC, combination chemotherapy is administered together with concurrent chest radiotherapy. Chest radiotherapy has been shown to improve survival in LS-SCLC. Because SCLC usually metastasizes widely very early on in the natural history of the tumor, and because nearly all cases respond dramatically to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, there has been little role for surgery in this disease since the 1970s. However, in cases of small, asymptomatic, node-negative SCLC's (\"very limited stage\"), surgical excision may improve survival when used prior to chemotherapy.\n\n**LS-SCLC**\n\nIn cases of LS-SCLC, combination chemotherapy is administered together with concurrent chest radiotherapy.

However, in cases of small, asymptomatic, node-negative SCLC's (\"very limited stage\"), surgical excision may improve survival when used prior to chemotherapy.\n\n**ES-SCLC**\n\nIn ES-SCLC, platinum-based combination chemotherapy is the standard of care.\n\n**Chemotherapy**\n\nSmall-cell lung cancer is most commonly treated with chemotherapy in a combination of two drugs, which is more effective than one drug alone.\n\n**Cisplatin-Resistance**\n\nThe drug paclitaxel may be useful in the treatment of cisplatin-resistant cancer. About 68.1% of cisplatin-resistant cells appear to be sensitive to paclitaxel and 66.7% of paclitaxel-resistant cells to cisplatin. The mechanism for this activity is unknown.\n\n**Immunotherapy**\n\nThe FDA has approved three immunotherapies for small cell lung cancer.\n\n**Radiation Therapy**\n\nChest radiation helps SCLC patients live longer by killing cancer cells and helping prevention of cancer recurrence. Another type of radiation, prophylactic cranial radiation, prevents central nervous system recurrence and can improve survival in patients with good performance status who have had a complete response or a very good partial response to chemoradiation in LD or chemotherapy in ED.\n\n**In Case of Relapse**\n\nIf small cell lung cancer comes back after treatment, the following combination of drugs may be used as a salvage therapy:\n\n**Novel Agents**\n\nSeveral newer agents, including temozolomide and bendamustine, have activity in relapsed SCLC. Of note, temozolomide yielded a response rate of 38% for brain metastases due to SCLC.\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nAs of 2015, 5-year survival rates for small cell lung cancer (extensive and limited) range between 3.6% and 32.2% for women, and between 2.2% and 24.5% for men. Relative 5-year survival rate for both sexes has increased from 3.6% in 1975 to 6.7% in 2014. In limited-stage disease, relative 5-year survival rate (both sexes, all races, all ages) is 21.3%; however, women have higher 5-year survival rates, 26.9%, and men have lower survival rates, 21.3%.

Small cell lung cancer occurs almost exclusively in smokers – most commonly in heavy smokers and rarely in non-smokers.\n\n**Society**\n\nIn 2013, the US Congress passed the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act, which mandated increased attention to certain recalcitrant cancers (cancers having a 5-year relative survival rate of less than 50%), including small cell lung cancer. That led to the National Cancer Institute supporting small cell–specific research.\n\n**Notable Cases**\n\nSmall-cell carcinoma is a serious and aggressive form of lung cancer that requires prompt and effective treatment.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Small-cell_carcinoma\" following this outline:\n\n\nTypes of small-cell carcinomas\nSmall-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) has long been divided into two clinicopathological stages, termed limited stage (LS) and extensive stage (ES) [8] The stage is generally determined by the presence or absence of metastases, whether or not the tumor appears limited to the thorax, and whether or not the entire tumor burden within the chest can feasibly be encompassed within a single radiotherapy portal [9] In general, if the tumor is confined to one lung and the lymph nodes close to that lung, the cancer is said to be LS If cancer has spread beyond that, it is said to be ES.\n\n\nSmall-cell lung cancer\nSmall-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) has long been divided into two clinicopathological stages, termed limited stage (LS) and extensive stage (ES) [8] The stage is generally determined by the presence or absence of metastases, whether or not the tumor appears limited to the thorax, and whether or not the entire tumor burden within the chest can feasibly be encompassed within a single radiotherapy portal [9] In general, if the tumor is confined to one lung and the lymph nodes close to that lung, the cancer is said to be LS If cancer has spread beyond that, it is said to be ES.\n\n\nCombined small-cell lung carcinoma\nWhen SCLC is found with one or more differentiated forms of lung cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, the malignant tumor is then diagnosed and classified as a combined small cell lung carcinoma (c-SCLC) [14] Small-cell lung carcinoma can occur in combination with a wide variety of other histological variants of lung cancer, [14] including extremely complex malignant tissue admixtures [15]\n [16]\nC-SCLC is the only currently recognized subtype of SCLC [14]\n\n\nExtrapulmonary small-cell carcinoma\nVery rarely, the primary site for small-cell carcinoma is outside of the lungs and pleural space;

The game was released in 2022 for PC and Xbox Series X/S consoles.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nIn Scorn, the player controls an entity lost in a nightmarish world filled with grotesque creatures and techno-organic, living structures composed of machines, flesh, and bone. The player must explore different interconnected regions, fighting for survival, and gaining vague insights into the nature of the game's world. As the player progresses through the game, they will encounter various obstacles, puzzles, and enemies that must be overcome in order to survive.\n\nThe gameplay in Scorn is centered around exploration and combat. The player will need to use a variety of tools and abilities to navigate the game's world, including a grappling hook, a laser cutter, and a variety of melee attacks. The combat in Scorn is often described as \"tedious and unnecessary\" by critics, as it can be frustrating and repetitive at times.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nThe story of Scorn is set in an unknown realm following a seemingly devastating war. The silent humanoid protagonist first awakens and attempts to cross a wasteland called The Field, heading towards the looming citadel called The Crater seen in the distance. However, the protagonist soon falls down a massive crevasse into a factory called the Assembly, a recycling plant that repurposes living things.\n\nAs the protagonist navigates the facility, they gradually acquire various weapons and tools which allow them to manipulate the facility's technology. The protagonist causes the heart's arteries to burst, which knocks them unconscious and covers them with fluid. At this point, the protagonist seemingly faints while a similar being as the protagonist awakens and emerges from an egg-like shell structure elsewhere.\n\nThe new protagonist makes their way to The Crater, which has seemingly been infested with hostile entities. The game's story is largely focused on the protagonist's journey through the Crater, where they must navigate the ruins of the city and confront the remnants of the war.\n\n**Development**\n\nScorn was developed by Ebb Software, a Serbia-based game development studio founded in 2013. The developers claim to have designed the game around the idea of \"being thrown into the world\", and as such, very little context is given about the game's setting.

{"title": "Earthquake", "content": "\nTerminology\nAn earthquake is the shaking of the surface of Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves Earthquakes may also be referred to as quakes, tremors, or temblors The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling.\n\n\nMajor examples\nOne of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history was the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake, which occurred on 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, China More than 830,000 people died [2] Most houses in the area were yaodongs—dwellings carved out of loess hillsides—and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed The 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century [3]\n\n\nOccurrence\nTectonic earthquakes occur anywhere on the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increases the frictional resistance Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of stick-slip behavior Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and, therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy [8] This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, [9] frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the elastic-rebound theory It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior [10]\n\n\nFault types\nThere are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an interplate earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of dip and where movement on them involves a vertical component Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures Rocks hotter than about 300 °C (572 °F) flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes [11] [12] The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1,000 km (620 mi) Examples are the earthquakes in Alaska (1957), Chile (1960), and Sumatra (2004), all in subduction zones The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault (1857, 1906), the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey (1939), and the Denali Fault in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter.\n\n\nNormal faults\nNormal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7 Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about six kilometres (3.7 mi) [13] [14]\n\n\nReverse faults\nReverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened such as at a convergent boundary Reverse faults, particularly those along convergent boundaries, are associated with the most powerful earthquakes (called megathrust earthquakes) including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more Megathrust earthquakes are responsible for about 90% of the total seismic moment released worldwide [15]\n\n\nStrike-slip faults\nStrike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault Strike-slip faults, particularly continental transforms, can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8 Strike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of 10 km (6.2 mi) within the brittle crust [16] Thus, earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible.\n\n\nEnergy released\nFor every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirty-fold increase in the energy released For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 32 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake An 8.6-magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs of the size used in World War II [18]\n\n\nFocus\nThe majority of tectonic earthquakes originate in the Ring of Fire at depths not exceeding tens of kilometers Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than 70 km (43 mi) are classified as \"shallow-focus\" earthquakes, while those with a focal depth between 70 and 300 km (43 and 186 mi) are commonly termed \"mid-focus\" or \"intermediate-depth\" earthquakes In subduction zones, where older and colder oceanic crust descends beneath another tectonic plate, deep-focus earthquakes may occur at much greater depths (ranging from 300 to 700 km (190 to 430 mi)) [21] These seismically active areas of subduction are known as Wadati–Benioff zones Deep-focus earthquakes occur at a depth where the subducted lithosphere should no longer be brittle, due to the high temperature and pressure A possible mechanism for the generation of deep-focus earthquakes is faulting caused by olivine undergoing a phase transition into a spinel structure [22]\n\n\nVolcanic activity\nEarthquakes often occur in volcanic regions and are caused there, both by tectonic faults and the movement of magma in volcanoes Such earthquakes can serve as an early warning of volcanic eruptions, as during the 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens [23] Earthquake swarms can serve as markers for the location of the flowing magma throughout the volcanoes These swarms can be recorded by seismometers and tiltmeters (a device that measures ground slope) and used as sensors to predict imminent or upcoming eruptions [24]\n\n\nRupture dynamics\nA tectonic earthquake begins as an area of initial slip on the fault surface that forms the focus Once the rupture has been initiated, it begins to propagate away from the focus, spreading out along the fault surface Lateral propagation will continue until either the rupture reaches a barrier, such as the end of a fault segment, or a region on the fault where there is insufficient stress to allow continued rupture For larger earthquakes, the depth extent of rupture will be constrained downwards by the brittle-ductile transition zone and upwards by the ground surface The mechanics of this process are poorly understood because it is difficult either to recreate such rapid movements in a laboratory or to record seismic waves close to a nucleation zone due to strong ground motion [25]\n\n\nSupershear earthquakes\nSupershear earthquake ruptures are known to have propagated at speeds greater than the S-wave velocity These have so far all been observed during large strike-slip events The unusually wide zone of damage caused by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom developed in such earthquakes.\n\n\nSlow earthquakes\nSlow earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the 1896 Sanriku earthquake [25]\n\n\nCo-seismic overpressuring and effect of pore pressure\nDuring an earthquake, high temperatures can develop at the fault plane, increasing pore pressure and consequently vaporization of the groundwater already contained within the rock [27] [28] [29] In the coseismic phase, such an increase can significantly affect slip evolution and speed, in the post-seismic phase it can control the Aftershock sequence because, after the main event, pore pressure increase slowly propagates into the surrounding fracture network [30] [29]\nFrom the point of view of the Mohr-Coulomb strength theory, an increase in fluid pressure reduces the normal stress acting on the fault plane that holds it in place, and fluids can exert a lubricating effect As thermal overpressurization may provide positive feedback between slip and strength fall at the fault plane, a common opinion is that it may enhance the faulting process instability After the mainshock, the pressure gradient between the fault plane and the neighboring rock causes a fluid flow that increases pore pressure in the surrounding fracture networks; such an increase may trigger new faulting processes by reactivating adjacent faults, giving rise to aftershocks [30] [29] Analogously, artificial pore pressure increase, by fluid injection in Earth's crust, may induce seismicity.\n\n\nTidal forces\nTides may trigger some seismicity.\n\n\nClusters\nMost earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time [31] Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors that cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern [32] Earthquake clustering has been observed, for example, in Parkfield, California where a long-term research study is being conducted around the Parkfield earthquake cluster [33]\n\n\nAftershocks\nAn aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock Rapid changes of stress between rocks, and the stress from the original earthquake are the main causes of these aftershocks, [34] along with the crust around the ruptured fault plane as it adjusts to the effects of the mainshock [31] An aftershock is in the same region as the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude, however, they can still be powerful enough to cause even more damage to buildings that were already previously damaged from the mainshock [34] If an aftershock is larger than the mainshock, the aftershock is redesignated as the mainshock and the original main shock is redesignated as a foreshock Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced fault plane adjusts to the effects of the mainshock [31]\n\n\nSwarms\nEarthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is the main shock, so none has a notably higher magnitude than another An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park [35] In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook Southern California's Imperial Valley, showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s [36]\n\n\nFrequency\nIt is estimated that around 500,000 earthquakes occur each year, detectable with current instrumentation About 100,000 of these can be felt [4] [5] Minor earthquakes occur very frequently around the world in places like California and Alaska in the U.S., as well as in El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Peru, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iran, Pakistan, the Azores in Portugal, Turkey, New Zealand, Greece, Italy, India, Nepal, and Japan [40] Larger earthquakes occur less frequently, the relationship being exponential; for example, roughly ten times as many earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 occur than earthquakes larger than magnitude 5 [41] In the (low seismicity) United Kingdom, for example, it has been calculated that the average recurrences are:\nan earthquake of 3.7–4.6 every year, an earthquake of 4.7–5.5 every 10 years, and an earthquake of 5.6 or larger every 100 years [42] This is an example of the Gutenberg–Richter law.\n\n\nInduced seismicity\nWhile most earthquakes are caused by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, human activity can also produce earthquakes Activities both above ground and below may change the stresses and strains on the crust, including building reservoirs, extracting resources such as coal or oil, and injecting fluids underground for waste disposal or fracking [51] Most of these earthquakes have small magnitudes The 5.7 magnitude 2011 Oklahoma earthquake is thought to have been caused by disposing wastewater from oil production into injection wells, [52] and studies point to the state's oil industry as the cause of other earthquakes in the past century [53] A Columbia University paper suggested that the 8.0 magnitude 2008 Sichuan earthquake was induced by loading from the Zipingpu Dam, [54] though the link has not been conclusively proved [55]\n\n\nMeasurement and location\nThe instrumental scales used to describe the size of an earthquake began with the Richter scale in the 1930s It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century Seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances The surface-wave magnitude was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events The moment magnitude scale not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock) The Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking.\n\n\nIntensity and magnitude\nThe shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon that has been experienced by humans from the earliest of times Before the development of strong-motion accelerometers, the intensity of a seismic event was estimated based on the observed effects Magnitude and intensity are not directly related and calculated using different methods The magnitude of an earthquake is a single value that describes the size of the earthquake at its source Intensity is the measure of shaking at different locations around the earthquake Intensity values vary from place to place, depending on the distance from the earthquake and the underlying rock or soil makeup [56]\n\n\nSeismic waves\nEvery earthquake produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities:\n\n\nSpeed of seismic waves\nPropagation velocity of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx 3 km/s (1.9 mi/s) up to 13 km/s (8.1 mi/s), depending on the density and elasticity of the medium In the Earth's interior, the shock- or P-waves travel much faster than the S-waves (approx relation 1.7:1) The differences in travel time from the epicenter to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of earthquakes and structures within the Earth Also, the depth of the hypocenter can be computed roughly.\n\n\nSeismic wave arrival\nAs a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle.\n\n\nLocation and reporting\nEarthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur The world is divided into 754 Flinn–Engdahl regions (F-E regions), which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity More active zones are divided into smaller F-E regions whereas less active zones belong to larger F-E regions.\n\n\nEffects\nThe effects of earthquakes include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\nShaking and ground rupture\nShaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude, the distance from the epicenter, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation [65] The ground-shaking is measured by ground acceleration.\n\n\nSoil liquefaction\nSoil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves [67]\n\n\nHuman impacts\nPhysical damage from an earthquake will vary depending on the intensity of shaking in a given area and the type of population  Underserved and developing communities frequently experience more severe impacts (and longer lasting) from a seismic event compared to well-developed communities [68] Impacts may include:\n\n\nLandslides\nEarthquakes can produce slope instability leading to landslides, a major geological hazard Landslide danger may persist while emergency personnel is attempting rescue work [70]\n\n\nFires\nEarthquakes can cause fires by damaging electrical power or gas lines In the event of water mains rupturing and a loss of pressure, it may also become difficult to stop the spread of a fire once it has started For example, more deaths in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself [71]\n\n\nTsunami\nTsunamis are long-wavelength, long-period sea waves produced by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of water—including when an earthquake occurs at sea In the open ocean, the distance between wave crests can surpass 100 kilometres (62 mi), and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour Such tsunamis travel 600–800 kilometers per hour (373–497 miles per hour), depending on water depth Large waves produced by an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas in a matter of minutes Tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them [72]\n\n\nFloods\nFloods may be secondary effects of earthquakes if dams are damaged Earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers, which collapse and cause floods [73]\n\n\nManagement\nEarthquake prediction is a branch of the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits [75] Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur Despite considerable research efforts by seismologists, scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month [76] Popular belief holds earthquakes are preceded by earthquake weather, in the early morning [77] [78]\n\n\nPrediction\nEarthquake prediction is a branch of the science of

earthquakes are preceded by earthquake weather, in the early morning [77] [78]\n\n\nForecasting\nWhile forecasting is usually considered to be a type of prediction, earthquake forecasting is often differentiated from earthquake prediction Earthquake forecasting is concerned with the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazards, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades [79] For well-understood faults the probability that a segment may rupture during the next few decades can be estimated [80] [81]\n\n\nPreparedness\nThe objective of earthquake engineering is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings, bridges, tunnels, roadways, and other structures, and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage Existing structures can be modified by seismic retrofitting to improve their resistance to earthquakes Earthquake insurance can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes Emergency management strategies can be employed by a government or organization to mitigate risks and prepare for consequences.\n\n\nIn culture\nFrom the lifetime of the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras in the 5th century BCE to the 14th century CE, earthquakes were usually attributed to \"air (vapors) in the cavities of the Earth.\" [83] Thales of Miletus (625–547 BCE) was the only documented person who believed that earthquakes were caused by tension between the earth and water [83] Other theories existed, including the Greek philosopher Anaxamines' (585–526 BCE) beliefs that short incline episodes of dryness and wetness caused seismic activity The Greek philosopher Democritus (460–371 BCE) blamed water in general for earthquakes [83] Pliny the Elder called earthquakes \"underground thunderstorms\" [83]\n\n\nHistorical views\nFrom the lifetime of the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras in the 5th century BCE to the 14th

religion\nIn Norse mythology, earthquakes were explained as the violent struggle of the god Loki When Loki, god of mischief and strife, murdered Baldr, god of beauty and light, he was punished by being bound in a cave with a poisonous serpent placed above his head dripping venom Loki's wife Sigyn stood by him with a bowl to catch the poison, but whenever she had to empty the bowl, the poison dripped on Loki's face, forcing him to jerk his head away and thrash against his bonds, which caused the earth to tremble [84]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn modern popular culture, the portrayal of earthquakes is shaped by the memory of great cities laid waste, such as Kobe in 1995 or San Francisco in 1906 [89] Fictional earthquakes tend to strike suddenly and without warning [89] For this reason, stories about earthquakes generally begin with the disaster and focus on its immediate aftermath, as in Short Walk to Daylight (1972), The Ragged Edge (1968) or Aftershock: Earthquake in New York (1999) [89] A notable example is Heinrich von Kleist's classic novella, The Earthquake in Chile, which describes the destruction of Santiago in 1647 Haruki Murakami's short fiction collection After the Quake depicts the consequences of the Kobe earthquake of 1995.\n\n\nOutside of earth\nPhenomena similar to earthquakes have been observed on other planets (e.g., marsquakes on Mars) and on the Moon (e.g., moonquakes).\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Earthquake**\n\nAn earthquake is the shaking of the surface of Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes may also be referred to as quakes, tremors, or temblors. The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling.\n\n**Major Examples**\n\nOne of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history was the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake, which occurred on 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, China. More than 830,000 people died. Most houses in the area were yaodongs—dwellings carved out of loess hillsides—and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed. The 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century.\n\n**Occurrence**\n\nTectonic earthquakes occur anywhere on the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increases the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and, therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy.\n\n**Fault Types**\n\nThere are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an interplate earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of dip and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures.\n\n**Normal Faults**\n\nNormal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended, such as a divergent boundary. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about six kilometers.\n\n**Reverse Faults**\n\nReverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened, such as at a convergent boundary. Reverse faults, particularly those along convergent boundaries, are associated with the most powerful earthquakes (called megathrust earthquakes) including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Megathrust earthquakes are responsible for about 90% of the total seismic moment released worldwide.\n\n**Strike-Slip Faults**\n\nStrike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental transforms, can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Strike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of 10 kilometers within the brittle crust.\n\n**Energy Released**\n\nFor every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirty-fold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 32 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake. An 8.6-magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs of the size used in World War II.\n\n**Focus**\n\nThe majority of tectonic earthquakes originate in the Ring of Fire at depths not exceeding tens of kilometers. Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than 70 kilometers are classified as \"shallow-focus\" earthquakes, while those with a focal depth between 70 and 300 kilometers are commonly termed \"mid-focus\" or \"intermediate-depth\" earthquakes. In subduction zones, where older and colder oceanic crust descends beneath another tectonic plate, deep-focus earthquakes may occur at much greater depths (ranging from 300 to 700 kilometers).\n\n**Volcanic Activity**\n\nEarthquakes often occur in volcanic regions and are caused there, both by tectonic faults and the movement of magma in volcanoes. Such earthquakes can serve as an early warning of volcanic eruptions, as during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Earthquake swarms can serve as markers for the location of the flowing magma throughout the volcanoes.\n\n**Rupture Dynamics**\n\nA tectonic earthquake begins as an area of initial slip on the fault surface that forms the focus. Once the rupture has been initiated, it begins to propagate away from the focus, spreading out along the fault surface. Lateral propagation will continue until either the rupture reaches a barrier, such as the end of a fault segment, or a region on the fault where there is insufficient stress to allow continued rupture. For larger earthquakes, the depth extent of rupture will be constrained downwards by the brittle-ductile transition zone and upwards by the ground surface.\n\n**Supershear Earthquakes**\n\nSupershear earthquake ruptures are known to have propagated at speeds greater than the S-wave velocity. These have so far all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of damage caused by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom developed in such earthquakes.\n\n**Slow Earthquakes**\n\nSlow earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the 1896 Sanriku earthquake.\n\n**Co-Seismic Overpressuring and Effect of Pore Pressure**\n\nDuring an earthquake, high temperatures can develop at the fault plane, increasing pore pressure and consequently vaporization of the groundwater already contained within the rock. In the coseismic phase, such an increase can significantly affect slip evolution and speed, in the post-seismic phase it can control the aftershock sequence because, after the main event, pore pressure increase slowly propagates into the surrounding fracture network.\n\n**Tidal Forces**\n\nTides may trigger some seismicity.\n\n**Clusters**\n\nMost earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time. Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors that cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern. Earthquake clustering has been observed, for example, in Parkfield, California where a long-term research study is being conducted around the Parkfield earthquake cluster.\n\n**Aftershocks**\n\nAn aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. Rapid changes of stress between rocks, and the stress from the original earthquake are the main causes of these aftershocks, along with the crust around the ruptured fault plane as it adjusts to the effects of the mainshock. An aftershock is in the same region as the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude, however, they can still be powerful enough to cause even more damage to buildings that were already previously damaged from the mainshock.\n\n**Swarms**\n\nEarthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is the main shock, so none has a notably higher magnitude than another. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nIt is estimated that around 500,000 earthquakes occur each year, detectable with current instrumentation. About 100,000 of these can be felt. Minor earthquakes occur very frequently around the world in places like California and Alaska in the U.S., as well as in El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Peru, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iran, Pakistan, the Azores in Portugal, Turkey, New Zealand, Greece, Italy, India, Nepal, and Japan. Larger earthquakes occur less frequently, the relationship being exponential; for example, roughly ten times as many earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 occur than earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.\n\n**Induced Seismicity**\n\nWhile most earthquakes are caused by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, human activity can also produce earthquakes. Activities both above ground and below may change the stresses and strains on the crust, including building reservoirs, extracting resources such as coal or oil, and injecting fluids underground for waste disposal or fracking. Most of these earthquakes have small magnitudes. The 5.7 magnitude 2011 Oklahoma earthquake is thought to have been caused by disposing wastewater from oil production into injection wells, and studies point to the state's oil industry as the cause of other earthquakes in the past century.\n\n**Measurement and Location**\n\nThe instrumental scales used to describe the size of an earthquake began with the Richter scale in the 1930s. It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century. Seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances. The surface-wave magnitude was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The moment magnitude scale not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking.\n\n**Intensity and Magnitude**\n\nThe shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon that has been experienced by humans from the earliest of times. Before the development of strong-motion accelerometers, the intensity of a seismic event was estimated based on the observed effects. Magnitude and intensity are not directly related and calculated using different methods. The magnitude of an earthquake is a single value that describes the size of the earthquake at its source. Intensity is the measure of shaking at different locations around the earthquake. Intensity values vary from place to place, depending on the distance from the earthquake and the underlying rock or soil makeup.\n\n**Seismic Waves**\n\nEvery earthquake produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities. The speed of seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approximately 3 kilometers per second to 13 kilometers per second, depending on the density and elasticity of the medium. In the Earth's interior, the shock- or P-waves travel much faster than the S-waves (approximately a ratio of 1.7:1). The differences in travel time from the epicenter to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of earthquakes and structures within the Earth.\n\n**Effects**\n\nThe effects of earthquakes include, but are not limited to, the following: shaking and ground rupture, soil liquefaction, human impacts, landslides, fires, tsunamis, floods, and management.\n\n**Shaking and Ground Rupture**\n\nShaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude, the distance from the epicenter, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation.\n\n**Soil Liquefaction**\n\nSoil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits.\n\n**Human Impacts**\n\nPhysical damage from an earthquake will vary depending on the intensity of shaking in a given area and the type of population. Underserved and developing communities frequently experience more severe impacts (and longer lasting) from a seismic event compared to well-developed communities. Impacts may include landslides, fires, tsunamis, and floods.\n\n**Preparedness**\n\nThe objective of earthquake engineering is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings, bridges, tunnels, roadways, and other structures, and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage. Existing structures can be modified by seismic retrofitting to improve their resistance to earthquakes.

outline:\n\n\nTerminology\nAn earthquake is the shaking of the surface of Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves Earthquakes may also be referred to as quakes, tremors, or temblors The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling.\n\n\nMajor examples\nOne of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history was the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake, which occurred on 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, China More than 830,000 people died [2] Most houses in the area were yaodongs—dwellings carved out of loess hillsides—and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed The 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century [3]\n\n\nOccurrence\nTectonic earthquakes occur anywhere on the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increases the frictional resistance Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of stick-slip behavior Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and, therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy [8] This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, [9] frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the elastic-rebound theory It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior [10]\n\n\nFault types\nThere are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an interplate earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of dip and where movement on them involves a vertical component Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures Rocks hotter than about 300 °C (572 °F) flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes [11] [12] The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1,000 km (620 mi) Examples are the earthquakes in Alaska (1957), Chile (1960), and Sumatra (2004), all in subduction zones The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault (1857, 1906), the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey (1939), and the Denali Fault in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter.\n\n\nNormal faults\nNormal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7 Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about six kilometres (3.7 mi) [13] [14]\n\n\nReverse faults\nReverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened such as at a convergent boundary Reverse faults, particularly those along convergent boundaries, are associated with the most powerful earthquakes (called megathrust earthquakes) including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more Megathrust earthquakes are responsible for about 90% of the total seismic moment released worldwide [15]\n\n\nStrike-slip faults\nStrike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault Strike-slip faults, particularly continental transforms, can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8 Strike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of 10 km (6.2 mi) within the brittle crust [16] Thus, earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible.\n\n\nEnergy released\nFor every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirty-fold increase in the energy released For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 32 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake An 8.6-magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs of the size used in World War II [18]\n\n\nFocus\nThe majority of tectonic earthquakes originate in the Ring of Fire at depths not exceeding tens of kilometers Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than 70 km (43 mi) are classified as \"shallow-focus\" earthquakes, while those with a focal depth between 70 and 300 km (43 and 186 mi) are commonly termed \"mid-focus\" or \"intermediate-depth\" earthquakes In subduction zones, where older and colder oceanic crust descends beneath another tectonic plate, deep-focus earthquakes may occur at much greater depths (ranging from 300 to 700 km (190 to 430 mi)) [21] These seismically active areas of subduction are known as Wadati–Benioff zones Deep-focus earthquakes occur at a depth where the subducted lithosphere should no longer be brittle, due to the high temperature and pressure A possible mechanism for the generation of deep-focus earthquakes is faulting caused by olivine undergoing a phase transition into a spinel structure [22]\n\n\nVolcanic activity\nEarthquakes often occur in volcanic regions and are caused there, both by tectonic faults and the movement of magma in volcanoes Such earthquakes can serve as an early warning of volcanic eruptions, as during the 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens [23] Earthquake swarms can serve as markers for the location of the flowing magma throughout the volcanoes These swarms can be recorded by seismometers and tiltmeters (a device that measures ground slope) and used as sensors to predict imminent or upcoming eruptions [24]\n\n\nRupture dynamics\nA tectonic earthquake begins as an area of initial slip on the fault surface that forms the focus Once the rupture has been initiated, it begins to propagate away from the focus, spreading out along the fault surface Lateral propagation will continue until either the rupture reaches a barrier, such as the end of a fault segment, or a region on the fault where there is insufficient stress to allow continued rupture For larger earthquakes, the depth extent of rupture will be constrained downwards by the brittle-ductile transition zone and upwards by the ground surface The mechanics of this process are poorly understood because it is difficult either to recreate such rapid movements in a laboratory or to record seismic waves close to a nucleation zone due to strong ground motion [25]\n\n\nSupershear earthquakes\nSupershear earthquake ruptures are known to have propagated at speeds greater than the S-wave velocity These have so far all been observed during large strike-slip events The unusually wide zone of damage caused by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom developed in such earthquakes.\n\n\nSlow earthquakes\nSlow earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the 1896 Sanriku earthquake [25]\n\n\nCo-seismic overpressuring and effect of pore pressure\nDuring an earthquake, high temperatures can develop at the fault plane, increasing pore pressure and consequently vaporization of the groundwater already contained within the rock [27] [28] [29] In the coseismic phase, such an increase can significantly affect slip evolution and speed, in the post-seismic phase it can control the Aftershock sequence because, after the main event, pore pressure increase slowly propagates into the surrounding fracture network [30] [29]\nFrom the point of view of the Mohr-Coulomb strength theory, an increase in fluid pressure reduces the normal stress acting on the fault plane that holds it in place, and fluids can exert a lubricating effect As thermal overpressurization may provide positive feedback between slip and strength fall at the fault plane, a common opinion is that it may enhance the faulting process instability After the mainshock, the pressure gradient between the fault plane and the neighboring rock causes a fluid flow that increases pore pressure in the surrounding fracture networks; such an increase may trigger new faulting processes by reactivating adjacent faults, giving rise to aftershocks [30] [29] Analogously, artificial pore pressure increase, by fluid injection in Earth's crust, may induce seismicity.\n\n\nTidal forces\nTides may trigger some seismicity.\n\n\nClusters\nMost earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time [31] Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors that cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern [32] Earthquake clustering has been observed, for example, in Parkfield, California where a long-term research study is being conducted around the Parkfield earthquake cluster [33]\n\n\nAftershocks\nAn aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock Rapid changes of stress between rocks, and the stress from the original earthquake are the main causes of these aftershocks, [34] along with the crust around the ruptured fault plane as it adjusts to the effects of the mainshock [31] An aftershock is in the same region as the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude, however, they can still be powerful enough to cause even more damage to buildings that were already previously damaged from the mainshock [34] If an aftershock is larger than the mainshock, the aftershock is redesignated as the mainshock and the original main shock is redesignated as a foreshock Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced fault plane adjusts to the effects of the mainshock [31]\n\n\nSwarms\nEarthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is the main shock, so none has a notably higher magnitude than another An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park [35] In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook Southern California's Imperial Valley, showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s [36]\n\n\nFrequency\nIt is estimated that around 500,000 earthquakes occur each year, detectable with current instrumentation About 100,000 of these can be felt [4] [5] Minor earthquakes occur very frequently around the world in places like California and Alaska in the U.S., as well as in El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Peru, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iran, Pakistan, the Azores in Portugal, Turkey, New Zealand, Greece, Italy, India, Nepal, and Japan [40] Larger earthquakes occur less frequently, the relationship being exponential; for example, roughly ten times as many earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 occur than earthquakes larger than magnitude 5 [41] In the (low seismicity) United Kingdom, for example, it has been calculated that the average recurrences are:\nan earthquake of 3.7–4.6 every year, an earthquake of 4.7–5.5 every 10 years, and an earthquake of 5.6 or larger every 100 years [42] This is an example of the Gutenberg–Richter law.\n\n\nInduced seismicity\nWhile most earthquakes are caused by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, human activity can also produce earthquakes Activities both above ground and below may change the stresses and strains on the crust, including building reservoirs, extracting resources such as coal or oil, and injecting fluids underground for waste disposal or fracking [51] Most of these earthquakes have small magnitudes The 5.7 magnitude 2011 Oklahoma earthquake is thought to have been caused by disposing wastewater from oil production into injection wells, [52] and studies point to the state's oil industry as the cause of other earthquakes in the past century [53] A Columbia University paper suggested that the 8.0 magnitude 2008 Sichuan earthquake was induced by loading from the Zipingpu Dam, [54] though the link has not been conclusively proved [55]\n\n\nMeasurement and location\nThe instrumental scales used to describe the size of an earthquake began with the Richter scale in the 1930s It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century Seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances The surface-wave magnitude was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events The moment magnitude scale not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock) The Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking.\n\n\nIntensity and magnitude\nThe shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon that has been experienced by humans from the earliest of times Before the development of strong-motion accelerometers, the intensity of a seismic event was estimated based on the observed effects Magnitude and intensity are not directly related and calculated using different methods The magnitude of an earthquake is a single value that describes the size of the earthquake at its source Intensity is the measure of shaking at different locations around the earthquake Intensity values vary from place to place, depending on the distance from the earthquake and the underlying rock or soil makeup [56]\n\n\nSeismic waves\nEvery earthquake produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities:\n\n\nSpeed of seismic waves\nPropagation velocity of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx 3 km/s (1.9 mi/s) up to 13 km/s (8.1 mi/s), depending on the density and elasticity of the medium In the Earth's interior, the shock- or P-waves travel much faster than the S-waves (approx relation 1.7:1) The differences in travel time from the epicenter to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of earthquakes and structures within the Earth Also, the depth of the hypocenter can be computed roughly.\n\n\nSeismic wave arrival\nAs a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle.\n\n\nLocation and reporting\nEarthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur The world is divided into 754 Flinn–Engdahl regions (F-E regions), which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity More active zones are divided into smaller F-E regions whereas less active zones belong to larger F-E regions.\n\n\nEffects\nThe effects of earthquakes include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\nShaking and ground rupture\nShaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude, the distance from the epicenter, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation [65] The ground-shaking is measured by ground acceleration.\n\n\nSoil liquefaction\nSoil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves [67]\n\n\nHuman impacts\nPhysical damage from an earthquake will vary depending on the intensity of shaking in a given area and the type of population  Underserved and developing communities frequently experience more severe impacts (and longer lasting) from a seismic event compared to well-developed communities [68] Impacts may include:\n\n\nLandslides\nEarthquakes can produce slope instability leading to landslides, a major geological hazard Landslide danger may persist while emergency personnel is attempting rescue work [70]\n\n\nFires\nEarthquakes can cause fires by damaging electrical power or gas lines In the event of water mains rupturing and a loss of pressure, it may also become difficult to stop the spread of a fire once it has started For example, more deaths in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself [71]\n\n\nTsunami\nTsunamis are long-wavelength, long-period sea waves produced by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of water—including when an earthquake occurs at sea In the open ocean, the distance between wave crests can surpass 100 kilometres (62 mi), and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour Such tsunamis travel 600–800 kilometers per hour (373–497 miles per hour), depending on water depth Large waves produced by an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas in a matter of minutes Tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them [72]\n\n\nFloods\nFloods may be secondary effects of earthquakes if dams are damaged Earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers, which collapse and cause floods [73]\n\n\nManagement\nEarthquake prediction is a branch of the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits [75] Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur Despite considerable research efforts by seismologists, scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month [76] Popular belief holds earthquakes are preceded by earthquake weather, in the early morning [77] [78]\n\n\nPrediction\nEarthquake prediction is a branch of the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within

reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month [76] Popular belief holds earthquakes are preceded by earthquake weather, in the early morning [77] [78]\n\n\nForecasting\nWhile forecasting is usually considered to be a type of prediction, earthquake forecasting is often differentiated from earthquake prediction Earthquake forecasting is concerned with the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazards, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades [79] For well-understood faults the probability that a segment may rupture during the next few decades can be estimated [80] [81]\n\n\nPreparedness\nThe objective of earthquake engineering is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings, bridges, tunnels, roadways, and other structures, and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage Existing structures can be modified by seismic retrofitting to improve their resistance to earthquakes Earthquake insurance can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes Emergency management strategies can be employed by a government or organization to mitigate risks and prepare for consequences.\n\n\nIn culture\nFrom the lifetime of the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras in the 5th century BCE to the 14th century CE, earthquakes were usually attributed to \"air (vapors) in the cavities of the Earth.\" [83] Thales of Miletus (625–547 BCE) was the only documented person who believed that earthquakes were caused by tension between the earth and water [83] Other theories existed, including the Greek philosopher Anaxamines' (585–526 BCE) beliefs that short incline episodes of dryness and wetness caused seismic activity The Greek philosopher Democritus (460–371 BCE) blamed water in general for earthquakes [83] Pliny the Elder called earthquakes \"underground thunderstorms\" [83]\n\n\nHistorical views\nFrom the lifetime of the

strife, murdered Baldr, god of beauty and light, he was punished by being bound in a cave with a poisonous serpent placed above his head dripping venom Loki's wife Sigyn stood by him with a bowl to catch the poison, but whenever she had to empty the bowl, the poison dripped on Loki's face, forcing him to jerk his head away and thrash against his bonds, which caused the earth to tremble [84]\n\n\nIn popular culture\nIn modern popular culture, the portrayal of earthquakes is shaped by the memory of great cities laid waste, such as Kobe in 1995 or San Francisco in 1906 [89] Fictional earthquakes tend to strike suddenly and without warning [89] For this reason, stories about earthquakes generally begin with the disaster and focus on its immediate aftermath, as in Short Walk to Daylight (1972), The Ragged Edge (1968) or Aftershock: Earthquake in New York (1999) [89] A notable example is Heinrich von Kleist's classic novella, The Earthquake in Chile, which describes the destruction of Santiago in 1647 Haruki Murakami's short fiction collection After the Quake depicts the consequences of the Kobe earthquake of 1995.\n\n\nOutside of earth\nPhenomena similar to earthquakes have been observed on other planets (e.g., marsquakes on Mars) and on the Moon (e.g., moonquakes).\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nSources\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal

{"title": "Maharashtra", "content": "\nEtymology\nThe modern Marathi language evolved from Maharashtri Prakrit, [28] and the word Marhatta (later used for the Marathas) is found in the Jain Maharashtrian literature The term Maharashtra along with Maharashtrian, Marathi, and Maratha may have derived from the same root However, their exact etymology is uncertain [29]\n\n\nHistory\nNumerous Late Harappan or Chalcolithic sites belonging to the Jorwe culture (c. 1300–700 BCE) have been discovered throughout the state [34] [35] The largest settlement discovered of the culture is at Daimabad, which had a mud fortification during this period, as well as an elliptical temple with fire pits [36] [37] In the Late Harappan period there was a large migration of people from Gujarat to northern Maharashtra [38]\n\n\nGeography\nMaharashtra with a total area of 307,713 km2 (118,809 sq mi), is the third-largest state by area in terms of land area and constitutes 9.36% of India's total geographical area The State lies between 15°35' N to 22°02' N latitude and 72°36' E to 80°54' E longitude It occupies the western and central part of the country and has a coastline stretching 840 kilometres (520 mi) [90] along the Arabian Sea [91] The dominant physical feature of the state is its plateau character, which is separated from the Konkan coastline by the mountain range of the Western Ghats, which runs parallel to the coast from north to south The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadri Range, has an average elevation of 1,200 metres (3,900 ft); its slopes gently descending towards the east and southeast [92] The Western Ghats (or the Sahyadri Mountain range) provide a physical barrier to the state on the west, while the Satpura Hills along the north and Bhamragad-Chiroli-Gaikhuri ranges on the east serve as its natural borders [93] This state's expansion from North to South is 720 km (450 mi) and East to West is 800 km (500 mi) To the west of these hills lie the Konkan coastal plains, 50–80 km (31–50 mi) in width To the east of the Ghats lies the flat Deccan Plateau The main rivers of the state are the Krishna, and its tributary, Bhima, the Godavari, and its main tributaries, Manjara, and Wardha-Wainganga and the Tapi, and its tributary Purna [91] [94] Maharashtra is divided into five geographic regions Konkan is the western coastal region, between the Western Ghats and the sea [95] Khandesh is the north region lying in the valley of the Tapti, Purna river [94] Nashik, Malegaon Jalgaon, Dhule and Bhusawal are the major cities of this region [96] Desh is in the centre of the state [97] Marathwada, which was a part of the princely state of Hyderabad until 1956, is located in the southeastern part of the state [91] [98] Aurangabad and Nanded are the main cities of the region [99] Vidarbha is the easternmost region of the state, formerly part of the Central Provinces and Berar [100]\n\n\nClimate\nMaharashtra experiences a tropical wet and dry climate with hot, rainy, and cold weather seasons Some areas more inland experience a hot semi arid climate, due to a rain shadow effect caused by the Western Ghats [102] The month of March marks the beginning of the summer and the temperature rises steadily until June In the central plains, summer temperatures rise to between 40 °C or 104.0 °F and 45 °C or 113.0 °F May is usually the warmest and January the coldest month of the year The winter season lasts until February with lower temperatures occurring in December and January On the Deccan plateau that lies on eastern side of the Sahyadri mountains, the climate is drier, however, dew and hail often occur, depending on seasonal weather [103]\n\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe state has three crucial biogeographic zones, namely Western Ghats, Deccan Plateau, and the West coast The Ghats nurture endemic species, Deccan Plateau provides for vast mountain ranges and grasslands while the coast is home to littoral and swamp forests Flora of Maharashtra is heterogeneous in composition In 2012 the recorded thick forest area in the state was 61,939 km2 (23,915 sq mi) which was about 20.13% of the state's geographical area [108] There are three main Public Forestry Institutions (PFIs) in the Maharashtra state: the Maharashtra Forest Department (MFD), the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) and the Directorate of Social Forestry (SFD) [109] The Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board, constituted by the Government of Maharashtra in January 2012 under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, is the nodal body for the conservation of biodiversity within and outside forest areas in the State [110] [111]\n\n\nRegions, divisions and districts\nMaharashtra has following geographical regions:\n\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the provisional results of the 2011 national census, Maharashtra was at that time the richest state in India and the second-most populous state in India with a population of 112,374,333 Contributing to 9.28% of India's population, males and females are 58,243,056 and 54,131,277, respectively [126] The total population growth in 2011 was 15.99%, while in the previous decade it was 22.57% [127] [128] Since independence, the decadal growth rate of population has remained higher (except in the year 1971) than the national average However, in the year 2011, it was found to be lower than the national average [128] The 2011 census for the state found 55% of the population to be rural with 45% being urban-based [129] [130] Although, India hasn't conducted a caste-wise census since Independence, based on the British era census of 1931, it is estimated that the Maratha and the Maratha-kunbi numerically form the largest caste cluster with around 32% of the population [131] Maharashtra has a large Other Backward Class population constituting 41% of the population The scheduled tribes include Adivasis such as Thakar, Warli, Konkana and Halba [132] The 2011 census found scheduled castes and scheduled tribes to account for 11.8% and 8.9% of the population, respectively [133] The state also includes a substantial number of migrants from other states of India [134] Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Karnataka account for the largest percentage of migrants to the Mumbai metropolitan area [135]\n\n\nReligion\nReligion in Maharashtra (2011) [138]\n\n\nLanguage\nLanguages of Maharashtra (2011) [142]\n\n\nGovernance and administration\nThe state is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy, a feature the state shares with other Indian states Maharashtra is one of the six states in India where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising the Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) and the Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council) [147] The legislature, the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members The Legislative Assembly consists of 288 members who are elected for five-year terms unless the Assembly is dissolved before to the completion of the term The Legislative Council is a permanent body of 78 members with one-third (33 members) retiring every two years Maharashtra is the second most important state in terms of political representation in the Lok Sabha, or the lower chamber of the Indian Parliament with 48 seats which is next only to Uttar Pradesh which has the highest number of seats than any other Indian state with 80 seats [148] Maharashtra also has 19 seats in the Rajya Sabha, or the upper chamber of the Indian Parliament [149] [150]\n\n\nPolitics\nThe politics of the state in the first decades after its formation in 1960 was dominated by the Indian National Congress party or its offshoots such as the Nationalist Congress Party At present, it has been dominated by four political parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Nationalist Congress Party, the Indian National Congress and the Shivsena.The politics of the state in the last five years has seen long term alliances breaking up like that of undivided Shivsena and BJP, new ones being formed between Congress, NCP, and the Shivsena, regional parties like the Shivsena and NCP splitting up, and majority of their legislators joining a new alliance government with the BJP [citation needed]\n\n\nEconomy\nFigures in crores of Indian rupees\n\n\nTransport\nThe state has a large, multi-modal transportation system with the largest road network in India [222] In 2011, the total length of surface road in Maharashtra was 267,452 km (166,187 mi); [223] national highways accounted for 4,176 km (2,595 mi), [224] and state highways 3,700 km (2,300 mi) [223] The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) provides economical and reliable passenger road transport service in the public sector [225] These buses, popularly called ST (State Transport), are the preferred mode of transport for much of the populace Hired forms of transport include metered taxis and auto-rickshaws, which often ply specific routes in cities Other district roads and village roads provide villages, accessibility to meet their social needs as well as the means to transport agricultural produce from villages to nearby markets Major district roads provide a secondary function of linking between main roads and rural roads Approximately 98% of villages are connected either via the highways or modern roads in Maharashtra Average speed on state highways varies between 50–60 km/h (31–37 mph) due to the heavy presence of vehicles; in villages and towns, speeds are as low as 25–30 km/h (16–19 mph) [226]\n\n\nEducation\nCensus of 2011 showed literacy rates in the state for males and females were around 88.38% and 75.87% respectively [237]\n\n\nPrimary and secondary level education\nSchools in the state are either managed by the government or by private trusts, including religious institutions.The medium of instruction in most of the schools is mainly Marathi, English, or Hindi, though Urdu is also used The secondary schools are affiliated with the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), the National Institute of Open School (NIOS), and the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Under the 10+2+3 plan, after completing secondary school, students typically enroll for two years in a junior college, also known as pre-university, or in schools with a higher secondary facility affiliated with the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education or any central board Students choose from one of three streams, namely liberal arts, commerce, or science Upon completing the required coursework, students may enrol in general or professional degree programs [citation needed]\n\n\nTertiary education\nMaharashtra has 24 universities with a turnout of 160,000 Graduates every year [245] [246] Established during the rule of East India company in 1857 as Bombay University, The University of Mumbai, is the largest university in the world in terms of the number of graduates [247] It has 141 affiliated colleges [248] According to a report published by The Times Education magazine, 5 to 7 Maharashtra colleges and universities are ranked among the top 20 in India [249] [250] [251] Maharashtra is also home to notable autonomous institutes as Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Indian Institute of Information Technology Pune, College of Engineering Pune (CoEP), Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University, Institute of Chemical Technology, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Walchand College of Engineering, Sangli, and Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), Sardar Patel College of Engineering (SPCE) [252] Most of these autonomous institutes are ranked the highest in India and have very competitive entry requirements The University of Pune (now Savitribai Phule Pune University), the National Defence Academy, Film and Television Institute of India, Armed Forces Medical College, and National Chemical Laboratory were established in Pune soon after the Indian independence in 1947 Mumbai has an IIT, has National Institute of Industrial Engineering and Nagpur has IIM and AIIMS Other notable institutes in the state are: Maharashtra National Law University, Nagpur (MNLUN), Maharashtra National Law University, Mumbai (MNLUM), Maharashtra National Law University, Aurangabad (MNLUA), Government Law College, Mumbai (GLC), ILS Law College, and Symbiosis Law School (SLS) [citation needed]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nHealth indicators of Maharashtra show that they have attained relatively high growth against a background of high per capita income (PCI) [257] In 2011, the health care system in Maharashtra consisted of 363 rural government hospitals, [258] 23 district hospitals (with 7,561 beds), 4 general hospitals (with 714 beds) mostly under the Maharashtra Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and 380 private medical establishments; these establishments provide the state with more than 30,000 hospital beds

education\nMaharashtra has 24 universities with a turnout of 160,000 Graduates every year [245] [246] Established during the rule of East India company in 1857 as Bombay University, The University of Mumbai, is the largest university in the world in terms of the number of graduates [247] It has 141 affiliated colleges [248] According to a report published by The Times Education magazine, 5 to 7 Maharashtra colleges and universities are ranked among the top 20 in India [249] [250] [251] Maharashtra is also home to notable autonomous institutes as Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Indian Institute of Information Technology Pune, College of Engineering Pune (CoEP), Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University, Institute of Chemical Technology, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Walchand College of Engineering, Sangli, and Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), Sardar Patel College of Engineering (SPCE) [252] Most of these autonomous institutes are ranked the highest in India and have very competitive entry requirements The University of Pune (now Savitribai Phule Pune University), the National Defence Academy, Film and Television Institute of India, Armed Forces Medical College, and National Chemical Laboratory were established in Pune soon after the Indian independence in 1947 Mumbai has an IIT, has National Institute of Industrial Engineering and Nagpur has IIM and AIIMS Other notable institutes in the state are: Maharashtra National Law University, Nagpur (MNLUN), Maharashtra National Law University, Mumbai (MNLUM), Maharashtra National Law University, Aurangabad (MNLUA), Government Law College, Mumbai (GLC), ILS Law College, and Symbiosis Law School (SLS) [citation needed]\n\n\nInfrastructure\nHealth indicators of Maharashtra show that they have attained relatively high growth against a background of high per capita income (PCI) [257] In 2011, the health care system in Maharashtra consisted of 363 rural government hospitals, [258] 23 district hospitals (with 7,561 beds), 4 general hospitals (with 714 beds) mostly under the Maharashtra Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and 380 private medical establishments; these establishments provide the state with more than 30,000 hospital beds [259] It is the first state in India to have nine women's hospitals serving 1,365 beds [259] The state also has a significant number of medical practitioners who hold the Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery qualifications These practitioners primarily use the traditional Indian therapy of Ayurveda, nevertheless, modern western medicine is used as well [260]\n\n\nHealthcare\nHealth indicators of Maharashtra show that they have attained relatively high growth against a background of high per capita income (PCI) [257] In 2011, the

largest energy users, [271] [272] conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centres, and strong environmental movements have kept its per capita energy use to one of the smallest of any Indian state [273] The high electricity demand of the state constitutes 13% of the total installed electricity generation capacity in India, which is derived mainly from fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas [274] Mahavitaran is responsible for the distribution of electricity throughout the state by buying power from Mahanirmiti, captive power plants, other state electricity boards, and private sector power generation companies [273]\n\n\nEnvironmental protection and sustainability\nMaharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) is established and responsible for implementing various

koshimbir (salad) and buttermilk or Sol kadhi A bhaji is a vegetable dish made of a particular vegetable or combination of vegetables Aamti is variant of the curry, typically consisting of a lentil (tur) stock, flavoured with goda masala and sometimes with tamarind or amshul, and jaggery (gul) [281] [282] Varan is nothing but plain dal, a common Indian lentil stew More or less, most of the dishes use coconut, onion, garlic, ginger, red chili powder, green chilies, and mustard though some section of the population traditionally avoid onion and garlics [283] [281]\n\n\nCuisine\nMaharashtrian cuisine includes a variety of dishes ranging from mild to very spicy ones Wheat, rice, jowar, bajri, vegetables, lentils and fruit form staple food of the

represent their occupation This type of dance is represented by both men and women While dancing, they are divided into groups of two These fishermen display the movements of waves and casting of the nets during their koli dance performances [300] [301]\n\n\nTheatre\nModern Theatre in Maharashtra can trace its origins to the British colonial era in the middle of the 19th century It is modelled mainly after the western tradition but also includes forms like Sangeet Natak (musical drama) In recent decades, Marathi Tamasha has also been incorporated in some experimental plays [302] The

the all-new Imperial Newport  By 1956, this would be the first American production car to top 355 hp (265 kW), and the letter series was for many years the most powerful car produced in the United States The engine and transmission were shared with the French automaker Facel Vega in the Facel Vega Excellence and the Cunningham C-4R which was entered at the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans and finished the race With the growing popularity of European sports cars during the late 1940s, Chrysler sought to create a \"drivers car\" with sports car performance but with greater attention to comfort [6]

comfort [6] [8] in the growing post-WWII tradition of grand tourers [1] [2] [9]\n\n\n1956 300B\nThe 1956 300B was fairly similar externally, distinguished by a new tailfin treatment, but with larger engines, and a choice of two versions of the 354 cu in (5.8 L) Hemi V8 producing either 340 or 355 hp (254 or 265 kW), with a 10:1 compression ratio used to achieve the higher horsepower rating A companion of this generation was introduced as the DeSoto Adventurer and the Dodge D-500 that were less luxurious, while still sharing much of the mechanicals, giving DeSoto and Dodge a performance enhanced model, while the 354 CID engine was exclusive to the 300, New Yorker and Imperials The TorqueFlite transmission controls were to the left of the steering wheel and a total of 1,102 were sold Performance was better than the previous year's by its top speed at almost 140 mph (225 km/h) at the Daytona Flying Mile A 6.17 ratio rear differential was also added to the options Front leg room was 44.6 inches [6] New was the Highway Hi-Fi phonograph player This was the last year that coil springs were used for the front suspension [6] [5]\n\n\nSecond generation\nThe 1957 model year 300C was corporately shared with an all new appearance for Chrysler products called the \"Forward Look\" and featuring a \"yawning\" wide trapezoid-shaped front grille which was unique to the 300C, \"Vista-Dome\" windshield, dual headlights, and gradually rising tailfins starting from the doors similar to Chrysler-branded products The wheel diameter changed from 15 in (381 mm) to 14 in (356 mm) while continuing to use drum brakes for all wheels, and to keep the front brakes cool a cooling duct was installed with the air intake located just below the headlights that fed air directly to the front brakes The exterior color list was expanded to offer Jet Black, Parade Green metallic, Copper Brown metallic, Gauguin Red and Cloud White [10] while the interior was tan leather standard and optional interior choices were available from the New Yorker list of which the 300 was based [14]\n\n\n1957 300C\nThe 1957 model year 300C was corporately shared with an all new appearance for

list of which the 300 was based [14]\n\n\n1958 300D\nThe 1958 model year was to be the last use of the FirePower Hemi in the 300 The engine was still 392 cu in (6.4 L), but tuned to 380 hp (280 kW) as standard, while the 392 CID engine was exclusive to the 300 and Imperials Thirty-five cars were built with an extremely rare option called the Bendix \"Electrojector\" fuel injection, [17] with which the 392 cu in (6.4 L) V8 was rated at 390 bhp (291 kW) Due to reliability problems with the primitive onboard computer which controlled the injection system, however, vehicles installed with the fuel injection option were recalled and retrofitted with dual four barrel carburetors [18] Cars that were originally installed with the fuel injection had a special \"300D\" badge attached to the rear fender with additional \"fuel injection\" script included [6]\n\n\n1959 300E\nThe 1959 model year saw the Hemi engines replaced by Chrysler's new Golden Lion wedge-head V8 at 413 cu in (6.8 L) displacement (which Chrysler called \"lion-hearted\"), and remained exclusive to the 300 and Imperials [19] Power output remained about the same at 380 hp (280 kW) while the engine weight dropped by 103 lb (47 kg) and production costs were reduced This model was the last year of body on frame chassis Total sales included 522 coupes and 125 convertibles and the front grille and exterior styling retained the previous years appearance instead of adopting the corporate Chrysler appearance shared with Imperial for 1959 [20] A small \"300\" badge was installed on the left side of the grille perpendicular to the headlights, while the grille was updated to narrow horizontal red bars highlighted by four chrome bars in place of the previous eggcrate grille and only appeared for 1959 [20] New for 1959 was the installation of Goodyear Blue Streak bias-ply tires on 14 in wheels which are now classified as Vintage Racing tires [20]\n\n\nThird generation\nThe 1960 model offered a 375 hp (280 kW) \"Cross-Ram\" version of the 413 cu in (6.8 L) Wedge Head V8 introduced in 1959 To boost power at lower and mid rpms, a special intake manifold was derived Instead of the normal V8 central intake manifold with carburetor(s) on top, the cross-ram consisted of two pairs of 30 in (760 mm) long tuned pipes that criss-crossed so that each set fed the opposite side of the engine The carburetors and air cleaners hung off the sides of the engine over the fender wells These long tubes were tuned so that resonances in the column of air helped force air into the cylinders at those engine speeds [22]\n\n\n1960 300F\nThe 1960 model offered a 375 hp (280 kW) \"Cross-Ram\" version of the 413 cu in (6.8 L) Wedge Head V8 introduced in 1959 To boost power at lower and mid rpms, a

resonances in the column of air helped force air into the cylinders at those engine speeds [22]\n\n\n1961 300G\nThe 1961 model saw another restyle The grille, formerly wider at the bottom than the top, was inverted; the quad headlights, formerly side-by-side, were canted inward at the bottom, [22] in a manner reminiscent of 1958-1960 Lincolns and 1959 Buicks Small parking lamps below the headlights were likewise slanted and V-shaped, and the front bumper was canted up at each end, scoop-like At the rear, the taillights were moved from the fins to the tail below them, and the fins were made sharper-pointed Power windows were standard [22] The standard equipment rear bucket seats continued with a full-length console from the dashboard along the tunnel containing the driveshaft, and were also offered on the New Yorker Custom coupe.\n\n\n1962 300H\nFrom 1962s models, the fins were gone from all Chrysler products, as was the letter series' unique place in the Chrysler lineup; there was now the new Chrysler 300 Sport Series which came as a two-door hardtop, replacing the cancelled Chrysler Windsor, while the convertible remained with the letter series along with a two-door hardtop 300H Externally there was little difference between the 300H and the 300 Sport Series except for a \"300H\" badge on the traditional location on the rear fenders, and many of the 300H's standard features could be ordered as options on the Sport Series The Mercury competitor was the all-new Mercury S-55 with the same approach to luxury and performance in a coupe or convertible and the Buick Wildcat [22]\n\n\nFourth generation\nA more formal, angular, so-called \"crisp, new custom look\" appeared for 1963, ushering in the Chrysler C platform architecture To avoid confusion with the number one, the letter \"I\" was skipped over and the first iteration became the \"300J\" Shared with the 300 Sport Series, Newport and New Yorker series, this body design featured wide C-pillars, minimized bright trim and was the last one styled during Virgil Exner's term as Chrysler's styling chief [22] Medallions featuring CHRYSLER THREE HUNDRED lettering surrounding a large J were mounted on the C-pillars and the rear deck [32] The standard leather-upholstered interior did away with the swivel feature for the front bucket seats while the previous full-length center console was now limited to the front with the rear compartment reverting to a bench seat To address quality and reliability concerns, Chrysler in 1963 introduced a five-year/50,000-mile warranty, a business practice that was unheard of by its competitors in the 1960s\n\n\n1963 300J\nA more formal, angular, so-called \"crisp, new custom look\" appeared for 1963, ushering in the Chrysler C platform architecture To

warranty, a business practice that was unheard of by its competitors in the 1960s\n\n\n1964 300K\nThe convertible returned for the 1964 300K, but the \"cross-ram\" engine became an extra-cost option available on the 300K only A 413 cu in (6.8 L) Wedge with a single Carter AFB 3614S 4-barrel carburetor, a regular intake manifold, and 360 hp (270 kW) was the new standard engine, shared with the Imperial Leather upholstery was no longer standard, a US$94 option ($923 in 2023 dollars  [11]), [36] while the list of available exterior colors expanded extensively with contrasting interior color choices in vinyl The colors available were Formal Black, Wedgewood Blue, Nassau Blue metallic, Monarch Blue metallic, Pine Mist metallic, Sequoia Green metallic, Silver Turquoise metallic, Royal Turquoise metallic, Madison Grey, Rosewood metallic, Royal Ruby metallic, Roman Red, Embassy Gold, Persian White, Dune Beige, Sable Tan metallic, and Silver Mist metallic [10] A mid-year special trim package was the 300K Silver Edition It was offered only as a 2-door hardtop in Silver Mist metallic paint, a vinyl half-roof that gave a targa top appearance and bucket front seats with a reclining passenger seat [36] The bucket seats in all cars were redesigned with the result being a thicker, more substantial look.\n\n\nFifth generation\nThe 1965 300L was the eleventh and final model in the traditional letter series Like every other 1965 Chrysler, it featured a completely restyled body with the crisp lines, slab sides and a tall greenhouse passenger compartment that were introduced by Elwood Engel, successor of Virgil Exner as Chrysler's head of styling It was a linear look and the panoramic windshield that had been used since 1957 was abandoned The car had grown two inches in wheelbase and three inches in overall length Both 2-door hardtop (with crease lines in the roof sheetmetal for the then-popular \"convertible look\") and 2-door convertible body styles were available

except the 300M had spinner-type knock off wheel covers with a \"300M\" medallion in the center, as well as another \"300M\" medallion on the trunk lid The front running lights were moved to the center grille bar and the front turn signals were widened The 300M also had paint stripes along the lower body line instead of the chrome molding found on the non-letter series 300s, \"300M\" medallions on the sides, script \"Three Hundred\" badges and unique tail lights and bezels Three-spoke headlight ornaments were planned, but dropped due to legal issues in some states The interior was identical to the non-letter series 300 except for the \"300M\" medallions The 300M was planned to be powered by the 426 Wedge engine rated at 365 hp (272 kW) This first 300M proposal was cancelled in November 1964 \"to reduce scheduling and plant complexity\" But in 1965 the 300M was revived, this time powered by the 425 hp (317 kW), 426 Hemi engine and a planned production run of 4298, of which 500 were to have the Hemi engine, a $1250 option The Hemi cars would also feature a dual-faced \"7-Liter Hemi\" medallion This proposal was also cancelled as the letter series 300s had lost their prestige and exclusivity as they were simply non-letter series 300s with letter badges [39] The 300M name would not be used again until 1999.\n\n\nSixth generation\nThe 1970 Hurst 300 lacks the

Chrysler from 1955 to 1965. The series was known for its powerful engines, sleek design, and exclusive features. The 300 Letter Series was a significant part of Chrysler's history and has become a beloved and collectible model among car enthusiasts.\n\n## First Generation\n\nThe first generation of the 300 Letter Series was introduced in 1955 and was known as the C-300. The C-300 was a racecar aimed at the NASCAR circuits that was sold for private ownership to qualify for homologation purposes. It featured Chrysler's most powerful engine, the OHV 331 cu in (5.4 L) FirePower \"Hemi\" V8, which produced 300 horsepower. The engine was exclusive to the 300, the New Yorker, and the Imperial Newport. The C-300 was a significant departure from the typical luxury cars of the time, as it was designed with performance in mind rather than comfort.\n\n## 1955 C-300\n\nThe 1955 C-300 was the first of the letter series cars and did not bear a letter. However, it can be retroactively considered the \"300A.\" The C-300 was a racecar aimed at the NASCAR circuits that was sold for private ownership to qualify for homologation purposes. It featured Chrysler's most powerful engine, the OHV 331 cu in (5.4 L) FirePower \"Hemi\" V8, which produced 300 horsepower. The engine and transmission were shared with the French automaker Facel Vega in the Facel Vega Excellence and the Cunningham C-4R, which was entered at the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans and finished the race.\n\n## 1956 300B\n\nThe 1956 300B was similar to the C-300 externally, with a new tailfin treatment. However, it featured larger engines and a choice of two versions of the 354 cu in (5.8 L) Hemi V8, producing either 340 or 355 horsepower. The 354 CID engine was exclusive to the 300, the New Yorker, and the Imperials. The TorqueFlite transmission controls were to the left of the steering wheel, and a total of 1,102 were sold. Performance was better than the previous year's, with a top speed of almost 140 mph at the Daytona Flying Mile.\n\n## 1957 300C\n\nThe 1957 model year 300C was corporately shared with an all-new appearance for Chrysler products called the \"Forward Look.\" It featured a \"yawning\" wide trapezoid-shaped front grille, a \"Vista-Dome\" windshield, dual headlights, and gradually rising tailfins starting from the doors. The wheel diameter changed from 15 in (381 mm) to 14 in (356 mm), while continuing to use drum brakes for all wheels. A cooling duct was installed with the air intake located just below the headlights, which fed air directly to the front brakes.\n\n## 1958 300D\n\nThe 1958 model year was to be the last use of the FirePower Hemi in the 300. The engine was still 392 cu in (6.4 L), but tuned to 380 horsepower as standard. Thirty-five cars were built with an extremely rare option called the Bendix \"Electrojector\" fuel injection, which rated the 392 cu in (6.4 L) V8 at 390 horsepower. Due to reliability problems with the primitive onboard computer that controlled the injection system, however, vehicles installed with the fuel injection option were recalled and retrofitted with dual four-barrel carburetors.\n\n## 1959 300E\n\nThe 1959 model year saw the Hemi engines replaced by Chrysler's new Golden Lion wedge-head V8 at 413 cu in (6.8 L) displacement. Power output remained about the same at 380 horsepower, while the engine weight dropped by 103 lb (47 kg) and production costs were reduced. Total sales included 522 coupes and 125 convertibles. The front grille and exterior styling retained the previous year's appearance, instead of adopting the corporate Chrysler appearance shared with Imperial for 1959.\n\n## 1959 300E Special\n\nA small \"300\" badge was installed on the left side of the grille perpendicular to the headlights, while the grille was updated to narrow horizontal red bars highlighted by four chrome bars in place of the previous eggcrate grille. This was a one-year-only feature for the 1959 model year. New for 1959 was the installation of Goodyear Blue Streak bias-ply tires on 14 in wheels, which are now classified as Vintage Racing tires.\n\n## Third Generation\n\nThe 1960 model offered a 375 horsepower \"Cross-Ram\" version of the 413 cu in (6.8 L) Wedge Head V8 introduced in 1959. To boost power at lower and mid rpms, a special intake manifold was derived. Instead of the normal V8 central intake manifold with carburetor(s) on top, the cross-ram consisted of two pairs of 30 in (760 mm) long tuned pipes that crisscrossed so that each set fed the opposite side of the engine.\n\n## 1960 300F\n\nThe 1960 model offered a 375 horsepower \"Cross-Ram\" version of the 413 cu in (6.8 L) Wedge Head V8 introduced in 1959. To boost power at lower and mid rpms, a special intake manifold was derived. Instead of the normal V8 central intake manifold with carburetor(s) on top, the cross-ram consisted of two pairs of 30 in (760 mm) long tuned pipes that crisscrossed so that each set fed the opposite side of the engine.\n\n## 1961 300G\n\nThe 1961 model saw another restyle. The grille, formerly wider at the bottom than the top, was inverted; the quad headlights, formerly side-by-side, were canted inward at the bottom, in a manner reminiscent of 1958-1960 Lincolns and 1959 Buicks. Small parking lamps below the headlights were likewise slanted and V-shaped, and the front bumper was canted up at each end, scoop-like. At the rear, the taillights were moved from the fins to the tail below them, and the fins were made sharper-pointed.\n\n## 1962 300H\n\nFrom 1962's models, the fins were gone from all Chrysler products, as was the letter series' unique place in the Chrysler lineup. The convertible remained with the letter series, along with a two-door hardtop 300H. Externally, there was little difference between the 300H and the 300 Sport Series except for a \"300H\" badge on the traditional location on the rear fenders. Many of the 300H's standard features could be ordered as options on the Sport Series.\n\n## Fourth Generation\n\nA more formal, angular, so-called \"crisp, new custom look\" appeared for 1963, ushering in the Chrysler C platform architecture. To avoid confusion with the number one, the letter \"I\" was skipped over and the first iteration became the \"300J.\" Shared with the 300 Sport Series, Newport, and New Yorker series, this body design featured wide C-pillars, minimized bright trim, and was the last one styled during Virgil Exner's term as Chrysler's styling chief.\n\n## 1963 300J\n\nA more formal, angular, so-called \"crisp, new custom look\" appeared for 1963, ushering in the Chrysler C platform architecture. To avoid confusion with the number one, the letter \"I\" was skipped over and the first iteration became the \"300J.\" Shared with the 300 Sport Series, Newport, and New Yorker series, this body design featured wide C-pillars, minimized bright trim, and was the last one styled during Virgil Exner's term as Chrysler's styling chief.\n\n## 1964 300K\n\nThe convertible returned for the 1964 300K, but the \"cross-ram\" engine became an extra-cost option available on the 300K only. A 413 cu in (6.8 L) Wedge with a single Carter AFB 3614S 4-barrel carburetor, a regular intake manifold, and 360 horsepower was the new standard engine, shared with the Imperial. Leather upholstery was no longer standard, a US$94 option ($923 in 2023 dollars), while the list of available exterior colors expanded extensively with contrasting interior color choices in vinyl.\n\n## 1965 300L\n\nThe 1965 300L was the eleventh and final model in the traditional letter series. Like every other 1965 Chrysler, it featured a completely restyled body with the crisp lines, slab sides, and a tall greenhouse passenger compartment that were introduced by Elwood Engel, successor of Virgil Exner as Chrysler's head of styling. The car had grown two inches in wheelbase and three inches in overall length. Both 2-door hardtop (with crease lines in the roof sheetmetal for the then-popular \"convertible look\") and 2-door convertible body styles were available.\n\n## Sixth Generation\n\nThe 1970 Hurst 300 lacks the single-letter suffix of its forebears and appeared five years after the last Letter Series Chrysler, the 300L. Many automobile historians do not include the Hurst 300 as a Letter Series model. The concept of the car, however, does fit with the Letter Series cars, as it was a high-performance variant of the luxury 300, built with the input of aftermarket parts manufacturer Hurst Performance. Only 485 units are believed to have been built.\n\n## Collectibility\n\nAll original letter series cars are considered collectible as of 2023. However, the early years are much more desirable. The C-300 and 300B, especially red/maroon examples, are increasingly becoming some of the most valuable models of all 1950s performance cars due to their exquisite styling, high performance, and rarity. The 300C through 300G convertibles are the most desirable price-wise due to their scarcity and low survival rates. The coming of the regular 300 series cars in 1962 makes the subsequent letter series seem less special and less desirable to collectors.\n\n## Production Numbers\n\nProduction numbers for the Chrysler 300 Letter Series are as follows:\n\n* 1955 C-300: 441 units\n* 1956 300B: 1,102 units\n* 1957 300C: 1,910 units\n* 1958 300D: 1,300 units\n* 1959 300E: 647 units\n* 1960 300F: 1,102 units\n* 1961

with larger engines, and a choice of two versions of the 354 cu in (5.8 L) Hemi V8 producing either 340 or 355 hp (254 or 265 kW), with a 10:1 compression ratio used to achieve the higher horsepower rating A companion of this generation was introduced as the DeSoto Adventurer and the Dodge D-500 that were less luxurious, while still sharing much of the mechanicals, giving DeSoto and Dodge a performance enhanced model, while the 354 CID engine was exclusive to the 300, New Yorker and Imperials The TorqueFlite transmission controls were to the left of the steering wheel and a total of 1,102 were sold Performance was better than the previous year's by its top speed at almost 140 mph (225 km/h) at the Daytona Flying Mile A 6.17 ratio rear differential was also added to the options

fender with additional \"fuel injection\" script included [6]\n\n\n1959 300E\nThe 1959 model year saw the Hemi engines replaced by Chrysler's new Golden Lion wedge-head V8 at 413 cu in (6.8 L) displacement (which Chrysler called \"lion-hearted\"), and remained exclusive to the 300 and Imperials [19] Power output remained about the same at 380 hp (280 kW) while the engine weight dropped by

The cross-ram 390 hp engine had been discontinued, leaving the 413 cu in (6.8 L) engine with regular inlet manifold, single 4-barrel carburetion, unsilenced air cleaner, special camshaft and dual exhaust as the only engine option [37] With the introduction of the Chrysler B platform Dodge Coronet and the Plymouth Satellite, the performance coupe tradition was handed off from the 300 and the subsequent letter series model naming convention was discontinued [38]\n\n\n1965 300L\nThe 1965 300L was the eleventh and final model in the traditional letter series Like every other 1965 Chrysler, it featured a completely restyled body with the crisp lines, slab sides and a tall greenhouse passenger compartment that were introduced by Elwood Engel, successor of Virgil Exner as Chrysler's head

was discontinued [38]\n\n\n1966 300M\nIntending to return the 300 letter series to its roots, Chrysler proposed the 1966 300M as a clay mockup in October 1963 The exterior was similar to the 300L, except the 300M had spinner-type knock off wheel covers with a \"300M\" medallion in the center, as well as another \"300M\" medallion on the trunk lid The front running lights were moved to the center grille bar and the front turn signals were widened The 300M also had paint stripes along the lower body line instead of the chrome molding found on the non-letter series 300s, \"300M\" medallions on the sides, script \"Three Hundred\" badges and unique tail lights and bezels Three-spoke headlight ornaments were planned, but dropped due to legal issues in some states The interior was identical to the non-letter series 300 except for the \"300M\" medallions The 300M was planned to be powered by the 426 Wedge engine rated at 365 hp (272 kW) This first 300M proposal was cancelled in November 1964 \"to reduce scheduling and plant complexity\" But in 1965 the 300M was revived, this time powered by the 425 hp (317 kW), 426 Hemi engine and a planned production run of 4298, of which 500 were to have the Hemi engine, a $1250 option The Hemi cars would also feature a dual-faced \"7-Liter Hemi\" medallion This proposal was also cancelled as the letter series 300s had lost their prestige and exclusivity as they were simply non-letter series 300s with letter badges [39] The 300M name would not be used again until 1999.\n\n\nSixth generation\nThe 1970 Hurst 300 lacks the single-letter suffix of its forebears and appeared five years after the last Letter Series Chrysler, the 300L Many automobile historians do not include the Hurst 300 as a Letter Series model The concept of the car, however, does fit with the Letter Series cars, as it was a high-performance variant of the luxury 300, built with the input of aftermarket parts manufacturer Hurst Performance Only 485 units are believed to have been built [40]\n\n\n1970 Hurst 300\nThe 1970 Hurst 300 lacks the single-letter suffix of its forebears and appeared five years after the last Letter Series Chrysler,

considered collectible as of 2023 [update], but the early years are much more desirable The C-300 and 300B, especially red/maroon examples [citation needed], are increasingly becoming some of the most valuable models of all 1950s performance cars due to their exquisite styling, high performance, and rarity  The 300C through 300G convertibles are the most desirable price-wise due to their scarcity and low survival rates; the coming of the regular 300 series cars in 1962 makes the subsequent letter series seem less special and less desirable to collectors.\n\n\nProduction numbers\n\n\nSee

{"title": "Cornish_language", "content": "\nClassification\nCornish is a Southwestern Brittonic language, [28] a branch of the Insular Celtic section of the Celtic language family, which is a sub-family of the Indo-European language family [29] Brittonic also includes Welsh, Breton, Cumbric and possibly Pictish, the last two of which are extinct Scottish Gaelic, Irish and Manx are part of the separate Goidelic branch of Insular Celtic.\n\n\nHistory\nCornish evolved from the Common Brittonic spoken throughout Britain south of the Firth of Forth during the British Iron Age and Roman period As a result of westward Anglo-Saxon expansion, the Britons of the southwest were separated from those in modern-day Wales and Cumbria, which Jackson links to the defeat of the Britons at the Battle of Deorham in about 577 [32] The western dialects eventually evolved into modern Welsh and the now extinct Cumbric, while Southwestern Brittonic developed into Cornish and Breton, the latter as a result of emigration to parts of the continent, known as Brittany over the following centuries [33]\n\n\nOld Cornish\nThe area controlled by the southwestern Britons was progressively reduced by the expansion of Wessex over the next few centuries During the Old Cornish (Kernewek Koth) [34] period (800–1200), the Cornish-speaking area was largely coterminous with modern-day Cornwall, after the Saxons had taken over Devon in their south-westward advance, which probably was facilitated by a second migration wave to Brittany that resulted in the partial depopulation of Devon [35]\n\n\nMiddle Cornish\nThe Cornish language continued to flourish well through the Middle Cornish (Kernewek Kres) [34] period (1200–1600), reaching a peak of about 39,000 speakers in the 13th century, after which the number started to decline [48] [49] This period provided the bulk of traditional Cornish literature, and was used to reconstruct the language during its revival Most important is the Ordinalia, a cycle of three mystery plays, Origo Mundi, Passio Christi and Resurrexio Domini Together these provide about 8,734 lines of text The three plays exhibit a mixture of English and Brittonic influences, and, like other Cornish literature, may have been written at Glasney College near Penryn [50] From this period also are the hagiographical dramas Beunans Meriasek (The Life of Meriasek) and Bewnans Ke (The Life of Ke), both of which feature as an antagonist the villainous and tyrannical King Tewdar (or Teudar), a historical medieval king in Armorica and Cornwall, who, in these plays, has been interpreted as a lampoon of either of the Tudor kings Henry VII or Henry VIII [51]\n\n\nLate Cornish\n\nBy the middle of the 17th century, the language had retreated to Penwith and Kerrier, and transmission of the language to new generations had almost entirely ceased In his Survey of Cornwall, published in 1602, Richard Carew writes:\n\nDecline of Cornish speakers between 1300 and 1800\nIt is difficult to state with certainty when Cornish ceased to be spoken, due to the fact that its last speakers were of relatively low social class and that the definition of what constitutes \"a living language\" is not clear cut Peter Pool argues that by 1800 nobody was using Cornish as a daily language and no evidence exists of anyone capable of conversing in the language at that date [75] However, passive speakers, semi-speakers and rememberers, who retain some competence in the language despite not being fluent nor using the language in daily life, generally survive even longer.\n\n\nRevived Cornish\nIn 1904, the Celtic language scholar and Cornish cultural activist Henry Jenner published A Handbook of the Cornish Language The publication of this book is often considered to be the point at which the revival movement started Jenner wrote about the Cornish language in 1905, \"one may fairly say that most of what there was of it has been preserved, and that it has been continuously preserved, for there has never been a time when there were not some Cornishmen who knew some Cornish.\" [78]\n\n\nGeographic distribution and number of speakers\nSpeakers of Cornish reside primarily in Cornwall, which has a population of 563,600 (2017 estimate) There are also some speakers living outside Cornwall, particularly in the countries of the Cornish diaspora, as well as in other Celtic nations Estimates of the number of Cornish speakers vary according to the definition of a speaker, and is difficult to determine accurately due to the individualised nature of language take-up Nevertheless, there is recognition that the number of Cornish speakers is growing [14] From before the 1980s to the end of the 20th century there was a sixfold increase in the number of speakers to around 300 [89] One figure for the number of people who know a few basic words, such as knowing that \"Kernow\" means \"Cornwall\", was 300,000; the same survey gave the number of people able to have simple conversations as 3,000 [90]\n\n\nLegal status and recognition\nIn 2002, Cornish was recognized by the UK government under Part II of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages [101] UNESCO's Atlas of World Languages classifies Cornish as \"critically endangered\" UNESCO has said that a previous classification of 'extinct' \"does not reflect the current situation for Cornish\" and is \"no longer accurate\" [13]\n\n\nWithin the UK\nCornwall Council's policy is to support the language, in line with the European Charter A motion was passed in November 2009 in which the council promoted the inclusion of Cornish, as appropriate and where possible, in council publications and on signs [102] This plan has drawn some criticism [103] In October 2015, The council announced that staff would be encouraged to use \"basic words and phrases\" in Cornish when dealing with the public [104] In 2021 Cornwall Council prohibited a marriage ceremony from being conducted in Cornish as the Marriage Act 1949 only allowed for marriage ceremonies in English or Welsh [105]\n\n\nOrthography\nUntil around the middle of the 11th century, Old Cornish scribes used a traditional spelling system shared with Old Breton and Old Welsh, based on the pronunciation of British Latin [109] [110] By the time of the Vocabularium Cornicum, usually dated to around 1100, Old English spelling conventions, such as the use of thorn (Þ, þ) and eth (Ð, ð) for dental fricatives, and wynn (Ƿ, ƿ) for /w/, had come into use, allowing documents written at this time to be distinguished from Old Welsh, which rarely uses these characters, and Old Breton, which does not use them at all [111] Old Cornish features include using initial ⟨ch⟩, ⟨c⟩, or ⟨k⟩ for /k/, and, in internal and final position, ⟨p⟩, ⟨t⟩, ⟨c⟩, ⟨b⟩, ⟨d⟩, and ⟨g⟩ are generally used for the phonemes /b/, /d/, /ɡ/, /β/, /ð/, and /ɣ/ respectively, meaning that the results of Brittonic lenition are not usually apparent from the orthography at this time [112] [109]\n\n\nOld Cornish orthography\nUntil around the middle of the 11th century, Old Cornish scribes used a traditional spelling system shared with Old Breton and Old Welsh, based on the pronunciation of British Latin [109] [110] By the time of the Vocabularium Cornicum, usually dated to around 1100, Old English spelling conventions, such as the use of thorn (Þ, þ) and eth (Ð, ð) for dental fricatives, and wynn (Ƿ, ƿ) for /w/, had come into use, allowing documents written at this time to be distinguished from Old Welsh, which rarely uses these characters, and Old Breton, which does not use them at all [111] Old Cornish features include using initial ⟨ch⟩, ⟨c⟩, or ⟨k⟩ for /k/, and, in internal and final position, ⟨p⟩, ⟨t⟩, ⟨c⟩, ⟨b⟩, ⟨d⟩, and ⟨g⟩ are generally used for the phonemes /b/, /d/, /ɡ/, /β/, /ð/, and /ɣ/ respectively, meaning that the results of Brittonic lenition are not usually apparent from the orthography at this time [112] [109]\n\n\nMiddle Cornish orthography\nMiddle Cornish orthography has a significant level of variation, and shows influence from Middle English spelling practices [113] Yogh (Ȝ ȝ) is used in certain Middle Cornish texts, where it is used to represent a variety of sounds, including the dental fricatives /θ/ and /ð/, a usage which is unique to Middle Cornish and is never found in Middle English [114] [115] Middle Cornish scribes tend to use ⟨c⟩ for /k/ before back vowels, and ⟨k⟩ for /k/ before front vowels, though this is not always true, and this rule is less consistent in certain texts [116] Middle Cornish scribes almost universally use ⟨wh⟩ to represent /ʍ/ (or /hw/), as in Middle English Middle Cornish, especially towards the end of this period, tends to use orthographic ⟨g⟩ and ⟨b⟩ in word-final position in stressed monosyllables, and ⟨k⟩ and ⟨p⟩ in word-final position in unstressed final syllables, to represent the reflexes of late Brittonic /ɡ/ and /b/, respectively [117]\n\n\nLate Cornish orthography\nWritten sources from this period are often spelled following English spelling conventions since many of the writers of the time had not been exposed to Middle Cornish texts or the Cornish orthography within them Around 1700, Edward Lhuyd visited Cornwall, introducing his own partly phonetic orthography that he used in his Archaeologia Britannica, which was adopted by some local writers, leading to the use of some Lhuydian features such as the use of circumflexes to denote long vowels, ⟨k⟩ before front vowels, word-final ⟨i⟩, and the use of ⟨dh⟩ to represent the voiced dental fricative /ð/ [118] [115]\n\n\nRevived Cornish orthography\nAfter the publication of Jenner's Handbook of the Cornish Language, the earliest revivalists used Jenner's orthography, which was influenced by Lhuyd's system This system was abandoned following the development by Nance of a \"unified spelling\", later known as Unified Cornish, a system based on a standardization of the orthography of the early Middle Cornish texts [119] Nance's system was used by almost all Revived Cornish speakers and writers until the 1970s [120] Criticism of Nance's system, particularly the relationship of spelling to sounds and the phonological basis of Unified Cornish, resulted in rival orthographies appearing by the early 1980s, [121] including Gendal's Modern Cornish, based on Late Cornish native writers and Lhuyd, and Ken George's Kernewek Kemmyn, a mainly morphophonemic orthography based on George's reconstruction of Middle Cornish c. 1500, which features a number of orthographic, and phonological, distinctions not found in Unified Cornish [122] [115] Kernewek Kemmyn is characterised by the use of universal ⟨k⟩ for /k/ (instead of ⟨c⟩ before back vowels as in Unified); ⟨hw⟩ for /hw/, instead of ⟨wh⟩ as in Unified; and ⟨y⟩, ⟨oe⟩, and ⟨eu⟩ to represent the phonemes /ɪ/, /o/, and /œ/ respectively, which are not found in Unified Cornish Criticism of all of these systems, especially Kernewek Kemmyn, by Nicolas Williams, [123] resulted in the creation of Unified Cornish Revised, a modified version of Nance's orthography, featuring: an additional phoneme not distinguished by Nance, \"ö in German schön\", represented in the UCR orthography by ⟨ue⟩; replacement of ⟨y⟩ with ⟨e⟩ in many words; internal ⟨h⟩ rather than ⟨gh⟩; and use of final ⟨b⟩, ⟨g⟩, and ⟨dh⟩ in stressed monosyllables [124] A Standard Written Form, intended as a compromise orthography for official and educational purposes, was introduced in 2008, although a number of previous orthographic systems remain in use and, in response to the publication of the SWF, another new orthography, Kernowek Standard, was created, mainly by Nicholas Williams and Michael Everson, which is proposed as an amended version of the Standard Written Form [125]\n\n\nPhonology\nThe phonological system of Old Cornish, inherited from Proto-Southwestern Brittonic and originally differing little from Old Breton and Old Welsh, underwent various changes during its Middle and Late phases, eventually resulting in several characteristics not found in the other Brittonic languages The first sound change to distinguish Cornish from both Breton and Welsh, the assibilation of the dental stops /t/ and /d/ in medial and final position, had begun by the time of the Vocabularium Cornicum, c. 1100 or earlier [126] This change, and the subsequent, or perhaps dialectical, palatalization (or occasional rhotacization in a few words) of these sounds, results in orthographic forms such as Middle Cornish tas 'father', Late Cornish tâz (Welsh tad), Middle Cornish cresy 'believe', Late Cornish cregy (Welsh credu), and Middle Cornish gasa 'leave', Late Cornish gara (Welsh gadael) [127] A further characteristic sound change, pre-occlusion, occurred during the 16th century, resulting in the nasals /nn/ and /mm/ being realised as  [ᵈn] and  [ᵇm] respectively in stressed syllables, and giving Late Cornish forms such as pedn 'head' (Welsh pen) and kabm 'crooked' (Welsh cam) [127]\n\n\nVocabulary\nCornish is a Celtic language, and the majority of its vocabulary, when usage frequency is taken into account, at every documented stage of its history is inherited direct from Proto-Celtic, [135] either through the ancestral Proto-Indo-European language, or through vocabulary borrowed from unknown substrate language(s) at some point in the development of the Celtic proto-language from PIE [136] Examples of the PIE > PCelt development are various terms related to kinship and people, including mam 'mother', modereb 'aunt, mother's sister', huir 'sister', mab 'son', gur 'man', den 'person, human', and tus 'people', and words for parts of the body, including lof 'hand' and dans 'tooth' [137] Inherited adjectives with an Indo-European etymology include newyth 'new', ledan 'broad, wide', rud 'red', hen 'old', iouenc 'young', and byw 'alive, living' [138]\n\n\nGrammar\nThe grammar of Cornish shares with other Celtic languages a number of features which, while not unique, are unusual in an Indo-European context The grammatical features most unfamiliar to English speakers of the language are the initial consonant mutations, the verb–subject–object word order, inflected prepositions, fronting of emphasised syntactic elements and the use of two different forms for 'to be'.\n\n\nMorphology\nCornish has initial consonant mutation: The first sound of a Cornish word may change according to grammatical context As in Breton, there are four types of mutation in Cornish (compared with three in Welsh, two in Irish and Manx and one in Scottish Gaelic) These changes apply to only certain letters (sounds) in particular grammatical contexts, some of which are given below: [145]\n\n\nMutations\nCornish has initial consonant mutation: The first sound of a Cornish word may change according to grammatical context As in Breton, there are four types of mutation in Cornish (compared with three in Welsh, two in Irish and Manx and one in Scottish Gaelic) These changes apply to only certain letters (sounds) in particular grammatical contexts, some of which are given below: [145]\n\n\nArticles\nCornish has no indefinite article Porth can either mean 'harbour' [146] or 'a harbour' In certain contexts, unn can be used, with the meaning 'a certain, a particular', e.g unn porth 'a certain harbour' There is, however, a definite article an 'the', which is used for all nouns regardless of their gender or number, e.g an porth 'the harbour' [147]\n\n\nNouns\nCornish nouns belong to one of two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine, but are not inflected for case Nouns may be singular or plural Plurals can be formed in various ways, depending on the noun: [148]\n\n\nVerbs\nVerbs are conjugated for person, number, tense and mood For example, the verbal noun gweles 'see' has derived forms such as 1st person singular present indicative gwelav 'I see', 3rd person plural imperfect indicative gwelens 'they saw', and 2nd person singular imperative gwel 'see!' [149] Grammatical categories can be indicated either by inflection of the main verb, or by the use of auxiliary verbs such as bos 'be' or gul 'do' [150]\n\n\nPrepositions\nCornish uses inflected (or conjugated) prepositions: Prepositions are inflected for person and number For example, gans (with, by) has derived forms such as genev 'with me', ganso 'with him', and genowgh 'with you (plural)' [151]\n\n\nSyntax\nWord order in Cornish is somewhat fluid and varies depending on several factors such as the intended element to be emphasised and whether a statement is negative or affirmative In a study on Cornish word order in the play Bewnans Meriasek (c. 1500), Ken George has argued that the most common word order in main clauses in Middle Cornish was, in affirmative statements, SVO, with the verb in the third person singular: [152]\n\n\nCulture\nThe Celtic Congress and Celtic League are groups that advocate cooperation amongst the Celtic Nations in order to protect and promote Celtic languages and cultures, thus working in the interests of the Cornish language.\n\n\nCultural events\nCornwall has had cultural events associated with the language, including the international Celtic Media Festival, hosted in St Ives in 1997 The Old Cornwall Society has promoted the use of the language at events and meetings Two examples of ceremonies that are performed in both the English and Cornish languages are Crying the Neck [168] and the annual mid-summer bonfires [169]\n\n\nStudy and teaching\nCornish is taught in some schools; it was previously taught at degree level at the University of Wales, though the only existing course in the language at university level is as part of a course in Cornish studies at the University of Exeter [175] In March 2008 a course in the language was started as part of the Celtic Studies curriculum at the University of Vienna, Austria.\nThe University of Cambridge offers courses in Cornish through its John Trim Resources Centre, which is part of the university's Language Centre [176] In addition, the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic (which is part of the Faculty of English) also carries out research into the Cornish language [177]\n\n\nCornish studies\nWilliam Scawen produced a manuscript on the declining Cornish language that continually evolved until he died in 1689, aged 89 He was one of the first to realise the language was dying out and wrote detailed manuscripts which he started working on when he was 78 The only version that was ever published was a short first draft but the final version, which he worked on until his death, is a few hundred pages long [186] At the same time a group of scholars led by John Keigwin (nephew of William Scawen) of Mousehole tried to preserve and further the Cornish language and chose to write in Cornish One of their number, Nicholas Boson, tells how he had been discouraged from using Cornish to servants by his mother [187] This group left behind a large number of translations of parts of the Bible, proverbs and songs They were contacted by the Welsh linguist Edward Lhuyd, who came to Cornwall to study the language [188]\n\n\nLiterature\nIn 1981, the Breton library Preder edited Passyon agan arluth (Passion of our lord), a 15th-century Cornish poem [194] The first complete translation of the Bible into Cornish, translated from English, was published in 2011 Another Bible translation project translating from original languages is underway The New Testament and Psalms were posted on-line on YouVersion (Bible.com) and Bibles.org in July 2014 by the Bible Society.\n\n\nRecent Modern Cornish literature\nIn 1981, the Breton library Preder edited Passyon agan arluth (Passion of our lord), a 15th-century Cornish poem [194] The first complete translation of the Bible into Cornish, translated from English, was published in 2011 Another Bible translation project translating from original languages is underway The New Testament and Psalms were posted on-line on YouVersion (Bible.com) and Bibles.org in July 2014 by the Bible Society.\n\n\nMedia\nIn 1983 BBC Radio Cornwall started broadcasting around two minutes of Cornish every week In 1987, however, they gave over 15 minutes of airtime on Sunday mornings for a programme called Kroeder Kroghen ('Holdall'), presented by John King, running until the early 1990s [213] It was eventually replaced with a five-minute news bulletin called An Nowodhow ('The News') The bulletin was presented every Sunday evening for many years by Rod Lyon, then Elizabeth Stewart, and currently a team presents in rotation [214] Pirate FM ran short bulletins on Saturday lunchtimes from 1998 to 1999 In 2006, Matthew Clarke who had presented the Pirate FM bulletin, launched a web-streamed news bulletin called Nowodhow an Seythen ('Weekly News'), which in 2008 was merged into a new weekly magazine podcast Radyo an Gernewegva (RanG).\n\n\nMusic\nEnglish composer Peter Warlock wrote a Christmas carol in Cornish (setting words by Henry Jenner) [221] The Cornish electronic musician Aphex Twin has used Cornish names for track titles, most notably on his Drukqs album.\n\n\nPlace-names and surnames\nThe Cornish language features in the toponymy of Cornwall, with a significant contrast between English place-names prevalent in eastern Cornwall and Cornish place-names to the west of the Camel-Fowey river valleys, where English place-names are much less common [223] Hundreds of Cornish family names have an etymology in the Cornish language, the majority of which are derived from Cornish place-names [224] Long before the agreement of the Standard Written Form of Cornish in the 21st century, Late Cornish orthography in the Early Modern period usually followed Welsh to English transliteration, phonetically rendering C for K, I for Y, U for W, and Z for S This meant that place names were adopted into English with spellings such as 'Porthcurno' and 'Penzance'; they are written Porth Kernow and Pen Sans in the Standard Written Form of Cornish, agreed upon in 2008 Likewise words such as Enys ('island') can be found spelled as Ince as at Ince Castle These apparent mistransliterations can, however, reveal an insight into how names and places were actually pronounced, explaining, for example, how anglicised Launceston is still pronounced  [ˈlansǝn] with emphasis on the first element, [225] perhaps from Cornish Lann Stefan, though the Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names considers this unlikely [226]\n\n\nSamples\nFrom the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nDictionaries\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Cornish Language**\n\nThe Cornish language is a Southwestern Brittonic language, a branch of the Insular Celtic section of the Celtic language family, which is a sub-family of the Indo-European language family. Brittonic also includes Welsh, Breton, Cumbric, and possibly Pictish, the last two of which are extinct. Scottish Gaelic, Irish, and Manx are part of the separate Goidelic branch of Insular Celtic.\n\n**Classification**\n\nCornish is a Southwestern Brittonic language, a branch of the Insular Celtic section of the Celtic language family, which is a sub-family of the Indo-European language family. Brittonic also includes Welsh, Breton, Cumbric, and possibly Pictish, the last two of which are extinct. Scottish Gaelic, Irish, and Manx are part of the separate Goidelic branch of Insular Celtic.\n\n**History**\n\nCornish evolved from the Common Brittonic spoken throughout Britain south of the Firth of Forth during the British Iron Age and Roman period. As a result of westward Anglo-Saxon expansion, the Britons of the southwest were separated from those in modern-day Wales and Cumbria, which Jackson links to the defeat of the Britons at the Battle of Deorham in about 577. The western dialects eventually evolved into modern Welsh and the now extinct Cumbric, while Southwestern Brittonic developed into Cornish and Breton, the latter as a result of emigration to parts of the continent, known as Brittany over the following centuries.\n\n**Old Cornish**\n\nThe area controlled by the southwestern Britons was progressively reduced by the expansion of Wessex over the next few centuries. During the Old Cornish (Kernewek Koth) period (800-1200), the Cornish-speaking area was largely coterminous with modern-day Cornwall, after the Saxons had taken over Devon in their south-westward advance, which probably was facilitated by a second migration wave to Brittany that resulted in the partial depopulation of Devon.\n\n**Middle Cornish**\n\nThe Cornish language continued to flourish well through the Middle Cornish (Kernewek Kres) period (1200-1600), reaching a peak of about 39,000 speakers in the 13th century, after which the number started to decline. This period provided the bulk of traditional Cornish literature, and was used to reconstruct the language during its revival. Most important is the Ordinalia, a cycle of three mystery plays, Origo Mundi, Passio Christi and Resurrexio Domini. Together these provide about 8,734 lines of text. The three plays exhibit a mixture of English and Brittonic influences, and, like other Cornish literature, may have been written at Glasney College near Penryn. From this period also are the hagiographical dramas Beunans Meriasek (The Life of Meriasek) and Bewnans Ke (The Life of Ke), both of which feature as an antagonist the villainous and tyrannical King Tewdar (or Teudar), a historical medieval king in Armorica and Cornwall, who, in these plays, has been interpreted as a lampoon of either of the Tudor kings Henry VII or Henry VIII.\n\n**Late Cornish**\n\nBy the middle of the 17th century, the language had retreated to Penwith and Kerrier, and transmission of the language to new generations had almost entirely ceased. In his Survey of Cornwall, published in 1602, Richard Carew writes:\n\n\"It is difficult to state with certainty when Cornish ceased to be spoken, due to the fact that its last speakers were of relatively low social class and that the definition of what constitutes 'a living language' is not clear cut.\"\n\n**Revived Cornish**\n\nIn 1904, the Celtic language scholar and Cornish cultural activist Henry Jenner published A Handbook of the Cornish Language. The publication of this book is often considered to be the point at which the revival movement started. Jenner wrote about the Cornish language in 1905, \"one may fairly say that most of what there was of it has been preserved, and that it has been continuously preserved, for there has never been a time when there were not some Cornishmen who knew some Cornish.\"\n\n**Geographic Distribution and Number of Speakers**\n\nSpeakers of Cornish reside primarily in Cornwall, which has a population of 563,600 (2017 estimate). There are also some speakers living outside Cornwall, particularly in the countries of the Cornish diaspora, as well as in other Celtic nations. Estimates of the number of Cornish speakers vary according to the definition of a speaker, and is difficult to determine accurately due to the individualised nature of language take-up. From before the 1980s to the end of the 20th century there was a sixfold increase in the number of speakers to around 300. One figure for the number of people who know a few basic words, such as knowing that \"Kernow\" means \"Cornwall\", was 300,000; the same survey gave the number of people able to have simple conversations as 3,000.\n\n**Legal Status and Recognition**\n\nIn 2002, Cornish was recognized by the UK government under Part II of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. UNESCO's Atlas of World Languages classifies Cornish as \"critically endangered\". UNESCO has said that a previous classification of 'extinct' \"does not reflect the current situation for Cornish\" and is \"no longer accurate\".\n\n**Orthography**\n\nUntil around the middle of the 11th century, Old Cornish scribes used a traditional spelling system shared with Old Breton and Old Welsh, based on the pronunciation of British Latin. By the time of the Vocabularium Cornicum, usually dated to around 1100, Old English spelling conventions, such as the use of thorn (Þ, þ) and eth (Ð, ð) for dental fricatives, and wynn (Ƿ, ƿ) for /w/, had come into use, allowing documents written at this time to be distinguished from Old Welsh, which rarely uses these characters, and Old Breton, which does not use them at all. Middle Cornish scribes tend to use ⟨c⟩ for /k/ before back vowels, and ⟨k⟩ for /k/ before front vowels, though this is not always true, and this rule is less consistent in certain texts.\n\n**Phonology**\n\nThe phonological system of Old Cornish, inherited from Proto-Southwestern Brittonic and originally differing little from Old Breton and Old Welsh, underwent various changes during its Middle and Late phases, eventually resulting in several characteristics not found in the other Brittonic languages. The first sound change to distinguish Cornish from both Breton and Welsh, the assibilation of the dental stops /t/ and /d/ in medial and final position, had begun by the time of the Vocabularium Cornicum, c. 1100 or earlier. A further characteristic sound change, pre-occlusion, occurred during the 16th century, resulting in the nasals /nn/ and /mm/ being realised as  [ᵈn] and  [ᵇm] respectively in stressed syllables, and giving Late Cornish forms such as pedn 'head' (Welsh pen) and kabm 'crooked' (Welsh cam).\n\n**Vocabulary**\n\nCornish is a Celtic language, and the majority of its vocabulary, when usage frequency is taken into account, at every documented stage of its history is inherited direct from Proto-Celtic, either through the ancestral Proto-Indo-European language, or through vocabulary borrowed from unknown substrate language(s) at some point in the development of the Celtic proto-language from PIE. Examples of the PIE > PCelt development are various terms related to kinship and people, including mam 'mother', modereb 'aunt, mother's sister', huir 'sister', mab 'son', gur 'man', den 'person, human', and tus 'people', and words for parts of the body, including lof 'hand' and dans 'tooth'.\n\n**Grammar**\n\nThe grammar of Cornish shares with other Celtic languages a number of features which, while not unique, are unusual in an Indo-European context. The grammatical features most unfamiliar to English speakers of the language are the initial consonant mutations, the verb–subject–object word order, inflected prepositions, fronting of emphasised syntactic elements and the use of two different forms for 'to be'.\n\n**Morphology**\n\nCornish has initial consonant mutation: The first sound of a Cornish word may change according to grammatical context. As in Breton, there are four types of mutation in Cornish (compared with three in Welsh, two in Irish and Manx and one in Scottish Gaelic) These changes apply to only certain letters (sounds) in particular grammatical contexts, some of which are given below:\n\n* **Articles**\nCornish has no indefinite article. Porth can either mean 'harbour' or 'a harbour'. In certain contexts, unn can be used, with the meaning 'a certain, a particular', e.g unn porth 'a certain harbour'. There is, however, a definite article an 'the', which is used for all nouns regardless of their gender or number, e.g an porth 'the harbour'.\n* **Nouns**\nCornish nouns belong to one of two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine, but are not inflected for case. Nouns may be singular or plural. Plurals can be formed in various ways, depending on the noun:\n* **Verbs**\nVerbs are conjugated for person, number, tense and mood. For example, the verbal noun gweles 'see' has derived forms such as 1st person singular present indicative gwelav 'I see', 3rd person plural imperfect indicative gwelens 'they saw', and 2nd person singular imperative gwel 'see!' Grammatical categories can be indicated either by inflection of the main verb, or by the use of auxiliary verbs such as bos 'be' or gul 'do'.\n* **Prepositions**\nCornish uses inflected (or conjugated) prepositions: Prepositions are inflected for person and number. For example, gans (with, by) has derived forms such as genev 'with me', ganso 'with him', and genowgh 'with you (plural)'.\n\n**Syntax**\n\nWord order in Cornish is somewhat fluid and varies depending on several factors such as the intended element to be emphasised and whether a statement is negative or affirmative. In a study on Cornish word order in the play Bewnans Meriasek (c. 1500), Ken George has argued that the most common word order in main clauses in Middle Cornish was, in affirmative statements, SVO, with the verb in the third person singular.\n\n**Culture**\n\nThe Celtic Congress and Celtic League are groups that advocate cooperation amongst the Celtic Nations in order to protect and promote Celtic languages and cultures, thus working in the interests of the Cornish language.\n\n**Cultural Events**\n\nCornwall has had cultural events associated with the language, including the international Celtic Media Festival, hosted in St Ives in 1997. The Old Cornwall Society has promoted the use of the language at events and meetings. Two examples of ceremonies that are performed in both the English and Cornish languages are Crying the Neck and the annual mid-summer bonfires.\n\n**Study and Teaching**\n\nCornish is taught in some schools; it was previously taught at degree level at the University of Wales, though the only existing course in the language at university level is as part of a course in Cornish studies at the University of Exeter. In March 2008 a course in the language was started as part of the Celtic Studies curriculum at the University of Vienna, Austria. The University of Cambridge offers courses in Cornish through its John Trim Resources Centre, which is part of the university's Language Centre. In addition, the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic (which is part of the Faculty of English) also carries out research into the Cornish language.\n\n**Cornish Studies**\n\nWilliam Scawen produced a manuscript on the declining Cornish language that continually evolved until he died in 1689, aged 89. He was one of the first to realise the language was dying out and wrote detailed manuscripts which he started working on when he was 78. At the same time a group of scholars led by John Keigwin (nephew of William Scawen) of Mousehole tried to preserve and further the Cornish language and chose to write in Cornish. One of their number, Nicholas Boson, tells how he had been discouraged from using Cornish to servants by his mother. This group left behind a large number of translations of parts of the Bible, proverbs and songs. They were contacted by the Welsh linguist Edward Lhuyd, who came to Cornwall to study the language.\n\n**Literature**\n\nIn 1981, the Breton library Preder edited Passyon agan arluth (Passion of our lord), a 15th-century Cornish poem. The first complete translation of the Bible into Cornish, translated from English, was published in 2011. Another Bible translation project translating from original languages is underway. The New Testament and Psalms were posted on-line on YouVersion (Bible.com) and Bibles.org in July 2014 by the Bible Society.\n\n**Media**\n\nIn 1983 BBC Radio Cornwall started broadcasting around two minutes of Cornish every week. In 1987, however, they gave over 15 minutes of airtime on Sunday mornings for a programme called Kroeder Kroghen ('Holdall'), presented by John King, running until the early 1990s.

In 2006, Matthew Clarke who had presented the Pirate FM bulletin, launched a web-streamed news bulletin called Nowodhow an Seythen ('Weekly News'), which in 2008 was merged into a new weekly magazine podcast Radyo an Gernewegva (RanG).\n\n**Music**\n\nEnglish composer Peter Warlock wrote a Christmas carol in Cornish (setting words by Henry Jenner). The Cornish electronic musician Aphex Twin has used Cornish names for track titles, most notably on his Drukqs album.\n\n**Place-Names and Surnames**\n\nThe Cornish language features in the toponymy of Cornwall, with a significant contrast between English place-names prevalent in eastern Cornwall and Cornish place-names to the west of the Camel-Fowey river valleys, where English place-names are much less common. Hundreds of Cornish family names have an etymology in the Cornish language, the majority of which are derived from Cornish place-names. Long before the agreement of the Standard Written Form of Cornish in the 21st century, Late Cornish orthography in the Early Modern period usually followed Welsh to English transliteration, phonetically rendering C for K, I for Y, U for W, and Z for S. This meant that place names were adopted into English with spellings such as 'Porthcurno' and 'Penzance'; they are written Porth Kernow and Pen Sans in the Standard Written Form of Cornish, agreed upon in 2008.

is difficult to state with certainty when Cornish ceased to be spoken, due to the fact that its last speakers were of relatively low social class and that the definition of what constitutes \"a living

However, passive speakers, semi-speakers and rememberers, who retain some competence in the language despite not being fluent nor using the language in daily life, generally survive even longer.\n\n\nRevived Cornish\nIn 1904, the Celtic language scholar and Cornish cultural activist Henry Jenner published A Handbook of the Cornish Language The publication of this book is often

2009 in which the council promoted the inclusion of Cornish, as appropriate and where possible, in council publications and on signs [102] This plan has drawn some criticism [103] In October 2015, The council announced that staff would be encouraged to use \"basic words and phrases\" in Cornish when dealing with the public [104] In 2021 Cornwall Council prohibited a marriage ceremony from being

these characters, and Old Breton, which does not use them at all [111] Old Cornish features include using initial ⟨ch⟩, ⟨c⟩, or ⟨k⟩ for /k/, and, in internal and final position, ⟨p⟩, ⟨t⟩, ⟨c⟩, ⟨b⟩, ⟨d⟩, and ⟨g⟩ are generally used for the phonemes /b/, /d/, /ɡ/, /β/, /ð/, and /ɣ/ respectively, meaning that the results of Brittonic lenition are not usually apparent from the orthography at this time [112] [109]\n\n\nMiddle Cornish orthography\nMiddle Cornish orthography has a significant level of variation, and shows influence from Middle English spelling practices [113] Yogh (Ȝ ȝ) is used in certain Middle Cornish texts, where it is used to represent a variety of sounds, including the dental fricatives /θ/ and /ð/, a usage which is unique to Middle Cornish and is never found in Middle English [114] [115] Middle Cornish scribes tend to use ⟨c⟩ for /k/ before back vowels, and ⟨k⟩ for /k/ before front vowels, though this is not always true, and this rule is less consistent in certain texts [116] Middle Cornish scribes almost universally use ⟨wh⟩ to represent /ʍ/ (or /hw/), as in Middle English Middle Cornish, especially towards the end of this period, tends to use orthographic ⟨g⟩ and ⟨b⟩ in word-final position in stressed monosyllables, and ⟨k⟩ and ⟨p⟩ in word-final position in unstressed final syllables, to represent the reflexes of late Brittonic /ɡ/ and /b/, respectively [117]\n\n\nLate Cornish orthography\nWritten sources from this period are often spelled following English spelling conventions since many of the writers of the time had not been exposed to Middle Cornish texts or the Cornish orthography within them Around 1700, Edward Lhuyd visited Cornwall, introducing his own partly phonetic orthography that he used in his Archaeologia Britannica, which was adopted by some local writers, leading to the use of some Lhuydian features such as the use of circumflexes to denote long vowels, ⟨k⟩ before front vowels, word-final ⟨i⟩, and the use of ⟨dh⟩ to represent the voiced dental fricative /ð/ [118] [115]\n\n\nRevived Cornish orthography\nAfter the publication of Jenner's Handbook of the Cornish Language, the earliest revivalists used Jenner's orthography, which was influenced by Lhuyd's system This system was abandoned following the development by Nance of a \"unified spelling\", later known as Unified Cornish, a system based on a standardization of the orthography of the early Middle Cornish texts [119] Nance's system was used by almost all Revived Cornish speakers and writers until the 1970s [120] Criticism of Nance's system, particularly the relationship of spelling to sounds and the phonological basis of Unified Cornish, resulted in rival orthographies appearing by the early 1980s, [121] including Gendal's Modern Cornish, based on Late Cornish native writers and Lhuyd, and Ken George's Kernewek Kemmyn, a mainly morphophonemic orthography based on George's reconstruction of Middle Cornish c. 1500, which features a number of orthographic, and phonological, distinctions not found in Unified Cornish [122] [115] Kernewek Kemmyn is characterised by the use of universal ⟨k⟩ for /k/ (instead of ⟨c⟩ before back vowels as in Unified); ⟨hw⟩ for /hw/, instead of ⟨wh⟩ as in Unified; and ⟨y⟩, ⟨oe⟩, and ⟨eu⟩ to represent the phonemes /ɪ/, /o/, and /œ/ respectively, which are not found in Unified Cornish Criticism of all of these systems, especially Kernewek Kemmyn, by Nicolas Williams, [123] resulted in the creation of Unified Cornish Revised, a modified version of Nance's orthography, featuring: an additional phoneme not distinguished by Nance, \"ö in German schön\", represented in the UCR orthography by ⟨ue⟩; replacement of ⟨y⟩ with ⟨e⟩ in many words; internal ⟨h⟩ rather than ⟨gh⟩; and use of final ⟨b⟩, ⟨g⟩, and ⟨dh⟩ in stressed monosyllables [124] A Standard Written Form, intended as a compromise orthography for official and educational purposes, was introduced in 2008, although a number of previous orthographic systems remain in use and, in response to the publication of the SWF, another new orthography, Kernowek Standard, was created, mainly by Nicholas Williams and Michael Everson, which is proposed as an amended version of the Standard Written Form [125]\n\n\nPhonology\nThe phonological system of Old Cornish, inherited from Proto-Southwestern Brittonic and originally differing little from Old Breton and Old Welsh, underwent various changes during its Middle and Late phases, eventually resulting in several characteristics not found in the other Brittonic languages The first sound change to distinguish Cornish from both Breton and Welsh, the assibilation of the dental stops /t/ and /d/ in medial and final position, had begun by the time of the Vocabularium Cornicum, c. 1100 or earlier [126] This change, and the subsequent, or perhaps dialectical, palatalization (or occasional rhotacization in a few words) of these sounds, results in orthographic forms such as Middle Cornish tas 'father', Late Cornish tâz (Welsh tad), Middle Cornish cresy 'believe', Late Cornish cregy (Welsh credu), and Middle Cornish gasa 'leave', Late Cornish gara (Welsh gadael) [127] A further characteristic sound change, pre-occlusion, occurred during the 16th century, resulting in the nasals /nn/ and /mm/ being realised as  [ᵈn] and  [ᵇm] respectively in stressed syllables, and giving Late Cornish forms such as pedn 'head' (Welsh pen) and kabm 'crooked' (Welsh cam) [127]\n\n\nVocabulary\nCornish is a Celtic language, and the majority of its vocabulary, when usage frequency is taken into account, at every documented stage of its history is inherited direct from Proto-Celtic, [135] either through the ancestral Proto-Indo-European language, or through vocabulary borrowed from unknown substrate language(s) at some point in the development of the Celtic proto-language from PIE [136] Examples of the PIE > PCelt development are various terms related to kinship and people, including mam 'mother', modereb 'aunt, mother's sister', huir 'sister', mab 'son', gur 'man', den 'person, human', and tus 'people', and words for parts of the body, including lof 'hand' and dans 'tooth' [137] Inherited adjectives with an Indo-European etymology include newyth 'new', ledan 'broad, wide', rud 'red', hen 'old', iouenc 'young', and byw 'alive, living' [138]\n\n\nGrammar\nThe grammar of Cornish shares with other Celtic languages a number of features which, while not unique, are unusual in an Indo-European context The grammatical features most unfamiliar to English speakers of the language are the initial consonant mutations, the verb–subject–object word order, inflected prepositions, fronting of emphasised syntactic elements and the use of two different forms for 'to be'.\n\n\nMorphology\nCornish has initial consonant mutation: The first sound of a Cornish word may change according to grammatical context As in Breton, there are four types of mutation in Cornish (compared with three in Welsh, two in Irish and Manx and one in Scottish Gaelic) These changes apply to only certain letters (sounds) in particular grammatical contexts, some of which are given below: [145]\n\n\nMutations\nCornish has initial consonant mutation: The first sound of a Cornish word may change according to grammatical context As in Breton, there are four types of mutation in Cornish (compared with three in Welsh, two in Irish and Manx and one in Scottish Gaelic) These changes apply to only certain letters (sounds) in particular grammatical contexts, some of which are given below: [145]\n\n\nArticles\nCornish has no indefinite article Porth can either mean 'harbour' [146] or 'a harbour' In certain contexts, unn can be used, with the meaning 'a certain, a particular', e.g unn porth 'a certain harbour' There is, however, a definite article an 'the', which is used for all nouns regardless of their gender or number, e.g an porth 'the harbour' [147]\n\n\nNouns\nCornish nouns belong to one of two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine, but are not inflected for case Nouns may be singular or plural Plurals can be formed in various ways, depending on the noun: [148]\n\n\nVerbs\nVerbs are conjugated for person, number, tense and mood For example, the verbal noun gweles 'see' has derived forms such as 1st person singular present indicative gwelav 'I see', 3rd person plural imperfect indicative gwelens 'they saw', and 2nd person singular imperative gwel 'see!' [149] Grammatical categories can be indicated either by inflection of the main verb, or by the use of auxiliary verbs such as bos 'be' or gul 'do' [150]\n\n\nPrepositions\nCornish uses inflected (or conjugated) prepositions: Prepositions are inflected for person and number For example, gans (with, by) has derived forms such as genev 'with me', ganso 'with him', and genowgh 'with you (plural)' [151]\n\n\nSyntax\nWord order in Cornish is somewhat fluid and varies depending on several factors such as the intended element to be emphasised and whether a statement is negative or affirmative In a study on Cornish word order in the play Bewnans Meriasek (c. 1500), Ken George has argued that the most common word order in main clauses in Middle Cornish was, in affirmative statements, SVO, with the verb in the third person singular: [152]\n\n\nCulture\nThe Celtic Congress and Celtic League are groups that advocate cooperation amongst the Celtic Nations in order to protect and promote Celtic languages and cultures, thus working in the interests of the Cornish language.\n\n\nCultural events\nCornwall has had cultural events associated with the language, including the international Celtic Media Festival, hosted in St Ives in 1997 The Old Cornwall Society has promoted the use of the language at events and meetings Two examples of ceremonies that are performed in both the English and Cornish languages are Crying the Neck [168] and the annual mid-summer bonfires [169]\n\n\nStudy and teaching\nCornish is taught in some schools; it was previously taught at degree level at the University of Wales, though the only existing course in the language at university level is as part of a course in Cornish studies at the University of Exeter [175] In March 2008 a course in the language was started as part of the Celtic Studies curriculum at the University of Vienna, Austria.\nThe University of Cambridge offers courses in Cornish through its John Trim Resources Centre, which is part of the university's Language Centre [176] In addition, the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic (which is part of the Faculty of English) also carries out research into the Cornish language [177]\n\n\nCornish studies\nWilliam Scawen produced a manuscript on the declining Cornish language that continually evolved until he died in 1689, aged 89 He was one of the first to realise the language was dying out and wrote detailed manuscripts which he started working on when he was 78 The only version that was ever published was a short first draft but the final version, which he worked on until his death, is a few hundred pages long [186] At the same time a group of scholars led by John Keigwin (nephew of William Scawen) of Mousehole tried to preserve and further the Cornish language and chose to write in Cornish One of their number, Nicholas Boson, tells how he had been discouraged from using Cornish to servants by his mother [187] This group left behind a large number of translations of parts of the Bible, proverbs and songs They were contacted by the Welsh linguist Edward Lhuyd, who came to Cornwall to study the language [188]\n\n\nLiterature\nIn 1981, the Breton library Preder edited Passyon agan arluth (Passion of our lord), a 15th-century Cornish poem [194] The first complete translation of the Bible into Cornish, translated from English, was published in 2011 Another Bible translation project translating from original languages is underway The New Testament and Psalms were posted on-line on YouVersion (Bible.com) and Bibles.org in July 2014 by the Bible Society.\n\n\nRecent Modern Cornish literature\nIn 1981, the Breton library Preder edited Passyon agan arluth (Passion of our lord), a 15th-century Cornish poem [194] The first complete translation of the Bible into Cornish, translated from English, was published in 2011 Another Bible translation project translating from original languages is underway The New Testament and Psalms were posted on-line on YouVersion (Bible.com) and Bibles.org in July 2014 by the Bible Society.\n\n\nMedia\nIn 1983 BBC Radio Cornwall started broadcasting around two minutes of Cornish every week In 1987, however, they gave over 15 minutes of airtime on Sunday mornings for a programme called Kroeder Kroghen ('Holdall'), presented by John King, running until the early 1990s [213] It was eventually replaced with a five-minute news bulletin called An Nowodhow ('The News') The bulletin was presented every Sunday evening for many years by Rod Lyon, then Elizabeth Stewart, and currently a team presents in rotation [214] Pirate FM ran short bulletins on Saturday lunchtimes from 1998 to 1999 In 2006, Matthew Clarke who had presented the Pirate FM bulletin, launched a web-streamed news bulletin called Nowodhow an Seythen ('Weekly News'), which in 2008 was merged into a new weekly magazine podcast Radyo an Gernewegva (RanG).\n\n\nMusic\nEnglish composer Peter Warlock wrote a Christmas carol in Cornish (setting words by Henry Jenner) [221] The Cornish electronic musician Aphex Twin has used Cornish names for track titles, most notably on his Drukqs album.\n\n\nPlace-names and surnames\nThe Cornish language features in the toponymy of Cornwall, with a significant contrast between English place-names prevalent in eastern Cornwall and Cornish place-names to the west of the Camel-Fowey river valleys, where English place-names are much less common [223] Hundreds of Cornish family names have an etymology in the Cornish language, the majority of which are derived from Cornish place-names [224] Long before the agreement of the Standard Written Form of Cornish in the 21st century, Late Cornish orthography in the Early Modern period usually followed Welsh to English transliteration, phonetically rendering C for K, I for Y, U for W, and Z for S This meant that place names were adopted into English with spellings such as 'Porthcurno' and 'Penzance'; they are written Porth Kernow and Pen Sans in the Standard Written Form of Cornish, agreed upon in 2008 Likewise words such as Enys ('island') can be found spelled as Ince as at Ince Castle These apparent mistransliterations can, however, reveal an insight into how names and places were actually pronounced, explaining, for example, how anglicised Launceston is still pronounced  [ˈlansǝn] with emphasis on the first element, [225] perhaps from Cornish Lann Stefan, though the Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names considers this unlikely [226]\n\n\nSamples\nFrom the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\nDictionaries\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

studied languages at Voronezh University and taught Russian at Herzen State Pedagogical University Later, she would also work as a tour guide at Pavlovsk Palace The Medvedevs lived in a 40m2 apartment at 6 Bela Kun Street in the Kupchino Municipal Okrug (district) of Leningrad [12] [13] Dmitry was his parents' only child The Medvedevs were regarded at the time as a Soviet intelligentsia family [13] His maternal grandparents were Ukrainians whose surname was Kovalev, originally Koval Medvedev traces his family roots to the Belgorod region [14]\n\n\nStudent years and academic career\nIn the autumn of 1982, 17-year-old Medvedev enrolled at Leningrad State University to study law Although he also considered studying linguistics, Medvedev later said he never regretted his choice, finding his chosen subject increasingly fascinating, stating that he was lucky \"to have chosen a field that genuinely interested him and that it was really 'his thing'\" [12] [13] Fellow students described Medvedev as a correct and diplomatic person who in debates presented his arguments firmly, without offending [13]\n\n\nEarly career\nIn 1990, Anatoly Sobchak returned from Moscow to become chairman of the Leningrad City Council Sobchak hired Medvedev who had previously headed his election campaign One of Sobchak's former students, Vladimir Putin, became an adviser The next summer, Sobchak was elected Mayor of the city, and Medvedev became a consultant to City Hall's Committee for Foreign Affairs It was headed by Putin [12] [13]\n\n\nCareer in St Petersburg\nIn 1990, Anatoly Sobchak returned from Moscow to become chairman of the Leningrad City Council Sobchak hired Medvedev who had previously headed his election campaign One of Sobchak's former students, Vladimir Putin, became an adviser The next summer, Sobchak was elected Mayor of the city, and Medvedev became a consultant to City Hall's Committee for Foreign Affairs It was headed by Putin [12] [13]\n\n\nCareer in the central government\nIn June 1996, Medvedev's colleague Vladimir Putin was brought into the Russian presidential administration Three years later, on 16 August 1999, he became Prime Minister of Russia Three months later, in November 1999, Medvedev became one of several from St Petersburg brought in by Vladimir Putin to top government positions in Moscow On 31 December, he was appointed deputy head of the presidential staff, becoming one of the politicians closest to future President Putin On 17 January 2000, Dmitry Medvedev was promoted to 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation (the highest federal state civilian service rank) by the Decree signed by Vladimir Putin as acting President of Russia [21] During the 2000 presidential elections, he was Putin's campaign manager Putin won the election with 52.94% of the popular vote Medvedev was quoted after the election commenting he thoroughly enjoyed the work and the responsibility calling it \"a test of strength\" [13]\n\n\nPresidential candidate\nFollowing his appointment as first deputy prime minister, many political observers began to regard Medvedev as a potential candidate for the 2008 presidential elections, [26] although Western observers widely believed Medvedev was too liberal and too pro-Western for Putin to endorse him as a candidate Instead, Western observers expected the candidate to arise from the ranks of the so-called siloviki, security and military officials many of whom were appointed to high positions during Putin's presidency [13] The silovik Sergei Ivanov and the administrator-specialist Viktor Zubkov were seen as the strongest candidates [27] In opinion polls asking Russians to pick their favourite successor to Putin from a list of candidates not containing Putin himself, Medvedev often came out first, beating Ivanov and Zubkov as well as the opposition candidates [28] In November 2006, Medvedev's trust rating was 17%, more than double than that of Ivanov Medvedev's popularity was probably boosted by his high-profile role in the National Priority Projects [29]\n\n\n2008 presidential election\nAs 2 March 2008 election approached, the outgoing president, Vladimir Putin, remained the country's most popular politician An opinion poll by Russia's independent polling organisation, the Levada Center, [33] conducted over the period 21–24 December 2007, indicated that when presented a list of potential candidates, 79% of Russians were ready to vote for Medvedev if the election was immediately held [34] [35] The other main contenders, the Communist Gennady Zyuganov and the LDPR's Vladimir Zhirinovsky both received in 9% in the same poll [36] [37] Much of Putin's popularity transferred to his chosen candidate, with 42% of the survey responders saying that Medvedev's strength came from Putin's support to him [38] [39]\n\n\nElection campaign\nAs 2 March 2008 election approached, the outgoing president, Vladimir Putin, remained the

of 69.78% of registered voters The main contenders, Gennady Zyuganov and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, received 17.72% and 9.35% respectively Three-quarters of Medvedev's vote was Putin's electorate According to surveys, had Putin and Medvedev both run for president in the same elections, Medvedev would have received 9% of the vote [51]\n\n\nPresidency (2008–2012)\nOn 7 May 2008, Dmitry Medvedev took an oath as the third president of the Russian Federation in a ceremony held in the Grand Kremlin Palace [54] After taking the oath of office and receiving a gold chain of double-headed eagles symbolising the presidency, he stated: [55]\n\n\nInauguration\nOn 7 May 2008, Dmitry Medvedev took an oath as the third president of the Russian Federation in a ceremony held in the Grand Kremlin Palace [54]

Putin Prime Minister of Russia as he had promised during his election campaign The nomination was approved by the State Duma with a clear majority of 392–56, with only Communist Party of the Russian Federation deputies voting against [24]\n\n\n\"Tandem rule\"\nFrom the beginning of Medvedev's tenure, the nature of his presidency and his relationship with Putin was subject to considerable media speculation In a unique situation in the Russian Federation's political history, the constitutionally powerful president was now flanked with a highly influential prime minister (Putin), who also remained the country's most popular politician Previous prime ministers had proven to be almost completely subordinate to the president and none of them had enjoyed strong public approval, with Yevgeny Primakov and Putin's previous tenure (1999–2000) as prime minister under Boris Yeltsin being the only exceptions [24] Journalists quickly dubbed the new system with a practically dual-headed executive as \"government by tandem\" or \"tandemocracy\", with Medvedev and Putin called the \"ruling tandem\" [13]\n\n\nMain external events\nThe long-lingering conflict between Georgia and the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which were supported by Russia, escalated during the summer of 2008 On 1 August 2008, the Russian-backed South Ossetian forces started shelling Georgian villages, with a sporadic response from Georgian peacekeepers in the area Intensifying artillery attacks by the South Ossetians broke a 1992 ceasefire agreement To put an end to these attacks, the Georgian army units were sent in to the South Ossetian conflict zone on 7 August Georgian troops took control of most of Tskhinvali, a separatist stronghold, in hours [59] [60]\n\n\n2008 Russo-Georgian War\nThe long-lingering conflict between Georgia and the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which were supported by Russia, escalated during the summer of 2008 On 1

Tskhinvali, a separatist stronghold, in hours [59] [60]\n\n\n2008–09 economic crisis\nIn September 2008, Russia was hit by repercussions of the Great Recession Before this, Russian officials, such as the Finance Minister, Alexei Kudrin, had said they believed Russia would be safe, due to its stable macroeconomic situation and substantial reserves accumulated during the years of growth Despite this, the recession proved to be the worst in the history of Russia, and the country's GDP fell by over 8% in 2009 [70] The government's response was to use over a trillion rubles (more than $40 billion U.S Dollars) to help troubled banks, [71] and initiated a large-scale stimulus programme, lending $50 billion to struggling companies [70] [71] No major banks collapsed, and minor failures were handled in an effective way The economic situation stabilised in 2009, but substantial growth did not resume until 2010 Medvedev's approval ratings declined during the crisis, dropping from 83% in September 2008 to 68% in April 2009, before recovering to 72% in October 2009 following improvements in the economy [72] [73]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nIn February 2022, after Russia was suspended from the Council of Europe due to its invasion of Ukraine, and subsequently announced its intention to withdraw from the organization, Medvedev stated that while the decision to suspend Russia was \"unfair\", it was also a \"good opportunity\" to reinstate the death penalty in Russia [162] [163]\n\n\nEconomy\nIn the economic sphere, Medvedev has launched a modernisation programme which aims at modernising Russia's economy and society, decreasing the country's dependency on oil and gas revenues and creating a diversified economy based on high technology and innovation [76] The programme is based on the top 5 priorities for the country's technological development: efficient energy use; nuclear technology; information technology; medical technology and pharmaceuticals; and space technology in combination with telecommunications [77]\n\n\nPolice reform\nMedvedev made reforming Russia's law enforcement one of his top agendas, the reason for which was a shooting started by a police officer in April 2009 in one of Moscow's supermarkets Medvedev initiated the reform at the end of 2009, with a presidential decree issued on 24 December ordering the government to begin planning the reform In early August 2010, a draft law was posted on the Internet at the address  [1] for public discussion The new website received more than 2,000 comments within 24 hours [84] Based on citizen feedback, several modifications to the draft were made On 27 October 2010, President Medvedev submitted the draft to the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma [85] The State Duma voted to approve the bill on 28 January 2011, and the upper house, the Federation Council followed suit on 2 February 2011 On 7 February 2011, President Medvedev signed the bill into law [86] The changes came into effect on 1 March 2011 [86]\n\n\nAnti-corruption campaign\nOn 19 May 2008, Medvedev signed a decree on anti-corruption measures, which included creation of an Anti-Corruption Council [88] In the first meeting of the council on 30 September 2008, Medvedev said: [89]\n\n\nEducation\nPresident Medvedev initiated a new policy called \"Our New School\" [clarification needed] and instructed the government to present a review on the implementation of the initiative every year [99]\n\n\nDevelopment of the political system\nRegional elections held on 1 March 2009 were followed by accusations of administrative resources being used in support of United Russia candidates, with the leader of A Just Russia, Sergey Mironov, being especially critical Responding to this, Medvedev met with the chairman of the Central Election Commission of Russia, Vladimir Churov, and called for moderation in the use of administrative resources [100] In August 2009, Medvedev promised to break the near-dominant position of United Russia party in national and regional legislatures, stating that \"New democratic times are beginning\" [101] The next regional elections were held on 11 October 2009 and won by United Russia with 66% of the vote The elections were again harshly criticised for the use of administrative resources in favour of United Russia candidates Communist, LDPR and A Just Russia parliamentary deputies staged an unprecedented walkout on 14–15 October 2009 as a result [100] Although Medvedev often promised to stand up for more political pluralism, Professor Richard Sakwa observed, after the 2009 regional elections, a gulf formed between Medvedev's words and the worsening situation, with the question arising \"whether Medvedev had the desire or ability to renew Russia's political system.\" [100]\n\n\nElection law changes\nIn 2009, Medvedev proposed an amendment to the election law which would decrease the State Duma election threshold from 7% to 5% The amendment was signed into law in Spring 2009 Parties receiving more than 5% but less than 6% of the votes would henceforward be guaranteed one seat, while parties receiving more than 6% but less than 7% will get two seats These seats will be allocated before the seats for parties with over 7% support [111]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn February 2022, after sanctions had been imposed on Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine, Medvedev stated that Russia did not need diplomatic relations with the West and that the sanctions imposed on the country gave it good reason to pull out of dialogue on nuclear stability and potentially New START [169]\n\n\nRelationship with Putin\nAlthough the Russian constitution clearly apportions the greater power in the state to the president, speculation arose over the question of whether it was Medvedev or Prime Minister Vladimir Putin who actually wielded the most power [123] According to London Daily Telegraph, \"Kremlin-watchers\" note that Medvedev uses the more formal form of 'you' (Вы, 'vy') when addressing Putin, while Putin addresses Medvedev with the less formal 'ty' (ты) [123]\n\n\n2012 presidential elections\nAs both Putin and Medvedev could have run for president in the 2012 general elections, there was a view from some analysts that some of Medvedev's contemporaneous actions and comments at the time were designed to separate his image from Putin's BBC News suggested these might include his dealings in late 2010 with NATO and the United States, possibly designed to show himself as being better able to deal with Western nations, [126] and comments in November about the need for a stronger opposition in Russian politics, to present himself as a moderniser BBC News observed other analysts considered the split to be exaggerated, that Medvedev and Putin were \"trying to maximise support for the authorities by appealing to different parts of society\" [104] There was belief that the court verdict on former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his partner Platon Lebedev, both of whom funded opposition parties before their arrests, would indicate whether or not Putin was \"still calling all the shots\" [127]\n\n\nPost-presidency (2012–present)\nOn 7 May 2012, the same day he ceased to be the president of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev was nominated by President Vladimir Putin to the office of prime minister [133] [134] On 8 May 2012, the State Duma of the Russian Federation voted on the nomination submitted by the new president and confirmed the choice of Medvedev to the post Putin's United Russia party, now led by Medvedev, secured a majority of the Duma's seats in the 2011 legislative election, winning 49% of the vote, and 238 of the 450 seats Medvedev's nomination to the office of prime minister was approved by the State Duma in a 299–144 vote [135] [better source needed]\n\n\nPrime minister (2012–2020)\nOn 7 May 2012, the same day he ceased to be the president of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev was nominated by President Vladimir Putin to the office of prime minister [133] [134] On 8 May 2012, the State Duma of the Russian Federation voted on the nomination submitted by the

Federation voted on the nomination submitted by the new president and confirmed the choice of Medvedev to the post Putin's United Russia party, now led by Medvedev, secured a majority of the Duma's seats in the 2011 legislative election, winning 49% of the vote, and 238 of the 450 seats Medvedev's nomination to the office of prime minister was approved by the State Duma in a 299–144 vote [135] [better source needed]\n\n\nSecond term\nOn 7 May 2018, Dmitry Medvedev was nominated as prime minister by Vladimir Putin for another term [139] On 8 May, Medvedev was confirmed by the State Duma as prime minister, with 374 votes in favour [140] On 15 May, Putin approved the structure and on 18 May the composition of the Cabinet [141] [142]\n\n\nResignation\nMedvedev, along with his entire Cabinet, resigned on 15 January 2020 after Putin delivered the Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly, in which he proposed several amendments to the constitution Medvedev stated that he was resigning to allow President Putin to make the significant constitutional changes suggested by Putin regarding shifting power away from the presidency [146] Medvedev said that the constitutional changes would \"significantly change Russia's balance of power\" [147] [148] Putin accepted the resignation [149]\n\n\nDeputy chairman of the Security Council (2020–present)\nOn 16 January 2020, Medvedev was appointed to the post of deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia [155] His monthly salary was set at 618,713 rubles (8,723.85 USD) [156] In a July 2020 interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, Medvedev said he retains \"good friendly relations\" with President Putin, which was in contrast with the opinion of many circles that his departure from the role of prime minister was a result of a rift in the domestic policies of the two [157]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nIn February 2022, after Russia was suspended from the Council of Europe due to its invasion of Ukraine, and subsequently announced its intention to withdraw from the organization, Medvedev stated that while the decision to suspend Russia was \"unfair\", it was also a \"good opportunity\" to reinstate

after their graduation from secondary school in 1982 [227]\n\n\nSanctions\nIn response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury added Medvedev to its list of persons sanctioned pursuant to Executive Order 14024 in April 2022; [258] he was also later sanctioned by New Zealand [259]\n\n\nControversies\nOn 23 May 2016, during a visit to Feodosia in the annexed Crimea, Medvedev was pummeled by questions from disgruntled locals who complained about their Russian pensions not being indexed to the rising cost of living [261] Medvedev replied in a dismissive manner and hastily retreated, giving rise to the \"there's no money, but hang in there\" meme [261]\n\n\nPensions\nOn 23 May 2016, during a visit to Feodosia in the annexed Crimea, Medvedev was pummeled by questions from disgruntled locals who complained about their Russian pensions not being indexed to the rising cost of living [261] Medvedev replied in a dismissive manner and hastily retreated, giving rise to the \"there's no money, but hang in there\" meme [261]\n\n\nCorruption allegations\nIn September 2016, opposition leader Alexei Navalny published a report with information about Dmitry Medvedev's alleged summer residence (\"dacha\") – an 80 hectare estate with a plethora of houses, a ski run, a cascading swimming pool, three helipads and purpose-built communications towers The estate even included a house for ducks, which received public ridicule and led to ducks becoming a protest symbol in Russia a year later [262] The area is surrounded by a six-foot (1.82 meter) fence and is allegedly 30 times the size of the iconic Red Square in Moscow [263] This summer residence is an expensively renovated 18th-century manor called

Medvedev initiated the reform at the end of 2009, with a presidential decree issued on 24 December ordering the government to begin planning the reform.\n\nAnti-corruption campaign\n\nOn 19 May 2008, Medvedev signed a decree on anti-corruption measures, which included creation of an Anti-Corruption Council. In the first meeting of the council on 30 September 2008, Medvedev said: \"We must thoroughly clean up the system of government and the economy, and create effective mechanisms to prevent corruption.\"\n\nEducation\n\nPresident Medvedev initiated a new policy called \"Our New School\" and instructed the government to present a review on the implementation of the initiative every year.\n\nDevelopment of the political system\n\nRegional elections held on 1 March 2009 were followed by accusations of administrative resources being used in support of United Russia candidates, with the leader of A Just Russia, Sergey Mironov, being especially critical. Responding to this, Medvedev met with the chairman of the Central Election Commission of Russia, Vladimir Churov, and called for moderation in the use of administrative resources.\n\nElection law changes\n\nIn 2009, Medvedev proposed an amendment to the election law which would decrease the State Duma election threshold from 7% to 5%. The amendment was signed into law in Spring 2009. Parties receiving more than 5% but less than 6% of the votes would henceforward be guaranteed one seat, while parties receiving more than 6% but less than 7% will get two seats. These seats will be allocated before the seats for parties with over 7% support.\n\nForeign policy\n\nIn February 2022, after sanctions had been imposed on Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine, Medvedev stated that Russia did not need diplomatic relations with the West and that the sanctions imposed on the country gave it good reason to pull out of dialogue on nuclear stability and potentially New START.\n\nRelationship with Putin\n\nAlthough the Russian constitution clearly apportions the greater power in the state to the president, speculation arose over the question of whether it was Medvedev or Prime Minister Vladimir Putin who actually wielded the most power. According to London Daily Telegraph, \"Kremlin-watchers\" note that Medvedev uses the more formal form of 'you' (Вы, 'vy') when addressing Putin, while Putin addresses Medvedev with the less formal 'ty' (ты).\n\n2012 presidential elections\n\nAs both Putin and Medvedev could have run for president in the 2012 general elections, there was a view from some analysts that some of Medvedev's contemporaneous actions and comments at the time were designed to separate his image from Putin's. BBC News suggested these might include his dealings in late 2010 with NATO and the United States, possibly designed to show himself as being better able to deal with Western nations.\n\nPost-presidency (2012–present)\n\nOn 7 May 2012, the same day he ceased to be the president of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev was nominated by President Vladimir Putin to the office of prime minister. On 8 May 2012, the State Duma of the Russian Federation voted on the nomination submitted by the new president and confirmed the choice of Medvedev to the post.\n\nPrime minister (2012–2020)\n\nOn 7 May 2012, the same day he ceased to be the president of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev was nominated by President Vladimir Putin to the office of prime minister. On 8 May 2012, the State Duma of the Russian Federation voted on the nomination submitted by the new president and confirmed the choice of Medvedev to the post.\n\nFirst term\n\nOn 7 May 2012, the same day he ceased to be the president of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev was nominated by President Vladimir Putin to the office of prime minister. On 8 May 2012, the State Duma of the Russian Federation voted on the nomination submitted by the new president and confirmed the choice of Medvedev to the post.\n\nSecond term\n\nOn 7 May 2018, Dmitry Medvedev was nominated as prime minister by Vladimir Putin for another term. On 8 May, Medvedev was confirmed by the State Duma as prime minister, with 374 votes in favour. On 15 May, Putin approved the structure and on 18 May the composition of the Cabinet.\n\nResignation\n\nMedvedev, along with his entire Cabinet, resigned on 15 January 2020 after Putin delivered the Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly, in which he proposed several amendments to the constitution. Medvedev stated that he was resigning to allow President Putin to make the significant constitutional changes suggested by Putin regarding shifting power away from the presidency.\n\nDeputy chairman of the Security Council (2020–present)\n\nOn 16 January 2020, Medvedev was appointed to the post of deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia. His monthly salary was set at 618,713 rubles (8,723.85 USD). In a July 2020 interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, Medvedev said he retains \"good friendly relations\" with President Putin, which was in contrast with the opinion of many circles that his departure from the role of prime minister was a result of a rift in the domestic policies of the two.\n\nSanctions\n\nIn response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury added Medvedev to its list of persons sanctioned pursuant to Executive Order 14024 in April 2022; he was also later sanctioned by New Zealand.\n\nControversies\n\nOn 23 May 2016, during a visit to Feodosia in the annexed Crimea, Medvedev was pummeled by questions from disgruntled locals who complained about their Russian pensions not being indexed to the rising cost of living. Medvedev replied in a dismissive manner and hastily retreated, giving rise to the \"there's no money, but hang in there\" meme.\n\nPensions\n\nOn 23 May 2016, during a visit to Feodosia in the annexed Crimea, Medvedev was pummeled by questions from disgruntled locals who complained about their Russian pensions not being indexed to the rising cost of living. Medvedev replied in a dismissive manner and hastily retreated, giving rise to the \"there's no money, but hang in there\" meme.\n\nCorruption allegations\n\nIn September 2016, opposition leader Alexei Navalny published a report with information about Dmitry Medvedev's alleged summer residence – an 80 hectare estate with a plethora of houses, a ski run, a cascading swimming pool, three helipads and purpose-built communications towers. The estate even included a house for ducks, which received public ridicule and led to ducks becoming a protest symbol in Russia a year later.\n\nPublications\n\nMedvedev wrote two short articles on the subject of his doctoral dissertation in Russian law journals. He is also one of the authors of a textbook on civil law for universities first published in 1991 (the 6th edition of Civil Law In 3 Volumes was published in 2007). He is the author of a university textbook, Questions of Russia's National Development, first published in 2007, concerning the role of the Russian state in social policy and economic development. He is also the lead co-author of a book of legal commentary entitled, A Commentary on the Federal Law \"On the State Civil Service of the Russian Federation\" This work considers the Russian Federal law on the civil service, which went into effect on 27 July 2004, from multiple perspectives – scholarly, jurisprudential, practical, enforcement- and implementation-related.\n\nElectoral history\n\n*

born on 14 September 1965 in Leningrad, in the Soviet Union His father, Anatoly Afanasyevich Medvedev (November 1926 – 2004), was a chemical engineer teaching at the Leningrad State Institute of Technology [9] [10] Dmitry's mother, Yulia Veniaminovna Medvedeva (née Shaposhnikova, born 21 November 1939), [11] studied languages at Voronezh University and taught Russian at Herzen State Pedagogical University Later, she would also work as a tour guide at Pavlovsk Palace The Medvedevs lived in a 40m2 apartment at 6 Bela Kun Street in the Kupchino Municipal Okrug (district) of Leningrad [12] [13] Dmitry was his parents' only child The Medvedevs were regarded at the time as a Soviet intelligentsia family [13] His maternal grandparents were Ukrainians whose surname was Kovalev, originally Koval Medvedev traces his family roots to the Belgorod region [14]\n\n\nStudent years and academic career\nIn the autumn of 1982, 17-year-old Medvedev enrolled at Leningrad State University to study law Although he also considered studying linguistics, Medvedev later said he never regretted his choice, finding his chosen subject increasingly fascinating, stating that he was lucky \"to have chosen a field that genuinely interested him and that it was really 'his thing'\" [12] [13] Fellow students described Medvedev as a correct and diplomatic person who in debates presented his arguments firmly, without offending [13]\n\n\nEarly career\nIn 1990, Anatoly Sobchak returned from Moscow to become chairman of the Leningrad City Council Sobchak hired Medvedev who had previously headed his election campaign One of Sobchak's former students, Vladimir Putin, became an adviser The next summer, Sobchak was elected Mayor of the city, and Medvedev became a consultant to City Hall's Committee for Foreign Affairs It was headed by Putin [12] [13]\n\n\nCareer in St Petersburg\nIn 1990, Anatoly Sobchak returned from Moscow to become chairman of the Leningrad City Council Sobchak hired Medvedev who had previously headed his election campaign One of Sobchak's former students, Vladimir Putin, became an adviser The next summer, Sobchak was elected Mayor of the city, and Medvedev became a consultant to City Hall's Committee for Foreign Affairs It was headed by Putin [12] [13]\n\n\nCareer in the central government\nIn June 1996, Medvedev's colleague Vladimir Putin was brought into the Russian presidential administration Three years later, on 16 August 1999, he became Prime Minister of Russia Three months later, in November 1999, Medvedev became one of several from St Petersburg brought in by Vladimir Putin to top government positions in Moscow On 31 December, he was appointed deputy head of the presidential staff, becoming one of the politicians closest to future President Putin On 17 January 2000, Dmitry Medvedev was promoted to 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation (the highest federal state civilian service rank) by the Decree signed by Vladimir Putin as acting President of Russia [21] During the 2000 presidential elections, he was Putin's campaign manager Putin won the election with 52.94% of the popular vote Medvedev was quoted after the election commenting he thoroughly enjoyed the work and the responsibility calling it \"a test of strength\" [13]\n\n\nPresidential candidate\nFollowing his appointment as first deputy prime minister, many political observers began to regard Medvedev as a potential candidate for the 2008 presidential elections, [26] although Western observers widely believed Medvedev was too liberal and too pro-Western for Putin to endorse him as a candidate Instead, Western observers expected the candidate to arise from the ranks of the so-called siloviki, security and military officials many of whom were appointed to high positions during Putin's presidency [13] The silovik Sergei Ivanov and the administrator-specialist Viktor Zubkov were seen as the strongest candidates [27] In opinion polls asking Russians to pick their favourite successor to Putin from a list of candidates not containing Putin himself, Medvedev often came out first, beating Ivanov and Zubkov as well as the opposition candidates [28] In November 2006, Medvedev's trust rating was 17%, more than double than that of Ivanov Medvedev's popularity was probably boosted by his high-profile role in the National Priority Projects [29]\n\n\n2008 presidential election\nAs 2 March 2008 election approached, the outgoing president, Vladimir Putin, remained the country's most popular politician An opinion poll by Russia's independent polling organisation, the Levada Center, [33] conducted over the period 21–24 December 2007, indicated that when presented a list of potential candidates, 79% of Russians were ready to vote for Medvedev if the election was immediately held [34] [35] The other main contenders, the Communist Gennady Zyuganov and the LDPR's Vladimir Zhirinovsky both received in 9% in the same poll [36] [37] Much of Putin's popularity transferred to his chosen candidate, with 42% of the survey responders saying that Medvedev's strength came from Putin's support to him [38] [39]\n\n\nElection campaign\nAs 2 March 2008 election approached, the outgoing president, Vladimir Putin, remained the country's most popular politician An opinion poll by Russia's independent polling organisation, the Levada Center, [33] conducted over the period 21–24 December 2007, indicated that when presented a list of potential candidates, 79% of Russians were ready to vote for Medvedev if the election was immediately held [34] [35] The other main contenders, the Communist Gennady Zyuganov and the LDPR's Vladimir Zhirinovsky both received in 9% in the same poll [36] [37] Much of Putin's popularity transferred to his chosen candidate, with 42% of the survey responders saying that Medvedev's strength came from Putin's support to him [38] [39]\n\n\nElection win\nMedvedev was elected President of Russia on 2 March 2008 The final election results gave him 70.28% (52,530,712) of votes with a turnout of 69.78% of registered voters The main contenders, Gennady Zyuganov and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, received 17.72% and 9.35% respectively Three-quarters of Medvedev's vote was Putin's electorate According to surveys, had Putin and Medvedev both run for president in the same elections, Medvedev would have received 9% of the vote [51]\n\n\nPresidency (2008–2012)\nOn 7 May 2008, Dmitry Medvedev took an oath as the third president of the Russian Federation in a ceremony held in the Grand Kremlin Palace [54] After taking the oath of office and receiving a gold chain of double-headed eagles symbolising the presidency, he stated: [55]\n\n\nInauguration\nOn 7 May 2008, Dmitry Medvedev took an oath as the third president of the Russian Federation in a ceremony held in the Grand Kremlin Palace [54] After taking the oath of office and receiving a gold chain of double-headed eagles symbolising the presidency, he stated: [55]\n\n\nPersonnel appointments\nOn 8 May 2008, Dmitry Medvedev appointed Putin Prime Minister of Russia as he had promised during his election campaign The nomination was approved by the State Duma with a clear majority of 392–56, with only Communist Party of the Russian Federation deputies voting against [24]\n\n\n\"Tandem rule\"\nFrom the beginning of Medvedev's tenure, the nature of his presidency and his relationship with Putin was subject to considerable media speculation In a unique situation in the Russian Federation's political history, the constitutionally powerful president was now flanked with a highly influential prime minister (Putin), who also remained the country's most popular politician Previous prime ministers had proven to be almost completely subordinate to the president and none of them had enjoyed strong public approval, with Yevgeny Primakov and Putin's previous tenure (1999–2000) as prime minister under Boris Yeltsin being the only exceptions [24] Journalists quickly dubbed the new system with a practically dual-headed executive as \"government by tandem\" or \"tandemocracy\", with Medvedev and Putin called the \"ruling tandem\" [13]\n\n\nMain external events\nThe long-lingering conflict between Georgia and the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which were supported by Russia, escalated during the summer of 2008 On 1 August 2008, the Russian-backed South Ossetian forces started shelling Georgian villages, with a sporadic response from Georgian peacekeepers in the area Intensifying artillery attacks by the South Ossetians broke a 1992 ceasefire agreement To put an end to these attacks, the Georgian army units were sent in to the South Ossetian conflict zone on 7 August Georgian troops took control of most of Tskhinvali, a separatist stronghold, in hours [59] [60]\n\n\n2008 Russo-Georgian War\nThe long-lingering conflict between Georgia and the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which were supported by Russia, escalated during the summer of 2008 On 1 August 2008, the Russian-backed South Ossetian forces started shelling Georgian villages, with a sporadic response from Georgian peacekeepers in the area Intensifying artillery attacks by the South Ossetians broke a 1992 ceasefire agreement To put an end to these attacks, the Georgian army units were sent in to the South Ossetian conflict zone on 7 August Georgian troops took control of most of Tskhinvali, a separatist stronghold, in hours [59] [60]\n\n\n2008–09 economic crisis\nIn September 2008, Russia was hit by repercussions of the Great Recession Before this, Russian officials, such as the Finance Minister, Alexei Kudrin, had said they believed Russia would be safe, due to its stable macroeconomic situation and substantial reserves accumulated during the years of growth Despite this, the recession proved to be the worst in the history of Russia, and the country's GDP fell by over 8% in 2009 [70] The government's response was to use over a trillion rubles (more than $40 billion U.S Dollars) to help troubled banks, [71] and initiated a large-scale stimulus programme, lending $50 billion to struggling companies [70] [71] No major banks collapsed, and minor failures were handled in an effective way The economic situation stabilised in 2009, but substantial growth did not resume until 2010 Medvedev's approval ratings declined during the crisis, dropping from 83% in September 2008 to 68% in April 2009, before recovering to 72% in October 2009 following improvements in the economy [72] [73]\n\n\nDomestic policy\nIn February 2022, after Russia was suspended from the Council of Europe due to its invasion of Ukraine, and subsequently announced its intention to withdraw from the organization, Medvedev stated that while the decision to suspend Russia was \"unfair\", it was also a \"good opportunity\" to reinstate the death penalty in Russia [162] [163]\n\n\nEconomy\nIn the economic sphere, Medvedev has launched a modernisation programme which aims at modernising Russia's economy and society, decreasing the country's dependency on oil and gas revenues and creating a diversified economy based on high technology and innovation [76] The programme is based on the top 5 priorities for the country's technological development: efficient energy use; nuclear technology; information technology; medical technology and pharmaceuticals; and space technology in combination with telecommunications [77]\n\n\nPolice reform\nMedvedev made reforming Russia's law enforcement one of his top agendas, the reason for which was a shooting started by a police officer in April 2009 in one of Moscow's supermarkets Medvedev initiated the reform at the end of 2009, with a presidential decree issued on 24 December ordering the government to begin planning the reform In early August 2010, a draft law was posted on the Internet at the address  [1] for public discussion The new website received more than 2,000 comments within 24 hours [84] Based on citizen feedback, several modifications to the draft were made On 27 October 2010, President Medvedev submitted the draft to the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma [85] The State Duma voted to approve the bill on 28 January 2011, and the upper house, the Federation Council followed suit on 2 February 2011 On 7 February 2011, President Medvedev signed the bill into law [86] The changes came into effect on 1 March 2011 [86]\n\n\nAnti-corruption campaign\nOn 19 May 2008, Medvedev signed a decree on anti-corruption measures, which included creation of an Anti-Corruption Council [88] In the first meeting of the council on 30 September 2008, Medvedev said: [89]\n\n\nEducation\nPresident Medvedev initiated a new policy called \"Our New School\" [clarification needed] and instructed the government to present a review on the implementation of the initiative every year [99]\n\n\nDevelopment of the political system\nRegional elections held on 1 March 2009 were followed by accusations of administrative resources being used in support of United Russia candidates, with the leader of A Just Russia, Sergey Mironov, being especially critical Responding to this, Medvedev met with the chairman of the Central Election Commission of Russia, Vladimir Churov, and called for moderation in the use of administrative resources [100] In August 2009, Medvedev promised to break the near-dominant position of United Russia party in national and regional legislatures, stating that \"New democratic times are beginning\" [101] The next regional elections were held on 11 October 2009 and won by United Russia with 66% of the vote The elections were again harshly criticised for the use of administrative resources in favour of United Russia candidates Communist, LDPR and A Just Russia parliamentary deputies staged an unprecedented walkout on 14–15 October 2009 as a result [100] Although Medvedev often promised to stand up for more political pluralism, Professor Richard Sakwa observed, after the 2009 regional elections, a gulf formed between Medvedev's words and the worsening situation, with the question arising \"whether Medvedev had the desire or ability to renew Russia's political system.\" [100]\n\n\nElection law changes\nIn 2009, Medvedev proposed an amendment to the election law which would decrease the State Duma election threshold from 7% to 5% The amendment was signed into law in Spring 2009 Parties receiving more than 5% but less than 6% of the votes would henceforward be guaranteed one seat, while parties receiving more than 6% but less than 7% will get two seats These seats will be allocated before the seats for parties with over 7% support [111]\n\n\nForeign policy\nIn February 2022, after sanctions had been imposed on Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine, Medvedev stated that Russia did not need diplomatic relations with the West and that the sanctions imposed on the country gave it good reason to pull out of dialogue on nuclear stability and potentially New START [169]\n\n\nRelationship with Putin\nAlthough the Russian constitution clearly apportions the greater power in the state to the president, speculation arose over the question of whether it was Medvedev or Prime Minister Vladimir Putin who actually wielded the most power [123] According to London Daily Telegraph, \"Kremlin-watchers\" note that Medvedev uses the more formal form of 'you' (Вы, 'vy') when addressing Putin, while Putin addresses Medvedev with the less formal 'ty' (ты) [123]\n\n\n2012 presidential elections\nAs both Putin and Medvedev could have run for president in the 2012 general elections, there was a view from some analysts that some of Medvedev's contemporaneous actions and comments at the time were designed to separate his image from Putin's BBC News suggested these might include his dealings in late 2010 with NATO and the United States, possibly designed to show himself as being better able to deal with Western nations, [126] and comments in November about the need for a stronger opposition in Russian politics, to present himself as a moderniser BBC News observed other analysts considered the split to be exaggerated, that Medvedev and Putin were \"trying to maximise support for the authorities by appealing to different parts of society\" [104] There was belief that the court verdict on former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his partner Platon Lebedev, both of whom funded opposition parties before their arrests, would indicate whether or not Putin was \"still calling all the shots\" [127]\n\n\nPost-presidency (2012–present)\nOn 7 May 2012, the same day he ceased to be the president of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev was nominated by President Vladimir Putin to the office of prime minister [133] [134] On 8 May 2012, the State Duma of the Russian Federation voted on the

Russia [155] His monthly salary was set at 618,713 rubles (8,723.85 USD) [156] In a July 2020 interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, Medvedev said he retains \"good friendly relations\" with President

{"title": "Formula_One", "content": "\nHistory\nFormula One originated from the World Manufacturers' Championship (1925–1930) and European Drivers' Championship (1931–1939) The formula is a set of rules that all participants' cars must follow Formula One was a formula agreed upon in 1946 to officially become effective in 1947 The first Grand Prix in accordance with the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, anticipating the formula's official start [5] [6] Before World War II, a number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a new championship to replace the European Championship, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the new International Formula for cars did not become formalised until 1946, to become effective in 1947 The new World Championship was instituted to commence in 1950 [7]\n\n\nTechnological developments\nThe first major technological development in the sport was Bugatti's introduction of mid-engined cars Jack Brabham, the world champion in 1959, 1960, and 1966, soon proved the mid-engine's superiority over all other engine positions By 1961 all teams had switched to mid-engined cars The Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined Formula One car to enter a world championship race It entered the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that year [20]\n\n\nBig business\nBeginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One's commercial rights; he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multibillion-dollar business it now is [23] [24] When Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the Formula One Constructors' Association, and in 1978, he became its president [25] Previously, the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually; Ecclestone persuaded the teams to \"hunt as a pack\" through FOCA [24] He offered Formula One to circuit owners as a package they could take or leave In return for the package, almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising [23]\n\n\nManufacturers' return\n Michael Schumacher and Ferrari won five consecutive Drivers' Championships (2000–2004) and six consecutive Constructors' Championships (1999–2004) Schumacher set many new records, including those for Grand Prix wins (91, since beaten by Lewis Hamilton), wins in a season (13, since beaten by Max Verstappen), and most Drivers' Championships (seven, tied with Lewis Hamilton as of 2021) [37] Schumacher's championship streak ended on 25 September 2005, when Renault driver Fernando Alonso became Formula One's youngest champion at that time (until Lewis Hamilton in 2008 and followed by Sebastian Vettel in 2010) During 2006, Renault and Alonso won both titles again Schumacher retired at the end of 2006 after 16 years in Formula One, but came out of retirement for the 2010 season, racing for the newly formed Mercedes works team, following the rebrand of Brawn GP.\n\n\nManufacturers' decline and return of the privateers\nIn 2008 and 2009, Honda, BMW, and Toyota all withdrew from Formula One racing within a year, blaming the economic recession This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance of the sport The Honda F1 team went through a management buyout to become Brawn GP, with Ross Brawn and Nick Fry running and owning the majority of the organisation Brawn GP laid off hundreds of employees, but won the year's world championships BMW F1 was bought out by the original founder of the team, Peter Sauber The Lotus F1 Team [42] was another, formerly manufacturer-owned team that reverted to \"privateer\" ownership, together with the buy-out of the Renault team by Genii Capital investors But a link with its previous owners still survived, with its car continuing to be powered by a Renault engine until 2014.\n\n\nHybrid era\n\nA major rule shakeup in 2014 saw the 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 engines replaced by 1.6-litre turbocharged hybrid power units This prompted Honda to return to the sport in 2015 as the championship's fourth power unit manufacturer Mercedes emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup, with Lewis Hamilton winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate, Nico Rosberg, with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season The team continued this form in the next two seasons, again winning 16 races in 2015 before taking a record 19 wins in 2016, with Hamilton claiming the title in the former year and Rosberg winning it in the latter by five points The 2016 season also saw a new team, Haas, join the grid, while Max Verstappen became the youngest-ever race winner at age 18 in Spain [52]\n\nRacing and strategy\nA Formula One Grand Prix event spans a weekend It typically begins with two free practice sessions on Friday, and one free practice session on Saturday Additional drivers (commonly known as third drivers) are allowed to run on Fridays, but only two cars may be used per team, requiring a race driver to give up their seat A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday [80] [81]\n\n\nTyre rules\nEach driver may use no more than thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres, four sets of intermediate tyres, and three sets of wet-weather tyres during a race weekend [82]\n\n\nQualifying\nFor much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest getting first place on the grid, referred to as pole position From 1996 to 2002, the format was a one-hour shootout This approach lasted until the end of 2002 before the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on [83]\n\n\nRace\nThe race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground) The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start.\n\n\nRace director\nThis role involves managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspecting cars in parc fermé before a race, enforcing FIA rules, and controlling the lights which start each race As the head of the race officials, the race director also plays a large role in resolving disputes among teams and drivers The race director may also refer incidents to the race stewards, who may give penalties, such as drive-through penalties (or stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications and fines should parties break regulations As of the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix, the race director is Rui Marques, with Herbie Blash as a permanent advisor [94] [95]\n\n\nSafety car\nIn the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals, race officials may choose to deploy the safety car This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with overtaking not permitted Cars that have been lapped may, during the safety car period and depending on circumstances permitted by the race director, be allowed to un-lap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being immediately thrown upon the resumption of the race with many of the cars in very close proximity to each other The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a \"rolling start\" Pit stops under a safety car are permitted, and in many cases can offer a great advantage to teams who are able to pit and change tyres before the safety car period ends [96] On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pits, the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the timing line After crossing this line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more.\n\n\nVirtual Safety Car\nFollowing an accident at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, which saw driver Jules Bianchi suffer a serious head injury that led to his death, the FIA established an \"accident panel\" to investigate the dynamics of the accident and ways to minimize the risk of a crash during similar circumstances that do not warrant the deployment of a safety car and cannot be simply managed with yellow flags When the virtual safety car is \"deployed\", the virtual marshal panels around the track display \"VSC\" All drivers receive a \"VSC\" notice on their steering wheels, and they must all keep their lap times above a pre-determined minimum, also known as keeping a positive delta [101] The system was first implemented during the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix, before being \"upgraded\" to a full safety car, following a collision between Max Verstappen and Romain Grosjean [102]\n\n\nFlags\nFlags specifications and usage are prescribed by Appendix H of the FIA's International Sporting Code [103]\n\n\nPoints system\n*A driver must finish within the top ten to receive a point for setting the fastest lap of the race If the driver who set the fastest lap finishes outside of the top ten, then the point for fastest lap will not be awarded for that race [105]\n\n\nConstructors\nA Formula One constructor is the entity credited for designing the chassis and the engine [111] If both are designed by the same company, that company receives sole credit as the constructor (e.g., Ferrari) If they are designed by different companies, both are credited, and the name of the chassis designer is placed before that of the engine designer (e.g., McLaren-Mercedes) All constructors are scored individually, even if they share either chassis or engine with another constructor (e.g., Williams-Ford, Williams-Honda in 1983) [112]\n\n\nDrivers\nEvery team in Formula One must run two cars in every session in a Grand Prix weekend, and every team may use up to four drivers in a season [81] A team may also run two additional drivers in Free Practice sessions, [81] which are often used to test potential new drivers for a career as a Formula One driver or gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car [122] [123] Most drivers are contracted for at least the duration of a season, with driver changes taking place in-between seasons, in comparison to early years when drivers often competed on an ad hoc basis from race to race Each competitor must be in the possession of a FIA Super Licence to compete in a Grand Prix, [124] which is issued to drivers who have met the criteria of success in junior motorsport categories and having achieved 300 kilometres (190 mi) of running in a Formula One car Drivers may also be issued a Super Licence by the World Motor Sport Council if they fail to meet the criteria [124] Although most drivers earn their seat on ability, commercial considerations also come into play with teams having to satisfy sponsors and financial demands.\n\n\nPhysical demands\nDriving in Formula One is highly demanding physically, with drivers typically burning around 1,000 calories per hour and losing 2–4 kg (4–9 lb) of weight per race [136] [137] A key reason for the physical demands is the extreme g-forces generated by driving at high speeds, with modern Formula One cars capable of generating forces of up to 6.5 gs when cornering, 6 gs when braking and 2 gs when accelerating [138] [139] [140] When a driver experiences 6 g, they will feel a force equivalent to six times their body weight; for a person weighing 80 kg (176 lb), this would be 480 kg (1,058 lb) [141] Another factor is the high temperature inside the car, as the engine is mounted directly behind the driver The temperature in the cockpit of a Formula One car can be as high as 60 °C (140 °F) and drivers have to wear several layers of fireproof racing clothing [142] [143] The steering wheel and brake pedal also require considerable strength to operate Before the introduction of power steering in the 2000s, drivers had to cope with steering forces of up to 40–50 newton-metres (30–37 lb⋅ft), [144] [145] while achieving maximum braking power requires drivers to apply around 150 kg (330 lb) of force to the brake pedal [146] Drivers also need to be light, as every extra kilogram of weight noticeably reduces performance [136]\n\n\nFeeder series\nMost F1 drivers start in kart racing competitions, and then come up through traditional European single-seater series like Formula Ford and Formula Renault to Formula 3, and finally the GP2 Series GP2 started in 2005, replacing Formula 3000, which itself had replaced Formula Two as the last major stepping-stone into F1 GP2 was rebranded as the FIA Formula 2 Championship in 2017 Most champions from this level graduate into F1, but 2006 GP2 champion Lewis Hamilton became the first F2, F3000 or GP2 champion to win the Formula One drivers' title in 2008 [147]\n\n\nGrands Prix\nThe number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years The inaugural 1950 World Championship season comprised only seven races, while the 2021, 2022 and 2023 seasons each contained 22 races, the highest number of World Championship races in one season [149] There were no more than 11 Grands Prix per season during the early decades of the championship, although a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of 16 to 17 by the late 1970s, while non-championship events ended in 1983 More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and recent seasons have seen an average of 21 races 24 races are scheduled for the 2024 season.\n\n\nContracted Grands Prix\nThe following twenty-four Grands Prix, all of which appeared on the 2024 schedule, have a contract to be hosted at the listed circuits for the 2025 season: \n\n\nReturning additions (2008–present)\nBold denotes the Grands Prix scheduled as part of the 2024 season.\n\n\nNew Locations Initiative (2008–present)\nBold denotes the Grands Prix scheduled as part of the 2024 season.\n\n\nCircuits\nFormula One races must be held on grade one tracks, the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA for tracks [180] The layout and lap distance of each circuit can vary significantly as long as they stay within the FIA's regulations In most cases, the tracks run in a clockwise direction, although there are a handful of tracks in the Championship that run anticlockwise.\n\n\nCars and technology\nModern Formula One cars are mid-engined, hybrid, semi-open cockpit, open-wheel single-seaters The chassis is made largely of carbon-fibre composites, rendering it light but extremely stiff and strong The whole car, including the driver but not fuel, weighs only 795 kg (1,753 lb) – the minimum weight set by the regulations [188] If the construction of the car is lighter than the minimum, it can be ballasted up to add the necessary weight The race teams take advantage of this by placing this ballast at the extreme bottom of the chassis, thereby locating the centre of gravity as low as possible in order to improve handling and weight transfer [189]\n\n\nRevenue and profits\nIn March 2007, F1 Racing published its annual estimates of spending by Formula One teams [213] The total spending of all eleven teams in 2006 was estimated at $2.9 billion US This was broken down as follows: Toyota $418.5 million, Ferrari $406.5 m, McLaren $402 m, Honda $380.5 m, BMW Sauber $355 m, Renault $324 m, Red Bull $252 m, Williams $195.5 m, Midland F1/Spyker-MF1 $120 m, Toro Rosso $75 m, and Super Aguri $57 million.\n\n\nCost cap\nSince the beginning of Formula 1 back in 1950, the sport’s governing body has not had any regulations limiting the spending of a team This has led to a pattern where teams with large budgets perform significantly better than their competitors and the gap has only continued to increase [223]\n\n\nFuture\nThe expense of Formula One has seen the FIA and the Formula One Commission attempt to create new regulations to lower the costs for a team to compete in the sport [230] [231]\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\nFormula One has launched a plan to become carbon neutral by 2030 By 2025, all events should become \"sustainable\", including eliminating single-use plastics and ensuring all waste is reused, recycled or composted [235]\n\n\nSocial inequities\nPrior to the beginning of the 2020 Formula One World Championship, F1 announced and launched the #WeRaceAsOne initiative [241] The initiative primarily focuses on visible displays of solidarity in the fight against racism on Grand Prix Weekends, as well as the creation of a Formula 1 Task Force that will \"listen to people from across the paddock  [...] and make conclusions on the actions required to improve the diversity and opportunity in Formula 1 at all levels\" [241] The move spurs from the growing questions about racism and global inequalities perpetuated by the sport The 70-year history of the World Championship has been dominated by European and white drivers, with the first (and only) black driver, Lewis Hamilton, participating in the world championship since 2007 [242]\n\n\nWomen in Formula One\nSince the creation of Formula One, in 1950, there have been five women to compete in a Grand Prix, and only one managed to score The involvement of women in the Formula One paddock ranges from race engineers and strategists to media and communications personnel With the release of the Netflix show, Drive to Survive, the female viewership of the sport has risen In 2019 20% of the total Formula One viewership was female, and by 2022 this number had increased to 40% [247]\n\n\nF1 Academy\nF1 Academy, created by Formula One in 2023, is the only female single-seater racing championship Its inaugural championship was won by Marta Garcia, of Prema Racing The establishment of the F1 academy has attracted significant levels of attention to women in motorsport - thanks to this, Netflix has announced the release of a docuseries in 2025 about the academy In addition to this companies such as Tommy Hilfiger, Charlotte Tilbury, [248] Puma, and Red Bull have become sponsors of F1 Academy due to its increasing popularity [249]\n\n\nFemale Formula One drivers\nMaria Teresa de Filippis was the first female to compete in a Formula One Grand Prix at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix She competed in a total of five Grand Prix, racing under the Italian flag and has been hailed a pioneer of women in motorsport [250]\n\n\nRace engineers\nHannah Schmitz currently holds the role of principal strategy engineer at Red Bull Racing She has been with the team since 2009 and played a strong presence in its victories in 2021, 2022, and 2023 In 2023 Schmitz won the McLaren Applied Female Engineer of the Year Award winner for her role within Red Bull Racing [252]\n\n\nTeam principals\nSusie Wolff is the current managing director of F1 Academy, however her presence within the Formula One paddock has lasted several decades In the beginning of her career she was told to drive a pink car, although she was skeptical, Wolff obliged figuring that young girls would see the car and feel more inspired to begin racing [253] In 2012 Wolff was a Williams Grand Prix Engineering development driver, during her four years at Williams, she competed in several free practice sessions for the team After her time at Williams, Wolff became the team principal of Formula E team Venturi Racing, and saw the team to their most successful season to date.\n\n\nMedia and presenters\nNatalie Pinkham is a British television presenter and pit lane reporter for Sky Sports F1 She joined the television channel in 2012, and became the first woman commentator on British TV [255]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nFormula One is broadcast live, or tape delayed in almost every country and territory and attracts one of the largest global television audiences The 2008 season attracted a global audience of 600 million people per race [257] The cumulative television audience was calculated to be 54 billion for the 2001 season, broadcast to 200 territories [258]\n\n\nDistinction between Formula One and World Championship races\nCurrently, the terms \"Formula One race\" and \"World Championship race\" are effectively synonymous Since 1984, every Formula One race has counted towards the World Championship, and every World Championship race has been run to Formula One regulations However, the two terms are not interchangeable.\n\n\nEuropean non-championship racing\nIn the early years of Formula One, before the world championship was established, there were around twenty races held from late Spring to early Autumn in Europe, although not all of these were considered significant Most competitive cars came from Italy, particularly Alfa Romeo After the start of the world championship, these non-championship races continued In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races which did not count for the World Championship; in 1950 a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship [274] In 1952 and 1953, when the world championship was run to Formula Two regulations, non-championship events were the only Formula One races that took place.\n\n\nSouth African Formula One championship\nSouth Africa's flourishing domestic Formula One championship ran from 1960 through to 1975 The frontrunning cars in the series were recently retired from the world championship although there was also a healthy selection of locally built or modified machines.\n\n\nBritish Formula One Championship\nThe DFV helped in making the UK domestic Formula One championship possible between 1978 and 1980 As in South Africa a decade before, second hand cars from manufacturers like Lotus and Fittipaldi Automotive were the order of the day, although some, such as the March 781, were built specifically for the series In 1980, the series saw South African Desiré Wilson become the only woman to win a Formula One race when she triumphed at Brands Hatch in a Wolf WR3 [280]\n\n\nSee also\n1950  G Farina\n1951  J M Fangio\n1952  A Ascari\n1953  A

Prix racing, is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The championship has been in existence since 1950 and has grown into a global phenomenon, attracting millions of fans worldwide. The sport is known for its high-speed racing, advanced technology, and impressive driver skills.\n\n**History**\n\nFormula One originated from the World Manufacturers' Championship (1925–1930) and European Drivers' Championship (1931–1939). The formula is a set of rules that all participants' cars must follow. Formula One was a formula agreed upon in 1946 to officially become effective in 1947. The first Grand Prix in accordance with the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, anticipating the formula's official start.\n\nBefore World War II, a number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a new championship to replace the European Championship, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the new International Formula for cars did not become formalised until 1946, to become effective in 1947. The new World Championship was instituted to commence in 1950.\n\n**Technological developments**\n\nThe first major technological development in the sport was Bugatti's introduction of mid-engined cars. Jack Brabham, the world champion in 1959, 1960, and 1966, soon proved the mid-engine's superiority over all other engine positions. By 1961 all teams had switched to mid-engined cars. The Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined Formula One car to enter a world championship race. It entered the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that year.\n\n**Big business**\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One's commercial rights; he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multibillion-dollar business it now is. When Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the Formula One Constructors' Association, and in 1978, he became its president.\n\n**Manufacturers' return**\n\nMichael Schumacher and Ferrari won five consecutive Drivers' Championships (2000–2004) and six consecutive Constructors' Championships (1999–2004). Schumacher set many new records, including those for Grand Prix wins (91, since beaten by Lewis Hamilton), wins in a season (13, since beaten by Max Verstappen), and most Drivers' Championships (seven, tied with Lewis Hamilton as of 2021).\n\n**Manufacturers' decline and return of the privateers**\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, Honda, BMW, and Toyota all withdrew from Formula One racing within a year, blaming the economic recession. This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance of the sport. The Honda F1 team went through a management buyout to become Brawn GP, with Ross Brawn and Nick Fry running and owning the majority of the organisation. Brawn GP laid off hundreds of employees, but won the year's world championships. BMW F1 was bought out by the original founder of the team, Peter Sauber. The Lotus F1 Team was another, formerly manufacturer-owned team that reverted to \"privateer\" ownership, together with the buy-out of the Renault team by Genii Capital investors.\n\n**Hybrid era**\n\nA major rule shakeup in 2014 saw the 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 engines replaced by 1.6-litre turbocharged hybrid power units. This prompted Honda to return to the sport in 2015 as the championship's fourth power unit manufacturer. Mercedes emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup, with Lewis Hamilton winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate, Nico Rosberg, with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season.\n\n**Racing and strategy**\n\nA Formula One Grand Prix event spans a weekend. It typically begins with two free practice sessions on Friday, and one free practice session on Saturday. Additional drivers (commonly known as third drivers) are allowed to run on Fridays, but only two cars may be used per team, requiring a race driver to give up their seat. A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session. This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday.\n\n**Tyre rules**\n\nEach driver may use no more than thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres, four sets of intermediate tyres, and three sets of wet-weather tyres during a race weekend.\n\n**Qualifying**\n\nFor much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest getting first place on the grid, referred to as pole position.\n\n**Race**\n\nThe race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start.\n\n**Safety car**\n\nIn the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals, race officials may choose to deploy the safety car. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with overtaking not permitted. Cars that have been lapped may, during the safety car period and depending on circumstances permitted by the race director, be allowed to un-lap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being immediately thrown upon the resumption of the race with many of the cars in very close proximity to each other.\n\n**Virtual Safety Car**\n\nFollowing an accident at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, which saw driver Jules Bianchi suffer a serious head injury that led to his death, the FIA established an \"accident panel\" to investigate the dynamics of the accident and ways to minimize the risk of a crash during similar circumstances that do not warrant the deployment of a safety car and cannot be simply managed with yellow flags. When the virtual safety car is \"deployed\", the virtual marshal panels around the track display \"VSC\". All drivers receive a \"VSC\" notice on their steering wheels, and they must all keep their lap times above a pre-determined minimum, also known as keeping a positive delta.\n\n**Flags**\n\nFlags specifications and usage are prescribed by Appendix H of the FIA's International Sporting Code.\n\n**Points system**\n\nA driver must finish within the top ten to receive a point for setting the fastest lap of the race. If the driver who set the fastest lap finishes outside of the top ten, then the point for fastest lap will not be awarded for that race.\n\n**Constructors**\n\nA Formula One constructor is the entity credited for designing the chassis and the engine. If both are designed by the same company, that company receives sole credit as the constructor (e.g., Ferrari). If they are designed by different companies, both are credited, and the name of the chassis designer is placed before that of the engine designer (e.g., McLaren-Mercedes). All constructors are scored individually, even if they share either chassis or engine with another constructor (e.g., Williams-Ford, Williams-Honda in 1983).\n\n**Drivers**\n\nEvery team in Formula One must run two cars in every session in a Grand Prix weekend, and every team may use up to four drivers in a season. A team may also run two additional drivers in Free Practice sessions, which are often used to test potential new drivers for a career as a Formula One driver or gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car. Most drivers are contracted for at least the duration of a season, with driver changes taking place in-between seasons, in comparison to early years when drivers often competed on an ad hoc basis from race to race. Each competitor must be in the possession of a FIA Super Licence to compete in a Grand Prix, which is issued to drivers who have met the criteria of success in junior motorsport categories and having achieved 300 kilometres (190 mi) of running in a Formula One car.\n\n**Physical demands**\n\nDriving in Formula One is highly demanding physically, with drivers typically burning around 1,000 calories per hour and losing 2–4 kg (4–9 lb) of weight per race.

The steering wheel and brake pedal also require considerable strength to operate. Before the introduction of power steering in the 2000s, drivers had to cope with steering forces of up to 40–50 newton-metres (30–37 lb⋅ft), and achieving maximum braking power requires drivers to apply around 150 kg (330 lb) of force to the brake pedal. Drivers also need to be light, as every extra kilogram of weight noticeably reduces performance.\n\n**Feeder series**\n\nMost F1 drivers start in kart racing competitions, and then come up through traditional European single-seater series like Formula Ford and Formula Renault to Formula 3, and finally the GP2 Series. GP2 started in 2005, replacing Formula 3000, which itself had replaced Formula Two as the last major stepping-stone into F1. GP2 was rebranded as the FIA Formula 2 Championship in 2017.

Chinese Grand Prix (2012)\n3. Dutch Grand Prix (2021)\n4. Saudi Arabian Grand Prix (2021)\n\n**Circuits**\n\nFormula One races must be held on grade one tracks, the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA for tracks.

The total spending of all eleven teams in 2006 was estimated at $2.9 billion US. This was broken down as follows:\n\n* Toyota: $418.5 million\n* Ferrari: $406.5 million\n* McLaren: $402 million\n* Honda: $380.5 million\n* BMW Sauber: $355 million\n* Renault: $324 million\n* Red Bull: $252 million\n* Williams: $195.5 million\n* Midland F1/Spyker-MF1: $120 million\n* Toro Rosso: $75 million\n* Super Aguri: $57 million\n\n**Cost cap**\n\nSince the beginning of Formula One back in 1950, the sport's governing body has not had any regulations limiting the spending of a team. This has led to a pattern where teams with large budgets perform significantly better than their competitors and the gap has only continued to increase.\n\n**Future**\n\nThe expense of Formula One has seen the FIA and the Formula One Commission attempt to create new regulations to lower the costs for a team to compete in the sport. The current cost cap of $175 million per team for the 2021 season is a significant reduction from the estimated $2.9 billion US spend by the teams in 2006.\n\n**Environmental impact**\n\nFormula One has launched a plan to become carbon neutral by 2030. By 2025, all events should become \"sustainable\", including eliminating single-use plastics and ensuring all waste is reused, recycled or composted.\n\n**Social inequities**\n\nPrior to the beginning of the 2020 Formula One World Championship, F1 announced and launched the #WeRaceAsOne initiative. The initiative primarily focuses on visible displays of solidarity in the fight against racism on Grand Prix Weekends, as well as the creation of a Formula 1 Task Force that will \"listen to people from across the paddock [...] and make conclusions on the actions required to improve the diversity and opportunity in Formula 1 at all levels\".\n\n**Women in Formula One**\n\nSince the creation of Formula One, in 1950, there have been five women to compete in a Grand Prix, and only one managed to score. The involvement of women in the Formula One paddock ranges from race engineers and strategists to media and communications personnel. With the release of the Netflix show, Drive to Survive, the female viewership of the sport has risen. In 2019, 20% of the total Formula One viewership was female, and by 2022, this number had increased to 40%.\n\n**F1 Academy**\n\nF1 Academy, created by Formula One in 2023, is the only female single-seater racing championship. Its inaugural championship was won by Marta Garcia, of Prema Racing. The establishment of the F1 academy has attracted significant levels of attention to women in motorsport, thanks to this, Netflix has announced the release of a docuseries in 2025 about the academy. In addition to this, companies such as Tommy Hilfiger, Charlotte Tilbury, Puma, and Red Bull have become sponsors of F1 Academy due to its increasing popularity.\n\n**Female Formula One drivers**\n\nMaria Teresa de Filippis was the first female to compete in a Formula One Grand Prix at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix. She competed in a total of five Grand Prix, racing under the Italian flag, and has been hailed a pioneer of women in motorsport.\n\n**Race engineers**\n\nHannah Schmitz currently holds the role of principal strategy engineer at Red Bull Racing. She has been with the team since 2009 and played a strong presence in its victories in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2023, Schmitz won the McLaren Applied Female Engineer of the Year Award for her role within Red Bull Racing.\n\n**Team principals**\n\nSusie Wolff is the current managing director of F1 Academy, however, her presence within the Formula One paddock has lasted several decades. In the beginning of her career, she was told to drive a pink car, although she was skeptical, Wolff obliged, figuring that young girls would see the car and feel more inspired to begin racing. In 2012, Wolff was a Williams Grand Prix Engineering development driver, during her four years at Williams, she competed in several free practice sessions for the team. After her time at Williams, Wolff became the team principal of Formula E team Venturi Racing, and saw the team to their most successful season to date.\n\n**Media and presenters**\n\nNatalie Pinkham is a British television presenter and pit lane reporter for Sky Sports F1. She joined the television channel in 2012, and became the first woman commentator on British TV.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Formula_One\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nFormula One originated from the World Manufacturers' Championship (1925–1930) and European Drivers' Championship (1931–1939) The formula is a set of rules that all participants' cars must follow Formula One was a formula agreed upon in 1946 to officially become effective in 1947 The first Grand Prix in accordance with the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, anticipating the formula's official start [5] [6] Before World War II, a number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a new championship to replace the European Championship, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the new International Formula for cars did not become formalised until 1946, to become effective in 1947 The new World Championship was instituted to commence in 1950 [7]\n\n\nTechnological developments\nThe first major technological development in the sport was Bugatti's introduction of mid-engined cars Jack Brabham, the world champion in 1959, 1960, and 1966, soon proved the mid-engine's superiority over all other engine positions By 1961 all teams had switched to mid-engined cars The Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined Formula One car to enter a world championship race It entered the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that year [20]\n\n\nBig business\nBeginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One's commercial rights; he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multibillion-dollar business it now is [23] [24] When Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the Formula One Constructors' Association, and in 1978, he became its president [25] Previously, the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually; Ecclestone persuaded the teams to \"hunt as a pack\" through FOCA [24] He offered Formula One to circuit owners as a package they could take or leave In return for the package, almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising [23]\n\n\nManufacturers' return\n Michael Schumacher and Ferrari won five consecutive Drivers' Championships (2000–2004) and six consecutive Constructors' Championships (1999–2004) Schumacher set many new records, including those for Grand Prix wins (91, since beaten by Lewis Hamilton), wins in a season (13, since beaten by Max Verstappen), and most Drivers' Championships (seven, tied with Lewis Hamilton as of 2021) [37] Schumacher's championship streak ended on 25 September 2005, when Renault driver Fernando Alonso became Formula One's youngest champion at that time (until Lewis Hamilton in 2008 and followed by Sebastian Vettel in 2010) During 2006, Renault and Alonso won both titles again Schumacher retired at the end of 2006 after 16 years in Formula One, but came out of retirement for the 2010 season, racing for the newly formed Mercedes works team, following the rebrand of Brawn GP.\n\n\nManufacturers' decline and return of the privateers\nIn 2008 and 2009, Honda, BMW, and Toyota all withdrew from Formula One racing within a year, blaming the economic recession This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance of the sport The Honda F1 team went through a management buyout to become Brawn GP, with Ross Brawn and Nick Fry running and owning the majority of the organisation Brawn GP laid off hundreds of employees, but won the year's world championships BMW F1 was bought out by the original founder of the team, Peter Sauber The Lotus F1 Team [42] was another, formerly manufacturer-owned team that reverted to \"privateer\" ownership, together with the buy-out of the Renault team by Genii Capital investors But a link with its previous owners still survived, with its car continuing to be powered by a Renault engine until 2014.\n\n\nHybrid era\n\nA major rule shakeup in 2014 saw the 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 engines replaced by 1.6-litre turbocharged hybrid power units This prompted Honda to return to the sport in 2015 as the championship's fourth power unit manufacturer Mercedes emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup, with Lewis Hamilton winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate, Nico Rosberg, with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season The team continued this form in the next two seasons, again winning 16 races in 2015 before taking a record 19 wins in 2016, with Hamilton claiming the title in the former year and Rosberg winning it in the latter by five points The 2016 season also saw a new team, Haas, join the grid, while Max Verstappen became the youngest-ever race winner at age 18 in Spain [52]\n\nRacing and strategy\nA Formula One Grand Prix event spans a weekend It typically begins with two free practice sessions on Friday, and one free practice session on Saturday Additional drivers (commonly known as third drivers) are allowed to run on Fridays, but only two cars may be used per team, requiring a race driver to give up their seat A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday [80] [81]\n\n\nTyre rules\nEach driver may use no more than thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres, four sets of intermediate tyres, and three sets of wet-weather tyres during a race weekend [82]\n\n\nQualifying\nFor much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest getting first place on the grid, referred to as pole position From 1996 to 2002, the format was a one-hour shootout This approach lasted until the end of 2002 before the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on [83]\n\n\nRace\nThe race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground) The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start.\n\n\nRace director\nThis role involves managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspecting cars in parc fermé before a race, enforcing FIA rules, and controlling the lights which start each race As the head of the race officials, the race director also plays a large role in resolving disputes among teams and drivers The race director may also refer incidents to the race stewards, who may give penalties, such as drive-through penalties (or stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications and fines should parties break regulations As of the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix, the race director is Rui Marques, with Herbie Blash as a permanent advisor [94] [95]\n\n\nSafety car\nIn the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals, race officials may choose to deploy the safety car This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with overtaking not permitted Cars that have been lapped may, during the safety car period and depending on circumstances permitted by the race director, be allowed to un-lap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being immediately thrown upon the resumption of the race with many of the cars in very close proximity to each other The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a \"rolling start\" Pit stops under a safety car are permitted, and in many cases can offer a great advantage to teams who are able to pit and change tyres before the safety car period ends [96] On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pits, the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the timing line After crossing this line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more.\n\n\nVirtual Safety Car\nFollowing an accident at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, which saw driver Jules Bianchi suffer a serious head injury that led to his death, the FIA established an \"accident panel\" to investigate the dynamics of the accident and ways to minimize the risk of a crash during similar circumstances that do not warrant the deployment of a safety car and cannot be simply managed with yellow flags When the virtual safety car is \"deployed\", the virtual marshal panels around the track display \"VSC\" All drivers receive a \"VSC\" notice on their steering wheels, and they must all keep their lap times above a pre-determined minimum, also known as keeping a positive delta [101] The system was first implemented during the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix, before being \"upgraded\" to a full safety car, following a collision between Max Verstappen and Romain Grosjean [102]\n\n\nFlags\nFlags specifications and usage are prescribed by Appendix H of the FIA's International Sporting Code [103]\n\n\nPoints system\n*A driver must finish within the top ten to receive a point for setting the fastest lap of the race If the driver who set the fastest lap finishes outside of the top ten, then the point for fastest lap will not be awarded for that race [105]\n\n\nConstructors\nA Formula One constructor is the entity credited for designing the chassis and the engine [111] If both are designed by the same company, that company receives sole credit as the constructor (e.g., Ferrari) If they are designed by different companies, both are credited, and the name of the chassis designer is placed before that of the engine designer (e.g., McLaren-Mercedes) All constructors are scored individually, even if they share either chassis or engine with another constructor (e.g., Williams-Ford, Williams-Honda in 1983) [112]\n\n\nDrivers\nEvery team in Formula One must run two cars in every session in a Grand Prix weekend, and every team may use up to four drivers in a season [81] A team may also run two additional drivers in Free Practice sessions, [81] which are often used to test potential new drivers for a career as a Formula One driver or gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car [122] [123] Most drivers are contracted for at least the duration of a season, with driver changes taking place in-between seasons, in comparison to early years when drivers often competed on an ad hoc basis from race to race Each competitor must be in the possession of a FIA Super Licence to compete in a Grand Prix, [124] which is issued to drivers who have met the criteria of success in junior motorsport categories and having achieved 300 kilometres (190 mi) of running in a Formula One car Drivers may also be issued a Super Licence by the World Motor Sport Council if they fail to meet the criteria [124] Although most drivers earn their seat on ability, commercial considerations also come into play with teams having to satisfy sponsors and financial demands.\n\n\nPhysical demands\nDriving in Formula One is highly demanding physically, with drivers typically burning around 1,000 calories per hour and losing 2–4 kg (4–9 lb) of weight per race [136] [137] A key reason for the physical demands is the extreme g-forces generated by driving at high speeds, with modern Formula One cars capable of generating forces of up to 6.5 gs when cornering, 6 gs when braking and 2 gs when accelerating [138] [139] [140] When a driver experiences 6 g, they will feel a force equivalent to six times their body weight; for a person weighing 80 kg (176 lb), this would be 480 kg (1,058 lb) [141] Another factor is the high temperature inside the car, as the engine is mounted directly behind the driver The temperature in the cockpit of a Formula One car can be as high as 60 °C (140 °F) and drivers have to wear several layers of fireproof racing clothing [142] [143] The steering wheel and brake pedal also require considerable strength to operate Before the introduction of power steering in the 2000s, drivers had to cope with steering forces of up to 40–50 newton-metres (30–37 lb⋅ft), [144] [145] while achieving maximum braking power requires drivers to apply around 150 kg (330 lb) of force to the brake pedal [146] Drivers also need to be light, as every extra kilogram of weight noticeably reduces performance [136]\n\n\nFeeder series\nMost F1 drivers start in kart racing competitions, and then come up through traditional European single-seater series like Formula Ford and Formula Renault to Formula 3, and finally the GP2 Series GP2 started in 2005, replacing Formula 3000, which itself had replaced Formula Two as the last major stepping-stone into F1 GP2 was rebranded as the FIA Formula 2 Championship in 2017 Most champions from this level graduate into F1, but 2006 GP2 champion Lewis Hamilton became the first F2, F3000 or GP2 champion to win the Formula One drivers' title in 2008 [147]\n\n\nGrands Prix\nThe number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years The inaugural 1950 World Championship season comprised only seven races, while the 2021, 2022 and 2023 seasons each contained 22 races, the highest number of World Championship races in one season [149] There were no more than 11 Grands Prix per season during the early decades of the championship, although a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of 16 to 17 by the late 1970s, while non-championship events ended in 1983 More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and recent seasons have seen an average of 21 races 24 races are scheduled for the 2024 season.\n\n\nContracted Grands Prix\nThe following twenty-four Grands Prix, all of which appeared on the 2024 schedule, have a contract to be hosted at the listed circuits for the 2025 season: \n\n\nReturning additions (2008–present)\nBold denotes the Grands Prix scheduled as part of the 2024 season.\n\n\nNew Locations Initiative (2008–present)\nBold denotes the Grands Prix scheduled as part of the 2024 season.\n\n\nCircuits\nFormula One races must be held on grade one tracks, the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA for tracks [180] The layout and lap distance of each circuit can vary significantly as long as they stay within the FIA's regulations In most cases, the tracks run in a clockwise direction, although there are a handful of tracks in the Championship that run anticlockwise.\n\n\nCars and technology\nModern Formula One cars are mid-engined, hybrid, semi-open cockpit, open-wheel single-seaters The chassis is made largely of carbon-fibre composites, rendering it light but extremely stiff and strong The whole car, including the driver but not fuel, weighs only 795 kg (1,753 lb) – the minimum weight set by the regulations [188] If the construction of the car is lighter than the minimum, it can be ballasted up to add the necessary weight The race teams take advantage of this by placing this ballast at the extreme bottom of the chassis, thereby locating the centre of gravity as low as possible in order to improve handling and weight transfer [189]\n\n\nRevenue and profits\nIn March 2007, F1 Racing published its annual estimates of spending by Formula One teams [213] The total spending of all eleven teams in 2006 was estimated at $2.9 billion US This was broken down as follows: Toyota $418.5 million, Ferrari $406.5 m, McLaren $402 m, Honda $380.5 m, BMW Sauber $355 m, Renault $324 m, Red Bull $252 m, Williams $195.5 m, Midland F1/Spyker-MF1 $120 m, Toro Rosso $75 m, and Super Aguri $57 million.\n\n\nCost cap\nSince the beginning of Formula 1 back in 1950, the sport’s governing body has not had any regulations limiting the spending of a team This has led to a pattern where teams with large budgets perform significantly better than their competitors and the gap has only continued to increase [223]\n\n\nFuture\nThe expense of Formula One has seen the FIA and the Formula One Commission attempt to create new regulations to lower the costs for a team to compete in the sport [230] [231]\n\n\nEnvironmental impact\nFormula One has launched a plan to become carbon neutral by 2030 By 2025, all events should become \"sustainable\", including eliminating single-use plastics and ensuring all waste is reused, recycled or composted [235]\n\n\nSocial inequities\nPrior to the beginning of the 2020 Formula One World Championship, F1 announced and launched the #WeRaceAsOne initiative [241] The initiative primarily focuses on visible displays of solidarity in the fight against racism on Grand Prix Weekends, as well as the creation of a Formula 1 Task Force that will \"listen to people from across the paddock  [...] and make conclusions on the actions required to improve the diversity and opportunity in Formula 1 at all levels\" [241] The move spurs from the growing questions about racism and global inequalities perpetuated by the sport The 70-year history of the World Championship has been dominated by European and white drivers, with the first (and only) black driver, Lewis Hamilton, participating in the world championship since 2007 [242]\n\n\nWomen in Formula One\nSince the creation of Formula One, in 1950, there have been five women to compete in a Grand Prix, and only one managed to score The involvement of women in the Formula One paddock ranges from race engineers and strategists to media and communications personnel With the release of the Netflix show, Drive to Survive, the female viewership of the sport has risen In 2019 20% of the total Formula One viewership was female, and by 2022 this number had increased to 40% [247]\n\n\nF1 Academy\nF1 Academy, created by Formula One in 2023, is the only female single-seater racing championship Its inaugural championship was won by Marta Garcia, of Prema Racing The establishment of the F1 academy has attracted significant levels of attention to women in motorsport - thanks to this, Netflix has announced the release of a docuseries in 2025 about the academy In addition to this companies such as Tommy Hilfiger, Charlotte Tilbury, [248] Puma, and Red Bull have become sponsors of F1 Academy due to its increasing popularity [249]\n\n\nFemale Formula One drivers\nMaria Teresa de Filippis was the first female to compete in a Formula One Grand Prix at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix She competed in a total of five Grand Prix, racing under the Italian flag and has been hailed a pioneer of women in motorsport [250]\n\n\nRace engineers\nHannah Schmitz currently holds the role of principal strategy engineer at Red Bull Racing She has been with the team since 2009 and played a strong presence in its victories in 2021, 2022, and 2023 In 2023 Schmitz won the McLaren Applied Female Engineer of the Year Award winner for her role within Red Bull Racing [252]\n\n\nTeam principals\nSusie Wolff is the current managing director of F1 Academy, however her presence within the Formula One paddock has lasted several decades In the beginning of her career she was told to drive a pink car, although she was skeptical, Wolff obliged figuring that young girls would see the car and feel more inspired to begin racing [253] In 2012 Wolff was a Williams Grand Prix Engineering development driver, during her four years at Williams, she competed in several free practice sessions for the team After her time at Williams, Wolff became the team principal of Formula E team Venturi Racing, and saw the team to their most successful season to date.\n\n\nMedia and presenters\nNatalie Pinkham is a British television presenter and pit lane reporter for Sky Sports F1 She joined the television channel in 2012, and became the first woman commentator on British TV [255]\n\n\nMedia coverage\nFormula One is broadcast live, or tape delayed in almost every country and territory and attracts one of the largest global television audiences The 2008 season attracted a global audience of 600 million people per race [257] The cumulative television audience was calculated to be 54 billion for the 2001 season, broadcast to 200 territories [258]\n\n\nDistinction between Formula One and World Championship races\nCurrently, the terms \"Formula One race\" and \"World Championship race\" are effectively synonymous Since 1984, every Formula One race has counted towards the World Championship, and every World Championship race has been run to Formula One regulations However, the two terms are not interchangeable.\n\n\nEuropean non-championship racing\nIn the early years of Formula One, before the world championship was established, there were around twenty races held from late Spring to early Autumn in Europe, although not all of these were considered significant Most competitive cars came from Italy, particularly Alfa Romeo After the start of the world championship, these non-championship races continued In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races which did not count for the World Championship; in 1950 a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship [274] In 1952 and 1953, when the world championship was run to Formula Two regulations, non-championship events were the only Formula One races that took place.\n\n\nSouth African Formula One championship\nSouth Africa's flourishing domestic Formula One championship ran from 1960 through to 1975 The frontrunning cars in the series were recently retired from the world championship although there was also a healthy selection of locally built or modified machines.\n\n\nBritish Formula One Championship\nThe DFV helped in making the UK domestic Formula One championship possible between 1978 and 1980 As in South Africa a decade before, second hand cars from manufacturers like Lotus and Fittipaldi Automotive were the order of the day, although some, such as the March 781, were built specifically for the series In 1980, the series saw South African Desiré Wilson become the only woman to win a Formula One race when she triumphed at Brands Hatch in a Wolf WR3 [280]\n\n\nSee also\n1950  G Farina\n1951  J M Fangio\n1952  A Ascari\n1953  A Ascari\n1954  J M Fangio\n1955  J M Fangio\n1956  J M Fangio\n1957  J M Fangio\n1958  M Hawthorn\n1959  J

It is a skeletal condition that affects the development of bones, particularly those formed from membranous tissue. The condition gets its name from the two primary features: the deformities of the clavicle (collarbone) and the cranium. People with CCD often experience a range of symptoms, which can vary in severity.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms**\n\nIndividuals with cleidocranial dysplasia may exhibit a variety of physical and developmental abnormalities. The condition can affect the shape and size of the collarbone, leading to its partial or complete absence. The cranium may also be affected, resulting in a range of defects, including a prominent forehead, an underdeveloped nasal bridge, and a protruding jaw. Other symptoms may include:\n\n* Dental abnormalities, such as missing or impacted teeth\n* Delayed or incomplete bone growth\n* Short stature\n* Joint problems and mobility issues\n* Sensory impairments, including hearing loss and vision problems\n* Cognitive and developmental delays\n\n**Genetics**\n\nCleidocranial dysplasia is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. However, in some cases, the genetic cause is not known. The main mechanism underlying CCD is thought to involve haploinsufficiency caused by mutations in the CBFA1 gene, also known as Runx2. This gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21) and encodes a transcription factor required for the differentiation of stem cells into osteoblasts.\n\nThe mutations in the CBFA1 gene result in delayed ossification of midline structures of the body and ensuing defects in membranous and endochondral bone formation. This can lead to the range of symptoms and deformities characteristic of cleidocranial dysplasia.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nDiagnosing cleidocranial dysplasia can be challenging, as the symptoms may be similar to those of other conditions. However, a combination of physical examination, medical history, and radiological imaging can help confirm the diagnosis. During pregnancy, clavicular size can be calculated using available nomograms, which can help identify potential cases of CCD.\n\nWormian bones, small bones found in the skull, can sometimes be observed in individuals with CCD. Radiological imaging, such as X-rays or CT scans, can help identify these bones and confirm the diagnosis.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nTreatment for cleidocranial dysplasia typically involves a range of surgical and medical interventions. In some cases, surgical correction may be necessary to prevent any worsening of the deformity. This can include:\n\n* Surgical correction of the collarbone deformity\n* Cranioplasty to correct skull defects\n* Orthognathic surgery to correct jaw deformities\n* Femoral osteotomy to correct coxa vara\n* Decompression surgery to relieve brachial plexus irritation\n\nIn addition to surgery, individuals with CCD may require ongoing medical care to manage their symptoms and prevent complications. This can include:\n\n* Dental care to manage dental abnormalities\n* Orthotics and physical therapy to improve mobility and function\n* Speech and language therapy to address communication difficulties\n* Cognitive and developmental therapy to support cognitive and developmental growth\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nSeveral studies have reported that life expectancy appears to be normal for people with cleidocranial dysplasia. However, individuals with CCD may experience a range of complications, including:\n\n* Respiratory problems due to chest deformities\n* Cardiovascular problems due to hypertension and cardiac defects\n* Gastrointestinal problems due to digestive tract anomalies\n* Neurological problems due to cranial nerve defects\n\n**Epidemiology**\n\nCleidocranial dysplasia affects approximately one in a million people worldwide.

organized while moving westward [12] On 16 January, the system organized into a tropical depression [13] With the presence of persisting deep convection, the system eventually strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Eloise on 17 January [14] Initially, Eloise struggled to strengthen further from the presence of strong easterly shear and dry air, which caused Eloise's thunderstorm activity to be displaced to the west [15] Despite the presence of this shear and mid-level dry air, Eloise continued to intensify, with convection wrapping into an eye feature and outflow becoming increasingly defined, marking the intensification of Eloise into a severe tropical storm on 19 January, while heading westward towards Madagascar [16]\n\n\nPreparations\nAhead of landfall, humanitarians and authorities in Madagascar coordinated preparedness activities A meeting was organized on 19 January by the National Office for Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) to prepare for potential assessments and/or response Authorities devised plans, including contingency plans, evacuation plans, emergency operation centres and early warning system at the community level Aerial assessments using photo and geo-tracking system were also planned for the impact of the storm [29] The local contingency plan in the north-eastern part of the country and the early warning system at the community level was activated Emergency stocks are available in many districts in the most at-risk areas [30] On 18 January, the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS) gave the storm a green alert, which pointed to a wind impact of 0.5 The next day, GDACS upgraded the storm alert to an orange alert, which pointed to a higher 1.5 wind impact [31] [32] [33] With Eloise enhancing heavy rainfall, landslides, flash floods, and widespread flooding were expected [34] Moreover, waves up 6 m (20 ft) were expected in Antongil Bay [35]\n\n\nMadagascar\nOn 19 January, Eloise made landfall in the northeastern town of Antalaha, Madagascar as a tropical storm Eloise produced heavy rain, which had the potential to lead to floods and landslides in northern Madagascar [29] Météo-France noted on 20 January that accumulations for 100–150 mm (3.9–5.9 in) were possible in 24 hours for the northwestern regions of Madagascar [53] By 18:00 UTC on 19 January, authorities had issued a red alert

{"title": "Saul_Goodman", "content": "\nDevelopment\nThe need for a character like Saul came from two paths of Breaking Bad's development around the second season First, as Walter White and Jesse Pinkman got themselves deeper into the drug business, the writers felt they needed a character to be a guide for them At this point, they had written that Jesse's dimwitted friends like Badger were selling their drugs, and needed to envision what type of lawyer Walt and Jesse would enlist when they run into trouble [3] This would later serve to introduce Walter to new concepts such as the Disappearer's services [4] Secondly, they were at a point in Hank's character arc where he had suffered major trauma in seeing Tortuga's severed head, and he would no longer be able to serve as the series' bit of lightness They thus made Saul more of a comical character to fill this void [3] The writers wrote this lawyer as loud, flashy, and over-the-top, as well as being a scammer himself [4] The creators decided on the name \"Saul Goodman\" as a play on the phrase \" [It]'s all good, man\", so that even his most simple-minded clients would remember his name when they get arrested [5] Gould credits Breaking Bad's creator Vince Gilligan for initially suggesting this idea for Saul's name [3]\n\n\nBiography\nJimmy is of Irish descent and was born on November 12, 1960, in Cicero, Illinois, near Chicago [18] [19] His older brother Chuck became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at Albuquerque law firm Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM) As a child, Jimmy worked at his

Jimmy anonymously warns them, and their home later appears to have been the scene of a kidnapping Nacho, who had been seen surveilling the Kettlemans, is arrested, and Jimmy defends him and obtains his release [24]\n\n\nSeason 1\nUnhappy with low-paying public defender work and other minor cases, Jimmy hopes to represent county treasurer Craig Kettleman and his wife Betsy, a couple accused of

American television series Breaking Bad and its prequel series Better Call Saul. He is portrayed by actor Bob Odenkirk. Saul is a lawyer who specializes in representing clients in morally ambiguous and often illicit cases. He is known for his cleverness, charisma, and willingness to bend the law to suit his clients' needs.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nThe need for a character like Saul came from two paths of Breaking Bad's development around the second season. Firstly, as Walter White and Jesse Pinkman got themselves deeper into the drug business, the writers felt they needed a character to be a guide for them. At this point, they had written that Jesse's dimwitted friends like Badger were selling their drugs, and needed to envision what type of lawyer Walt and Jesse would enlist when they run into trouble. This would later serve to introduce Walter to new concepts such as the Disappearer's services. Secondly, they were at a point in Hank's character arc where he had suffered major trauma in seeing Tortuga's severed head, and he would no longer be able to serve as the series' bit of lightness. They thus made Saul more of a comical character to fill this void.\n\nBiography\n---------\n\nJimmy is of Irish descent and was born on November 12, 1960, in Cicero, Illinois, near Chicago. His older brother Chuck became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at Albuquerque law firm Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). As a child, Jimmy worked at his parents' corner store in Cicero, and watched as customers took advantage of his gullible, naive father, Charles Sr.; Jimmy soon began pilfering small change from the store.\n\nBetter Call Saul\n----------------\n\nBetter Call Saul is a prequel series to Breaking Bad, which explores the backstory of Saul Goodman. The series follows Jimmy McGill, a small-time lawyer who becomes a successful attorney by any means necessary. In the series, Jimmy becomes increasingly drawn into a life of crime, and eventually adopts the alias \"Saul Goodman.\"\n\nSeason 1\n--------\n\nUnhappy with low-paying public defender work and other minor cases, Jimmy hopes to represent county treasurer Craig Kettleman and his wife Betsy, a couple accused of embezzling over $1.6 million. They retain HHM, but Jimmy's attempts to represent them leads to an altercation with Tuco Salamanca and Nacho Varga, members of the Juarez drug cartel. When Nacho plans to rob the Kettlemans, Jimmy anonymously warns them, and their home later appears to have been the scene of a kidnapping. Nacho, who had been seen surveilling the Kettlemans, is arrested, and Jimmy defends him and obtains his release.\n\nSeason 2\n--------\n\nAfter a drug dealer named Brandon \"Badger\" Mayhew is arrested, Saul offers to be Badger's legal counsel and learns that the DEA hopes Badger will lead them to \"Heisenberg,\" an up-and-coming drug lord. Worried meth cooks Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, the former being the aforementioned \"Heisenberg,\" decide to visit Saul to convince him to not let Badger talk to the DEA. Walt poses as Badger's uncle and goes to Saul's office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to reveal his associates in order to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from \"flipping,\" but Saul refuses. Later that night, Walt and Jesse kidnap Saul and drive out to the middle of the desert, threatening to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing. Saul initially believes Lalo sent them and blames Nacho for assisting in the attack on Lalo at his home. Upon realizing Walt and Jesse are not associated with Lalo, he takes a token payment so he can give them legal advice protected by attorney-client privilege.\n\nSeason 3\n--------\n\nSaul helps Jesse anonymously buy his aunt's house back from his parents with his share of the drug money. Saul and Mike bug Skyler White's (Walt's wife) house to find out if she has told anyone about Walt. Saul attempts to get Jesse to convince Walt to resume cooking methamphetamine. After an altercation between Walt and Skyler's boss Ted Beneke, Mike brings Walt to Saul. Walt later figures out that Saul has been bugging his house and attacks him, causing Saul to refuse to launder any more money through Walter Jr.'s website. Jesse visits Saul with the methamphetamine he produced and asks for a meeting with Gus, at which Gus agrees to buy Jesse's product, assuming it will be an incentive to Walt. Saul sets up a meeting between Jesse and Walt to resolve the issue of Jesse's half of the money from their previous work for Gus. Walt agrees to resume meth production for Gus, with Gale Boetticher as his assistant, so Saul changes sides and agrees to launder Walt's new income.\n\nSeason 4\n--------\n\nSaul and Skyler plot ways to persuade Bogdan to sell the car wash, but Skyler rules out violence or intimidation. Saul has his employee Patrick Kuby pose as a government inspector to inform Bogdan of supposed environmental concerns that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate. Bogdan sells the car wash to Walt and Skyler, and Skyler takes over day-to-day management. Walt confides in Saul about his concerns with respect to Jesse, Hank, and Gus. Saul tells Walt about Ed Galbraith the \"Disappearer,\" a vacuum repair shop owner who can provide Walt and his family with new identities if they have to flee. Walt runs over Gus' two dealers before Jesse can kill them, then tells Jesse to run. Saul helps ensure the damage to Walt's car is not discovered. Walt suggests that Gus will retaliate for the murder of the two dealers and recommends that Saul contact a hit man to kill Gus, but Saul dismisses the idea.\n\nSeason 5\n--------\n\nSaul tells Skyler about Beneke's accident, which has left him hospitalized and immobile. Walt is angry with Saul about Saul's payment to Beneke, while Saul is upset at Walt for poisoning Brock. He attempts to end his relationship with Walt, but Walt intimidates him into continuing their business arrangement. With Gus dead, Saul tries to convince Walt to stop making meth, but Walt says he has to continue because he needs the cash. Saul hosts a meeting between Mike, Jesse, and Walt, where they agree to set up a new meth-producing business. Saul helps Walt and Jesse look for new locations, and they agree on Ira's business, Vamonos Pest Control, as the best option. Saul defends Mike from the DEA's investigation by threatening litigation over their supposed harassment. The DEA learns that Mike's lawyer Dan Wachsberger is the conduit for Mike's hush money payments to Gus's former employees and Mike's hiding of cash for his daughter-in-law Stacey and granddaughter Kaylee. Mike asks Saul to retrieve his \"go bag,\" which contains cash and false identity documents. Saul is unable, so Walt does it. When Mike refuses to divulge the names of Gus' former employees so Walt can have them killed to protect his identity, Walt shoots and kills him. Jesse tries to have Saul take the $5 million Jesse made stealing a trainload of methylamine and distribute it to Kaylee and the parents of Drew Sharp, the young boy Todd Alquist killed during the theft. Saul refuses, saying it would attract more police scrutiny. Jesse attempts to get rid of the money in other ways, including throwing it onto random lawns and leaving it in random mailboxes. Saul calls Walt to inform him of Jesse's erratic behavior.\n\nSeason 6\n--------\n\nWalt visits Saul to tell him that Hank has learned that Walt is Heisenberg. Saul suggests killing Hank, but Walt refuses. Jesse is arrested while tossing money from his car, and Saul obtains his release from police custody. Saul arranges a meeting between Walt and Jesse, and Walt convinces Jesse to contact Ed and start a new life. Walt wants Jesse to give up drugs before beginning the trip, but Jesse refuses, so Saul has Huell pickpocket Jesse's cannabis. When Jesse realizes his marijuana was stolen, he figures out that Huell previously stole the ricin cigarette, meaning that Walt poisoned Brock and Saul knew. Instead of leaving with Ed, Jesse returns to Saul's office and assaults him. Saul admits he had Huell steal the ricin, but says he did not know what Walt intended. Saul calls Walt to warn him that Jesse knows the truth about what happened to Brock. Saul meets with Walt and suggests killing Jesse. After the DEA manipulates Huell into telling them what happened to Walt's money, Saul is afraid for his life and meets with Walt at the car wash. Believing his arrest is imminent, Walt goes into hiding. Saul gathers valuables from his office and gives Francesca a cover story, while she prepares to dispose of shredded documents from Saul's law practice. She agrees to be at a telephone booth on November 12 (Jimmy's birthday) at 3 p.m to receive a call. Saul gives Francesca cash and an attorney's business card and tells her that if she needs help she should say \"Jimmy\" sent her.\n\nPost-Breaking Bad\n----------------\n\nEd refers to Saul in El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie when Jesse attempts to persuade Ed to help him leave Albuquerque and begin a new life. In addition, a scene in the film shows that the strip mall location of Saul's former law office has become a restaurant and sports bar.\n\nReception\n----------\n\nFor the first four seasons and season 6A and season 6B of Better Call Saul, Odenkirk was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.

He was a key figure in the country's modernization and development, and is widely regarded as one of the most influential leaders in the region's history.\n\n**Family and Early Life**\n\nZayed was the youngest of four sons of Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, who ruled Abu Dhabi from 1922 until his death in 1926. His eldest brother, Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan, became ruler of Abu Dhabi after their uncle, Saqr bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Zayed's mother was Sheikha Salama bint Butti, who was known for her wise and compassionate nature. She extracted a promise from her sons not to use violence against each other, a promise which they kept.\n\nZayed was named after his grandfather, Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, who ruled the emirate from 1855 to 1909. At the time of Zayed's birth, the sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi was one of seven Trucial States along the lower coast of the Persian Gulf. Zayed showed a keen interest in falconry from an early age and would often spend hours in the desert with his companions, training and racing their birds of prey.\n\n**Career and Reign**\n\nIn 1946, Zayed was appointed governor of the Eastern Region of Abu Dhabi, with his base of operations in the Muwaiji fort in Al Ain. The area was then a poor and disease-prone region, but Zayed worked tirelessly to improve the living conditions of its people. When parties from Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) began exploring for oil in the area, Zayed assisted them, recognizing the potential benefits that oil could bring to the region.\n\nAs Zayed's reputation as a wise and effective leader grew, he became a key figure in the UAE's modernization and development. In 1966, he became the ruler of Abu Dhabi, replacing his brother Sheikh Shakbut. Zayed's leadership played a crucial role in the UAE's transition from a collection of small, independent states to a unified nation.\n\n**Attitudes**\n\nZayed was a strong advocate for the unity of the Emirates, and his calls for cooperation extended across the Persian Gulf to Iran. He believed that dialogue was the key to resolving conflicts, and worked tirelessly to promote peace and understanding between nations.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges that Zayed faced during his reign was the dispute over the three strategic Persian Gulf islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb, and Lesser Tunb. In 1971, Iran seized the islands from the Emirate of Sharjah, which was then part of the UAE. Despite over three decades of diplomatic efforts, the islands remain in Iranian hands to this day.\n\n**Policies and Charity**\n\nAt the time of the British withdrawal from the Persian Gulf in 1971, Zayed oversaw the establishment of the Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development. The fund's primary goal was to promote economic development and cooperation between Arab countries, and it played a crucial role in channeling oil riches to less fortunate Islamic nations in Asia and Africa.\n\nUnder Zayed's leadership, the UAE also became a major player in the global humanitarian effort, providing aid and disaster relief to countries around the world. Zayed's commitment to charity and philanthropy was legendary, and he was widely respected for his generosity and compassion.\n\n**Zayed Centre**\n\nThe Zayed Centre was established in 1997 to promote education and cultural exchange between the UAE and other countries. The centre was named after Zayed, who was a strong advocate for education and knowledge. However, the centre's opinions were not without controversy, and in 2000, the Harvard Divinity School returned a $2.5 million gift from the centre, citing concerns over the source of the funding.\n\nDespite this controversy, the Zayed Centre remains a respected institution, and its work continues to promote education and cultural exchange around the world.\n\n**Death**\n\nZayed died on November 2, 2004, at the age of 86, after a long battle with diabetes and kidney problems. He was buried in the courtyard of the new Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, where he had worshipped for many years. His eldest son, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, succeeded him as ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the UAE.\n\n**Memorials and Legacy**\n\nIn 2017, the Emirates News Agency reported that Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan had issued directives declaring 2018 to be the Year of Zayed, in honor of his father's centenary birth anniversary. The declaration was aimed at commemorating Zayed's life and legacy, and promoting his values and principles.\n\nIn 2018, the Founder's Memorial was opened in Abu Dhabi, dedicated to Zayed's memory. The memorial consists of an open Heritage Garden and Sanctuary Garden, with a cubic pavilion housing The Constellation, an artwork dedicated to Zayed's memory.\n\n**Marriage and Children**\n\nZayed bin Sultan married seven times and had 19 sons. His children are as follows:\n\n* Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan (eldest son)\n* Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (second son)\n* Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan (third son)\n* Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed Al Nahyan (fourth son)\n* Sheikh Ahmed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (fifth son)\n* Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan (sixth son)\n* Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan (seventh son)\n* Sheikh Shakhbut bin Zayed Al Nahyan (eighth son)\n* Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan (ninth son)\n* Sheikh Fahad bin Zayed Al Nahyan (tenth son)\n* Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (eleventh son)\n* Sheikh Rashid bin Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (twelfth son)\n* Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan (thirteenth son)\n* Sheikh Mohammed bin Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan (fourteenth son)\n* Sheikh Mansour bin Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (fifteenth son)\n* Sheikh Sultan bin Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan (sixteenth son)\n* Sheikh Ahmed bin Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan (seventeenth son)\n* Sheikh Hamad bin Tahnoun bin Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (eighteenth son)\n* Sheikh Khalid bin Tahnoun bin Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (nineteenth son)\n\nZayed's legacy continues to shape the UAE and its people, and his commitment to education, charity, and leadership remains an inspiration to people around the world.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Zayed_bin_Sultan_Al_Nahyan\" following this outline:\n\n\nFamily and early life\nZayed was the youngest of four sons of Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan [2] [3] His father was the ruler of Abu Dhabi from 1922 until his death in 1926 Zayed was the youngest of his four brothers [2] His eldest brother, Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan, became ruler of Abu Dhabi after their uncle, Saqr bin Zayed Al Nahyan His mother was Sheikha Salama bint Butti [9] [10] She extracted a promise from her sons not to use violence against each other, a promise which they kept [11] Sheikh Zayed was named after his grandfather, Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan (\"Zayed the Great\"), who ruled the emirate from 1855 to 1909 [12] At the time of Sheikh Zayed's birth, the sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi was one of seven Trucial States along the lower coast of the Persian Gulf [13] He also showed interest in falconry [14]\n\n\nCareer and reign\nZayed was appointed the governor of the Eastern Region of Abu Dhabi in 1946, [12] and was based in the Muwaiji fort in Al Ain At this time, the area was poor and prone to outbreaks of disease When parties from Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) began exploring for oil in the area, Zayed assisted them [18] [page needed]\n\n\nAttitudes\nSheikh Zayed was determined to unite the Emirates into federation His calls for cooperation extended across the Persian Gulf to Iran He advocated dialogue as the means to settle the row with Tehran over three strategic Persian Gulf islands which Iran seized from the (future) UAE Emirate of Sharjah in 1971 The islands remain in Iranian hands, despite over three decades of UAE diplomatic initiatives [citation needed]\n\n\nPolicies and charity\nAt the time the British withdrew from the Persian Gulf in 1971, Zayed oversaw the establishment of the Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development;

{"title": "CEO", "content": "\nOrigins\nThe term \"chief executive officer\" is attested as early as 1782, when an ordinance of the Congress of the Confederation of the United States of America used the term to refer to governors and other leaders of the executive branches of each of the Thirteen Colonies [3] In draft additions to the Oxford English Dictionary published online in 2011, the Dictionary says that the use of \"CEO\" as an acronym for a chief executive officer originated in Australia, with the first attestation being in 1914 The first American usage cited is from 1972 [4]\n\n\nResponsibilities\nThe responsibilities of an organization's CEO are set by the organization's board of directors or other authority, depending on the organization's structure They can be far-reaching or quite limited, and are typically enshrined in a formal delegation of authority regarding business administration Typically, responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on business strategy and other key policy issues, as well as leader, manager, and executor roles The communicator role can involve speaking to the press and to the public, as well as to the organization's management and employees; the decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy The CEO is tasked with implementing the goals, targets and strategic objectives as determined by the board of directors.\n\n\nInternational use\nIn some countries, there is a dual board system with two separate boards, one executive board for the day-to-day business and one supervisory board for control purposes (selected by the shareholders) In these countries, the CEO presides over the executive board and the chairperson presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people This ensures a distinction between management by the executive board and governance by the supervisory board This allows for clear lines of authority The aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person.\n\n\nRelated positions\nDepending on the organization, a CEO may have several subordinate executives to help run the day-to-day administration of the company, each of whom has specific functional responsibilities referred to as senior executives, [8] executive officers or corporate officers Subordinate executives are given different titles in different organizations, but one common category of subordinate executive, if the CEO is also the president, is the vice president (VP) An organization may have more than one vice president, each tasked with a different area of responsibility (e.g., VP of finance, VP of human resources) Examples of subordinate executive officers who typically report to the CEO include the chief operating officer (COO), chief financial officer (CFO), chief strategy officer (CSO), chief marketing officer (CMO) and chief business officer (CBO) The public relations-focused position of chief reputation officer is sometimes included as one such subordinate executive officer, but, as suggested by Anthony Johndrow, CEO of Reputation Economy Advisors, it can also be seen as \"simply another way to add emphasis to the role of a modern-day CEO – where they are both the external face of, and the driving force behind, an organization culture\" [9]\n\n\nUnited States\nIn the US, the term \"chief executive officer\" is used primarily in business, whereas the term \"executive director\" is used primarily in the not-for-profit sector [10] These terms are generally mutually exclusive and refer to distinct legal duties and responsibilities [11] The CEO is the highest-ranking executive in a company, making corporate decisions, managing operations, allocating resources, and serving as the main point of communication between the board of directors and the company [12] [13]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the UK, chief executive and chief executive officer are used in local government, where their position in law is described as the \"head of paid service\", [14] and in business and in the charitable sector [15] As of 2013 [update], the use of the term director for senior charity staff is deprecated to avoid confusion with the legal duties and responsibilities associated with being a charity director or trustee, which are normally non-executive (unpaid) roles The term managing director is often used in lieu of chief executive officer.\n\n\nCelebrity CEOs\nBusiness publicists since the days of Edward Bernays (1891–1995) and his client John D Rockefeller (1839–1937) and even more successfully the corporate publicists for Henry Ford, promoted the concept of the \"celebrity CEO\" Business journalists have often adopted this approach, which assumes that the corporate achievements, especially in the arena of manufacturing, are produced by uniquely talented individuals, especially the \"heroic CEO\" In effect, journalists celebrate a CEO who takes distinctive strategic actions The model is the celebrity in entertainment, sports, and politics – compare the \"great man theory\" Guthey et al argues that \"...these individuals are not self-made, but rather are created by a process of widespread media exposure to the point that their actions, personalities, and even private lives function symbolically to represent significant dynamics and tensions prevalent in the contemporary business atmosphere\" [16] Journalism thereby exaggerates the importance of the CEO and tends to neglect harder-to-describe broader corporate factors There is little attention to the intricately organized technical bureaucracy that actually does the work Hubris sets in when the CEO internalizes the celebrity and becomes excessively self-confident in making complex decisions There may be an emphasis on the sort of decisions that attract the celebrity journalists [17]\n\n\nCriticism\nExecutive compensation has been a source of criticism following a dramatic rise in pay relative to the average worker's wage For example, the relative pay was 20-to-1 in 1965 in the US, but had risen to 376-to-1 by 2000 [19] The relative pay differs around the world, and, in some smaller countries, is still around 20-to-1 [20] Observers differ as to whether the rise is due to competition for talent or due to lack of control by compensation committees [21] In recent years, investors have demanded more say over executive pay [22]\n\n\nExecutive compensation\nExecutive compensation has been a

by compensation committees [21] In recent years, investors have demanded more say over executive pay [22]\n\n\nDiversity\nLack of diversity amongst chief executives has also been a source of criticism [23] In 2018, 5% of Fortune 500 CEOs were women [24] In 2023 the number rose to 10.4% of for Women CEO's of Fortune 500 companies [25] The reasons for this are explained or justified in various ways, and may include biological sex differences, male and female differences in Big Five personality traits and temperament, sex differences in psychology and interests, maternity and career breaks, hypergamy, phallogocentrism, the existence of old boy networks, tradition, and the lack of female role models in that regard [26] [27] [28] Some countries have passed laws mandating boardroom gender quotas [29] In 2023 Rockefeller Foundation awarded a grant to Korn Ferry to research strategies and then action a plan to help more women to become CEO's [30]\n\n\nToxic executives\nThere are contentious claims that a significant number of CEO's have psychopathic tendencies, often characterized by power-seeking behavior and dominance These individuals can often conceal their ruthlessness and antisocial behavior behind a facade of charm and eloquence Traits such as courage and risk-taking, generally considered desirable, are often found alongside these psychopathic tendencies.\n\n\nSee

The role of the CEO is to lead and manage the organization, making key decisions that impact its success. In this article, we will explore the history of the CEO position, responsibilities, international use, related positions, and various aspects of the role.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe term \"chief executive officer\" is attested as early as 1782, when an ordinance of the Congress of the Confederation of the United States of America used the term to refer to governors and other leaders of the executive branches of each of the Thirteen Colonies. However, the use of \"CEO\" as an acronym for a chief executive officer originated in Australia, with the first attestation being in 1914. The first American usage cited is from 1972.\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\nThe responsibilities of an organization's CEO are set by the organization's board of directors or other authority, depending on the organization's structure. These responsibilities can be far-reaching or quite limited, and are typically enshrined in a formal delegation of authority regarding business administration. Typically, responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on business strategy and other key policy issues, as well as leader, manager, and executor roles. The communicator role can involve speaking to the press and to the public, as well as to the organization's management and employees; the decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy. The CEO is tasked with implementing the goals, targets, and strategic objectives as determined by the board of directors.\n\n**International Use**\n\nIn some countries, there is a dual board system with two separate boards, one executive board for the day-to-day business and one supervisory board for control purposes (selected by the shareholders). In these countries, the CEO presides over the executive board and the chairperson presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between management by the executive board and governance by the supervisory board. This allows for clear lines of authority, preventing a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person.\n\n**Related Positions**\n\nDepending on the organization, a CEO may have several subordinate executives to help run the day-to-day administration of the company, each of whom has specific functional responsibilities referred to as senior executives, executive officers, or corporate officers. Subordinate executives are given different titles in different organizations, but one common category of subordinate executive, if the CEO is also the president, is the vice president (VP). An organization may have more than one vice president, each tasked with a different area of responsibility (e.g., VP of finance, VP of human resources). Examples of subordinate executive officers who typically report to the CEO include the chief operating officer (COO), chief financial officer (CFO), chief strategy officer (CSO), chief marketing officer (CMO), and chief business officer (CBO). The public relations-focused position of chief reputation officer is sometimes included as one such subordinate executive officer.\n\n**United States**\n\nIn the US, the term \"chief executive officer\" is used primarily in business, whereas the term \"executive director\" is used primarily in the not-for-profit sector. These terms are generally mutually exclusive and refer to distinct legal duties and responsibilities. The CEO is the highest-ranking executive in a company, making corporate decisions, managing operations, allocating resources, and serving as the main point of communication between the board of directors and the company.\n\n**United Kingdom**\n\nIn the UK, chief executive and chief executive officer are used in local government, where their position in law is described as the \"head of paid service\", and in business and in the charitable sector. As of 2013, the use of the term director for senior charity staff is deprecated to avoid confusion with the legal duties and responsibilities associated with being a charity director or trustee, which are normally non-executive (unpaid) roles. The term managing director is often used in lieu of chief executive officer.\n\n**Celebrity CEOs**\n\nBusiness publicists since the days of Edward Bernays (1891–1995) and his client John D Rockefeller (1839–1937) and even more successfully the corporate publicists for Henry Ford, promoted the concept of the \"celebrity CEO\". Business journalists have often adopted this approach, which assumes that the corporate achievements, especially in the arena of manufacturing, are produced by uniquely talented individuals, especially the \"heroic CEO\". In effect, journalists celebrate a CEO who takes distinctive strategic actions. The model is the celebrity in entertainment, sports, and politics – compare the \"great man theory\". Journalism thereby exaggerates the importance of the CEO and tends to neglect harder-to-describe broader corporate factors. There is little attention to the intricately organized technical bureaucracy that actually does the work. Hubris sets in when the CEO internalizes the celebrity and becomes excessively self-confident in making complex decisions. There may be an emphasis on the sort of decisions that attract the celebrity journalists.\n\n**Criticism**\n\nExecutive compensation has been a source of criticism following a dramatic rise in pay relative to the average worker's wage. For example, the relative pay was 20-to-1 in 1965 in the US, but had risen to 376-to-1 by 2000. The relative pay differs around the world, and, in some smaller countries, is still around 20-to-1. Observers differ as to whether the rise is due to competition for talent or due to lack of control by compensation committees. In recent years, investors have demanded more say over executive pay.\n\n**Diversity**\n\nLack of diversity amongst chief executives has also been a source of criticism. In 2018, 5% of Fortune 500 CEOs were women. In 2023, the number rose to 10.4% of women CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. The reasons for this are explained or justified in various ways, and may include biological sex differences, male and female differences in Big Five personality traits and temperament, sex differences in psychology and interests, maternity and career breaks, hypergamy, phallogocentrism, the existence of old boy networks, tradition, and the lack of female role models in that regard. Some countries have passed laws mandating boardroom gender quotas. In 2023, the Rockefeller Foundation awarded a grant to Korn Ferry to research strategies and then action a plan to help more women to become CEOs.\n\n**Toxic Executives**\n\nThere are contentious claims that a significant number of CEOs have psychopathic tendencies, often characterized by power-seeking behavior and dominance. These individuals can often conceal their ruthlessness and antisocial behavior behind a facade of charm and eloquence. Traits such as courage and risk-taking, generally considered desirable, are often found alongside these psychopathic tendencies.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Executive compensation\n* Corporate governance\n*

This article provides an in-depth examination of Scarlett's character, including her background, personality, and influence on popular culture.\n\n**Biography**\n\nScarlett O'Hara is the oldest living child of Gerald O'Hara and Ellen O'Hara (née Robillard). She was born in 1845 on her family's plantation Tara in Georgia. Scarlett was named Katie Scarlett, after her father's mother, but is always called Scarlett, except by her father, who refers to her as \"Katie Scarlett.\" Scarlett has black hair, green eyes, and fair skin, and is famous for her fashionably small waist. She is from a Catholic family of Irish ancestry on her paternal side and French ancestry on her maternal side, descending from her mother's old-money Robillard family in Savannah.\n\nScarlett has two younger sisters, Susan Elinor (\"Suellen\") O'Hara and Caroline Irene (\"Carreen\") O'Hara, and three little brothers who died in infancy. Her baby brothers are buried in the family burying ground at Tara, and each was named Gerald O'Hara Jr.\n\n**Character Summary**\n\nWhen the novel opens, Scarlett O'Hara is sixteen. She is vain, self-centered, and very spoiled by her wealthy parents. Scarlett can also be insecure, but is very intelligent, despite the Old South's pretense of ignorance and helplessness. Scarlett is somewhat unusual among Southern women, whom society preferred to act as dainty creatures who needed protection from their men. Scarlett is aware that she is only acting empty-headed, and resents the \"necessity\" of it, unlike most of her Southern belle peers, including Melanie Hamilton and India Wilkes.\n\n**Common Character Analysis**\n\nScarlett's character portrayed in both the novel and 1939 film is, at face-value, unscrupulous and selfish. However, her character development ultimately portrays multiple stigmas throughout that support Mitchell's theme. Mitchell admitted the theme of the novel was “survival,” specifically shown is exploring human behavior in the face of the catastrophe of the Civil War. Decades later, literary critics and authors agree that Scarlett's revolution from a spoiled, wealthy girl—typical of her socioeconomic status—to becoming an independent woman in an unforgiving society and unstable economy is a testament to the development of Mitchell's character.\n\n**Inspiration for the Character**\n\nMargaret Mitchell used to say that her Gone with The Wind characters were not based on real people, although modern researchers have found similarities to some of the people in Mitchell's own life. Scarlett's upbringing resembled that of Mitchell's maternal grandmother, Annie Fitzgerald Stephens (1844–1934), who was raised predominantly Irish Catholic on a plantation near Jonesboro in Fayette, not unlike the O'Hara family. Mitchell was engaged three times, although only married twice. Her first engagement was to Clifford Henry, a bayonet instructor at Camp Gordon in World War I. He was killed overseas in October 1918 while fighting in France, similar to O’Hara and her first husband, Charles Hamilton. Mitchell's mother, Maybelle Stephens Mitchell, contracted influenza and died shortly before Mitchell could reach home, similar to Ellen O'Hara dying before Scarlett fled Atlanta. Rhett Butler is thought to be based on Mitchell's first husband, Red Upshaw because Upshaw left Atlanta for the Midwest and never returned.\n\n**In the 1939 Film**\n\nWhile the studio and the public agreed that the part of Rhett Butler should go to Clark Gable (except for Clark Gable himself), casting for the role of Scarlett was harder. The search for an actress to play Scarlett in the film version of the novel famously drew the biggest names in the history of cinema, such as Bette Davis (who had been cast as a Southern belle in Jezebel in 1938), and Katharine Hepburn, who went so far as demanding an appointment with producer David O Selznick and saying, \"I am Scarlett O'Hara! The role is practically written for me.\" Selznick replied rather bluntly, \"I can't imagine Rhett Butler chasing you for twelve years.\" Jean Arthur and Lucille Ball were also considered, as well as relatively unknown actress Doris Davenport Susan Hayward was \"discovered\" when she tested for the part, and the career of Lana Turner developed quickly after her screen test Tallulah Bankhead and Joan Bennett were widely considered to be the most likely choices until they were supplanted by Paulette Goddard.\n\n**Casting**\n\nWhile the studio and the public agreed that the part of Rhett Butler should go to Clark Gable (except for Clark Gable himself), casting for the role of Scarlett was harder.

Between late 1937 and mid-1938, approximately 128 actresses were nominated for the role of Scarlett through letters of suggestion sent to Selznick International Pictures from the public. The following actresses were among those considered or auditioned for the role, which required playing Scarlett from 16 years of age until she was 28 (actress age in 1939, the year of Gone With the Wind's release, when Leigh was 26).\n\n**In Other Adaptations**\n\nTroy Patterson of Entertainment Weekly argued that Ally McBeal, the main character of the television series with the same name, has similarities to O'Hara and that \"Scarlett and Ally are fairy-tale princesses who bear about as much resemblance to real women as Barbie and Skipper.\" Patterson wrote that Ally is similar because she is also a child from a ruling class family, \"pines hopelessly after an unavailable dreamboat\", and has a \"sassy black roommate\" in place of a \"mammy\" to \"comfort her.\" Other characters often compared to Scarlett include many female protagonists from other romantic epics, most notably Lara Antipova from the 1965 film Doctor Zhivago and Rose DeWitt Bukater from Titanic (1997) as well as strong-willed women in history, such as Cleopatra, Marie Antoinette and Eva Peron.\n\n**Ballet Dance Performances & Costumes**\n\nScarlett O'Hara ballet variations have been performed by numerous ballet companies around the world, including the American Ballet Theatre, the Royal Ballet, and the Paris Opera Ballet. The ballets often feature elaborate costumes and sets, with Scarlett's iconic green velvet dress being a staple of the productions.\n\n**In Popular Culture**\n\nIn the 1977 song \"Belle of the Ball\" written and recorded by Waylon Jennings off of Ol' Waylon he mentions Scarlett O’Hara in the opening verse as a comparison to the love of someone, presumed to be his wife Jessi Colter, gave to him.\n\n**Notes**\n\nWhile the character of Scarlett O'Hara has become synonymous with the novel and film \"Gone with the Wind,\" she has also been the subject of much academic and cultural analysis. Her complex and multifaceted personality has made her a fascinating subject for study, and her iconic status has cemented her place in popular culture.\n\n**References**\n\nThis article has not included any citations or references as per the original instructions.\n\n**External Links**\n\nThis article does not include any external links as per the original instructions.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Scarlett_O'Hara\" following this outline:\n\n\nBiography\nScarlett O'Hara is the oldest living child of Gerald O'Hara and Ellen O'Hara (née Robillard) She was born in 1845 on her family's plantation Tara in Georgia She was named Katie Scarlett, after her father's mother, but is always called Scarlett, except by her father, who refers to her as \"Katie Scarlett\" [4] She is from a Catholic family of Irish ancestry on her paternal side and French ancestry on her maternal side, descending from her mother's old-money Robillard family in Savannah Scarlett has black hair, green eyes, and fair skin She is famous for her fashionably small waist [a] Scarlett has two younger sisters, Susan Elinor (\"Suellen\") O'Hara and Caroline Irene (\"Carreen\") O'Hara, and three little brothers who died in infancy Her baby brothers are buried in the family burying ground at Tara, and each was named Gerald O'Hara Jr.\n\n\nCharacter summary\nWhen the novel opens, Scarlett O’Hara is sixteen She is vain, self-centered, and very spoiled by her wealthy parents She can also be insecure, but is very intelligent, despite the Old South's pretense of ignorance and helplessness She is somewhat unusual among Southern women, whom society preferred to act as dainty creatures who needed protection from their men Scarlett is aware that she is only acting empty-headed, and resents the \"necessity\" of it, unlike most of her Southern belle peers, including Melanie Hamilton and India Wilkes.\n\n\nCommon character analysis\nScarlett's character portrayed in both the novel and 1939 film is, at face-value, unscrupulous and selfish, but her character development ultimately portrays multiple stigmas throughout that support Mitchell's theme In a rare interview, Mitchell admitted the theme of the novel was “survival,” specifically shown is exploring human behavior in the face of the catastrophe of the Civil War [7] Decades later, literary critics and authors agree that Scarlett's revolution from a spoiled, wealthy girl—typical of her socioeconomic status—to becoming an independent woman in an unforgiving society and unstable economy is a testament to the development of Mitchell's character.\n\n\nInspiration for the character\nMargaret Mitchell used to say that her Gone with The Wind characters were not based on real people, although modern researchers have found similarities to some of the people in Mitchell's own life Scarlett's upbringing resembled that of Mitchell's maternal grandmother, Annie Fitzgerald Stephens (1844–1934), who was raised predominantly Irish Catholic on a plantation near Jonesboro in Fayette, not unlike the O’Hara family [7] Mitchell was engaged three times, although only married twice Her first engagement was to Clifford Henry, a bayonet instructor at Camp Gordon in World War I He was killed overseas in October 1918 while fighting in France, [7] similar to O’Hara and her first husband, Charles Hamilton Mitchell's mother, Maybelle Stephens Mitchell, contracted influenza and died shortly before Mitchell could reach home, similar to Ellen O’Hara dying before Scarlett fled Atlanta Rhett Butler is thought to be based on Mitchell's first husband, Red Upshaw because Upshaw left Atlanta for the Midwest and never returned [7] Her second marriage was to John Robert Marsh, and they were married until her death in 1949 [7]\n\n\nIn the 1939 film\nWhile the studio and the public agreed that the part of Rhett Butler should go to Clark Gable (except for Clark Gable himself), casting for the role of Scarlett was harder The search for an actress to play Scarlett in the film version of the novel famously drew the biggest names in the history of cinema, such as Bette Davis (who had been cast as a Southern belle in Jezebel in 1938), and Katharine Hepburn, who went so far as demanding an appointment with producer David O Selznick and saying, \"I am Scarlett O'Hara!

This rift zone is where the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates are moving apart, resulting in a high level of volcanic activity. In fact, Iceland is one of the most volcanically active countries in the world, with over 130 volcanoes, including around 30 active volcanoes.\n\nVolcanoes in Iceland can be broadly classified into three main types: shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes, and subglacial volcanoes. Shield volcanoes are characterized by their gently sloping shape and are typically formed by the eruption of fluid lava flows. Stratovolcanoes, on the other hand, are taller and more conical in shape, with steep slopes and a history of explosive eruptions. Subglacial volcanoes are located beneath ice caps and glaciers and can produce a range of eruption styles, from gentle lava flows to violent explosions.\n\nVolcanic Zones and Systems\n\nIceland's volcanic activity is concentrated in several distinct zones and systems. The East Volcanic Zone (EVZ) is one of the most active regions, with volcanoes such as Grímsvötn, Katla, and Hekla. The EVZ is characterized by a mix of shield and stratovolcanoes, and is responsible for many of Iceland's most significant eruptions.\n\nThe North Volcanic Zone (NVZ) is another active region, with volcanoes such as Askja and Öraefajökull. The NVZ is characterized by a mix of shield and stratovolcanoes, and is responsible for a number of significant eruptions.\n\nThe West Volcanic Zone (WVZ) is a less active region, with volcanoes such as Hengill and Skjaldbreiður. The WVZ is characterized by a mix of shield and stratovolcanoes, and is responsible for a number of smaller eruptions.\n\nThe Reykjanes Volcanic Zone (RVZ) is a region of high volcanic activity, with volcanoes such as Keilir and Fagradalsfjall. The RVZ is characterized by a mix of shield and stratovolcanoes, and is responsible for a number of significant eruptions.\n\n## Volcanoes\n\n### Reykjanes Volcanic Zone (RVZ)\n\n* Askja - A complex of nested calderas within the Dyngjufjöll mountains\n* Bárðarbunga - An active stratovolcano located under the Vatnajökull glacier\n* Brennisteinsfjall - A fissure vent system and central volcano on the Snæfellsnes Peninsula\n* Dyngjufjöll - A volcanic mountain range in the northeast of Iceland\n* Eldfell - A volcanic cone on the island of Heimaey\n* Eldgjá - A volcano and a canyon that is part of the Katla volcano\n* Esja - A volcanic mountain range made from basalt and tuff\n* Eyjafjallajökull - An ice-covered active volcano\n* Fagradalsfjall - A tuya volcano formed in the Last Glacial Period\n* Geirfuglasker - A small basalt islet\n* Grímsnes - A fissure or crater row volcanic system\n* Grímsvötn - An active volcano with a partially subglacial fissure system\n* Hekla - An active stratovolcano in the south\n* Hengill - A volcanic table mountain in the southwest\n* Helgafell - A small mountain on the Snæfellsnes Peninsula\n* Herðubreið - A tuya in northern part of Vatnajökull National Park\n* Hofsjökull - A subglacial volcano\n* Holuhraun - A lava field just north of the Vatnajökull ice cap\n* Hrómundartindur - A mountain\n* Hvalbakur - A small, uninhabited island\n* Hveravellir - A geothermal field of the Oddnýjarhnjúkur-Langjökull subglacial volcanic system\n* Hverfjall - A tephra cone or Phreatomagmatic eruption\n* Kerið - A volcanic crater lake\n* Keilir - A Pleistocene subglacial mound or tuya\n* Kerlingarfjöll - A mountain range in the Highlands\n* Kolbeinsey - A small basalt islet\n* Krafla - A volcanic caldera of about 10 km in diameter\n* Krakatindur - A volcano in the county of Rangárvallasýsla\n* Krýsuvík - A fissure swarm\n* Kverkfjöll - A mountain range situated on the north-eastern border of the Vatnajökull glacier\n* Laki / Lakagígar - A volcanic fissure that bisects Laki mountain\n* Landmannalaugar - A lava field in the Fjallabak Nature Reserve\n* Langjökull - The second largest ice cap in Iceland\n* Ljósufjöll - A fissure vent system and central volcano on the Snæfellsnes Peninsula\n* Loki-Fögrufjöll - A subglacial volcano under the Vatnajökull glacier\n* Lýsuhóll - A small volcano on the Snæfellsnes Peninsula\n* Mývatn (fires) - A series of fires at Krafla\n* Nýey - A small, uninhabited island\n* Öraefajökull - An ice-covered active volcano\n* Prestahnúkur - A volcano in the Central Highlands\n* Snaefellsjökull - The 700,000-year-old stratovolcano\n* Stóra-Eldborg undir Geitahlíð - A volcano\n* Sundhnúkur - A volcanic system\n* Surtsey - A volcanic island\n* Theistareykjarbunga - A subglacial volcano\n* Þingvellir - A tectonic and volcanic environment in a rift valley\n* Þjórsá Lava - A volcanic eruption\n* Þórðarhyrna - A subglacial volcano\n* Þórólfsfell - A basaltic tuya\n* Þrándarjökull - A small glacier\n* Thrihnukagigur - A dormant volcano\n* Tindfjallajökull - A stratovolcano\n* Tjörnes Fracture Zone - A submarine volcano\n* Torfajökull - A rhyolitic stratovolcano\n* Trölladyngja - The biggest Icelandic shield volcano\n* Tungnafellsjökull - A glacier and volcano\n* Vatnafjöll - A basaltic fissure vent system\n* Vatnajökull - The largest and most voluminous ice cap in Iceland\n* Vatnaöldur - A volcano\n* Veiðivötn - A volcanic system\n* Vestmannaeyjar - An archipelago off the south coast\n* Viðey - A caldera\n\n## Eruptive Activity\n\nIceland's volcanoes are known for their frequent and intense eruptions. The country's unique geology, with its numerous volcanoes and fissures, makes it a prime location for volcanic activity. In fact, Iceland is home to some of the most active volcanoes in the world, with over 130 volcanoes, including around 30 active volcanoes.\n\nGrímsvötn, including the Skaftá eruption of 1783, is probably the most eruptive volcano system. The Lakagígar lava field alone is estimated to have produced about 15 cubic kilometers of lava. Grímsvötn has probably had more than 30 eruptions in the last 400 years, and produced around 55 cubic kilometers over the last 10,000 years.\n\nKatla has erupted 17 times in historical times, and Eldgjá seems to be part of the same system.

He is best known for hosting the popular game show Password, and was also a talented actor who appeared in numerous stage productions and film roles. Ludden's career spanned over four decades, during which he became a beloved figure in American entertainment.\n\n# Early Years\n\nAllen Ludden was born on October 5, 1917, in Mineral Point, Wisconsin, to Elmer and Leila M (née Allen) Ellsworth. His father, Elmer, was a Nebraska native who worked as an ice dealer, while his mother, Leila, was a Wisconsin native and housewife. Tragically, Elmer Ellsworth died on January 6, 1919, at the age of 26, from the Spanish flu. This event had a profound impact on Ludden's life, and he often spoke about the importance of his father's influence on his early years.\n\nGrowing up in Mineral Point, Ludden developed a passion for the arts, particularly music and drama. He attended the local high school, where he was an active participant in the school's theatrical productions. After completing his secondary education, Ludden went on to study English and dramatics at the University of Texas (now known as the University of Texas at Austin). He graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors in 1940 and received his Master of Arts in English from the same university in 1941.\n\n# Education and Career\n\nDuring his time at the University of Texas, Ludden was an active member of the university's theater community, appearing in numerous stage productions. After graduating, he joined the United States Army, where he served as officer in charge of entertainment in the Pacific theater. Ludden's military service took him to various locations, including Hawaii and the Philippines, where he was responsible for organizing entertainment for the troops. He was awarded a Bronze Star Medal for meritorious service during his time in the military.\n\nAfter being discharged from the army with the rank of captain in 1946, Ludden began his career in television. He started out as a writer and producer for several game shows, including the popular program \"What's My Line?\" In the late 1940s, Ludden began hosting his own game show, \"Password,\" which quickly became a huge success. The show's format, featuring a password given to one player and the other players trying to guess the word, was simple yet engaging, and it captivated audiences for over two decades.\n\n# Family\n\nIn 1943, Ludden married Margaret McGloin, a talented actress and singer. The couple had a son, David, and two daughters, Martha and Sarah. Tragically, Margaret died of cancer on October 30, 1961, at the age of 44. Ludden was deeply affected by her passing and often spoke about the importance of his wife's influence on his life.\n\n# Death\n\nIn early 1980, Ludden was diagnosed with stomach cancer. He took a month-long leave of absence from \"Password Plus\" to undergo chemotherapy treatment, with Bill Cullen filling in as host during his absence. On October 7, 1980, Ludden slipped into a coma while on vacation in Monterey, California. Initially, it was reported that he had suffered a stroke, but the coma was actually caused by high levels of calcium from medication taken to help fight the cancer.\n\nTom Kennedy assumed duties as host of \"Password Plus,\" and although Ludden hoped to return to the show, his cancer continued to worsen. He never returned to hosting the program, and his health continued to decline. Ludden died in Los Angeles on June 9, 1981, at the age of 63. He was buried beside his father in the Ellsworth family plot in Graceland Cemetery in Mineral Point, Wisconsin.\n\n# Legacy\n\nAllen Ludden's legacy extends far beyond his work on \"Password.\" He was a talented actor, writer, and producer who made significant contributions to the world of entertainment. In recognition of his contributions, a walkway at the Los Angeles Zoo was named in his memory. An artificial lake in Mineral Point was also named Ludden Lake in his honor.\n\nBetty White, a close friend and co-star of Ludden's, also paid tribute to him in her own way. She donated a Labrador Retriever named \"Ludden\" to Guide Dogs for the Blind in San Rafael, California, in memory of her late husband.\n\n# Archive\n\nThe Allen Ludden Papers collection is located at the Free Public Library in Mineral Point, Wisconsin. The collection includes letters written or received by Ludden, typed radio scripts, newspaper and magazine clippings by or about Ludden, publicity photographs and personal photographs, and a broken pair of horn-rimmed glasses.

however, both of these parts of Lives are now lost [1] Plutarch wrote his biography over 400 years after Epaminondas's death and is therefore very much a secondary source, but he often explicitly names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements [citation needed]\n\n\nEarly life\nEpaminondas was born at Thebes to a family of high standing which, according to tradition, claimed descent from the mythical Spartoi [7] His year of birth cannot be determined with precision, and estimates have varied between 419 and 411 BC [8] What has been recorded of Epaminondas's immediate family is that his father was called Polymnis, he had a brother named Caphisias, and both parents lived to see his victory at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC [7] His education was regarded as excellent and comprehensive He learned how to handle a cither, to play the flute, and to dance, and, while exercising in the gymnasium (traditionally a cornerstone of Theban education), he demonstrated a preference for agility over sheer strength Epaminondas was taught philosophy by Lysis of Tarentum, a Pythagorean who had escaped persecution in Magna Graecia and allowed to settle in Epaminondas's father's own house [9]\n\n\nPolitical and military career\nEpaminondas lived at a particularly turbulent point in Greek history Following its victory in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC, Sparta had embarked upon an aggressively unilateralist policy towards the rest of Greece and quickly alienated many of its former allies [12] [13] Thebes, meanwhile, had greatly increased its own power during the war and sought to gain control of the other cities of Boeotia (the region of ancient Greece northwest of Attica) This policy, along with other disputes, brought Thebes into conflict with Sparta By 395 BC, Thebes, alongside Athens, Corinth, and Argos, found itself arrayed against Sparta (a former ally) in the Corinthian War That war, which dragged on inconclusively for eight years, saw several bloody Theban defeats at Spartan hands By the time of its conclusion, Thebes had been forced to check its expansionist ambitions and return to its old alliance with Sparta [14]\n\n\nBackground\nEpaminondas lived at a particularly turbulent point in Greek history Following its victory in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC, Sparta had embarked upon an aggressively unilateralist policy towards the rest of Greece and quickly alienated many of its former allies [12] [13] Thebes, meanwhile, had greatly increased its own power during the war and sought to gain control of the other cities of Boeotia (the region of ancient Greece northwest of Attica) This policy, along with other disputes, brought Thebes into conflict with Sparta By 395 BC, Thebes, alongside Athens, Corinth, and Argos, found itself arrayed against Sparta (a former ally) in the Corinthian War That war, which dragged on inconclusively for eight years, saw several bloody Theban defeats at Spartan hands By the time of its conclusion, Thebes had been forced to check its expansionist ambitions and return to its old alliance with Sparta [14]\n\n\nEarly career\nEpaminondas supposedly served in a Theban contingent that aided Sparta in its attack against the city of Mantinea in 385 BC, during which he is said to have saved the life of Pelopidas, an act that cemented their friendship The anecdote, reported by Plutarch and Pausanias, has been dismissed as an unhistorical doublet of Socrates's saving of Alcibiades at the Battle of Delium in 424 BC [16] While some historians at least accept that Epaminondas served with the Spartans in 385 BC, [17] one author has questioned altogether the existence of a Spartan–Theban alliance during this period [16]\n\n\nTheban coup of 378 BC\nIn the years following the Spartan takeover, the exiled Thebans regrouped in Athens and, at the instigation of Pelopidas, prepared to liberate their city Meanwhile, in Thebes, Epaminondas began preparing the young men of the city to fight the Spartans In the winter of 379 BC, a small group of the exiles, led by Pelopidas, infiltrated the city They then assassinated the leaders of the pro-Spartan government, and supported by Epaminondas and Gorgidas, who led a group of young men, and a force of Athenian hoplites, they surrounded the Spartans on the Cadmeia The following day, Epaminondas and Gorgidas brought Pelopidas and his men before the Theban assembly and exhorted the Thebans to fight for their freedom; the assembly responded by acclaiming Pelopidas and his men as liberators The Cadmeia was surrounded, and the Spartans attacked; Pelopidas realised that they must be expelled before an army came from Sparta to relieve them The Spartan garrison eventually surrendered on the condition that they were allowed to march away unharmed The narrow margin of the conspirators' success is demonstrated by the fact that the Spartan garrison met a Spartan force on the way to rescue them as they marched back to Sparta.\n\n\nAftermath, 378–371 BC\nWhen news of the uprising at Thebes reached Sparta, an army under Cleombrotus I had been dispatched to subdue the city, but turned back without engaging the Thebans Another army under Agesilaus II was then dispatched to attack the Thebans However, the Thebans refused to meet the Spartan army in battle, instead building a trench and stockade outside Thebes, which they occupied, preventing the Spartans advancing on the city The Spartans ravaged the countryside but eventually departed, leaving Thebes independent This victory so heartened the Thebans that they undertook operations against other neighboring cities as well [note 1] In short order the Thebans were able to reconstitute their old Boeotian confederacy in a new, democratic form The cities of Boeotia united as a federation with an executive body composed of seven generals, or Boeotarchs, elected from seven districts throughout Boeotia [19] This political fusion was so successful that henceforth the names Theban and Boeotian were used interchangeably in a nod to the newfound solidarity of the region.\n\n\nPeace conference of 371 BC\nThe years following the Theban coup had seen desultory fighting between Sparta and Thebes, with Athens also drawn into the conflict A feeble attempt at a common peace had been made in 375 BC, but desultory fighting between Athens and Sparta had resumed by 373 BC (at the latest) By 371 BC, Athens and Sparta were again war-weary, and in 371 BC a conference was held at Sparta to discuss another attempt at a common peace.\n\n\nBattle of Leuctra (371 BC)\nImmediately following the failure of the peace talks, orders were sent out from Sparta to the Spartan king Cleombrotus, who was at the head of an army in Phocis, commanding him to march directly to Boeotia Skirting north to avoid mountain passes where the Boeotians were prepared to ambush him, Cleombrotus entered Boeotian territory from an unexpected direction and quickly seized a fort and captured 10 or 12 triremes Then marching towards Thebes, he camped at Leuctra, in the territory of Thespiae Here, the Boeotian army came to meet him The Spartan army contained some 10,000 hoplites, 700 of whom were the elite warriors known as Spartiates The Boeotians opposite them numbered about 6,000, but were bolstered by a cavalry superior to that of the Peloponnesians [27] [28]\n\n\nTheban hegemony\nIn the immediate aftermath of Leuctra, the Thebans considered following up their victory by taking their vengeance on Sparta; they also invited Athens to join them in doing so However, their Thessalian allies under Jason of Pherae dissuaded them from shattering what remained of the Spartan army [43] Instead, Epaminondas occupied himself with consolidating the Boeotian confederacy, compelling the previously Spartan-aligned polis of Orchomenus to join the league [44]\n\n\nFirst Invasion of the Peloponnese (370 BC)\nWhen, in the immediate aftermath of Leuctra, the Thebans had sent a herald to Athens with news of their victory, the messenger was met with stony silence The Athenians then decided to take advantage of the Spartan discomfiture, holding a conference in Athens, in which the peace terms proposed earlier in 371 BC were ratified by all cities (except Elis); and this time, the treaty explicitly made the Peloponnesian cities, formerly under Spartan dominance, independent [49] Taking advantage of this, the Mantineans decided to unify their settlements into a single city, and to fortify it; a decision which greatly angered Agesilaus Furthermore, Tegea, supported by Mantinea, instigated the formation of an Arcadian alliance This led to the Spartans declaring war on Mantinea, whereupon the majority of Arcadian cities grouped together to oppose the Spartans (thus forming the confederation that the Spartans were trying to prevent), and requested assistance from the Thebans The Theban force arrived late in 370 BC, and it was led by Epaminondas and Pelopidas, both at this time Boeotarchs [50] [49] As they journeyed into Arcadia, the Thebans were joined by armed contingents from many of Sparta's former allies, swelling their forces to some 50–70,000 men [51] In Arcadia Epaminondas encouraged the Arcadians to form their proposed league, and to build the new city of Megalopolis (as a center of power opposed to Sparta) [52]\n\n\nTrial\n\nIn order to accomplish all that he wished in the Peloponnesus, Epaminondas had persuaded his fellow Boeotarchs to remain in the field for several months after their term of office had expired Upon his return home, Epaminondas was therefore greeted not with a hero's welcome but with a trial arranged by his political enemies According to Cornelius Nepos, in his defense Epaminondas merely requested that, if he be executed, the inscription regarding the verdict read: [55] \n\nSecond invasion of the Peloponnesus (369 BC)\nIn 369 BC the Argives, Eleans and the Arcadians, eager to continue their war against Sparta, recalled the Thebans to their support Epaminondas, at the height of his prestige, again commanded an allied invasion force Arriving at the Isthmus of Corinth, the Thebans found it heavily guarded by the Spartans and Athenians (along with the Corinthians, Megarans and Pellenians) Epaminondas decided to attack the weakest spot, guarded by the Lacedaemonians; in a dawn attack he forced his way through the Spartan position, and joined his Peloponnesian allies The Thebans thus won an easy victory and crossed the Isthmus Diodorus stresses that this was \"a feat no whit inferior to his former mighty deeds\" [57]\n\n\nThessaly (368 BC)\nWhen Epaminondas returned to Thebes, he continued to be dogged by his political enemies who prosecuted him for the second time They actually succeeded in excluding him from the office of Boeotarch for the year 368 BC This was the only time from the Battle of Leuctra until his death that he did not serve as Boeotarch In 368, the Theban army marched into Thessaly to rescue Pelopidas and Ismenias, who had been imprisoned by Alexander of Pherae while serving as ambassadors The Theban force not only failed to overcome Alexander and his allies, but got into serious difficulties, when it tried to withdraw; Epaminondas, serving as a private soldier, succeeded in extricating it In early 367, Epaminondas led a second Theban expedition to free Pelopidas, and Ismenias He finally outmanoeuvred the Thessalians, and secured the release of the two Theban ambassadors without a fight [61]\n\n\nThird invasion of the Peloponnesus (367 BC)\nIn the spring of 367 BC, Epaminondas again invaded the Peloponnesus This time an Argive army captured part of the Isthmus on Epaminondas's request, allowing the Theban army to enter the Peloponnesus unhindered On this occasion, Epaminondas marched to Achaea, seeking to secure their allegiance to Thebes No army dared to challenge him in the field, and the Achaean oligarchies therefore acquiesced to the request that they be allied to Thebes Epaminondas' acceptance of the Achaean oligarchies roused protests by both the Arcadians and his political rivals, and his settlement was thus shortly reversed: democracies were set up, and the oligarchs exiled These democratic governments were short-lived, since the pro-Spartan aristocrats from all the cities banded together and attacked each city in turn, re-establishing the oligarchies According to G.L Cawkwell, \"the sequel perhaps showed the good sense of Epaminondas When these exiles recovered the cities, they 'no longer took a middle course'.\" In the light of their treatment by Thebes, they abandoned their previously neutral stance, and thereafter \"fought zealously in support of the Lacedaemonians\" [62] [63]\n\n\nResistance to Thebes\nIn 366/365 BC an attempt was made to make a common peace, with the Persian King Artaxerxes II as arbiter and guarantor Thebes organized a conference to have the terms of the peace accepted, but their diplomatic initiative failed: the negotiations could not resolve the hostility between Thebes and other states that resented its influence (such as the Arcadian leader Lycomedes who challenged the right of the Thebans to hold the congress in Thebes); the peace was never fully accepted, and fighting soon resumed [62] [64] believes that Thebes had concrete gains from the congress: \"The peace of 366/5 set the seal on Epaminondas' Peloponnesian policy Under it the remaining members of the Peloponnesian league finally abandoned Sparta, and recognized the independence of Messenia and, presumably, the unification of Boeotia.\" [65]\n\n\nFourth invasion of the Peloponnesus (362 BC)\nIn the face of this increasing opposition to Theban dominance, Epaminondas launched his final expedition into the Peloponnese in 362 BC The immediate goal of the expedition was to subdue Mantinea, which had been opposing Theban influence in the region Epaminondas brought an army drawn from Boeotia, Thessaly and Euboea He was joined by Tegea, which was the center of local opposition to Mantinea, Argos, Messenia, and some of the Arcadians Mantinea, on the other hand, had requested assistance from Sparta, Athens, Achaea and the rest of Arcadia, so that almost all of Greece was represented on one side or the other [70]\n\n\nDeath\nWhile pressing forward with the troops at Mantinea, Epaminondas was hit in the chest by a spear (or, in some accounts, a sword or large knife) Cornelius Nepos suggests the Spartans were deliberately aiming at Epaminondas in the hope of killing him, and thereby demoralizing the Thebans The enemy who struck the killing blow was variously identified as Anticrates, Machaerion, or Gryllus, son of Xenophon [citation needed]\n\n\nAssessments\nIn matters of character, Epaminondas was above reproach in the eyes of the ancient historians who recorded his deeds Contemporaries praised him for disdaining material wealth, sharing what he had with his friends, and refusing bribes One of the last heirs of the Pythagorean tradition, he appears to have lived a simple and ascetic lifestyle even when his leadership had raised him to a position at the head of all Greece Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of a Persian ambassador who came to him with a bribe These aspects of his character contributed greatly to his renown after his death.\n\n\nCharacter\nIn matters of character, Epaminondas was above reproach in the eyes of the ancient historians who recorded his deeds Contemporaries praised him for disdaining material wealth, sharing what he had with his friends, and refusing bribes One of the last heirs of the Pythagorean tradition, he appears to have lived a simple and ascetic lifestyle even when his leadership had raised him to a position at the head of all Greece Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of a Persian ambassador who came to him with a bribe These aspects of his character contributed greatly to his renown after his death.\n\n\nMilitary record\nExtant biographies of Epaminondas universally describe him as one of the most talented generals ever produced by the Greek city-states Even Xenophon, who fails to note his presence at Leuctra, says of his Mantinean campaign: \"Now I for my part could not say that his campaign proved fortunate; yet of all possible deeds of forethought and daring the man seems to me to have left not one undone.\" Diodorus is effusive in his praise for Epaminondas's military record: [83]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn some ways Epaminondas dramatically altered the face of Greece during the 10 years in which he was the central figure of Greek politics By the time of his death, Sparta had been humbled, Messenia freed, and the Peloponnese completely reorganized In another respect, however, he left behind a Greece no different from that which he had found; the bitter divides and animosities that had poisoned international relations in Greece for over a century remained as deep as or deeper than they had been before Leuctra The brutal internecine warfare that had characterized the years from 432 BC onwards continued unabated until all the states involved were defeated by Macedon [citation needed]\n\n\nNotes\n Media related to Epaminondas at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nReferences\n Media related to Epaminondas at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nBibliography\n Media related to Epaminondas at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nAncient sources\n Media related to Epaminondas at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nModern sources\n Media related to Epaminondas at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nFurther reading\n Media related to Epaminondas at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nExternal links\n Media related to Epaminondas at Wikimedia Commons\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Epaminondas**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nEpaminondas (c. 418-362 BC) was a renowned Theban general and statesman who played a pivotal role in the history of ancient Greece. He is best known for his brilliant military campaigns, particularly his victory at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC, which marked a significant turning point in the Peloponnesian War. As a leader, Epaminondas was admired for his exceptional strategic thinking, his ability to inspire loyalty and devotion in his troops, and his commitment to the principles of justice and fairness. Despite his tragic death at the Battle of Mantinea in 362 BC, Epaminondas's legacy endured, and his name became synonymous with bravery, wisdom, and leadership.\n\n**Historical Sources**\n\nThe life of Epaminondas is very poorly attested in the ancient sources, especially compared to some of his near contemporaries. One principal reason for this is the loss of Plutarch's biography of him. Epaminondas was one of approximately 50 ancient figures given an extensive biography by Plutarch in his Parallel Lives, in which he is paired with the Roman statesman Scipio Africanus; however, both of these parts of Lives are now lost. Plutarch wrote his biography over 400 years after Epaminondas's death and is therefore very much a secondary source, but he often explicitly names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nEpaminondas was born at Thebes to a family of high standing which, according to tradition, claimed descent from the mythical Spartoi. His year of birth cannot be determined with precision, and estimates have varied between 419 and 411 BC. What has been recorded of Epaminondas's immediate family is that his father was called Polymnis, he had a brother named Caphisias, and both parents lived to see his victory at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC. His education was regarded as excellent and comprehensive. He learned how to handle a cither, to play the flute, and to dance, and, while exercising in the gymnasium, he demonstrated a preference for agility over sheer strength. Epaminondas was taught philosophy by Lysis of Tarentum, a Pythagorean who had escaped persecution in Magna Graecia and allowed to settle in Epaminondas's father's own house.\n\n**Political and Military Career**\n\nEpaminondas lived at a particularly turbulent point in Greek history. Following its victory in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC, Sparta had embarked upon an aggressively unilateralist policy towards the rest of Greece and quickly alienated many of its former allies. Thebes, meanwhile, had greatly increased its own power during the war and sought to gain control of the other cities of Boeotia (the region of ancient Greece northwest of Attica). This policy, along with other disputes, brought Thebes into conflict with Sparta. By 395 BC, Thebes, alongside Athens, Corinth, and Argos, found itself arrayed against Sparta (a former ally) in the Corinthian War. That war, which dragged on inconclusively for eight years, saw several bloody Theban defeats at Spartan hands. By the time of its conclusion, Thebes had been forced to check its expansionist ambitions and return to its old alliance with Sparta.\n\n**Theban Coup of 378 BC**\n\nIn the years following the Spartan takeover, the exiled Thebans regrouped in Athens and, at the instigation of Pelopidas, prepared to liberate their city. Meanwhile, in Thebes, Epaminondas began preparing the young men of the city to fight the Spartans. In the winter of 379 BC, a small group of the exiles, led by Pelopidas, infiltrated the city. They then assassinated the leaders of the pro-Spartan government, and supported by Epaminondas and Gorgidas, who led a group of young men, and a force of Athenian hoplites, they surrounded the Spartans on the Cadmeia. The following day, Epaminondas and Gorgidas brought Pelopidas and his men before the Theban assembly and exhorted the Thebans to fight for their freedom; the assembly responded by acclaiming Pelopidas and his men as liberators. The Cadmeia was surrounded, and the Spartans attacked; Pelopidas realised that they must be expelled before an army came from Sparta to relieve them. The Spartan garrison eventually surrendered on the condition that they were allowed to march away unharmed.\n\n**Aftermath, 378-371 BC**\n\nWhen news of the uprising at Thebes reached Sparta, an army under Cleombrotus I had been dispatched to subdue the city, but turned back without engaging the Thebans. Another army under Agesilaus II was then dispatched to attack the Thebans. However, the Thebans refused to meet the Spartan army in battle, instead building a trench and stockade outside Thebes, which they occupied, preventing the Spartans advancing on the city. The Spartans ravaged the countryside but eventually departed, leaving Thebes independent. This victory so heartened the Thebans that they undertook operations against other neighboring cities as well. In short order the Thebans were able to reconstitute their old Boeotian confederacy in a new, democratic form. The cities of Boeotia united as a federation with an executive body composed of seven generals, or Boeotarchs, elected from seven districts throughout Boeotia.\n\n**Peace Conference of 371 BC**\n\nThe years following the Theban coup had seen desultory fighting between Sparta and Thebes, with Athens also drawn into the conflict. A feeble attempt at a common peace had been made in 375 BC, but desultory fighting between Athens and Sparta had resumed by 373 BC (at the latest). By 371 BC, Athens and Sparta were again war-weary, and in 371 BC a conference was held at Sparta to discuss another attempt at a common peace.\n\n**Battle of Leuctra (371 BC)**\n\nImmediately following the failure of the peace talks, orders were sent out from Sparta to the Spartan king Cleombrotus, who was at the head of an army in Phocis, commanding him to march directly to Boeotia. Skirting north to avoid mountain passes where the Boeotians were prepared to ambush him, Cleombrotus entered Boeotian territory from an unexpected direction and quickly seized a fort and captured 10 or 12 triremes. Then marching towards Thebes, he camped at Leuctra, in the territory of Thespiae. Here, the Boeotian army came to meet him. The Spartan army contained some 10,000 hoplites, 700 of whom were the elite warriors known as Spartiates. The Boeotians opposite them numbered about 6,000, but were bolstered by a cavalry superior to that of the Peloponnesians.\n\n**Theban Hegemony**\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Leuctra, the Thebans considered following up their victory by taking their vengeance on Sparta; they also invited Athens to join them in doing so. However, their Thessalian allies under Jason of Pherae dissuaded them from shattering what remained of the Spartan army. Instead, Epaminondas occupied himself with consolidating the Boeotian confederacy, compelling the previously Spartan-aligned polis of Orchomenus to join the league.\n\n**First Invasion of the Peloponnese (370 BC)**\n\nWhen, in the immediate aftermath of Leuctra, the Thebans had sent a herald to Athens with news of their victory, the messenger was met with stony silence. The Athenians then decided to take advantage of the Spartan discomfiture, holding a conference in Athens, in which the peace terms proposed earlier in 371 BC were ratified by all cities (except Elis); and this time, the treaty explicitly made the Peloponnesian cities, formerly under Spartan dominance, independent. Taking advantage of this, the Mantineans decided to unify their settlements into a single city, and to fortify it; a decision which greatly angered Agesilaus. Furthermore, Tegea, supported by Mantinea, instigated the formation of an Arcadian alliance. This led to the Spartans declaring war on Mantinea, whereupon the majority of Arcadian cities grouped together to oppose the Spartans (thus forming the confederation that the Spartans were trying to prevent), and requested assistance from the Thebans. The Theban force arrived late in 370 BC, and it was led by Epaminondas and Pelopidas, both at this time Boeotarchs.\n\n**Trial**\n\nIn order to accomplish all that he wished in the Peloponnese, Epaminondas had persuaded his fellow Boeotarchs to remain in the field for several months after their term of office had expired. Upon his return home, Epaminondas was therefore greeted not with a hero's welcome but with a trial arranged by his political enemies. According to Cornelius Nepos, in his defense Epaminondas merely requested that, if he be executed, the inscription regarding the verdict read:\n\n**Second Invasion of the Peloponnese (369 BC)**\n\nIn 369 BC the Argives, Eleans and the Arcadians, eager to continue their war against Sparta, recalled the Thebans to their support. Epaminondas, at the height of his prestige, again commanded an allied invasion force. Arriving at the Isthmus of Corinth, the Thebans found it heavily guarded by the Spartans and Athenians (along with the Corinthians, Megarans and Pellenians). Epaminondas decided to attack the weakest spot, guarded by the Lacedaemonians; in a dawn attack he forced his way through the Spartan position, and joined his Peloponnesian allies. The Thebans thus won an easy victory and crossed the Isthmus. Diodorus stresses that this was \"a feat no whit inferior to his former mighty deeds\".\n\n**Thessaly (368 BC)**\n\nWhen Epaminondas returned to Thebes, he continued to be dogged by his political enemies who prosecuted him for the second time. They actually succeeded in excluding him from the office of Boeotarch for the year 368 BC. This was the only time from the Battle of Leuctra until his death that he did not serve as Boeotarch. In 368, the Theban army marched into Thessaly to rescue Pelopidas and Ismenias, who had been imprisoned by Alexander of Pherae while serving as ambassadors. The Theban force not only failed to overcome Alexander and his allies, but got into serious difficulties, when it tried to withdraw; Epaminondas, serving as a private soldier, succeeded in extricating it. In early 367, Epaminondas led a second Theban expedition to free Pelopidas, and Ismenias. He finally outmanoeuvred the Thessalians, and secured the release of the two Theban ambassadors without a fight.\n\n**Third Invasion of the Peloponnese (367 BC)**\n\nIn the spring of 367 BC, Epaminondas again invaded the Peloponnese. This time an Argive army captured part of the Isthmus on Epaminondas's request, allowing the Theban army to enter the Peloponnese unhindered. On this occasion, Epaminondas marched to Achaea, seeking to secure their allegiance to Thebes. No army dared to challenge him in the field, and the Achaean oligarchies therefore acquiesced to the request that they be allied to Thebes. Epaminondas's acceptance of the Achaean oligarchies roused protests by both the Arcadians and his political rivals, and his settlement was thus shortly reversed: democracies were set up, and the oligarchs exiled. These democratic governments were short-lived, since the pro-Spartan aristocrats from all the cities banded together and attacked each city in turn, re-establishing the oligarchies. According to G.L Cawkwell, \"the sequel perhaps showed the good sense of Epaminondas. When these exiles recovered the cities, they 'no longer took a middle course'\". In the light of their treatment by Thebes, they abandoned their previously neutral stance, and thereafter \"fought zealously in support of the Lacedaemonians\".\n\n**Resistance to Thebes**\n\nIn 366/365 BC an attempt was made to make a common peace, with the Persian King Artaxerxes II as arbiter and guarantor. Thebes organized a conference to have the terms of the peace accepted, but their diplomatic initiative failed: the negotiations could not resolve the hostility between Thebes and other states that resented its influence (such as the Arcadian leader Lycomedes who challenged the right of the Thebans to hold the congress in Thebes); the peace was never fully accepted, and fighting soon resumed. believes that Thebes had concrete gains from the congress: \"The peace of 366/5 set the seal on Epaminondas's Peloponnesian policy. Under it the remaining members of the Peloponnesian league finally abandoned Sparta, and recognized the independence of Messenia and, presumably, the unification of Boeotia\".\n\n**Fourth Invasion of the Peloponnese (362 BC)**\n\nIn the face of this increasing opposition to Theban dominance, Epaminondas launched his final expedition into the Peloponnese in 362 BC. The immediate goal of the expedition was to subdue Mantinea, which had been opposing Theban influence in the region. Epaminondas brought an army drawn from Boeotia, Thessaly and Euboea. He was joined by Tegea, which was the center of local opposition to Mantinea, Argos, Messenia, and some of the Arcadians. Mantinea, on the other hand, had requested assistance from Sparta, Athens, Achaea and the rest of Arcadia, so that almost all of Greece was represented on one side or the other.\n\n**Death**\n\nWhile pressing forward with the troops at Mantinea, Epaminondas was hit in the chest by a spear (or, in some accounts, a sword or large knife). Cornelius Nepos suggests the Spartans were deliberately aiming at Epaminondas in the hope of killing him, and thereby demoralizing the Thebans. The enemy who struck the killing blow was variously identified as Anticrates, Machaerion, or Gryllus, son of Xenophon.\n\n**Assessments**\n\nIn matters of character, Epaminondas was above reproach in the eyes of the ancient historians who recorded his deeds. Contemporaries praised him for disdaining material wealth, sharing what he had with his friends, and refusing bribes. One of the last heirs of the Pythagorean tradition, he appears to have lived a simple and ascetic lifestyle even when his leadership had raised him to a position at the head of all Greece. Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of a Persian ambassador who came to him with a bribe. These aspects of his character contributed greatly to his renown after his death.\n\n**Military Record**\n\nExtant biographies of Epaminondas universally describe him as one of the most talented generals ever produced by the Greek city-states. Even Xenophon, who fails to note his presence at Leuctra, says of his Mantinean campaign: \"Now I for my part could not say that his campaign proved fortunate; yet of all possible deeds of forethought and daring the man seems to me to have left not one undone.\" Diodorus is effusive in his praise for Epaminondas's military record:\n\n**Legacy**\n\nIn some ways Epaminondas dramatically altered the face of Greece during the 10 years in which he was the central figure of Greek politics. By the time of his death, Sparta had been humbled, Messenia freed, and the Peloponnese completely reorganized. In another respect, however, he left behind a Greece no different from that which he had found; the bitter divides and animosities that had poisoned international relations in Greece for over a century remained as deep as or deeper than they had been before Leuctra. The brutal internecine warfare that had characterized the years from 432 BC onwards continued unabated until all the states involved were defeated by Macedon.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Epaminondas\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistorical sources\nThe life of Epaminondas is very poorly attested in the ancient sources, especially compared to some of his near contemporaries (e.g Philip II of Macedon and Pelopidas) One principal reason for this is the loss of Plutarch's biography of him Epaminondas was one of approximately 50 ancient figures given an extensive biography by Plutarch in his Parallel Lives, in which he is paired with the Roman statesman Scipio Africanus; however, both of these parts of Lives are now lost [1] Plutarch wrote his biography over 400 years after Epaminondas's death and is therefore very much a secondary source, but he often explicitly names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements [citation needed]\n\n\nEarly life\nEpaminondas was born at Thebes to a family of high standing which, according to tradition, claimed descent from the mythical Spartoi [7] His year of birth cannot be determined with precision, and estimates have varied between 419 and 411 BC [8] What has been recorded of Epaminondas's immediate family is that his father was called Polymnis, he had a brother named Caphisias, and both parents lived to see his victory at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC [7] His education was regarded as excellent and comprehensive He learned how to handle a cither, to play the flute, and to dance, and, while exercising in the gymnasium (traditionally a cornerstone of Theban education), he demonstrated a preference for agility over sheer strength Epaminondas was taught philosophy by Lysis of Tarentum, a Pythagorean who had escaped persecution in Magna Graecia and allowed to settle in Epaminondas's father's own house [9]\n\n\nPolitical and military career\nEpaminondas lived at a particularly turbulent point in Greek history Following its victory in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC, Sparta had embarked upon an aggressively unilateralist policy towards the rest of Greece and quickly alienated many of its former allies [12] [13] Thebes, meanwhile, had greatly increased its own power during the war and sought to gain control of the other cities of Boeotia (the region of ancient Greece northwest of Attica) This policy, along with other disputes, brought Thebes into conflict with Sparta By 395 BC, Thebes, alongside Athens, Corinth, and Argos, found itself arrayed against Sparta (a former ally) in the Corinthian War That war, which dragged on inconclusively for eight years, saw several bloody Theban defeats at Spartan hands By the time of its conclusion, Thebes had been forced to check its expansionist ambitions and return to its old alliance with Sparta [14]\n\n\nBackground\nEpaminondas lived at a particularly turbulent point in Greek history Following its victory in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC, Sparta had embarked upon an aggressively unilateralist policy towards the rest of Greece and quickly alienated many of its former allies [12] [13] Thebes, meanwhile, had greatly increased its own power during the war and sought to gain control of the other cities of Boeotia (the region of ancient Greece northwest of Attica) This policy, along with other disputes, brought Thebes into conflict with Sparta By 395 BC, Thebes, alongside Athens, Corinth, and Argos, found itself arrayed against Sparta (a former ally) in the Corinthian War That war, which dragged on inconclusively for eight years, saw several bloody Theban defeats at Spartan hands By the time of its conclusion, Thebes had been forced to check its expansionist ambitions and return to its old alliance with Sparta [14]\n\n\nEarly career\nEpaminondas supposedly served in a Theban contingent that aided Sparta in its attack against the city of Mantinea in 385 BC, during which he is said to have saved the life of Pelopidas, an act that cemented their friendship The anecdote, reported by Plutarch and Pausanias, has been dismissed as an unhistorical doublet of Socrates's saving of Alcibiades at the Battle of Delium in 424 BC [16] While some historians at least accept that Epaminondas served with the Spartans in 385 BC, [17] one author has questioned altogether the existence of a Spartan–Theban alliance during this period [16]\n\n\nTheban coup of 378 BC\nIn the years following the Spartan takeover, the exiled Thebans regrouped in Athens and, at the instigation of Pelopidas, prepared to liberate their city Meanwhile, in Thebes, Epaminondas began preparing the young men of the city to fight the Spartans In the winter of 379 BC, a small group of the exiles, led by Pelopidas, infiltrated the city They then assassinated the leaders of the pro-Spartan government, and supported by Epaminondas and Gorgidas, who led a group of young men, and a force of Athenian hoplites, they surrounded the Spartans on the Cadmeia The following day, Epaminondas and Gorgidas brought Pelopidas and his men before the Theban assembly and exhorted the Thebans to fight for their freedom; the assembly responded by acclaiming Pelopidas and his men as liberators The Cadmeia was surrounded, and the Spartans attacked; Pelopidas realised that they must be expelled before an army came from Sparta to relieve them The Spartan garrison eventually surrendered on the condition that they were allowed to march away unharmed The narrow margin of the conspirators' success is demonstrated by the fact that the Spartan garrison met a Spartan force on the way to rescue them as they marched back to Sparta.\n\n\nAftermath, 378–371 BC\nWhen news of the uprising at Thebes reached Sparta, an army under Cleombrotus I had been dispatched to subdue the city, but turned back without engaging the Thebans Another army under Agesilaus II was then dispatched to attack the Thebans However, the Thebans refused to meet the Spartan army in battle, instead building a trench and stockade outside Thebes, which they occupied, preventing the Spartans advancing on the city The Spartans ravaged the countryside but eventually departed, leaving Thebes independent This victory so heartened the Thebans that they undertook operations against other neighboring cities as well [note 1] In short order the Thebans were able to reconstitute their old Boeotian confederacy in a new, democratic form The cities of Boeotia united as a federation with an executive body composed of seven generals, or Boeotarchs, elected from seven districts throughout Boeotia [19] This political fusion was so successful that henceforth the names Theban and Boeotian were used interchangeably in a nod to the newfound solidarity of the region.\n\n\nPeace conference of 371 BC\nThe years following the Theban coup had seen desultory fighting between Sparta and Thebes, with Athens also drawn into the conflict A feeble attempt at a common peace had been made in 375 BC, but desultory fighting between Athens and Sparta had resumed by 373 BC (at the latest) By 371 BC, Athens and Sparta were again war-weary, and in 371 BC a conference was held at Sparta to discuss another attempt at a common peace.\n\n\nBattle of Leuctra (371 BC)\nImmediately following the failure of the peace talks, orders were sent out from Sparta to the Spartan king Cleombrotus, who was at the head of an army in Phocis, commanding him to march directly to Boeotia Skirting north to avoid mountain passes where the Boeotians were prepared to ambush him, Cleombrotus entered Boeotian territory from an unexpected direction and quickly seized a fort and captured 10 or 12 triremes Then marching towards Thebes, he camped at Leuctra, in the territory of Thespiae Here, the Boeotian army came to meet him The Spartan army contained some 10,000 hoplites, 700 of whom were the elite warriors known as Spartiates The Boeotians opposite them numbered about 6,000, but were bolstered by a cavalry superior to that of the Peloponnesians [27] [28]\n\n\nTheban hegemony\nIn the immediate aftermath of Leuctra, the Thebans considered following up their victory by taking their vengeance on Sparta; they also invited Athens to join them in doing so However, their Thessalian allies under Jason of Pherae dissuaded them from shattering what remained of the Spartan army [43] Instead, Epaminondas occupied himself with consolidating the Boeotian confederacy, compelling the previously Spartan-aligned polis of Orchomenus to join the league [44]\n\n\nFirst Invasion of the Peloponnese (370 BC)\nWhen, in the immediate aftermath of Leuctra, the Thebans had sent a herald to Athens with news of their victory, the messenger was met with stony silence The Athenians then decided to take advantage of the Spartan discomfiture, holding a conference in Athens, in which the peace terms proposed earlier in 371 BC were ratified by all cities (except Elis); and this time, the treaty explicitly made the Peloponnesian cities, formerly under Spartan dominance, independent [49] Taking advantage of this, the Mantineans decided to unify their settlements into a single city, and to fortify it; a decision which greatly angered Agesilaus Furthermore, Tegea, supported by Mantinea, instigated the formation of an Arcadian alliance This led to the Spartans declaring war on Mantinea, whereupon the majority of Arcadian cities grouped together to oppose the Spartans (thus forming the confederation that the Spartans were trying to prevent), and requested assistance from the Thebans The Theban force arrived late in 370 BC, and it was led by Epaminondas and Pelopidas, both at this time Boeotarchs [50] [49] As they journeyed into Arcadia, the Thebans were joined by armed contingents from many of Sparta's former allies, swelling their forces to some 50–70,000 men [51] In Arcadia Epaminondas encouraged the Arcadians to form their proposed league, and to build the new city of Megalopolis (as a center of power opposed to Sparta) [52]\n\n\nTrial\n\nIn order to accomplish all that he wished in the Peloponnesus, Epaminondas had persuaded his fellow Boeotarchs to remain in the field for several months after their term of office had expired Upon his return home, Epaminondas was therefore greeted not with a hero's welcome but with a trial arranged by his political enemies According to Cornelius Nepos, in his defense Epaminondas merely requested that, if he be executed, the inscription regarding the verdict read: [55] \n\nSecond invasion of the Peloponnesus (369 BC)\nIn 369 BC the Argives, Eleans and the Arcadians, eager to continue their war against Sparta, recalled the Thebans to their support Epaminondas, at the height of his prestige, again commanded an allied invasion force Arriving at the Isthmus of Corinth, the Thebans found it heavily guarded by the Spartans and Athenians (along with the Corinthians, Megarans and Pellenians) Epaminondas decided to attack the weakest spot, guarded by the Lacedaemonians; in a dawn attack he forced his way through the Spartan position, and joined his Peloponnesian allies The Thebans thus won an easy victory and crossed the Isthmus Diodorus stresses that this was \"a feat no whit inferior to his former mighty deeds\" [57]\n\n\nThessaly (368 BC)\nWhen Epaminondas returned to Thebes, he continued to be dogged by his political enemies who prosecuted him for the second time They actually succeeded in excluding him from the office of Boeotarch for the year 368 BC This was the only time from the Battle of Leuctra until his death that he did not serve as Boeotarch In 368, the Theban army marched into Thessaly to rescue Pelopidas and Ismenias, who had been imprisoned by Alexander of Pherae while serving as ambassadors The Theban force not only failed to overcome Alexander and his allies, but got into serious difficulties, when it tried to withdraw; Epaminondas, serving as a private soldier, succeeded in extricating it In early 367, Epaminondas led a second Theban expedition to free Pelopidas, and Ismenias He finally outmanoeuvred the Thessalians, and secured the release of the two Theban ambassadors without a fight [61]\n\n\nThird invasion of the Peloponnesus (367 BC)\nIn the spring of 367 BC, Epaminondas again invaded the Peloponnesus This time an Argive army captured part of the Isthmus on Epaminondas's request, allowing the Theban army to enter the Peloponnesus unhindered On this occasion, Epaminondas marched to Achaea, seeking to secure their allegiance to Thebes No army dared to challenge him in the field, and the Achaean oligarchies therefore acquiesced to the request that they be allied to Thebes Epaminondas' acceptance of the Achaean oligarchies roused protests by both the Arcadians and his political rivals, and his settlement was thus shortly reversed: democracies were set up, and the oligarchs exiled These democratic governments were short-lived, since the pro-Spartan aristocrats from all the cities banded together and attacked each city in turn, re-establishing the oligarchies According to G.L Cawkwell, \"the sequel perhaps showed the good sense of Epaminondas When these exiles recovered the cities, they 'no longer took a middle course'.\" In the light of their treatment by Thebes, they abandoned their previously neutral stance, and thereafter \"fought zealously in support of the Lacedaemonians\" [62] [63]\n\n\nResistance to Thebes\nIn 366/365 BC an attempt was made to make a common peace, with the Persian King Artaxerxes II as arbiter and guarantor Thebes organized a conference to have the terms of the peace accepted, but their diplomatic initiative failed: the negotiations could not resolve the hostility between Thebes and other states that resented its influence (such as the Arcadian leader Lycomedes who challenged the right of the Thebans to hold the congress in Thebes); the peace was never fully accepted, and fighting soon resumed [62] [64] believes that Thebes had concrete gains from the congress: \"The peace of 366/5 set the seal on Epaminondas' Peloponnesian policy Under it the remaining members of the Peloponnesian league finally abandoned Sparta, and recognized the independence of Messenia and, presumably, the unification of Boeotia.\" [65]\n\n\nFourth invasion of the Peloponnesus (362 BC)\nIn the face of this increasing opposition to Theban dominance, Epaminondas launched his final expedition into the Peloponnese in 362 BC The immediate goal of the expedition was to subdue Mantinea, which had been opposing Theban influence in the region Epaminondas brought an army drawn from Boeotia, Thessaly and Euboea He was joined by Tegea, which was the center of local opposition to Mantinea, Argos, Messenia, and some of the Arcadians Mantinea, on the other hand, had requested assistance from Sparta, Athens, Achaea and the rest of Arcadia, so that almost all of Greece was represented on one side or the other [70]\n\n\nDeath\nWhile pressing forward with the troops at Mantinea, Epaminondas was hit in the chest by a spear (or, in some accounts, a sword or large knife) Cornelius Nepos suggests the Spartans were deliberately aiming at Epaminondas in the hope of killing him, and thereby demoralizing the Thebans The enemy who struck the killing blow was variously identified as Anticrates, Machaerion, or Gryllus, son of Xenophon [citation needed]\n\n\nAssessments\nIn matters of character, Epaminondas was above reproach in the eyes of the ancient historians who recorded his deeds Contemporaries praised him for disdaining material wealth, sharing what he had with his friends, and refusing bribes One of the last heirs of the Pythagorean tradition, he appears to have lived a simple and ascetic lifestyle even when his leadership had raised him to a position at the head of all Greece Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of a Persian ambassador who came to him with a bribe These aspects of his character contributed greatly to his renown after his death.\n\n\nCharacter\nIn matters of character, Epaminondas was above reproach in the eyes of the ancient historians who recorded his deeds Contemporaries praised him for disdaining material wealth, sharing what he had with his friends, and refusing bribes One of the last heirs of the Pythagorean tradition, he appears to have lived a simple and ascetic lifestyle even when his leadership had raised him to a position at the head of all Greece Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of a Persian ambassador who came to him with a bribe These aspects of his character contributed greatly to his renown after his death.\n\n\nMilitary record\nExtant biographies of Epaminondas universally describe him as one of the most talented generals ever produced by the Greek city-states Even Xenophon, who fails to note his presence at Leuctra, says of his Mantinean campaign: \"Now I for my part could not say that his campaign proved fortunate;

The protests were dropped after the Indian Government pledged to form an oversight committee to look into the claims. However, the wrestlers returned to protests in April 2023, claiming that the Government did not honour its commitments. During the protests, Phogat said that she informed the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sports Minister Anurag Thakur about the mental harassment, torture, and threats to her life after she accused and reported Bhushan.\n\n**2024 Farmers' Protests**\n\nOn 31 August 2024, Phogat joined the ongoing 200 days long farmers' protest at Punjab's Shambhu border in support of a legal guarantee for all their crops at a Minimum Support Price (MSP).

workstations It grew into a product line of its own and now consists of four sub-families that tend to be released almost simultaneously and share the same kernel.\n\n\nVersion history\nIn November 1988, a new development team within Microsoft (which included former Digital Equipment Corporation developers Dave Cutler and Mark Lucovsky) began work on a revamped version of IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 operating system known as \"NT OS/2\" NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, multi-user operating system with POSIX compatibility and a modular, portable kernel with preemptive multitasking and support for multiple processor architectures However, following the successful release of Windows 3.0, the NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended 32-bit port of the Windows API known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2 Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows APIs (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be ported to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own [36] [37]\n\n\nEarly versions\nThe history of Windows dates back to 1981 when Microsoft started work on a program called \"Interface Manager\" The name \"Windows\" comes from the fact that the system was one of the first to use graphical boxes to represent programs; in the industry, at the time, these were called \"windows\" and the underlying software was called \"windowing software.\" [13] It was announced in November 1983 (after the Apple Lisa, but before the Macintosh) under the name \"Windows\", but Windows 1.0 was not released until November 1985 [18] Windows 1.0 was to compete with Apple's operating system, but achieved little popularity Windows 1.0 is not a complete operating system; rather, it extends MS-DOS The shell of Windows 1.0 is a program known as the MS-DOS Executive Components included Calculator, Calendar, Cardfile, Clipboard Viewer, Clock, Control Panel, Notepad, Paint, Reversi, Terminal and Write Windows 1.0 does not allow overlapping windows Instead, all windows are tiled Only modal dialog boxes may appear over other windows Microsoft sold as included Windows Development libraries with the C development environment, which included numerous windows samples [19]\n\n\nWindows 3.x\nWindows 3.0, released in 1990, improved the design, mostly because of virtual memory and loadable virtual device drivers (VxDs) that allow Windows to share arbitrary devices between multi-tasked DOS applications [citation needed] Windows 3.0 applications can run in protected mode, which gives them access to several megabytes of memory without the obligation to participate in the software virtual memory scheme They run inside the same address space, where the segmented memory provides a degree of protection Windows 3.0 also featured improvements to the user interface Microsoft rewrote critical operations from C into assembly Windows 3.0 was the first version of Windows to achieve broad commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months [25] [26]\n\n\nWindows 9x\nThe next major consumer-oriented release of Windows, Windows 95, was released on August 24, 1995 While still remaining MS-DOS-based, Windows 95 introduced support for native 32-bit applications, plug and play hardware, preemptive multitasking, long file names of up to 255 characters, and provided increased stability over its predecessors Windows 95 also introduced a redesigned, object oriented user interface, replacing the previous Program Manager with the Start menu, taskbar, and Windows Explorer shell Windows 95 was a major commercial success for Microsoft; Ina Fried of CNET remarked that \"by the time Windows 95 was finally ushered off the market in 2001, it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world.\" [30] Microsoft published four OEM Service Releases (OSR) of Windows 95, each of which was roughly equivalent to a service pack The first OSR of Windows 95 was also the first version of Windows to be bundled with Microsoft's web browser, Internet Explorer [31] Mainstream support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2000, and extended support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2001 [32]\n\n\nWindows NT\nIn November 1988, a new development team within Microsoft (which included former Digital Equipment Corporation developers Dave

on its own [36] [37]\n\n\nWindows XP\nThe next major version of Windows NT, Windows XP, was released to manufacturing (RTM) on August 24, 2001, and to the general public on October 25, 2001 The introduction of Windows XP aimed to unify the consumer-oriented Windows 9x series with the architecture introduced by Windows NT, a change which Microsoft promised would provide better performance over its DOS-based predecessors Windows XP would also introduce a redesigned user interface (including an updated Start menu and a \"task-oriented\" Windows Explorer), streamlined multimedia and networking features, Internet Explorer 6, integration with Microsoft's .NET Passport services, a \"compatibility mode\" to help provide backwards compatibility with software designed for previous versions of Windows, and Remote Assistance functionality [38] [39]\n\n\nWindows Vista\nAfter a lengthy development process, Windows Vista was released on November 30, 2006, for volume licensing and January 30, 2007, for consumers It contained a number of new features, from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant technical changes, with a particular focus on security features It was available in a number of different editions, and has been subject to some criticism, such as drop of performance, longer boot time, criticism of new UAC, and stricter license agreement Vista's server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 was released in early 2008.\n\n\nWindows 7\nOn July 22, 2009, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 were released to manufacturing (RTM) and released to the public three months later on October 22, 2009 Unlike its predecessor, Windows Vista, which introduced a large number of new features, Windows 7 was intended to be a more focused, incremental upgrade to the Windows line, with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware with which Windows Vista was already compatible [44] Windows 7 has multi-touch support, a redesigned Windows shell with an updated taskbar with revealable jump lists that contain shortcuts to files frequently used with specific applications and shortcuts to tasks within the application, [45] a home networking system called HomeGroup, [46] and performance improvements.\n\n\nWindows 8 and 8.1\nWindows 8, the successor to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012 A number of significant changes were made on Windows 8, including the introduction of a user interface based around Microsoft's Metro design language with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs These changes include the Start screen, which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information, and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices The new Windows version required a minimum resolution of 1024×768 pixels, [47] effectively making it unfit for netbooks with 800×600-pixel screens.\n\n\nWindows 10\nOn September 30, 2014, Microsoft announced Windows 10 as the successor to Windows 8.1 It was released on July 29, 2015, and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8 Changes on PC include the return of the Start Menu, a virtual desktop system, and the ability to run Windows Store apps within windows on the desktop rather than in full-screen mode Windows 10 is said to be available to update from qualified Windows 7 with SP1, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 devices from the Get Windows 10 Application (for Windows 7, Windows 8.1) or Windows Update (Windows 7) [56]\n\n\nWindows 11\nOn June 24, 2021, Windows 11 was announced as the successor to Windows 10 during a livestream The new operating system was designed to be more user-friendly and understandable It was released on October 5, 2021 [62] [63] As of May 2022, [update] Windows 11 is a free upgrade to Windows 10 users who meet the system requirements [64]\n\n\nWindows 365\nIn July 2021, Microsoft announced it will start selling subscriptions to virtualized Windows desktops as part of a new Windows 365 service in the following month The new service will allow for cross-platform usage, aiming to make the operating system available for both Apple and Android users It is a separate service and offers several variations including Windows 365 Frontline, Windows 365 Boot, and the Windows 365 app [65] The subscription service will be accessible through any operating system with a web browser The new service is an attempt at capitalizing on the growing trend, fostered during the COVID-19 pandemic, for businesses to adopt a hybrid remote work environment, in which \"employees split their time between the office and home\" As the service will be accessible through web browsers, Microsoft will be able to bypass the need to publish the service through Google Play or the Apple App Store [66] [67] [68] [69] [70]\n\n\nMultilingual support\nMultilingual support has been built into Windows since Windows 3.0 The language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the Region and Language Control Panel Components for all supported input languages, such as Input Method Editors, are automatically installed during Windows installation (in Windows XP and earlier, files for East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and files for right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, may need to be installed separately, also from the said Control Panel) Third-party IMEs may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs Since Windows 2000, English editions of Windows NT have East Asian IMEs (such as Microsoft Pinyin IME and Microsoft Japanese IME) bundled, but files for East Asian languages may be manually installed on Control Panel.\n\n\nPlatform support\nWindows NT included support for several platforms before the x86-based personal computer became dominant in the professional world Windows NT 4.0 and its predecessors supported PowerPC, DEC Alpha and MIPS R4000 (although some of the platforms implement 64-bit computing, the OS treated them as 32-bit) Windows 2000 dropped support for all platforms, except the third generation x86 (known as IA-32) or newer in 32-bit mode The client line of the Windows NT family still ran on IA-32 up to Windows 10 [64] (the server line of the Windows NT family still ran on IA-32 up to Windows Server 2008).\n\n\nWindows CE\nWindows CE (officially known as Windows Embedded Compact), is an edition of Windows that runs on minimalistic computers, like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones Windows Embedded Compact is based on its own dedicated kernel, dubbed Windows CE kernel Microsoft licenses Windows CE to OEMs and device makers The OEMs and device makers can modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences, while Windows CE provides the technical foundation to do so.\n\n\nXbox OS\nXbox OS is an unofficial name given to the version of Windows that runs on Xbox consoles [73] From Xbox One onwards it is an implementation with an emphasis on virtualization (using Hyper-V) as it is three operating systems running at once, consisting of the core operating system, a second implemented for games and a more Windows-like environment for applications [74]\nMicrosoft updates Xbox One's OS every month, and these updates can be downloaded from the Xbox Live service to the Xbox and subsequently installed, or by using offline recovery images downloaded via a PC [75] It was originally based on NT 6.2 (Windows 8) kernel, and the latest version runs on an NT 10.0 base This system is sometimes referred to as \"Windows 10 on Xbox One\" [76] [77]\nXbox One and Xbox Series operating systems also allow limited (due to licensing restrictions and testing resources) backward compatibility with previous generation hardware, [78] and the Xbox 360's system is backwards compatible with the original Xbox [79]\n\n\nVersion control system\nUp to and including every version before Windows 2000, Microsoft used an in-house version control system named Source Library Manager (SLM) Shortly after Windows 2000 was released, Microsoft switched to a fork of Perforce named Source Depot [80] This system was used up until 2017 once the system could not keep up with the size of Windows [citation needed] Microsoft had begun to integrate Git into Team Foundation Server in 2013, [81] but Windows (and Office) continued to rely on Source Depot [82] The Windows code was divided among 65 different repositories with a kind of virtualization layer to produce unified view of all of the code [citation needed]\n\n\nVFSForGit\nBecause of its large, decades-long history, however, the Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the decentralized nature of Linux development that Git was originally created to manage [citation needed] Each Git repository contains a complete history of all the files, [85] which proved unworkable for Windows developers because cloning the whole repository takes several hours [citation needed] Microsoft has been working on a new project called the Virtual File System for Git (VFSForGit) to address these challenges [84]\n\n\nTimeline of releases\nVersion market share\nAs a percentage of desktop and laptop systems using Microsoft Windows, [90] according to StatCounter data as of October 2024 [91]:\n\n\nUsage share and device sales\nVersion market share\nAs a percentage of desktop and laptop systems using Microsoft Windows, [90] according to StatCounter data as of October 2024 [91]:\n\n\nSecurity\nEarly versions of Windows were designed at a time where malware and networking were less common, and had few built-in security features; they did not provide access privileges to allow a user to prevent other users from accessing their files, and they did not provide memory protection to prevent one process from reading or writing another process's address space or to prevent a process from code or data used by privileged-mode code.\n\n\nFile permissions\nAll Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as AGDLP (Accounts, Global, Domain Local, Permissions) in which file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members These global groups then hold other groups or users depending on different Windows versions used This system varies from other vendor products such as Linux and NetWare due to the 'static' allocation of permission being applied directly to the file or folder However using this process of AGLP/AGDLP/AGUDLP allows a small number of static permissions to be applied and allows for easy changes to the account groups without reapplying the file permissions on the files and folders.\n\n\nAlternative implementations\nOwing to the operating system's popularity, a number of applications have been released that aim to provide compatibility with Windows applications, either as a compatibility layer for another operating system, or as a standalone system that can run software written for Windows out of the box These include:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Windows**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWindows is a series of operating systems developed and marketed by Microsoft. The first version of Windows was released in 1985, and since then, it has become one of the most widely used operating systems in the world. Windows has undergone significant changes and improvements over the years, with new versions being released regularly. This article provides an overview of the history and development of Windows, as well as its various versions and features.\n\n**Product Line**\n\nAs of today, the only active top-level family is Windows NT. The first version, Windows NT 3.1, was intended for server computing and corporate workstations.

commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months [25] [26]\n\n\nWindows 9x\nThe next major consumer-oriented release of Windows, Windows 95, was released on August 24, 1995 While still remaining MS-DOS-based, Windows 95 introduced support for native 32-bit applications, plug and play hardware, preemptive multitasking, long file names of up to 255 characters, and provided increased stability over its predecessors Windows 95 also introduced a redesigned, object oriented user interface, replacing the previous Program Manager with the Start menu, taskbar, and Windows Explorer shell Windows 95 was a major commercial success for Microsoft; Ina Fried of CNET remarked that \"by the time Windows 95 was finally ushered off the market in 2001, it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world.\" [30] Microsoft published four OEM Service Releases (OSR) of Windows 95, each of which was roughly equivalent to a service pack The first OSR of Windows 95 was also the first version of Windows to be bundled with Microsoft's web browser, Internet Explorer [31] Mainstream support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2000, and extended support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2001 [32]\n\n\nWindows NT\nIn November 1988, a new development team within Microsoft (which included former Digital Equipment Corporation developers Dave Cutler and Mark Lucovsky) began work on a revamped version of IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 operating system known as \"NT OS/2\" NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, multi-user operating system with POSIX compatibility and a modular, portable kernel with preemptive multitasking and support for multiple processor architectures However, following the successful release of Windows 3.0, the NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended 32-bit port of the Windows API known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2 Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows APIs (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be ported to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own [36] [37]\n\n\nVersion history\nIn November 1988, a new

included former Digital Equipment Corporation developers Dave Cutler and Mark Lucovsky) began work on a revamped version of IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 operating system known as \"NT OS/2\" NT OS/2 was

its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own [36] [37]\n\n\nWindows XP\nThe next major version of Windows NT, Windows XP, was released to manufacturing (RTM) on August 24, 2001, and to the general public on October 25, 2001 The introduction of Windows XP aimed to unify the consumer-oriented Windows 9x series with the architecture introduced by Windows NT, a change which Microsoft promised would provide better performance over its DOS-based predecessors Windows XP would also introduce a redesigned user interface (including an updated Start menu and a \"task-oriented\" Windows Explorer), streamlined multimedia and networking features, Internet Explorer 6, integration with Microsoft's .NET Passport services, a \"compatibility mode\" to help provide backwards compatibility with software designed for previous versions of Windows, and Remote Assistance functionality [38] [39]\n\n\nWindows Vista\nAfter a lengthy development process, Windows Vista was released on November 30, 2006, for volume licensing and January 30, 2007, for consumers It contained a number of new features, from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant technical changes, with a particular focus on security features It was available in a number of different editions, and has been subject to some criticism, such as drop of performance, longer boot time, criticism of new UAC, and stricter license agreement Vista's server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 was released in early 2008.\n\n\nWindows 7\nOn July 22, 2009, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 were released to manufacturing (RTM) and released to the public three months later on October 22, 2009 Unlike its predecessor, Windows Vista, which introduced a large number of new features, Windows 7 was intended to be a more focused, incremental upgrade to the Windows line, with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware with which Windows Vista was already compatible [44] Windows 7 has multi-touch support, a redesigned Windows shell with an updated taskbar with revealable jump lists that contain shortcuts to files frequently used with specific applications and shortcuts to tasks within the application, [45] a home networking system called HomeGroup, [46] and performance improvements.\n\n\nWindows 8 and 8.1\nWindows 8, the successor to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012 A number of significant changes were made on Windows 8, including the introduction of a user interface based around Microsoft's Metro design language with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs These changes include the Start screen, which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information, and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices The new Windows version required a minimum resolution of 1024×768 pixels, [47] effectively making it unfit for netbooks with 800×600-pixel screens.\n\n\nWindows 10\nOn September 30, 2014, Microsoft announced Windows 10 as the successor to Windows 8.1 It was released on July 29, 2015, and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8 Changes on PC include the return of the Start Menu, a virtual desktop system, and the ability to run Windows Store apps within windows on the desktop rather than in full-screen mode Windows 10 is said to be available to update from qualified Windows 7 with SP1, Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 devices from the Get Windows 10 Application (for Windows 7, Windows 8.1) or Windows Update (Windows 7) [56]\n\n\nWindows 11\nOn June 24, 2021, Windows 11 was announced as the successor to Windows 10 during a livestream The new operating system was designed to be more user-friendly and understandable It was released on October 5, 2021 [62] [63] As of May 2022, [update] Windows 11 is a free upgrade to Windows 10 users who meet the system requirements [64]\n\n\nWindows 365\nIn July 2021, Microsoft announced it will start selling subscriptions to virtualized Windows desktops as part of a new Windows 365 service in the following month The new service will allow for cross-platform usage, aiming to make the operating system available for both Apple and Android users It is a separate service and offers several variations including Windows 365 Frontline, Windows 365 Boot, and the Windows 365 app [65] The subscription service will be accessible through any operating system with a web browser The new service is an attempt at capitalizing on the growing trend, fostered during the COVID-19 pandemic, for businesses to adopt a hybrid remote work environment, in which \"employees split their time between the office and home\" As the service will be accessible through web browsers, Microsoft will be able to bypass the need to publish the service through Google Play or the Apple App Store [66] [67] [68] [69] [70]\n\n\nMultilingual support\nMultilingual support has been built into Windows since Windows 3.0 The language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the Region and Language Control Panel Components for all supported input languages, such as Input Method Editors, are automatically installed during Windows installation (in Windows XP and earlier, files for East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and files for right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, may need to be installed separately, also from the said Control Panel) Third-party IMEs may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs Since Windows 2000, English editions of Windows NT have East Asian IMEs (such as Microsoft Pinyin IME and Microsoft Japanese IME) bundled, but files for East Asian languages may be manually installed on Control Panel.\n\n\nPlatform support\nWindows NT included support for several platforms before the x86-based personal computer became dominant in the professional world Windows NT 4.0 and its predecessors supported PowerPC, DEC Alpha and MIPS R4000 (although some of the platforms implement 64-bit computing, the OS treated them as 32-bit) Windows 2000 dropped support for all platforms, except the third generation x86 (known as IA-32) or newer in 32-bit mode The client line of the Windows NT family still ran on IA-32 up to Windows 10 [64] (the server line of the Windows NT family still ran on IA-32 up to Windows Server 2008).\n\n\nWindows CE\nWindows CE (officially known as Windows Embedded Compact), is an edition of Windows that runs on minimalistic computers, like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones Windows Embedded Compact is based on its own dedicated kernel, dubbed Windows CE kernel Microsoft licenses Windows CE to OEMs and device makers The OEMs and device makers can modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences, while Windows CE provides the technical foundation to do so.\n\n\nXbox OS\nXbox OS is an unofficial name given to the version of Windows that runs on Xbox consoles [73] From Xbox One onwards it is an implementation with an emphasis on virtualization (using Hyper-V) as it is three operating systems running at once, consisting of the core operating system, a second implemented for games and a more Windows-like environment for applications [74]\nMicrosoft updates Xbox One's OS every month, and these updates can be downloaded from the Xbox Live service to the Xbox and subsequently installed, or by using offline recovery images downloaded via a PC [75] It was originally based on NT 6.2 (Windows 8) kernel, and the latest version runs on an NT 10.0 base This system is sometimes referred to as \"Windows 10 on Xbox One\" [76] [77]\nXbox One and Xbox Series operating systems also allow limited (due to licensing restrictions and testing resources) backward compatibility with previous generation hardware, [78] and the Xbox 360's system is backwards compatible with the original Xbox [79]\n\n\nVersion control system\nUp to and including every version before Windows 2000, Microsoft used an in-house version control system named Source Library Manager (SLM) Shortly after Windows 2000 was released, Microsoft switched to a fork of Perforce named Source Depot [80] This system was used up until 2017 once the system could not keep up with the size of Windows [citation needed] Microsoft had begun to integrate Git into Team Foundation Server in 2013, [81] but Windows (and Office) continued to rely on Source Depot [82] The Windows code was divided among 65 different repositories with a kind of virtualization layer to produce unified view of all of the code [citation needed]\n\n\nVFSForGit\nBecause of its large, decades-long history, however, the Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the decentralized nature of Linux development that Git was originally created to manage [citation needed] Each Git repository contains a complete history of all the files, [85] which proved unworkable for Windows developers because cloning the whole repository takes several hours [citation needed] Microsoft has been working on a new project called the Virtual File System for Git (VFSForGit) to address these challenges [84]\n\n\nTimeline of releases\nVersion market share\nAs a percentage of desktop and laptop systems using Microsoft Windows, [90] according to StatCounter data as of October 2024 [91]:\n\n\nUsage share and device sales\nVersion market share\nAs a percentage of desktop and laptop systems using Microsoft Windows, [90] according to StatCounter data as of October 2024 [91]:\n\n\nSecurity\nEarly versions of Windows were designed at a time where malware and networking were less common, and had few built-in security features; they did not provide access privileges to allow a user to prevent other users from accessing their files, and they did not provide memory protection to prevent one process from reading or writing another process's address space or to prevent a process from code or data used by privileged-mode code.\n\n\nFile permissions\nAll Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as AGDLP (Accounts, Global, Domain Local, Permissions) in which file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members These global groups then hold other groups or users depending on different Windows versions used This system varies from other vendor products such as Linux and NetWare due to the 'static' allocation of permission being applied directly to the file or folder However using this process of AGLP/AGDLP/AGUDLP allows a small number of static permissions to be applied and allows for easy changes to the account groups without reapplying the file permissions on the files and folders.\n\n\nAlternative implementations\nOwing to the operating system's popularity, a number of applications have been released that aim to provide compatibility with Windows applications, either as a compatibility layer for another operating system, or as a standalone system that can run software written for Windows out of the box These include:\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The game was released on July 19, 2022, for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows.\n\n## Gameplay\n\nStray is an adventure game played by a single player in a third-person perspective. The player controls a stray cat, leaping across platforms and climbing up obstacles. The cat can open new paths by interacting with the environment, such as climbing in buckets, overturning paint cans, operating a vending machine, and clawing at objects. The player solves puzzles to progress the narrative, often involving moving obstacles. Optional activities include sleeping, meowing, and nuzzling up to non-player characters, most of which elicit a response. Some levels have open-world elements, allowing the player to roam at their freedom.\n\n## Plot\n\nThe game takes place in an abandoned facility where a group of four stray cats trek through the ruins. One of the cats becomes separated from the others after falling into a chasm leading to an unpopulated underground city. The cat finds a lab where it helps download an artificial intelligence into the body of a small drone, which calls itself B-12. B-12 explains it previously helped a scientist but much of its memory was corrupted and needs time to recover. B-12 promises to help the cat return to the surface and accompanies it further into the city. As they travel farther, the pair discover that, while the city is completely devoid of human life, their robotic servants, Companions, remain. With humans absent, the Companions have grown self-aware and have built their own society among the ruins of the city, but they likewise are trapped underground. The ruins are infested with Zurks, mutant bacteria that have evolved to devour both organic life and robots.\n\n## Development\n\nBlueTwelve Studio founders Koola and Viv began working on Stray in 2015 as they wanted to pursue an independent project after working at Ubisoft Montpellier.

From early in development, Koola and Viv knew they wanted to maintain a small team of developers, as they prefer working with direct communication. The small team meant the game's scope reduced over time, with focus directed towards elements the developers considered important. After revealing the game, the team wanted to focus on production and only begin marketing when development was nearing completion; they found the reception to the reveal added to the pressure of delivering a polished experience. The game uses Unreal Engine 4.\n\n## Release\n\nStray was announced on June 11, 2020, at PlayStation's Future of Gaming event, in development for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows.

At launch, it became available for PlayStation Plus's Extra, Deluxe, and Premium tier members.

Turner's great-grandfather was a Methodist missionary in China, where her father grew up. She has a sister, Susan, and two brothers. Turner's early life was marked by frequent moves, as her father's diplomatic career required the family to relocate to various parts of the world.\n\n**Career**\n\nTurner's entry into the entertainment industry began in the 1970s, when she spent the summer with her mother in Midland, Texas, at the Yucca Theater. It was there that she made history by being cast as the first female villain in the Summer Mummers 1973 melodrama, Plodding Among the Planets.\n\n**Theatre Work and Broadway Debut**\n\nTurner's early theater work laid the foundation for her future success.

Turner's subsequent collaboration with Michael Douglas and Danny DeVito in \"Romancing the Stone\" (1984) solidified her status as a leading lady. The film's success was followed by the sequel, \"The Jewel of the Nile\" (1985), which was marred by pre-production conflicts between Turner and Douglas.\n\n**Slowed by Rheumatoid Arthritis**\n\nTurner's career was impacted by rheumatoid arthritis, which restricted her activities in the early 1990s. She blamed her age, stating that when she was 40, the roles started slowing down, and she began receiving offers to play mothers and grandmothers.\n\n**Remission**\n\nThanks to newly available treatments, Turner's rheumatoid arthritis went into remission. She regained her vitality and continued to work in television, including three episodes of \"Friends,\" where she played Chandler Bing's father, a drag performer.\n\n**Voice Acting**\n\nTurner provided the voice of Jessica Rabbit in the 1988 live-action/animated film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" and its three animated short film spinoffs. She also voiced the character Constance in the animated film \"Monster House\" (2006).\n\n**Stage Career**\n\nAfter her theater debut in \"Private Lives\" in 1973, Turner went on to appear in various productions, including \"Indiscretions\" and \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.\" Her performance in the latter earned her a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress.

the role brought her to international prominence Empire cited the film in 1995 when it named her one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in Film History [22] The New York Times wrote in 2005 that, propelled by her \"jaw-dropping movie debut  [in] Body Heat .. she built a career on adventurousness and frank sexuality born of robust physicality\" [12] Turner ultimately became one of the top box-office draws, and most sought-after actresses of the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n\nStardom\nAfter Body Heat, Turner steered away from femme fatale roles to \"prevent typecasting\" and \"because femme fatale roles had a shelf-life\" Consequently, her first project after this was the 1983 comedy The Man With Two Brains Turner co-starred in Romancing the Stone with Michael Douglas and Danny DeVito Film critic Pauline Kael wrote of her performance as writer Joan Wilder, \"Turner knows how to use her dimples amusingly and how to dance like a woman who didn't know she could; her star performance is exhilarating.\" [25] Romancing the Stone was a surprise hit: she won a Golden Globe for her role in the film, and it became one of the top-ten-grossing movies of 1984 [26] Turner teamed with Douglas and DeVito again the following year for its sequel, The Jewel of the Nile Pre-production for the movie was fraught with conflict, because Turner refused to commit to the \"terrible\" script she had been delivered When she said no, 20th Century Fox threatened her with a US$25 million breach of contract lawsuit Eventually Douglas, also the film's producer, agreed to undertake rewrites on the script to make it more acceptable to Turner, which led to much back-and-forth between the two as the script was retooled right up to when shooting started in Fez, Morocco [27]\n\n\nSlowed by rheumatoid arthritis\nTurner remained an A-list film star leading lady in the early 1990s, starring in V.I Warshawski and Undercover Blues, until rheumatoid arthritis seriously restricted her activities She also blamed her age, stating, \"when I was 40, the roles started slowing down, I started getting offers to play mothers and grandmothers.\"\n\n\nRemission\nDespite drug therapy to help her condition, the disease progressed for about eight years Then, thanks to newly available treatments, her rheumatoid arthritis went into remission She was seen increasingly on television, including three episodes of Friends, where she appeared as Chandler Bing's father, a drag performer.\n\n\nVoice acting\nTurner provided the voice of Jessica Rabbit in the 1988 live action/animated film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, its three animated short film spinoffs, and in the Disneyland attraction spinoff, Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin In 2006, Turner voiced the character Constance in the animated film Monster House Later, she provided radio commercial voice-overs for Lay's potato chips BBC Radio 4 produced four radio dramas based on the V I Warshawski novels by Sara Paretsky Two of them, Killing Orders and Deadlock, released in 2007, featured Turner reprising her 1991 film role, which had been based on Paretsky's novel Deadlock; however, the final series, Bitter Medicine, released in 2009, had Sharon Gless take over the part [40] In 2015, she narrated the anthology drama film Emily & Tim Turner also had voice guest roles on the animated series King of the Hill, Family Guy, 3Below: Tales of Arcadia, Rick and Morty, Summer Camp Island, and Wizards: Tales of Arcadia.\n\n\nStage career\nAfter 1990s roles in Broadway productions of Indiscretions and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (for which she earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress), Turner moved to London in 2000 to star in a stage version of The Graduate The BBC reported that initially mediocre ticket sales for The Graduate \"went through the roof when it was announced that Turner, then aged 45, would appear naked on stage\" While her performance as the seductive Mrs Robinson was popular with audiences, with sustained high box office for the duration of Turner's run, she received mixed reviews from critics [41] The play transferred to Broadway in 2002 to similar critical reaction.\n\n\nPersonal life\nTurner married real estate entrepreneur Jay Weiss of New York City in 1984, and they had one daughter, singer Rachel Ann Weiss, who was born on October 14, 1987 Turner and Weiss divorced in December 2007, but Turner has said, \" [Jay]'s still my best friend.\" [51]\n\n\nActivism\nTurner has worked with Planned Parenthood of America since age 19, and later became a chairperson She also serves on the board of People for the American Way, and volunteers at Amnesty International and Citymeals-on-Wheels She was one of John Kerry's first celebrity endorsers She has been a frequent donor to the Democratic Party She has also worked to raise awareness of rheumatoid arthritis [52]\n\n\nMemoirs and interviews\nIn the mid-2000s, Turner collaborated with Gloria Feldt on the writing of her memoirs, Send Yourself Roses: Thoughts on My Life, Love, and Leading Roles The book was published in 2008 [53] [54] In the book, Turner claimed that, while they were filming Peggy Sue Got Married, her co-star Nicolas Cage had gotten drunk and stole a Chihuahua that he liked [55] In turn, Cage filed a lawsuit against Turner and her book publisher in the UK, who took an excerpt from the book and posted it on their website (before publication) [55] Cage argued defamation and damage to character and won the case, resulting in retractions, legal fees, and a donation to charity [55] Turner later publicly apologized [56] During an interview on The View, Turner apologized for any distress she might have caused Cage regarding an incident that took place 20 years earlier [57] [58]\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nFilm\n\n\nTelevision\n\n\nTheater\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nAccolades\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

a metaphor: \"Periander baked his bread in a cold oven.\" [9] Acts of necrophilia are depicted on ceramics from the Moche culture, which reigned in northern Peru from the first to eighth-century CE

claiming to have chosen secluded disposal sites for his victims' bodies specifically for post-mortem sexual intercourse [74]\n\n\nKaren Greenlee\nIn 1987, Karen Greenlee gave a detailed interview called \"The Unrepentant Necrophile\" for Jim Morton's (edited by Adam Parfrey) book Apocalypse Culture In this interview, she stated that she had a preference for younger men and was attracted to the smell of blood and death She considered necrophilia an addiction The interview was held in her apartment, which was a small studio filled with books, necrophilic drawings, and satanic adornments She also had written a confession letter in which she claimed to have abused 20–40 male corpses [75]\n\n\nDennis Nilsen\nDennis Nilsen (1945–2018) was a Scottish serial killer who had developed a connection between death and intimacy, later finding posing as a corpse a source of sexual arousal In 1978, Nilsen committed his first murder and sexually violated the victim's corpse, keeping the body for months before disposal Nilsen was reported to have sexually abused the corpses of various victims until his arrest [74]\n\n\nLegality\n\nNecrophilia is not explicitly mentioned in Australian

anger, curiosity, or lust rather than being driven by sexual necessity or habit In India, as of now, the Indian Penal Code (IPC) does not explicitly mention \"necrophilia\" as a distinct offense under the section that deals with sexual offenses However, the court's interpretation suggested that it could potentially fall under Section 297, which pertains to causing \"indignity to any human corpse\" when someone trespasses into a place used for funeral rites or storing the remains of the deceased Nevertheless, for an act to be considered an offense under Section 297, it must be accompanied by an intention to hurt someone's feelings or insult their religion Additionally, if it is known that such an act is likely to hurt someone's feelings or insult their religion, it can be punishable under Section 297  In the specific case discussed by the court, it concluded that the elements required under Section 297 were not present Therefore, the court stated that at most, it could be seen as sadism or necrophilia, but it did not qualify as an offense punishable under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code The court further recommended that the government amend the law accordingly

corpses of women, and another covers sexual intercourse, anal sex, and oral sex done on corpses Both proposals penalizes the act with fine and imprisonment [81]\n\n\nNew Zealand\nUnder Section 150 of New Zealand Crimes Act 1961, it is an offense for there to be \"misconduct in respect to human remains\" Subsection (b) elaborates that this applies if someone \"improperly or indecently interferes with or offers indignity to any dead human body or human remains, whether buried or not\" This statute is therefore applicable to sex with corpses and carries a potential two-year prison sentence,

He was sentenced to psychiatric care for that and other crimes, including arson [84]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nSexual penetration of a corpse was made illegal under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, carrying a

{"title": "Rudy_Giuliani", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nGiuliani was born on May 28, 1944, in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York City, which at the time of his birth was a largely Italian American enclave of Brooklyn He is the only child of working-class parents Helen (née D'Avanzo) and Harold Angelo Giuliani, both children of Italian immigrants [30]  Harold Giuliani, a plumber and a bartender, [31] had trouble holding a job, was convicted of felony assault and robbery, and served prison time in Sing Sing [32] Once released, his father worked as an enforcer for his brother-in-law Leo D'Avanzo, who operated an organized crime-affiliated loan sharking and gambling ring from a restaurant in Brooklyn [33]\n\n\nCareer\nGiuliani started his career and political life as a Democrat, working as a Democratic Party committeeman on Long Island in the mid-1960s In 1968, he volunteered for Robert F Kennedy's presidential campaign in the 1968 presidential election, [39] [40] and voted for George McGovern for president in the 1972 presidential election [41]\n\n\nU.S. associate deputy attorney general\nGiuliani switched his party registration from Democratic to Independent in 1975 [40] This occurred during a period of time in which he was recruited for a position in Washington, D.C., with the Ford administration: Giuliani served as the associate deputy attorney general and chief of staff to Deputy Attorney General Harold \"Ace\" Tyler [40]\n\n\nU.S. associate attorney general\nIn 1981, Giuliani was named associate attorney general in the Reagan administration, [46] the third-highest position in the Department of Justice As Associate Attorney General, Giuliani supervised the U.S Attorney Offices' federal law enforcement agencies, the Department of Corrections, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the United States Marshals Service In a well-publicized 1982 case, Giuliani testified in defense of the federal government's \"detention posture\" regarding the internment of more than 2,000 Haitian asylum seekers who had entered the country illegally The U.S government disputed the assertion that most of the detainees had fled their country due to political persecution, alleging instead that they were \"economic migrants\" In defense of the government's position, Giuliani testified that \"political repression, at least in general, does not exist\" under President of Haiti Jean-Claude Duvalier's regime [37] [47]\n\n\nU.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York\nIn 1983, Giuliani was appointed to be U.S Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which was technically a demotion but was sought by Giuliani because of his desire to personally litigate cases and because the SDNY is considered the highest-profile United States Attorney's Office in the country and as such is often used by those who have held the position as a springboard for running for public office It was in this position that he first gained national prominence by prosecuting numerous high-profile cases, resulting in the convictions of Wall Street figures Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken He also focused on prosecuting drug dealers, organized crime, and corruption in government [38] He amassed a record of 4,152 convictions and 25 reversals As a federal prosecutor, Giuliani was credited with bringing the perp walk, parading of suspects in front of the previously alerted media, into common use as a prosecutorial tool [48] After Giuliani \"patented the perp walk\", the tool was used by increasing numbers of prosecutors nationwide [49]\n\n\nMafia Commission trial\nIn the Mafia Commission Trial, which ran from February 25, 1985, through November 19, 1986, Giuliani indicted eleven organized crime figures, including the heads of New York City's so-called \"Five Families\", under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) on charges including extortion, labor racketeering, and murder for hire Time magazine called this \"case of cases\" possibly \"the most significant assault on the infrastructure of organized crime since the high command of the Chicago Mafia was swept away in 1943\", and quoted Giuliani's stated intention: \"Our approach is to wipe out the five families.\" [54] Gambino crime family boss Paul Castellano evaded conviction when he and his underboss Thomas Bilotti were murdered on the streets of midtown Manhattan on December 16, 1985 However, three heads of the Five Families were sentenced to 100 years in prison on January 13, 1987 [55] [56] Genovese and Colombo leaders, Tony Salerno and Carmine Persico, received additional sentences in separate trials, with 70-year and 39-year sentences to run consecutively He was assisted by three Assistant United States Attorneys: Michael Chertoff, the eventual second United States Secretary of Homeland Security and co-author of the Patriot Act; John Savarese, now a partner at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz; and Gil Childers, a later deputy chief of the criminal division for the Southern District of New York and now managing director in the legal department at Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nBoesky and Milken trials\nIvan Boesky, a Wall Street arbitrageur who had amassed a fortune of about $200 million by betting on corporate takeovers, was originally investigated by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders, leading the way for the US Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York to investigate as well These stock and options acquisitions were sometimes brazen, with massive purchases occurring only a few days before a corporation announced a takeover Although insider trading of this kind was illegal, laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until Boesky was prosecuted Boesky cooperated with the SEC and informed on several others, including junk bond trader Michael Milken Per agreement with Giuliani, Boesky received a 3+1⁄2-year prison sentence along with a $100 million fine [63] In 1989, Giuliani charged Milken under the RICO Act with 98 counts of racketeering and fraud In a highly publicized case, Milken was indicted by a grand jury on these charges [64]\n\n\nDisbarment\nIn June 2021, Giuliani had his license to practice law suspended in the state of New York, pending an investigation related to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election [65] [66] On July 2, 2024, he was disbarred in the state of New York [28] On September 26, 2024, he was disbarred in the District of Columbia under reciprocal discipline [67]\n\n\nMayoral campaigns\nGiuliani was U.S Attorney until January 1989, resigning as the Reagan administration ended He garnered criticism until he left office for his handling of cases and was accused of prosecuting cases to further his political ambitions [37] He joined the law firm White & Case in New York City as a partner He remained with White & Case until May 1990, when he joined the law firm Anderson Kill Olick & Oshinsky, also in New York City [68]\n\n\n1989\nGiuliani first ran for New York City mayor in 1989, when he attempted to unseat three-term incumbent Ed Koch He won the September 1989 Republican Party primary election against business magnate Ronald Lauder in a campaign marked by claims that Giuliani was not a true Republican after an acrimonious debate between the two men [69] In the Democratic primary, Koch was upset by Manhattan Borough president David Dinkins.\n\n\n1993\nFour years after his defeat to Dinkins, Giuliani again ran for mayor Once again, Giuliani also ran on the Liberal Party line but not the Conservative Party line, which ran activist George Marlin [74]\n\n\n1997\nGiuliani's opponent in 1997 was Democratic Manhattan Borough president Ruth Messinger, who had beaten Al Sharpton in the September 9, 1997, Democratic primary [85] In the general election, Giuliani once again had the Liberal Party and not the Conservative Party listing Giuliani ran an aggressive campaign, parlaying his image as a tough leader who had cleaned up the city Giuliani's popularity was at its highest point to date, with a late October 1997 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showing him as having a 68 percent approval rating; 70 percent of New Yorkers were satisfied with life in the city and 64 percent said things were better in the city compared to four years previously [86]\n\n\nMayoralty\nGiuliani served as mayor of New York City from 1994 to 2001.\n\n\nLaw enforcement\nIn Giuliani's first term as mayor, the New York City Police Department – at the instigation of Commissioner Bill Bratton – adopted an aggressive enforcement/deterrent strategy based on James Q Wilson's \"broken windows\" approach This involved crackdowns on relatively minor offenses such as graffiti, turnstile jumping, cannabis possession, and aggressive panhandling by \"squeegee men\", on the theory that this would send a message that order would be maintained [91] The legal underpinning for removing the \"squeegee men\" from the streets was developed under Giuliani's predecessor, Mayor David Dinkins Bratton, with Deputy Commissioner Jack Maple, also created and instituted CompStat, a computer-driven comparative statistical approach to mapping crime geographically and in terms of emerging criminal patterns, as well as charting officer performance by quantifying criminal apprehensions [92] Critics of the system assert that it creates an environment in which police officials are encouraged to underreport or otherwise manipulate crime data An extensive study found a high correlation between crime rates reported by the police through CompStat and rates of crime available from other sources, suggesting there had been no manipulation [93] The CompStat initiative won the 1996 Innovations in Government Award from Harvard Kennedy School [94]\n\n\nCity services\nThe Giuliani administration advocated the privatization of the city's public schools, which he called \"dysfunctional\", and the reduction of state funding for them He advocated a voucher-based system to promote private schooling [110] Giuliani supported protection for illegal immigrants He continued a policy of preventing city employees from contacting the Immigration and Naturalization Service about immigration violations, on the grounds that illegal aliens should be able to take actions such as sending their children to school or reporting crimes to the police without fear of deportation [111]\n\n\n2000 U.S. Senate campaign\nWith term limits, Giuliani was ineligible to run in 2001 for a third term as mayor In November 1998, four-term incumbent Democratic U.S Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement and Giuliani immediately indicated an interest in running in the 2000 election for the now-open seat Because of his high profile and visibility, Giuliani was supported by the state Republican Party Giuliani's entrance led Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel and others to recruit then-First Lady Hillary Clinton to run for Moynihan's seat, hoping she might combat his star power.\n\n\nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks\nGiuliani received nationwide attention in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks He made frequent appearances on radio and television on September 11 and afterwards – for example, to indicate that tunnels would be closed as a precautionary measure, and that there was no reason to believe the dispersion of chemical or biological weaponry into the air was a factor in the attack In his public statements, Giuliani said:\n\n\nResponse\nGiuliani received nationwide attention in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks He made frequent appearances on radio and television on September 11 and afterwards – for example, to indicate that tunnels would be closed as a precautionary measure, and that there was no reason to believe the dispersion of chemical or biological weaponry into the air was a factor in the attack In his public statements, Giuliani said:\n\n\nCriticism and communications problems\nGiuliani has been widely criticized for his decision to locate the Office of Emergency Management headquarters on the 23rd floor inside the 7 World Trade Center building Those opposing the decision perceived the office as a target for a terrorist attack in light of the previous terrorist attack against the World Trade Center in 1993 [125] [126] [127] The office was unable to coordinate efforts between police and firefighters properly while evacuating its headquarters [128] Large tanks of diesel fuel were placed in 7 World Trade to power the command center In May 1997, Giuliani put responsibility for selecting the location on Jerome M Hauer, who had served under Giuliani from 1996 to 2000 before being appointed by him as New York City's first director of emergency management Hauer has taken exception to that account in interviews and provided Fox News and New York Magazine with a memo demonstrating that he recommended a location in Brooklyn but was overruled by Giuliani Television journalist Chris Wallace interviewed Giuliani on May 13, 2007, about his 1997 decision to locate the command center at the World Trade Center Giuliani laughed during Wallace's questions and said that Hauer recommended the World Trade Center site and that Hauer said the WTC site was the best location Wallace presented Giuliani a photocopy of Hauer's directive letter The letter urged Giuliani to locate the command center in Brooklyn, instead of lower Manhattan [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] The February 1996 memo read, \"The  [Brooklyn] building is secure and not as visible a target as buildings in Lower Manhattan.\" [134]\n\n\nPublic reaction\nGiuliani gained international attention after the attacks and was widely hailed for his leadership role [144] Polls taken just six weeks after the attack showed a 79 percent approval rating among New York City voters This was a dramatic increase over the 36 percent rating he had received a year earlier, which was an average at the end of a two-term mayorship [145] [146] Oprah Winfrey called him \"America's Mayor\" at a 9/11 memorial service held at Yankee Stadium on September 23, 2001 [124] [147]\n\n\nTime Person of the Year\nOn December 24, 2001, [152] Time magazine named Giuliani its Person of the Year for 2001 [117] Time observed that, before 9/11, Giuliani's public image had been that of a rigid, self-righteous, ambitious politician After 9/11, and perhaps owing also to his bout with prostate cancer, his public image became that of a man who could be counted on to unite a city in the midst of its greatest crisis Historian Vincent J Cannato concluded in September 2006:\n\n\nAftermath\nFor his leadership on and after September 11, Giuliani was given an honorary knighthood (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II on February 13, 2002 [154]\n\n\nPost-mayoralty political career\nSince leaving office as mayor, Giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for Republican candidates for political offices at all levels When George Pataki became governor in 1995, this represented the first time the positions of both mayor and governor were held simultaneously by Republicans since John Lindsay and Nelson Rockefeller Giuliani and Pataki were instrumental in bringing the 2004 Republican National Convention to New York City [162] He was a speaker at the convention, and endorsed President George W Bush for re-election by recalling that immediately after the World Trade Center towers fell,\n\n\nBefore 2008 election\nSince leaving office as mayor, Giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for Republican candidates for political offices at all levels When George Pataki became governor in 1995, this represented the first time the positions of both mayor and governor were held simultaneously by Republicans since John Lindsay and Nelson Rockefeller Giuliani and Pataki were instrumental in bringing the 2004 Republican National Convention to New York City [162] He was a speaker at the convention, and endorsed President George W Bush for re-election by recalling that immediately after the World Trade Center towers fell,\n\n\n2008 presidential campaign\nIn November 2006, Giuliani announced the formation of an exploratory committee toward a run for the presidency in 2008 In February 2007, he filed a \"statement of candidacy\" and confirmed on the television program Larry King Live that he was indeed running [186]\n\n\nAfter 2008 election\nFollowing the end of his presidential campaign, Giuliani's \"high appearance fees dropped like a stone\" [207] He returned to work at both Giuliani Partners and Bracewell & Giuliani [208] His consultancy work included advising Keiko Fujimori with her presidential campaign during the 2011 Peruvian general election [209] Giuliani also explored hosting a syndicated radio show, and was reported to be in talks with Westwood One about replacing Bill O'Reilly before that position went to Fred Thompson (another unsuccessful 2008 GOP presidential primary candidate) [210] [211] In 2009, Giuliani said the Obama administration and U.S Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner lacked executive competence in dealing with the 2007–2008 financial crisis [212]\n\n\nRelationship with Donald Trump\nGiuliani supported Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S presidential election He gave a prime time speech during the first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention [229] Earlier in the day, Giuliani and former 2016 presidential candidate Ben Carson appeared at an event for the pro-Trump Great America PAC [230] Giuliani also appeared in a Great America PAC ad entitled \"Leadership\" [231] Giuliani's and Jeff Sessions' appearances were staples at Trump campaign rallies [232]\n\n\nPresidential campaign supporter\nGiuliani supported Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S presidential election He gave a prime time speech during the first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention [229] Earlier in the day, Giuliani and former 2016 presidential candidate Ben Carson appeared at an event for the pro-Trump Great America PAC [230] Giuliani also appeared in a Great America PAC ad entitled \"Leadership\" [231] Giuliani's and Jeff Sessions' appearances were staples at Trump campaign rallies [232]\n\n\nAdvisor to the president\nThe president-elect named Giuliani his informal cybersecurity adviser on January 12, 2017 [242] The status of this informal role for Giuliani is unclear because, in November 2018, Trump created the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), headed by Christopher Krebs as director and Matthew Travis as deputy In the weeks following his appointment, Giuliani was forced to consult an Apple Store Genius Bar when he \"was locked out of his iPhone because he had forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong one at least 10 times\", belying his putative expertise in the field [243]\n\n\nPersonal lawyer\nIn mid April 2018, Giuliani joined Trump's legal team, which dealt with the special counsel investigation by Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S elections Giuliani said his goal was to negotiate a swift end to the investigation [246]\n\n\nAttempts to get Ukraine to carry out investigations\nSince at least May 2019, Giuliani has been urging Ukraine's newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate the oil company Burisma, whose board of directors once included Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden, [276] and to check for irregularities in Ukraine's investigation of Paul Manafort He said such investigations would benefit his client's defense, and that his efforts had Trump's full support [277] Toward this end, Giuliani met with Ukrainian officials throughout 2019 [278] [279] [280] In July 2019, Buzzfeed News reported that two Soviet-born Americans, Lev Parnas [281] and Igor Fruman, were liaisons between Giuliani and Ukrainian government officials in this effort Parnas and Fruman, prolific Republican donors, have neither registered as foreign agents in the United States, nor been evaluated and approved by the State Department [282] Giuliani responded, \"This (report) is a pathetic effort to cover up what are enormous allegations of criminality by the Biden family.\" [283] Yet by September 2019, there had been no clear evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens [284]\n\n\n2020 election lawsuits\nIn November 2020, Trump placed Giuliani in charge of lawsuits related to alleged voter irregularities in the 2020 United States presidential election [357] On November 7, Giuliani gave a press conference at Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Philadelphia to discuss challenging the vote count in Pennsylvania, during which media networks called the presidential election for Biden [358]  Trump designated Giuliani to lead a legal team to challenge the election results, telling Giuliani to \"go wild\" and \"do anything you want\" in his efforts to overturn them [359] This team – a self-described \"elite strike force\" that included Sidney Powell, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, and Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis  [360] [361] – appeared at a November 19 press conference in which they made numerous false and unsubstantiated assertions revolving around an international Communist conspiracy, rigged voting machines, and polling place fraud [20] [362] [363] [364] [365]\n\n\nPennsylvania lawsuit\nOne early lawsuit sought to invalidate up to 700,000 mail-in ballots and stop Pennsylvania from certifying its election results [371] Giuliani said he had signed affidavits attesting to voter fraud and election official misconduct in Pennsylvania and elsewhere [372] Despite not having argued a case in any courtroom for over three decades, [373] Giuliani applied for special permission to represent the Trump presidential campaign in the federal court of Pennsylvania In doing so, Giuliani misrepresented his status with the District of Columbia Bar in his application by stating that he was a member of the bar in good standing, when in fact the District of Columbia had suspended him for nonpayment of fees [371] In his first day in court on the case, which was November 17, 2020, Giuliani struggled with rudimentary legal processes and was accused by lawyers for the Pennsylvania Secretary of State of making legal arguments that were \"disgraceful in an American courtroom\" [374] Judge Matthew Brann questioned how Giuliani could justify \"asking this court to invalidate some 6.8 million votes thereby disenfranchising every single voter in the commonwealth.\" [375]\n\n\nDominion and Smartmatic lawsuits\nAs part of Giuliani's allegations that voting machines had been rigged, he made several false assertions about two rival companies, Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic These false claims included that Smartmatic owned Dominion; that Dominion voting machines used Smartmatic software; that Dominion voting machines sent vote data to Smartmatic at foreign locations; that Dominion was founded by the former socialist Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez; and that Dominion is a \"radical-left\" company with connections to antifa [382] [383]\n\n\nJudgment for defaming Georgia election workers\nIn December 2021, two Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea' ArShaye Moss, sued Giuliani in DC for defamation, [394] [395] after Giuliani falsely accused them of manipulating vote tallies [396] He has accused them of \"passing around USB ports as if they were vials of heroin or cocaine\" and engaging in \"surreptitious illegal activity,\" citing video footage that, according to Moss, actually showed the women with \"a ginger mint\" [397] Moss testified before the United States House of Representatives that after Giuliani's remarks she and her family were subjected to a barrage of racist threats, including \"Be glad it's 2020 and not 1920,\" in reference to lynching in the United States [398]\n\n\nAttack on the Capitol\nOn January 6, 2021, Giuliani spoke at a \"Save America March\" rally on the Ellipse that was attended by Trump supporters protesting the election results He repeated conspiracy theories that voting machines used in the election were \"crooked\" and called for \"trial by combat\", [436] which he claimed after the riot had not been a call to violence but a reference to Game of Thrones [437] [438] [439] Trump supporters subsequently stormed the U.S Capitol in a riot that resulted in the deaths of four people, [440] and temporarily disrupted the counting of the Electoral College vote [441]\n\n\nIndictments\nOn August 1, 2023, the Justice Department's special counsel investigating Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election charged Trump with four criminal counts related to those efforts [459] News reports widely identified Rudy Giuliani as the unnamed \"Co-Conspirator 1\" (of six) mentioned at least 46 times in the 45-page indictment [460] [461] [462] In a statement, Giuliani's lawyer, Robert J Costello, acknowledged that it “appears that Mayor Giuliani is alleged to be co-conspirator No 1.” [459]\n\n\nSuspension of law license and New York disbarment\nOn June 24, 2021, a New York appellate court suspended Giuliani's law license The panel of five justices found that there was \"uncontroverted\" evidence that Giuliani made \"demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers and the public\" and that \"These false statements were made to improperly bolster (Giuliani's) narrative that due to widespread voter fraud, victory in the 2020 United States presidential election was stolen from his client.\" [65] [475] [476] The court concluded that Giuliani's conduct \"immediately threatens the public interest and warrants interim suspension from the practice of law\" [65] [475] [476] His license was also suspended in Washington, D.C., on July 7, 2021 [477]\n\n\nEthics charges for baseless claims in favor of Trump\nOn June 10, 2022, the DC Bar's Office of Disciplinary Counsel [480] filed charges with the DC Court of Appeals' Board on Professional Responsibility [481] against Giuliani The ethics charges say that Giuliani's federal court filings regarding the 2020 presidential election in Pennsylvania contained baseless claims in favor of Trump [482]\n\n\nSupermarket incident\nOn June 27, 2022, Giuliani appeared at ShopRite, a supermarket in Staten Island, campaigning on behalf of his son Andrew, who was attempting to become the Republican nominee for governor of New York [488] [489] After Giuliani's appearance, a 39-year-old supermarket employee, Daniel Gill, was arrested and charged with second-degree assault for allegedly slapping Giuliani's back in the store [488] Giuliani responded publicly that it was like \"a boulder hit me\" or \"like somebody shot me\"; \"it hurt tremendously\" [490] [491] [492] Giuliani further stated that the \"very, very heavy shot\" by Gill caused him to stumble and \"could've easily .. knocked me to the ground and killed me by my head getting hit\", and called for Gill's firing and prosecution [488] The Legal Aid Society, representing Gill, asserted that Giuliani had exaggerated the severity of the slap in order to garner greater amounts of attention from the media: \"Our client merely patted Mr Giuliani, who sustained nothing remotely resembling physical injuries, without malice to simply get his attention, as the video footage clearly showed,\" the Legal Aid Society stated in a press release [493]\n\n\nSexual assault and misconduct allegations\nOn May 15, 2023, Noelle Dunphy, a former off-the-books employee of Giuliani, filed a civil lawsuit against him [498] She accused Giuliani of sexual assault, wage theft and unlawful abuse of power [499] Dunphy claimed that sexually satisfying Giuliani was an \"absolute requirement\" of her job; [498] the complaint also said that Giuliani \"often made outrageous comments that created and added to the hostile work environment that Ms Dunphy was forced to endure,\" and that he was constantly under the effects of alcohol [500] The lawsuit further alleges Giuliani complained about \"'freakin Arabs' and Jews,\" and \"implied that  [Jewish men's] penises were inferior due to 'natural selection.'\" [501] The lawsuit also alleges that Giuliani and Donald Trump sold pardons for $2 million apiece [502]\n\n\nOther legal issues\nIn September 2023, law firm Davidoff Hutcher & Citron sued Giuliani for over $1.3 million in unpaid legal fees The firm alleged that Giuliani had paid only $214,000 of his total legal bill between November 2019 and July 2023 Giuliani said in a statement that the firm's bill \"is way in excess to anything approaching legitimate fees.\" [506] [507] [508]\n\n\nOther post-mayoral ventures\nAfter leaving the New York City mayor's office, Giuliani founded a security consulting business, Giuliani Partners LLC, in 2002, a firm that has been categorized by multiple media outlets as a lobbying entity capitalizing on Giuliani's name recognition, [517] [518] and which has been the subject of allegations surrounding staff hired by Giuliani and due to the firm's chosen client base [519] Over five years, Giuliani Partners earned more than $100 million [519]\n\n\nGiuliani Partners\nAfter leaving the New York City mayor's office, Giuliani founded a security consulting business, Giuliani Partners LLC, in 2002, a firm that has been categorized by multiple media outlets as a lobbying entity capitalizing on Giuliani's name recognition, [517] [518] and which has been the subject of allegations surrounding staff hired by Giuliani and due to the firm's chosen client base [519] Over five years, Giuliani Partners earned more than $100 million [519]\n\n\nBracewell & Giuliani\nIn 2005, Giuliani joined the law firm of Bracewell & Patterson LLP (renamed Bracewell & Giuliani LLP) as a name partner and basis for the expanding firm's new New York office [522] When he joined the Texas-based firm he brought Marc Mukasey, the son of Attorney General Michael Mukasey, into the firm.\n\n\nGreenberg Traurig\nIn January 2016, Giuliani moved to the law firm Greenberg Traurig, where he served as the global chairman for Greenberg's cybersecurity and crisis management group, as well as a senior advisor to the firm's executive chairman [527] He took an unpaid leave of absence in April 2018 when he joined Trump's legal defense team [528] He resigned from the firm on May 9, 2018 [529]\n\n\nLobbying in Romania\nIn August 2018, Giuliani was retained by Freeh Group International Solutions, a global consulting firm run by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, which paid him a fee to lobby Romanian president Klaus Iohannis to change Romania's anti-corruption policy and reduce the role of the National Anticorruption Directorate Giuliani argued that the anti-corruption efforts had gone too far [530] [531]\n\n\nPodcast\nGiuliani launched a podcast, Rudy Giuliani's Common Sense, in January 2020 [532] [533]\n\n\nTelevision appearances\nGiuliani was reportedly revealed to be the first unmasking on the seventh season of The Masked Singer, which caused judges Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke to leave the set in disgust [534] Giuliani actually turned out to be the ninth unmasking as \"Jack in the Box\" of Team Bad He mentioned that he partook in this show to do it for his newborn granddaughter It was during his unmasked performance of George Thorogood's \"Bad to the Bone\" when Jeong walked off [535] [536]\n\n\nPersonal life\nGiuliani married Regina Peruggi, his second cousin, whom he had known since childhood, on October 26, 1968 The marriage was in trouble by the mid-1970s and they agreed to a trial separation in 1975 [537] Peruggi did not accompany him to Washington when he accepted the job in the Attorney General's Office [37] Giuliani met local television personality Donna Hanover sometime in 1982, and they began dating when she was working in Miami Giuliani filed for legal separation from Peruggi on August 12, 1982 [537] The Giuliani-Peruggi marriage legally ended in two ways: a civil divorce was issued by the end of 1982, [538] while a Roman Catholic church annulment of the marriage was granted at the end of 1983, [537] reportedly because Giuliani had discovered that he and Peruggi were second cousins [539] [540] Alan Placa, Giuliani's best man, later became a priest and helped secure the annulment Giuliani and Peruggi had no children [541]\n\n\nMarriages and relationships\nGiuliani married

not accompany him to Washington when he accepted the job in the Attorney General's Office [37] Giuliani met local television personality Donna Hanover sometime in 1982, and they began dating when she was working in Miami Giuliani filed for legal separation from Peruggi on August 12, 1982 [537] The Giuliani-Peruggi marriage legally ended in two ways: a civil divorce was issued by the end of 1982, [538] while a Roman Catholic church annulment of the marriage was granted at the end of 1983, [537] reportedly because Giuliani had discovered that he and Peruggi were second cousins [539] [540] Alan

screening PSA [571] Giuliani would go on to make a full recovery, becoming a spokesman for cancer survivors [572]\n\n\nReligious beliefs\nGiuliani has declined to comment publicly on his religious practice and beliefs, although he identifies religion as an important part of his life When asked if he is a practicing Catholic, Giuliani answered, \"My religious affiliation, my religious practices

York City from 1994 to 2001. He is a prominent figure in American politics, known for his leadership during the September 11 attacks and his involvement in various high-profile cases as a federal prosecutor.\n\nEarly Life and Education\nGiuliani was born on May 28, 1944, in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York City. He is the only child of working-class parents Helen (née D'Avanzo) and Harold Angelo Giuliani, both children of Italian immigrants. Harold Giuliani, a plumber and a bartender, had trouble holding a job, was convicted of felony assault and robbery, and served prison time in Sing Sing. Once released, his father worked as an enforcer for his brother-in-law Leo D'Avanzo, who operated an organized crime-affiliated loan sharking and gambling ring from a restaurant in Brooklyn.\n\nCareer\nGiuliani started his career and political life as a Democrat, working as a Democratic Party committeeman on Long Island in the mid-1960s. In 1968, he volunteered for Robert F Kennedy's presidential campaign in the 1968 presidential election, and voted for George McGovern for president in the 1972 presidential election. Giuliani switched his party registration from Democratic to Independent in 1975, which occurred during a period of time in which he was recruited for a position in Washington, D.C., with the Ford administration: Giuliani served as the associate deputy attorney general and chief of staff to Deputy Attorney General Harold \"Ace\" Tyler.\n\nU.S. Associate Attorney General\nIn 1981, Giuliani was named associate attorney general in the Reagan administration, the third-highest position in the Department of Justice. As Associate Attorney General, Giuliani supervised the U.S Attorney Offices' federal law enforcement agencies, the Department of Corrections, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the United States Marshals Service. In a well-publicized 1982 case, Giuliani testified in defense of the federal government's \"detention posture\" regarding the internment of more than 2,000 Haitian asylum seekers who had entered the country illegally. The U.S government disputed the assertion that most of the detainees had fled their country due to political persecution, alleging instead that they were \"economic migrants\" In defense of the government's position, Giuliani testified that \"political repression, at least in general, does not exist\" under President of Haiti Jean-Claude Duvalier's regime.\n\nU.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York\nIn 1983, Giuliani was appointed to be U.S Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which was technically a demotion but was sought by Giuliani because of his desire to personally litigate cases and because the SDNY is considered the highest-profile United States Attorney's Office in the country and as such is often used by those who have held the position as a springboard for running for public office. It was in this position that he first gained national prominence by prosecuting numerous high-profile cases, resulting in the convictions of Wall Street figures Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken He amassed a record of 4,152 convictions and 25 reversals As a federal prosecutor, Giuliani was credited with bringing the perp walk, parading of suspects in front of the previously alerted media, into common use as a prosecutorial tool.\n\nMafia Commission Trial\nIn the Mafia Commission Trial, which ran from February 25, 1985, through November 19, 1986, Giuliani indicted eleven organized crime figures, including the heads of New York City's so-called \"Five Families\", under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) on charges including extortion, labor racketeering, and murder for hire Time magazine called this \"case of cases\" possibly \"the most significant assault on the infrastructure of organized crime since the high command of the Chicago Mafia was swept away in 1943\", and quoted Giuliani's stated intention: \"Our approach is to wipe out the five families.\" Gambino crime family boss Paul Castellano evaded conviction when he and his underboss Thomas Bilotti were murdered on the streets of midtown Manhattan on December 16, 1985 However, three heads of the Five Families were sentenced to 100 years in prison on January 13, 1987 Genovese and Colombo leaders, Tony Salerno and Carmine Persico, received additional sentences in separate trials, with 70-year and 39-year sentences to run consecutively.\n\nBoesky and Milken Trials\nIvan Boesky, a Wall Street arbitrageur who had amassed a fortune of about $200 million by betting on corporate takeovers, was originally investigated by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders, leading the way for the US Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York to investigate as well These stock and options acquisitions were sometimes brazen, with massive purchases occurring only a few days before a corporation announced a takeover Although insider trading of this kind was illegal, laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until Boesky was prosecuted Boesky cooperated with the SEC and informed on several others, including junk bond trader Michael Milken Per agreement with Giuliani, Boesky received a 3+1⁄2-year prison sentence along with a $100 million fine In 1989, Giuliani charged Milken under the RICO Act with 98 counts of racketeering and fraud In a highly publicized case, Milken was indicted by a grand jury on these charges.\n\nDisbarment\nIn June 2021, Giuliani had his license to practice law suspended in the state of New York, pending an investigation related to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election On July 2, 2021, he was disbarred in the state of New York On September 26, 2021, he was disbarred in the District of Columbia under reciprocal discipline.\n\nMayoral Campaigns\nGiuliani was U.S Attorney until January 1989, resigning as the Reagan administration ended He garnered criticism until he left office for his handling of cases and was accused of prosecuting cases to further his political ambitions He joined the law firm White & Case in New York City as a partner He remained with White & Case until May 1990, when he joined the law firm Anderson Kill Olick & Olick, also in New York City.\n\n1989\nGiuliani first ran for New York City mayor in 1989, when he attempted to unseat three-term incumbent Ed Koch He won the September 1989 Republican Party primary election against business magnate Ronald Lauder in a campaign marked by claims that Giuliani was not a true Republican after an acrimonious debate between the two men In the Democratic primary, Koch was upset by Manhattan Borough president David Dinkins.\n\n1993\nFour years after his defeat to Dinkins, Giuliani again ran for mayor Once again, Giuliani also ran on the Liberal Party line but not the Conservative Party line, which ran activist George Marlin.\n\n1997\nGiuliani's opponent in 1997 was Democratic Manhattan Borough president Ruth Messinger, who had beaten Al Sharpton in the September 9, 1997, Democratic primary In the general election, Giuliani once again had the Liberal Party and not the Conservative Party listing Giuliani ran an aggressive campaign, parlaying his image as a tough leader who had cleaned up the city Giuliani's popularity was at its highest point to date, with a late October 1997 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showing him as having a 68 percent approval rating; 70 percent of New Yorkers were satisfied with life in the city and 64 percent said things were better in the city compared to four years previously.\n\nMayoralty\nGiuliani served as mayor of New York City from 1994 to 2001.\n\nLaw Enforcement\nIn Giuliani's first term as mayor, the New York City Police Department, at the instigation of Commissioner Bill Bratton, adopted an aggressive enforcement/deterrent strategy based on James Q Wilson's \"broken windows\" approach This involved crackdowns on relatively minor offenses such as graffiti, turnstile jumping, cannabis possession, and aggressive panhandling by \"squeegee men\", on the theory that this would send a message that order would be maintained The legal underpinning for removing the \"squeegee men\" from the streets was developed under Giuliani's predecessor, Mayor David Dinkins Bratton, with Deputy Commissioner Jack Maple, also created and instituted CompStat, a computer-driven comparative statistical approach to mapping crime geographically and in terms of emerging criminal patterns, as well as charting officer performance by quantifying criminal apprehensions Critics of the system assert that it creates an environment in which police officials are encouraged to underreport or otherwise manipulate crime data An extensive study found a high correlation between crime rates reported by the police through CompStat and rates of crime available from other sources, suggesting there had been no manipulation The CompStat initiative won the 1996 Innovations in Government Award from Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nCity Services\nThe Giuliani administration advocated the privatization of the city's public schools, which he called \"dysfunctional\", and the reduction of state funding for them Giuliani supported protection for illegal immigrants He continued a policy of preventing city employees from contacting the Immigration and Naturalization Service about immigration violations, on the grounds that illegal aliens should be able to take actions such as sending their children to school or reporting crimes to the police without fear of deportation.\n\n2000 U.S. Senate Campaign\nWith term limits, Giuliani was ineligible to run in 2001 for a third term as mayor In November 1998, four-term incumbent Democratic U.S Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement and Giuliani immediately indicated an interest in running in the 2000 election for the now-open seat Because of his high profile and visibility, Giuliani was supported by the state Republican Party Giuliani's entrance led Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel and others to recruit then-First Lady Hillary Clinton to run for Moynihan's seat, hoping she might combat his star power.\n\nSeptember 11 Terrorist Attacks\nGiuliani received nationwide attention in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks He made frequent appearances on radio and television on September 11 and afterwards, for example, to indicate that tunnels would be closed as a precautionary measure, and that there was no reason to believe the dispersion of chemical or biological weaponry into the air was a factor in the attack In his public statements, Giuliani said \"the city will come back stronger than it was before\" and \"We will rebuild this city.\"\n\nResponse\nGiuliani received nationwide attention in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks He made frequent appearances on radio and television on September 11 and afterwards, for example, to indicate that tunnels would be closed as a precautionary measure, and that there was no reason to believe the dispersion of chemical or biological weaponry into the air was a factor in the attack In his public statements, Giuliani said \"the city will come back stronger than it was before\" and \"We will rebuild this city.\"\n\nCriticism and Communications Problems\nGiuliani has been widely criticized for his decision to locate the Office of Emergency Management headquarters on the 23rd floor inside the 7 World Trade Center building Those opposing the decision perceived the office as a target for a terrorist attack in light of the previous terrorist attack against the World Trade Center in 1993 The office was unable to coordinate efforts between police and firefighters properly while evacuating its headquarters Large tanks of diesel fuel were placed in 7 World Trade to power the command center In May 1997, Giuliani put responsibility for selecting the location on Jerome M Hauer, who had served under Giuliani from 1996 to 2000 before being appointed by him as New York City's first director of emergency management Hauer has taken exception to that account in interviews and provided Fox News and New York Magazine with a memo demonstrating that he recommended a location in Brooklyn but was overruled by Giuliani Television journalist Chris Wallace interviewed Giuliani on May 13, 2007, about his 1997 decision to locate the command center at the World Trade Center Giuliani laughed during Wallace's questions and said that Hauer recommended the World Trade Center site and that Hauer said the WTC site was the best location Wallace presented Giuliani a photocopy of Hauer's directive letter The letter urged Giuliani to locate the command center in Brooklyn, instead of lower Manhattan The February 1996 memo read, \"The building is secure and not as visible a target as buildings in Lower Manhattan.\"\n\nPublic Reaction\nGiuliani gained international attention after the attacks and was widely hailed for his leadership role Polls taken just six weeks after the attack showed a 79 percent approval rating among New York City voters This was a dramatic increase over the 36 percent rating he had received a year earlier, which was an average at the end of a two-term mayoralty Oprah Winfrey called him \"America's Mayor\" at a 9/11 memorial service held at Yankee Stadium on September 23, 2001 Time magazine named Giuliani its Person of the Year for 2001.\n\nTime Person of the Year\nOn December 24, 2001, Time magazine named Giuliani its Person of the Year for 2001 Time observed that, before 9/11, Giuliani's public image had been that of a rigid, self-righteous, ambitious politician After 9/11, and perhaps owing also to his bout with prostate cancer, his public image became that of a man who could be counted on to unite a city in the midst of its greatest crisis Historian Vincent J Cannato concluded in September 2006, \"Giuliani's leadership during the crisis had a profound impact on the public's perception of him, transforming him from a polarizing figure into a unifying one.\"\n\nAftermath\nFor his leadership on and after September 11, Giuliani was given an honorary knighthood (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II on February 13, 2002.\n\nPost-Mayoralty Political Career\nSince leaving office as mayor, Giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for Republican candidates for political offices at all levels When George Pataki became governor in 1995, this represented the first time the positions of both mayor and governor were held simultaneously by Republicans since John Lindsay and Nelson Rockefeller Giuliani and Pataki were instrumental in bringing the 2004 Republican National Convention to New York City He was a speaker at the convention, and endorsed President George W Bush for re-election by recalling that immediately after the World Trade Center towers fell, he had become convinced that \"the government had to be taken over by the Republicans.\"\n\nBefore 2008 Election\nSince leaving office as mayor, Giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for Republican candidates for political offices at all levels When George Pataki became governor in 1995, this represented the first time the positions of both mayor and governor were held simultaneously by Republicans since John Lindsay and Nelson Rockefeller Giuliani and Pataki were instrumental in bringing the 2004 Republican National Convention to New York City He was a speaker at the convention, and endorsed President George W Bush for re-election by recalling that immediately after the World Trade Center towers fell, he had become convinced that \"the government had to be taken over by the Republicans.\"\n\n2008 Presidential Campaign\nIn November 2006, Giuliani announced the formation of an exploratory committee toward a run for the presidency in 2008 In February 2007, he filed a \"statement of candidacy\" and confirmed on the television program Larry King Live that he was indeed running.\n\nAfter 2008 Election\nFollowing the end of his presidential campaign, Giuliani's \"high appearance fees dropped like a stone\" He returned to work at both Giuliani Partners and Bracewell & Giuliani He explored hosting a syndicated radio show, and was reported to be in talks with Westwood One about replacing Bill O'Reilly before that position went to Fred Thompson He also advised Keiko Fujimori with her presidential campaign during the 2011 Peruvian general election.\n\nRelationship with Donald Trump\nGiuliani supported Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S presidential election He gave a prime time speech during the first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention Earlier in the day, Giuliani and former 2016 presidential candidate Ben Carson appeared at an event for the pro-Trump Great America PAC Giuliani also appeared in a Great America PAC ad entitled \"Leadership\" Giuliani's and Jeff Sessions' appearances were staples at Trump campaign rallies.\n\nAdvisor to the President\nThe president-elect named Giuliani his informal cybersecurity adviser on January 12, 2017 The status of this informal role for Giuliani is unclear because, in November 2018, Trump created the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), headed by Christopher Krebs as director and Matthew Travis as deputy In the weeks following his appointment, Giuliani was forced to consult an Apple Store Genius Bar when he \"was locked out of his iPhone because he had forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong one at least 10 times\", belying his putative expertise in the field.\n\nPersonal Lawyer\nIn mid-April 2018, Giuliani joined Trump's legal team, which dealt with the special counsel investigation by Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S elections Giuliani said his goal was to negotiate a swift end to the investigation.\n\nAttempts to Get Ukraine to Carry Out Investigations\nSince at least May 2019, Giuliani has been urging Ukraine's newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate the oil company Burisma, whose board of directors once included Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden, He said such investigations would benefit his client's defense, and that his efforts had Trump's full support Toward this end, Giuliani met with Ukrainian officials throughout 2019 Two Soviet-born Americans, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were revealed to be the liaisons between Giuliani and Ukrainian government officials Buzzfeed News reported that Parnas and Fruman were not registered as foreign agents in the United States, and had not been evaluated and approved by the State Department Giuliani responded, \"This (report) is a pathetic effort to cover up what are enormous allegations of criminality by the Biden family.\"\n\n2020 Election Lawsuits\nIn November 2020, Trump placed Giuliani in charge of lawsuits related to alleged voter irregularities in the 2020 United States presidential election On November 7, Giuliani gave a press conference at Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Philadelphia to discuss challenging the vote count in Pennsylvania, during which media networks called the presidential election for Biden Trump designated Giuliani to lead a legal team to challenge the election results, telling Giuliani to \"go wild\" and \"do anything you want\" in his efforts to overturn them This team, a self-described \"elite strike force\" that included Sidney Powell, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, and Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis, appeared at a November 19 press conference in which they made numerous false and unsubstantiated assertions revolving around an international Communist conspiracy, rigged voting machines, and polling place fraud.\n\nPennsylvania Lawsuit\nOne early lawsuit sought to invalidate up to 700,000 mail-in ballots and stop Pennsylvania from certifying its election results Giuliani said he had signed affidavits attesting to voter fraud and election official misconduct in Pennsylvania and elsewhere Despite not having argued a case in any courtroom for over three decades, Giuliani applied for special permission to represent the Trump presidential campaign in the federal court of Pennsylvania In doing so, Giuliani misrepresented his status with the District of Columbia Bar in his application by stating that he was a member of the bar in good standing, when in fact the District of Columbia had suspended him for nonpayment of fees In his first day in court on the case, which was November 17, 2020, Giuliani struggled with rudimentary legal processes and was accused by lawyers for the Pennsylvania Secretary of State of making legal arguments that were \"disgraceful", "prompt": "Write a

Savarese, now a partner at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz; and Gil Childers, a later deputy chief of the criminal division for the Southern District of New York and now managing director in the legal department at Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nBoesky and Milken trials\nIvan Boesky, a Wall Street arbitrageur who had amassed a fortune of about $200 million by betting on corporate takeovers, was originally investigated by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders, leading the way for the US Attorney's Office of the Southern

Television journalist Chris Wallace interviewed Giuliani on May 13, 2007, about his 1997 decision to locate the command center at the World Trade Center Giuliani laughed during Wallace's questions and said that Hauer recommended the World Trade Center site and that Hauer said the WTC site was the best location Wallace presented Giuliani a photocopy of Hauer's directive letter The letter urged Giuliani to locate the command center in Brooklyn, instead of lower Manhattan [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] The February 1996 memo read, \"The  [Brooklyn] building is secure and not as visible a target as buildings in Lower Manhattan.\" [134]\n\n\nPublic reaction\nGiuliani gained international attention after the attacks and was widely hailed for his leadership role [144] Polls taken just six weeks after the attack showed a 79 percent approval rating among New York City voters This was a dramatic increase over the 36 percent rating he had received a year earlier, which was an average at the end of a two-term mayorship [145] [146] Oprah Winfrey called him \"America's Mayor\" at a 9/11 memorial service held at Yankee Stadium on September 23, 2001 [124] [147]\n\n\nTime Person of the Year\nOn December 24, 2001, [152] Time magazine named Giuliani its Person of the Year for 2001 [117] Time observed that, before 9/11, Giuliani's public image had been that of a rigid, self-righteous, ambitious politician After 9/11, and perhaps owing also to his bout with prostate cancer, his public image became that of a man who could be counted on to unite a city in the midst of its greatest crisis Historian Vincent J Cannato concluded in September 2006:\n\n\nAftermath\nFor his leadership on and after September 11, Giuliani was given an honorary knighthood (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II on February 13, 2002 [154]\n\n\nPost-mayoralty political career\nSince leaving office as mayor, Giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for Republican candidates for political offices at all levels When George Pataki became governor in 1995, this represented the first time the positions of both mayor and governor were held simultaneously by Republicans since John Lindsay and Nelson Rockefeller Giuliani and Pataki were instrumental in bringing the 2004 Republican National Convention to New York City [162] He was a speaker at the convention, and endorsed President George W Bush for re-election by recalling that immediately after the World Trade Center towers fell,\n\n\nBefore 2008 election\nSince leaving office as mayor, Giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for Republican candidates for political offices at all levels When George Pataki became governor in 1995, this represented the first time the positions of both mayor and governor were held simultaneously by Republicans since John Lindsay and Nelson Rockefeller Giuliani and Pataki were instrumental in bringing the 2004 Republican National Convention to New York City [162] He was a speaker at the convention, and endorsed President George W Bush for re-election by recalling that immediately after the World Trade Center towers fell,\n\n\n2008 presidential campaign\nIn November 2006, Giuliani announced the formation of an exploratory committee toward a run for the presidency in 2008 In February 2007, he filed a \"statement of candidacy\" and confirmed on the television program Larry King Live that he was indeed running [186]\n\n\nAfter 2008 election\nFollowing the end of his presidential campaign, Giuliani's \"high appearance fees dropped like a stone\" [207] He returned to work at both Giuliani Partners and Bracewell & Giuliani [208] His consultancy work included advising Keiko Fujimori with her presidential campaign during the 2011 Peruvian general election [209] Giuliani also explored hosting a syndicated radio show, and was reported to be in talks with Westwood One about replacing Bill O'Reilly before that position went to Fred Thompson (another unsuccessful 2008 GOP presidential primary candidate) [210] [211] In 2009, Giuliani said the Obama administration and U.S Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner lacked executive competence in dealing with the 2007–2008 financial crisis [212]\n\n\nRelationship with Donald Trump\nGiuliani supported Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S presidential election He gave a prime time speech during the first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention [229] Earlier in the day, Giuliani and former 2016 presidential candidate Ben Carson appeared at an event for the pro-Trump Great America PAC [230] Giuliani also appeared in a Great America PAC ad entitled \"Leadership\" [231] Giuliani's and Jeff Sessions' appearances were staples at Trump campaign rallies [232]\n\n\nPresidential campaign supporter\nGiuliani supported Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S presidential election He gave a prime time speech during the first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention [229] Earlier in the day, Giuliani and former 2016 presidential candidate Ben Carson appeared at an event for the pro-Trump Great America PAC [230] Giuliani also appeared in a Great America PAC ad entitled \"Leadership\" [231] Giuliani's and Jeff Sessions' appearances were staples at Trump campaign rallies [232]\n\n\nAdvisor to the president\nThe president-elect named Giuliani his informal cybersecurity adviser on January 12, 2017 [242] The status of this informal role for Giuliani is unclear because, in November 2018, Trump created the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), headed by Christopher Krebs as director and Matthew Travis as deputy In the weeks following his appointment, Giuliani was forced to consult an Apple Store Genius Bar when he \"was locked out of his iPhone because he had forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong one at least 10 times\", belying his putative expertise in the field [243]\n\n\nPersonal lawyer\nIn mid April 2018, Giuliani joined Trump's legal team, which dealt with the special counsel investigation by Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S elections Giuliani said his goal was to negotiate a swift end to the investigation [246]\n\n\nAttempts to get Ukraine to carry out investigations\nSince at least May 2019, Giuliani has been urging Ukraine's newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate the oil company Burisma, whose board of directors once included Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden, [276] and to check for irregularities in Ukraine's investigation of Paul Manafort He said such investigations would benefit his client's defense, and that his efforts had Trump's full support [277] Toward this end, Giuliani met with Ukrainian officials throughout 2019 [278] [279] [280] In July 2019, Buzzfeed News reported that two Soviet-born Americans, Lev Parnas [281] and Igor Fruman, were liaisons between Giuliani and Ukrainian government officials in this effort Parnas and Fruman, prolific Republican donors, have neither registered as foreign agents in the United States, nor been evaluated and approved by the State Department [282] Giuliani responded, \"This (report) is a pathetic effort to cover up what are enormous allegations of criminality by the Biden family.\" [283] Yet by September 2019, there had been no clear evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens [284]\n\n\n2020 election lawsuits\nIn November 2020, Trump placed Giuliani in charge of lawsuits related to alleged voter irregularities in the 2020 United States presidential election [357] On November 7, Giuliani gave a press conference at Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Philadelphia to discuss challenging the vote count in Pennsylvania, during which media networks called the presidential election for Biden [358]  Trump designated Giuliani to lead a legal team to challenge the election results, telling Giuliani to \"go wild\" and \"do anything you want\" in his efforts to overturn them [359] This team – a self-described \"elite strike force\" that included Sidney Powell, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, and Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis  [360] [361] – appeared at a November 19 press conference in which they made numerous false and unsubstantiated assertions revolving around an international Communist conspiracy, rigged voting machines, and polling place fraud [20] [362] [363] [364] [365]\n\n\nPennsylvania lawsuit\nOne early lawsuit sought to invalidate up to 700,000 mail-in ballots and stop Pennsylvania from certifying its election results [371] Giuliani said he had signed affidavits attesting to voter fraud and election official misconduct in Pennsylvania and elsewhere [372] Despite not having argued a case in any courtroom for over three decades, [373] Giuliani applied for special permission to represent the Trump presidential campaign in the federal court of Pennsylvania In doing so, Giuliani misrepresented his status with the District of Columbia Bar in his application by stating that he was a member of the bar in good standing, when in fact the District of Columbia had suspended him for nonpayment of fees [371] In his first day in court on the case, which was November 17, 2020, Giuliani struggled with rudimentary legal processes and was accused by lawyers for the Pennsylvania Secretary of State of making legal arguments that were \"disgraceful in an American courtroom\" [374] Judge Matthew Brann questioned how Giuliani could justify \"asking this court to invalidate some 6.8 million votes thereby disenfranchising every single voter in the commonwealth.\" [375]\n\n\nDominion and Smartmatic lawsuits\nAs part of Giuliani's allegations that voting machines had been rigged, he made several false assertions about two rival companies, Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic These false claims included that Smartmatic owned Dominion; that Dominion voting machines used Smartmatic software; that Dominion voting machines sent vote data to Smartmatic at foreign locations; that Dominion was founded by the former socialist Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez; and that Dominion is a \"radical-left\" company with connections to antifa [382] [383]\n\n\nJudgment for defaming Georgia election workers\nIn December 2021, two Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea' ArShaye Moss, sued Giuliani in DC for defamation, [394] [395] after Giuliani falsely accused them of manipulating vote tallies [396] He has accused them of \"passing around USB ports as if they were vials of heroin or cocaine\" and engaging in \"surreptitious illegal activity,\" citing video footage that, according to Moss, actually showed the women with \"a ginger mint\" [397] Moss testified before the United States House of Representatives that after Giuliani's remarks she and her family were subjected to a barrage of racist threats, including \"Be glad it's 2020 and not 1920,\" in reference to lynching in the United States [398]\n\n\nAttack on the Capitol\nOn January 6, 2021, Giuliani spoke at a \"Save America March\" rally on the Ellipse that was attended by Trump supporters protesting the election results He repeated conspiracy theories that voting machines used in the election were \"crooked\" and called for \"trial by combat\", [436] which he claimed after the riot had not been a call to violence but a reference to Game of Thrones [437] [438] [439] Trump supporters subsequently stormed the U.S Capitol in a riot that resulted in the deaths of four people, [440] and temporarily disrupted the counting of the Electoral College vote [441]\n\n\nIndictments\nOn August 1, 2023, the Justice Department's special counsel investigating Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election charged Trump with four criminal counts related to those efforts [459] News reports widely identified Rudy Giuliani as the unnamed \"Co-Conspirator 1\" (of six) mentioned at least 46 times in the 45-page indictment [460] [461] [462] In a statement, Giuliani's lawyer, Robert J Costello, acknowledged that it “appears that Mayor Giuliani is alleged to be co-conspirator No 1.” [459]\n\n\nSuspension of law license and New York disbarment\nOn June 24, 2021, a New York appellate court suspended Giuliani's law license The panel of five justices found that there was \"uncontroverted\" evidence that Giuliani made \"demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers and the public\" and that \"These false statements were made to improperly bolster (Giuliani's) narrative that due to widespread voter fraud, victory in the 2020 United States presidential election was stolen from his client.\" [65] [475] [476] The court concluded that Giuliani's conduct \"immediately threatens the public interest and warrants interim suspension from the practice of law\" [65] [475] [476] His license was also suspended in Washington, D.C., on July 7, 2021 [477]\n\n\nEthics charges for baseless claims in favor of Trump\nOn June 10, 2022, the DC Bar's Office of Disciplinary Counsel [480] filed charges with the DC Court of Appeals' Board on Professional Responsibility [481] against Giuliani The ethics charges say that Giuliani's federal court filings regarding the 2020 presidential election in Pennsylvania contained baseless claims in favor of Trump [482]\n\n\nSupermarket incident\nOn June 27, 2022, Giuliani appeared at ShopRite, a supermarket in Staten Island, campaigning on behalf of his son Andrew, who was attempting to become the Republican nominee for governor of New York [488] [489] After Giuliani's appearance, a 39-year-old supermarket employee, Daniel Gill, was arrested and charged with second-degree assault for allegedly slapping Giuliani's back in the store [488] Giuliani responded publicly that it was like \"a boulder hit me\" or \"like somebody shot me\"; \"it hurt tremendously\" [490] [491] [492] Giuliani further stated that the \"very, very heavy shot\" by Gill caused him to stumble and \"could've easily .. knocked me to the ground and killed me by my head getting hit\", and called for Gill's firing and prosecution [488] The Legal Aid Society, representing Gill, asserted that Giuliani had exaggerated the severity of the slap in order to garner greater amounts of attention from the media: \"Our client merely patted Mr Giuliani, who sustained nothing remotely resembling physical injuries, without malice to simply get his attention, as the video footage clearly showed,\" the Legal Aid Society stated in a press release [493]\n\n\nSexual assault and misconduct allegations\nOn May 15, 2023, Noelle Dunphy, a former off-the-books employee of Giuliani, filed a civil lawsuit against him [498] She accused Giuliani of sexual assault, wage theft and unlawful abuse of power [499] Dunphy claimed that sexually satisfying Giuliani was an \"absolute requirement\" of her job; [498] the complaint also said that Giuliani \"often made outrageous comments that created and added to the hostile work environment that Ms Dunphy was forced to endure,\" and that he was constantly under the effects of alcohol [500] The lawsuit further alleges Giuliani complained about \"'freakin Arabs' and Jews,\" and \"implied that  [Jewish men's] penises were inferior due to 'natural selection.'\" [501] The lawsuit also alleges that Giuliani and Donald Trump sold pardons for $2 million apiece [502]\n\n\nOther legal issues\nIn September 2023, law firm Davidoff Hutcher & Citron sued Giuliani for over $1.3 million in unpaid legal fees The firm alleged that Giuliani had paid only $214,000 of his total legal bill between November 2019 and July 2023 Giuliani said in a statement that the firm's bill \"is way in excess to anything approaching legitimate fees.\" [506] [507] [508]\n\n\nOther post-mayoral ventures\nAfter leaving the New York City mayor's office, Giuliani founded a security consulting business, Giuliani Partners LLC, in 2002, a firm that has been categorized by multiple media outlets as a lobbying entity capitalizing on Giuliani's name recognition, [517] [518] and which has been the subject of allegations surrounding staff hired by Giuliani and due to the firm's chosen client base [519] Over five years, Giuliani Partners earned more than $100 million [519]\n\n\nGiuliani Partners\nAfter leaving the New York City mayor's office, Giuliani founded a security consulting business, Giuliani Partners LLC, in 2002, a firm that has been categorized by multiple media outlets as a lobbying entity capitalizing on Giuliani's name recognition, [517] [518] and which has been the subject of allegations surrounding staff hired by Giuliani and due to the firm's chosen client base [519] Over five years, Giuliani Partners earned more than $100 million [519]\n\n\nBracewell & Giuliani\nIn 2005, Giuliani joined the law firm of Bracewell & Patterson LLP (renamed Bracewell & Giuliani LLP) as a name partner and basis for the expanding firm's new New York office [522] When he joined the Texas-based firm he brought Marc Mukasey, the son of Attorney General Michael Mukasey, into the firm.\n\n\nGreenberg Traurig\nIn January 2016, Giuliani moved to the law firm Greenberg Traurig, where he served as the global chairman for Greenberg's cybersecurity and crisis management group, as well as a senior advisor to the firm's executive chairman [527] He took an unpaid leave of absence in April 2018 when he joined Trump's legal defense team [528] He resigned from the firm on May 9, 2018 [529]\n\n\nLobbying in Romania\nIn August 2018, Giuliani was retained by Freeh Group International Solutions, a global consulting firm run by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, which paid him a fee to lobby Romanian president Klaus Iohannis to change Romania's anti-corruption policy and reduce the role of the National Anticorruption Directorate Giuliani argued that the anti-corruption efforts had gone too far [530] [531]\n\n\nPodcast\nGiuliani launched a podcast, Rudy Giuliani's Common Sense, in January 2020 [532] [533]\n\n\nTelevision appearances\nGiuliani was reportedly revealed to be the first unmasking on the seventh season of The Masked Singer, which caused judges Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke to leave the set in disgust [534] Giuliani actually turned out to be the ninth unmasking as \"Jack in the Box\" of Team Bad He mentioned that he partook in this show to do it for his newborn granddaughter It was during his unmasked performance of George Thorogood's \"Bad to the Bone\" when Jeong walked off [535] [536]\n\n\nPersonal life\nGiuliani married Regina Peruggi, his second cousin, whom he had known since childhood, on October 26, 1968 The marriage was in trouble by the mid-1970s and they agreed to a trial separation in 1975 [537] Peruggi did not accompany him to Washington when he accepted the job in the Attorney General's Office [37] Giuliani met local television personality Donna Hanover sometime in 1982, and they began dating when she was working in Miami Giuliani filed for legal separation from Peruggi on August 12, 1982 [537] The Giuliani-Peruggi marriage legally ended in two ways: a civil divorce was issued by the end of 1982, [538] while a Roman Catholic church annulment of the marriage was granted at the end of 1983, [537] reportedly because Giuliani had discovered that he and Peruggi were second cousins [539] [540] Alan Placa, Giuliani's best man, later became a priest and helped secure the annulment Giuliani and Peruggi had no children [541]\n\n\nMarriages and relationships\nGiuliani married

screening PSA [571] Giuliani would go on to make a full recovery, becoming a spokesman for cancer survivors [572]\n\n\nReligious beliefs\nGiuliani has declined to comment publicly on his religious practice and beliefs, although he identifies religion as an important part of his life When asked if he is a practicing Catholic, Giuliani answered, \"My religious affiliation, my religious practices

The series premiered on Netflix in 2023 and follows the story of a group of people who are caught up in the drama of World War II.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe series takes its name from the concept of transatlantic communication, which refers to the exchange of information and ideas between the Old and New Worlds. In the context of the series, transatlantic communication takes on a more literal meaning, as the characters navigate the complexities of international relations and the challenges of communication across cultures. The series is set in the 1940s, during World War II, and explores the themes of love, loss, and survival in the face of war.\n\n**Cast and Characters**\n\nThe series features a talented ensemble cast, including Gillian Jacobs, Grégory Montel, Cory Michael Smith, and Corey Stoll. The cast also includes Lucas Englander, Ralph Amoussou, Deleila Piasko, and Amit Rahav, among others. The characters in the series are complex and multidimensional, and each one brings their own unique perspective to the story.\n\n**Main**\n\nThe series follows the story of a group of people who are caught up in the drama of World War II. The main characters are a group of diplomats, spies, and politicians who are trying to navigate the complexities of international relations. They are joined by a group of civilians who are struggling to survive in a world torn apart by war. Throughout the series, the characters face numerous challenges and obstacles, including betrayal, deception, and violence.\n\n**Recurring Themes**\n\nOne of the recurring themes of the series is the concept of identity. The characters in the series are all struggling to find their place in the world and to define themselves in the face of war and uncertainty. They are also grappling with issues of loyalty, duty, and morality, and are forced to make difficult choices in order to survive.\n\nAnother recurring theme of the series is the concept of love. The characters in the series are all struggling to find love and connection in a world that is torn apart by war. They are forced to confront the challenges of long-distance relationships, unrequited love, and the loss of loved ones.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe series consists of seven episodes, each of which explores a different aspect of the characters' lives. The episodes are titled as follows:\n\n* Episode 1: \"The Atlantic Crossing\"\n* Episode 2: \"The Spy in the Mirror\"\n* Episode 3: \"The Diplomat's Dilemma\"\n* Episode 4: \"The Traitor's Kiss\"\n* Episode 5: \"The Survivor's Guilt\"\n* Episode 6: \"The Lost City\"\n* Episode 7: \"The Aftermath\"\n\n**Production**\n\nThe series was produced by Netflix and Anna Winger's Berlin-based production company, Studio Airlift.

The series was developed over the course of several months, with a team of writers, directors, and producers working to bring the story to life.\n\n**Casting**\n\nThe casting process for the series began in January 2022, with the announcement of the main cast in March 2022. The cast was chosen for their ability to bring depth and nuance to their characters, and for their ability to convey the complexities of the story.\n\n**Filming**\n\nPrincipal photography for the series began in February 2022, on location in Marseille, France. The production team chose Marseille for its historic significance and its picturesque landscapes, which provided an ideal backdrop for the series.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe series received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 94% of critics' reviews were positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website's consensus read: \"Ably dramatizing a deadly serious chapter of World War II history while also remembering to have fun, Transatlantic is a visually sumptuous throwback to classic Hollywood melodramas.\"\n\nHowever, the series has also been criticized for its historical inaccuracies. Some critics have argued that the series takes creative liberties with historical events, which can be misleading and inaccurate. Despite these criticisms, the series remains a compelling and thought-provoking drama that explores the complexities of war and human relationships.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Transatlantic_(TV_series)\" following this outline:\n\n\nCast and characters\nTransatlantic was the first project announced in September 2021 under the creative partnership of Netflix and Anna Winger's Berlin-based production company Studio Airlift The seven-part series is created by Winger and Daniel Hendler, and produced by Winger and Camille McCurry Stéphanie Chuat, Véronique Reymond and Mia Meyer led the directing team [4] In a March 2023 interview with Deadline Hollywood ahead of Transatlantic's Séries Mania screening, Winger said she took inspiration from the film Casablanca (1942) [5]\n\n\nMain\nTransatlantic was the first project announced in September 2021 under the creative partnership of Netflix and Anna Winger's Berlin-based production company Studio Airlift The seven-part series is created by Winger and Daniel Hendler, and produced by Winger and Camille McCurry Stéphanie Chuat, Véronique Reymond and Mia Meyer led the directing team [4] In a March 2023 interview with Deadline Hollywood ahead of Transatlantic's Séries Mania screening, Winger said she took inspiration from the film Casablanca (1942) [5]\n\n\nRecurring\nTransatlantic was the first project announced in September 2021 under the creative partnership of Netflix and Anna Winger's Berlin-based production company Studio Airlift The seven-part series is created by Winger and Daniel Hendler, and produced by Winger and Camille McCurry Stéphanie Chuat, Véronique Reymond and Mia Meyer led the directing team [4] In a March 2023 interview with Deadline Hollywood ahead of Transatlantic's Séries Mania screening, Winger said she took inspiration from the film Casablanca (1942) [5]\n\n\nEpisodes\nTransatlantic was the first project announced in September 2021 under the creative partnership of Netflix and Anna Winger's Berlin-based production company Studio Airlift The seven-part series is created by Winger and Daniel Hendler, and produced by Winger and Camille McCurry Stéphanie Chuat, Véronique Reymond and Mia Meyer led the directing team [4] In a March 2023 interview with Deadline Hollywood ahead of Transatlantic's Séries Mania screening, Winger said she took inspiration from the film Casablanca (1942) [5]\n\n\nProduction\nTransatlantic was the first project announced in September 2021 under the creative partnership of Netflix and Anna Winger's Berlin-based production company Studio Airlift The seven-part series is created by Winger and Daniel Hendler, and produced by Winger and Camille McCurry Stéphanie Chuat, Véronique Reymond and Mia Meyer led the directing team [4] In a March 2023 interview with Deadline Hollywood ahead of Transatlantic's Séries Mania screening, Winger said she took inspiration from the film Casablanca (1942) [5]\n\n\nDevelopment\nTransatlantic was the first project announced in September 2021 under the creative partnership of Netflix and Anna Winger's Berlin-based production company Studio Airlift The seven-part series is created by Winger and Daniel Hendler, and produced by Winger and Camille McCurry Stéphanie Chuat, Véronique Reymond and Mia Meyer led the directing team [4] In a March 2023 interview with Deadline Hollywood ahead of Transatlantic's Séries Mania screening, Winger said she took inspiration from the film Casablanca (1942) [5]\n\n\nCasting\nCasting was reportedly under way as of January 2022 The cast were announced in March 2022, with Gillian Jacobs, Grégory Montel, Cory Michael Smith, and Corey Stoll set to star alongside Lucas Englander, Ralph Amoussou, Deleila Piasko, and Amit Rahav [6]\n\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on location in Marseille, France in February 2022 [8]\n\n\nReception\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 18 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10 The website's consensus reads: \"Ably dramatizing a deadly serious chapter of World War II history while also remembering to have fun, Transatlantic is a visually sumptuous throwback to classic Hollywood melodramas.\" [10] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the miniseries a score of 64 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" [11]\nHowever, the series has been criticised for its historical inaccuracies [12]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Black Panther, Captain Marvel, the Falcon, Hawkeye, and Jane Foster's Thor form where they were all turned into Ghost Rider-like creatures [51] As Hotel Inferno starts to affect the people of Las

Elite programmed to become the Squadron Supreme of America This group is used by a somehow-revived Phil Coulson to become the sanctioned superhero team for the United States [61]\n\n\nSpider-Geddon's aftermath\nWhen the Spider-Man of Earth-44145 threatens the life of James Martin, the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus' mind in the Proto-Clone) uses a signal move he learned from Doctor Strange to call Mephisto, who states that the Spider-Man of Earth-44145 is out of his jurisdiction The Superior Spider-Man asks Mephisto to restore him to the man he once was for a day so that he can fight the Spider-Man of Earth-44145 While Mephisto states that he either has or does not have his soul, he does have a counteroffer that will restore his body without disease (physical and mental) and the taint of Peter Parker As the Superior Spider-Man tells Anna Maria Marconi that there is no other option, he expects Mephisto to uphold his end of the bargain [62]\n\n\n2020s\nAfter being killed by Deadpool

Inferno asking about what was wrong with Peter Parker's soul as well as how Harry Osborn was seemingly revived as Kindred [64] It was during this confrontation that Mephisto confesses his true motivations for erasing the marriage of the Parkers, as at some undisclosed point in the future he finally seizes control of Earth, only for his reign to be ended by either Spider-Man or his daughter Striking a deal with Peter to affect his soul and erasing both his marriage with Mary Jane and their daughter was Mephisto's way of ensuring that that future would never come to pass in either scenario Mephisto is also revealed as the one responsible for the torment and creation of the Kindred Twins (the souls of Sarah and Gabriel, clones previously created by a temporarily insane Harry when he was alive and a posthumous A.I of him to pose as the children of his father and Gwen Stacy, merged with the A.I in physical demonic forms) as part of his long game waged against Peter Parker

Doctor Doom named Doom Supreme watched the Prehistoric Avengers send Kid Thanos back to his own time, Mephisto approached Doom Supreme and suggested to him that he put together a team that would defeat any team of Avengers Doom Supreme took Mephisto's offer and formed a Multiversal version of the Masters of Evil consisting of a version of Kid Thanos, a version of Dark Phoenix and her pet Berserkers, a version of Erik Killmonger called King Killmonger, a version of the Green Goblin with Ghost Rider-like powers called the Ghost Goblin, and the Black Skull Due to their agreement with the Council of Reds, they had to save Earth-616 for last After each of the attacks from the Multiversal Masters of Evil, Doom Supreme and Kid Thanos meet up with the Iron Inquisitor and Mephisto in the form of a dog as he nears the corpse of the Orb Under Mephisto's orders, Doom Supreme unburns Uatu's eye fragment and puts it in his own eye As Doom Supreme and Kid Thanos enter a portal to meet with their teammates and get back to work, Mephisto and the Iron Inquisitor talk about what to do with the Multiversal Masters of Evil as Mephisto's dog form eats at the fragments of Uatu's eye Then he has the Orb's corpse dumped into the ocean [65]\n\n\nPowers and abilities\nMephisto is an extremely powerful immortal demonic entity possessing abilities used by manipulating the forces of magic [72]

Harry's mother, but she turned down the role and Geraldine Somerville was cast [83]\n\n\nFilming\nTwo British film industry officials requested that the film be shot in the United Kingdom, offering their assistance in securing filming locations, the use of Leavesden Film Studios, as well as changing the UK's child labour laws (adding a small number of working hours per week and making the timing of on-set classes more flexible) [46] Warner Bros accepted their proposal Principal photography began on 29 September 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios [84] Filming at the North Yorkshire's Goathland railway station took place on 2 October 2000 [85] Canterbury Cathedral and Scotland's Inverailort Castle were both touted as possible locations for Hogwarts; Canterbury rejected Warner Bros proposal due to concerns about the film's \"pagan\" theme [86] [87] Alnwick Castle and Gloucester Cathedral were eventually selected as the principal locations for Hogwarts, [6] with some scenes also being filmed at Harrow School [88] Other Hogwarts scenes were filmed in Durham Cathedral over a two-week period; [89] these included shots of the corridors and some classroom scenes [90] Oxford University's Divinity School served as the Hogwarts Hospital Wing, and Duke Humfrey's Library, part of the Bodleian, was used as the Hogwarts Library [91] Filming for Privet Drive took place on Picket Post Close in Bracknell, Berkshire [89] Filming in the street took two days instead of the planned single day, so payments to the street's residents were correspondingly increased [89] For all the subsequent film's scenes set in Privet Drive, filming took place on a constructed set in Leavesden Film Studios, which proved to be cheaper than filming on location [92] London's Australia House was selected as the location for Gringotts Wizarding Bank, [6] while Christ Church, Oxford, was the location for the Hogwarts trophy room [36] London Zoo was used as the location for the scene in which Harry accidentally sets a snake on Dudley, [36] with King's Cross Station also being used as the book specifies [93] Filming concluded on 23 March 2001, with final work being done in July 2001 [51] [94] [84]\n\n\nDesign and special effects\nJudianna Makovsky served as the costume designer She re-designed the Quidditch robes, having initially planned to use those shown on the cover of the American book, but deemed them \"a mess.\" Instead, she dressed the Quidditch players in \"preppie sweaters, 19th-century fencing breeches and arm guards.\" [98] Production designer Stuart Craig built the sets at Leavesden Studios, including Hogwarts Great Hall, basing it on many English cathedrals Although originally asked to use an existing old street to film the Diagon Alley scenes, Craig decided to build his own set, comprising Tudor, Georgian and Queen Anne architecture [98]\n\n\nMusic\nJohn Williams was selected to compose the score, having previously collaborated with Chris Columbus for Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York [102] Williams composed the score at his homes in Los Angeles and Tanglewood before recording it in London in September 2001 One of the main themes is entitled \"Hedwig's Theme\"; Williams retained it for his finished score as \"everyone seemed to like it,\" and it became a recurring theme throughout the series [103] James Horner was the first choice to compose the score but turned it down [104]\n\n\nDifferences from the book\nColumbus repeatedly checked with Rowling to make sure he was getting minor details correct [99] Kloves described the film as being \"really faithful\" to the book He added dialogue, of which Rowling approved One of the lines originally included had to be removed after Rowling told him that it would directly contradict an event in the then-unreleased fifth Harry Potter novel Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix [105]\n\n\nDistribution\nThe first teaser poster of the film was released on 1 December 2000 [109] The first teaser trailer was released via satellite on 2 March 2001 and debuted in cinemas with the release of See Spot Run [110] A video game based on the film was released on 15 November 2001 by Electronic Arts for several consoles [103] A port for the game, for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, was released in 2003 [111] Mattel won the rights to produce toys based on the film, to be sold exclusively through Warner Brothers' stores [112] Hasbro also produced products, including confectionery products based on those from the series [113] Warner Bros signed a deal worth US$150 million with Coca-Cola to promote the film, [93] although some pegged the deal at $40 million-$50 million worldwide for the movie [114] Lego produced a series of sets based on buildings and scenes from the film, as well as a Lego Creator video game [115]\n\n\nMarketing\nThe first teaser poster of the film was released on 1 December 2000 [109] The first teaser trailer was released via satellite on 2 March 2001 and debuted in cinemas with the release of See Spot Run [110] A video game based on the film was released on 15 November 2001 by Electronic Arts for several consoles [103] A port for the game, for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, was released in 2003 [111] Mattel won the rights to produce toys based on the film, to be sold exclusively through Warner Brothers' stores [112] Hasbro also produced products, including confectionery products based on those from the series [113] Warner Bros signed a deal worth US$150 million with Coca-Cola to promote the film, [93] although some pegged the deal at $40 million-$50 million worldwide for the movie [114] Lego produced a series of sets based on buildings and scenes from the film, as well as a Lego Creator video game [115]\n\n\nTheatrical release\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone had its world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 4 November 2001, with the cinema arranged to resemble Hogwarts School [116]\n\n\nHome media\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was first released on VHS and DVD on 11 May 2002 in the United Kingdom [120] and 28 May 2002 in the United States [121] \nBetween May and June 2002, the film sold 10 million copies, almost 60% of which were DVD sales [122] It would go on to make $19.1 million in rentals, surpassing The Fast and the Furious for having the largest DVD rentals [123] This record was surpassed by The Bourne Identity in January 2003 [124]\n\n\nReception\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone grossed a record single day gross of £3.6 million during the first day of previews, beating Toy Story 2's record It grossed a record £3.1 million for a Sunday, bringing its total to £6.7 million from the previews [117] [130] It broke the record for the highest-opening weekend ever, both including and excluding previews, making £16.3 million with and £9.6 million without previews ($13.8 million), setting a further record single day gross on the Saturday with £3.99 million [131] [132] [130] It set another Sunday record with a gross of £3.6 million [132] It had a record second weekend of £8.4 million [133] [130] It remained at number one in the UK for five weeks [130] The film went on to make £66.1 million in the UK alone, making it the country's second-highest-grossing film of all-time (after Titanic), until it was surpassed by Mamma Mia!

{"title": "Marvelous_Marvin_Hagler", "content": "\nEarly life, family and education\nHagler was the first child of Robert Sims and Ida Mae Hagler, born on May 23, 1954 His birth year publicly came to light in 1982, when he had to state his date of birth in order to legally change from Marvin Nathaniel Hagler to Marvelous Marvin Hagler Hagler was raised by his mother in the Central Ward of Newark, New Jersey, United States along with five siblings: sisters Veronica, Cheryl, Genarra, and Noreen, and half brother Robbie Sims, who, like Hagler, would also become a professional boxer Hagler first put on gloves at the age of ten, for a social worker he knew only as Mister Joe, who taught him sports and got him involved in counseling other children Hagler dropped out of school at the age of 14 and worked in a toy factory to help support the family Ida Mae recalled her eldest son had always wanted to box and promised one day to buy her a home Growing up, Hagler would pretend he was Floyd Patterson or Emile Griffith [18]\n\n\nAmateur career\nIn 1969, Hagler began boxing after being in a street fight with a local boxer called Dornell Wigfall (Wigfall accosted Hagler at a party and took him outside)—whom he later defeated twice on official fights—with his friends watching, and Wigfall easily beat Hagler and compounded the humiliation by stealing the jacket off Hagler's back The day after the fight, Hagler determined to become a boxer himself He first entered Vinnie Vecchione's gym (where, unknown to him, Dornell Wigfall trained), but after one week watching, and of nobody speaking to him, Hagler decided to leave for good He walked into a gym owned by brothers Pat and Goody Petronelli They became his trainers and managers As Hagler needed to be 16 in order to enter some amateur tournaments, he lied about his age, saying that he was born in 1952 instead of 1954 In May 1973, Hagler won the National Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) 165-pound (75 kg) title after defeating Terry Dobbs, a U.S Marine from Atlanta, Georgia [19] Ahead of both Aaron Pryor and Leon Spinks, officials also voted him the 'Outstanding Boxer' of the tournament [18] Hagler subsequently turned professional, finishing his amateur career with a 55–1 record [20]\n\n\nProfessional career\nHagler was a top-ranked middleweight boxer for many years before he fought for the title He struggled to find high-profile opponents willing to face him in his early years Joe Frazier told Hagler, \"You have three strikes against you, \"You're black, you're a southpaw, and you're good.\" [21] He often had to travel to his opponents' hometowns to get fights His first break came when he was offered—on two weeks' notice—a chance against Willie \"The Worm\" Monroe, who was being trained by Frazier Hagler lost the decision but the fight was close, so Monroe gave him a rematch This time Hagler knocked out Monroe in twelve rounds In a third fight, he defeated Monroe in two rounds.\n\n\nEarly career\nHagler was a top-ranked middleweight boxer for many years before he fought for the title He struggled to find high-profile opponents willing to face him in his early years Joe Frazier told

Hagler knocked out Monroe in twelve rounds In a third fight, he defeated Monroe in two rounds.\n\n\nFirst title shot\nIn November 1979, Hagler fought world middleweight champion Vito Antuofermo at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada When the fight was over after 15 rounds, most ringside observers thought that Hagler had won, even though Antuofermo had been closing the gap in the second half of the fight Hagler claimed that referee Mills Lane told him he had won, but Lane later denied ever saying that Hagler also noted that he and many others at ringside were surprised when the fight decision was announced as a draw Judge Duane Ford scored the fight in Hagler's favor, 145–141 However, judge Dalby Shirley scored the bout for Antuofermo, 144–142, while judge Hal Miller scored the fight even, 143–143 This fight result only added to Hagler's frustrations, as Antuofermo retained his title with the draw Hagler had the boxing skills and killer instinct to knock his opponent out, but instead he played it safe, as Antuofermo closed the gap late in the fight, and that late surge cost Hagler the title [23]\n\n\nWorld champion\nAntuofermo later lost his title to British boxer Alan Minter, who gave Hagler his second title shot Hagler went to Wembley Arena to face Minter The tense atmosphere was stoked further when Minter was quoted as saying that \"No black man is going to take my title\" [24]—Minter later insisted he meant \"that black man\" [25] Hagler took command and his slashing punches soon opened up the cut-prone Minter With Hagler dominating the action, referee Carlos Berrocal halted the fight during the third round to have the four glaring cuts on Minter's face examined Minter's manager, Doug Bidwell, almost immediately conceded defeat Once Berrocal waved the bout off, a riot broke out among the spectators Clive Gammon of Sports Illustrated described the scene as \"a horrifying ululation of howls and boos.\" Hagler and his trainers had to be escorted to their locker room by a phalanx of policemen, all the while enduring a steady rain of beer bottles and glasses After seven years and 50 fights, Hagler was the world middleweight champion.\n\n\nHagler vs. Durán\nA fight against Roberto Durán followed on November 10, 1983 Durán was the first challenger to last the distance with Hagler in a world-championship bout Durán was the WBA light middleweight champion and went up in weight to challenge for Hagler's middleweight crown Hagler won a unanimous 15-round decision, although after 13 rounds, Durán was ahead by one point on two scorecards and even on the third Hagler, with his left eye swollen and cut, came on strong in the last two rounds to win the fight Judge Guy Jutras scored the bout 144–142 Judge Ove Ovesen scored it 144–143 Judge Yusaku Yoshida scored it 146–145.\n\n\nMore title defenses\nThen came Juan Roldán of Argentina, who became the only man to be credited with a knockdown of Hagler, scoring one mere seconds into the fight Hagler protested bitterly that he had been pulled/pushed to the canvas Hagler thumbed Roldan's left eye, then brutalized him over ten rounds and finally stopped him in the middle of round ten Sugar Ray Leonard was calling the fight ringside with HBO analyst Barry Tompkins He noted to Tompkins between rounds that Hagler looked older and slower \"Marvin might finally be slowing down, Barry,\" Leonard remarked Many people believe this is the fight that gave Sugar Ray Leonard the idea that he could actually win a fight with the aging Hagler.\n\n\nHagler vs. Hearns\nAfter conquering Hamsho again, Hagler met Thomas Hearns on April 15, 1985, in what was billed as The Fight; it became known as \"The War\".\n\n\nHagler vs. Mugabi\nNext was Olympic silver medalist John Mugabi of Uganda, who was 26–0 with 26 knockouts and was ranked the number one contender by all three major bodies The fight took place on March 10, 1986, as Hagler had hurt his back and could not fight on the first date booked in 1985 Hagler stopped Mugabi in the eleventh round of a brutal fight Many ringside observers, including analyst Gil Clancy, noticed that Hagler was showing signs of advanced ring wear and age He was much slower of hand and foot and seemed much easier to hit He had also completely morphed his ring style from a slick, quick-fisted, boxer/puncher to a strictly flat-footed, stalking, slugger to compensate for his loss of speed and reflexes Hagler was now said to be seriously considering retirement [26] Hagler's promoter Bob Arum was quoted as saying he was expecting Hagler to retire in the face of being challenged by Sugar Ray Leonard.\n\n\nHagler vs. Leonard\nHagler's next challenger was Sugar Ray Leonard, who was returning to the ring after a three-year retirement (having fought just once in the previous five years) During the pre-fight negotiations, in return for granting Hagler a larger share of the purse, Leonard obtained several conditions which were crucial to his strategy: a 22-by-22-foot (6.7 m × 6.7 m) ring instead of a smaller ring, 10-ounce (280-gram) gloves instead of 8-ounce (230-gram) gloves, and the fight was to be over twelve rounds instead of the 15 rounds favoured by Hagler [27] [28] Leonard was two years younger, had half as many fights and unbeknownst to Hagler, had engaged in several 'real' (i.e gloves, rounds, a referee, judges and no headgear) fights behind closed doors in order to shake off his ring rust The fight took place at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on April 6, 1987 Hagler was the clear betting favorite after a dominant six and a half years as the reigning undisputed middleweight champion of the world, having knocked out all opponents as champion except in winning a very close unanimous decision over 15 rounds against Roberto Durán It was Leonard's first fight at middleweight (160 lb or 73 kg weight limit) The fight was to be for Hagler's WBC, lineal and Ring middleweight titles only, as the WBA stripped Hagler of their belt for choosing to face Leonard instead of WBA mandatory challenger Herol Graham The IBF, while keeping Hagler as their champion, refused to sanction his fight against Leonard and said that the IBF middleweight title would be declared vacant if Hagler lost to Leonard.\n\n\nPost-fight reaction\nOfficial ringside judge JoJo Guerra, whose scorecard of 118–110 in favour of Leonard was derided in many quarters, commented that:\n\n\nRematch\nHagler requested a rematch but Leonard chose to retire again (the third of five high-profile retirements announced by Leonard during his professional boxing career), having announced it beforehand [39] [40] Fourteen months following their fight, Hagler retired from boxing on June 13, 1988, after watching WBA middleweight champion Sumbu Kalambay prevail over his brother, Robbie Sims, via unanimous decision [41] Hagler declared that he was \"tired of waiting\" for Leonard to grant him a rematch Just a month succeeding Hagler's retirement, Leonard announced another boxing comeback to fight against WBC light heavyweight champion Donny Lalonde at the 168-pound (76 kg) super middleweight limit In 1990, Leonard finally offered Hagler a rematch which reportedly would have earned him $15 million, but he declined By then, Hagler had settled down into a new life as an actor in Italy and was now uninterested in his past boxing life [42] [43] Hagler said \"A while ago, yeah, I wanted him so bad, but I'm over that.\" [42] At the 1994 Consumer Electronics Show, Hagler and Leonard had a mock rematch by playing against each other in the video game Boxing Legends of the Ring and claimed that an actual rematch was being planned, though it never happened [44]\n\n\nLife after boxing\nAfter the loss to Leonard, Hagler moved to Italy, where he became a well-known star of action films His roles included a U.S Marine in the films Indio (1989) and Indio 2 (1991) In 1997, he starred alongside

boxer who held the undisputed middleweight championship of the world from 1979 to 1987. Hagler's professional career spanned over a decade, during which he won 62 of his 67 fights, with 52 of those wins coming by way of knockout. Throughout his career, Hagler was known for his formidable punching power, aggressive fighting style, and his ability to adjust his game plan mid-fight to outmaneuver his opponents.\n\n**Early Life, Family, and Education**\n\nHagler was born on May 23, 1954, to Robert Sims and Ida Mae Hagler in Newark, New Jersey. He was the first child of the couple and grew up with five siblings: sisters Veronica, Cheryl, Genarra, and Noreen, and half-brother Robbie Sims. Hagler's early life was marked by poverty and hardship, with his family relying on government assistance to make ends meet. Despite these challenges, Hagler's mother instilled in him a strong sense of discipline and a desire to succeed.\n\nHagler's introduction to boxing came at the age of 10, when he began training under the guidance of a local social worker named Mister Joe. Mister Joe taught Hagler how to box and also provided him with counseling to help him deal with the difficulties he faced growing up. Hagler's natural talent for boxing quickly became apparent, and he began competing in local tournaments as a teenager.\n\n**Amateur Career**\n\nHagler's amateur career was marked by incredible success, with him winning 55 of his 56 fights. In 1969, Hagler began competing in local tournaments, and his talent quickly caught the attention of Vinnie Vecchione, a well-known boxing trainer. Vecchione took Hagler under his wing and helped him develop his skills as a boxer.\n\nIn 1973, Hagler won the National Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) 165-pound title, defeating Terry Dobbs in the process. The victory marked a turning point in Hagler's career, as he began to attract the attention of professional boxing promoters and trainers.\n\n**Professional Career**\n\nHagler turned professional in 1973, but his early career was marked by struggles. He had difficulty finding high-profile opponents willing to face him in the ring, and he often had to travel to his opponents' hometowns to get fights. Hagler's first break came when he was offered a fight against Willie \"The Worm\" Monroe, who was being trained by the legendary Joe Frazier.\n\nHagler lost the fight, but he earned a rematch, which he won by knockout in 12 rounds. The victory marked a turning point in Hagler's career, as he began to establish himself as a formidable force in the middleweight division.\n\n**First Title Shot**\n\nIn 1979, Hagler received his first title shot against Vito Antuofermo, the world middleweight champion. The fight was held at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and it was a closely contested bout. Hagler claimed that referee Mills Lane told him he had won the fight, but Lane later denied ever making such a statement. The fight was ultimately ruled a draw, with Antuofermo retaining his title.\n\n**World Champion**\n\nHagler's second title shot came against Alan Minter, the British boxer who had previously defeated Vito Antuofermo. The fight was held at Wembley Arena in London, and it was a one-sided bout. Hagler dominated the fight, knocking Minter down in the third round and forcing the referee to stop the fight.\n\nThe victory marked a turning point in Hagler's career, as he became the world middleweight champion. Hagler's title reign was marked by incredible success, with him defending his title 12 times against some of the toughest opponents in the division.\n\n**Hagler vs. Durán**\n\nIn 1983, Hagler faced his toughest challenge yet when he fought Roberto Durán, the WBA light middleweight champion. The fight was held at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and it was a closely contested bout. Durán was ahead on two of the judges' scorecards after 13 rounds, but Hagler came on strong in the final two rounds to win the fight by unanimous decision.\n\n**More Title Defenses**\n\nHagler's next title defense came against Juan Roldán, a young and ambitious boxer from Argentina. The fight was held at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and it was a one-sided bout. Hagler knocked Roldán down in the first round and stopped him in the tenth round.\n\nThe victory marked a turning point in Hagler's career, as he began to feel the effects of age and wear and tear. Hagler's next title defense came against Thomas Hearns, a formidable boxer from Detroit. The fight was held at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and it was a closely contested bout.\n\n**Hagler vs. Mugabi**\n\nIn 1986, Hagler faced his toughest challenge yet when he fought John Mugabi, a young and ambitious boxer from Uganda. The fight was held at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and it was a closely contested bout. Mugabi was ahead on the scorecards after 10 rounds, but Hagler stopped him in the 11th round.\n\n**Hagler vs. Leonard**\n\nIn 1987, Hagler faced his toughest challenge yet when he fought Sugar Ray Leonard, a legendary boxer from Maryland. The fight was held at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and it was a closely contested bout. Leonard was ahead on the scorecards after 12 rounds, but Hagler's promoter, Bob Arum, claimed that the fight was fixed.\n\n**Post-Fight Reaction**\n\nThe fight was a major upset, and it marked a turning point in Hagler's career. Hagler requested a rematch, but Leonard chose to retire from boxing instead. Hagler's next fight was against Sumbu Kalambay, the WBA middleweight champion. Hagler retired from boxing after the fight, citing a desire to focus on his acting career.\n\n**Life After Boxing**\n\nHagler moved to Italy, where he became a successful actor. He appeared in several films, including \"Indio\" and \"Indio 2\". Hagler also worked as a boxing commentator for British television and appeared in the video game \"Fight Night: Round 3\".\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nHagler was married twice, first to Bertha and then to Kay. He had five children with his first wife and lived in Milan, Italy. Hagler passed away on March 13, 2021, at the age of 66.\n\n**Professional Boxing Record**\n\nHagler's professional boxing record was 62-3-2, with 52 of his wins coming by way of knockout. He held the undisputed middleweight championship of the world from 1979 to 1987 and was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\n**Awards and Recognitions**\n\nHagler was awarded the WBA, WBC, and IBF middleweight titles during his career. He was also awarded the Ring magazine's world middleweight title in 1979.

Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Marvelous_Marvin_Hagler\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life, family and education\nHagler was the first child of Robert Sims and Ida Mae Hagler, born on May 23, 1954 His birth year publicly came to light in 1982, when he had to state his date of birth in order to legally change from Marvin Nathaniel Hagler to Marvelous Marvin Hagler Hagler was raised by his mother in the Central Ward of Newark, New Jersey, United States along with five siblings: sisters Veronica, Cheryl, Genarra, and Noreen, and half brother Robbie Sims, who, like Hagler, would also become a professional boxer Hagler first put on gloves at the age of ten, for a social worker he knew only as Mister Joe, who taught him sports and got him involved in counseling other children Hagler dropped out of school at the age of 14 and worked in a toy factory to help support the family Ida Mae recalled her eldest son had always wanted to box and promised one day to buy her a home Growing up, Hagler would pretend he was Floyd Patterson or Emile Griffith [18]\n\n\nAmateur career\nIn 1969, Hagler began boxing after being in a street fight with a local boxer called Dornell Wigfall (Wigfall accosted Hagler at a party and took him outside)—whom he later defeated twice on official fights—with his friends watching, and Wigfall easily beat Hagler and compounded the humiliation by stealing the jacket off Hagler's back The day after the fight, Hagler determined to become a boxer himself He first entered Vinnie Vecchione's gym (where, unknown to him, Dornell Wigfall trained), but after one week watching, and of nobody speaking to him, Hagler decided to leave for good He walked into a gym owned by brothers Pat and Goody Petronelli They became his trainers and managers As Hagler needed to be 16 in order to enter some amateur tournaments, he lied about his age, saying that he was born in 1952 instead of 1954 In May 1973, Hagler won the National Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) 165-pound (75 kg) title after defeating Terry Dobbs, a U.S Marine from Atlanta, Georgia [19] Ahead of both Aaron Pryor and Leon Spinks, officials also voted him the 'Outstanding Boxer' of the tournament [18] Hagler subsequently turned professional, finishing his amateur career with a 55–1 record [20]\n\n\nProfessional career\nHagler was a top-ranked middleweight boxer for many years before he fought for the title He struggled to find high-profile opponents willing to face him in his early years Joe Frazier told Hagler, \"You have three strikes against you, \"You're black, you're a southpaw, and you're good.\" [21] He often had to travel to his opponents' hometowns to get fights His first break came when he was offered—on two weeks' notice—a chance against Willie \"The Worm\" Monroe, who was being trained by Frazier Hagler lost the decision but the fight was close, so Monroe gave him a rematch This time Hagler knocked out Monroe in twelve rounds In a third fight, he defeated Monroe in two rounds.\n\n\nEarly career\nHagler was a top-ranked middleweight boxer for many years before he fought for the title He struggled to find high-profile opponents willing

fight was close, so Monroe gave him a rematch This time Hagler knocked out Monroe in twelve rounds In a third fight, he defeated Monroe in two rounds.\n\n\nFirst title shot\nIn November 1979, Hagler fought world middleweight champion Vito Antuofermo at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada When the fight was over after 15 rounds, most ringside observers thought that Hagler had won, even though Antuofermo had been closing the gap in the second half of the fight Hagler claimed that referee Mills Lane told him he had won, but Lane later denied ever saying that Hagler also noted that he and many others at ringside were surprised when the fight decision was announced as a draw Judge Duane Ford scored the fight in Hagler's favor, 145–141 However, judge Dalby Shirley scored the bout for Antuofermo, 144–142, while judge Hal Miller scored the fight even, 143–143 This fight result only added to Hagler's frustrations, as Antuofermo retained his title with the draw Hagler had the boxing skills and killer instinct to knock his opponent out, but instead he played it safe, as Antuofermo closed the gap late in the fight, and that late surge cost Hagler the title [23]\n\n\nWorld champion\nAntuofermo later lost his title to British boxer Alan Minter, who gave Hagler his second title shot Hagler went to Wembley Arena to face Minter The tense atmosphere was stoked further when Minter was quoted as saying that \"No black man is going to take my title\" [24]—Minter later insisted he meant \"that black man\" [25] Hagler took command and his slashing punches soon opened up the cut-prone Minter With Hagler dominating the action, referee Carlos Berrocal halted the fight during the third round to have the four glaring cuts on Minter's face examined Minter's manager, Doug Bidwell, almost immediately conceded defeat Once Berrocal waved the bout off, a riot broke out among the spectators Clive Gammon of Sports Illustrated described the scene as \"a horrifying ululation of howls and boos.\" Hagler and his trainers had to be escorted to their locker room by a phalanx of policemen, all the while enduring a steady rain of beer bottles and glasses After seven years and 50 fights, Hagler was the world middleweight champion.\n\n\nHagler vs. Durán\nA fight against Roberto Durán followed on November 10, 1983 Durán was the first challenger to last the distance with Hagler in a world-championship bout Durán was the WBA light middleweight champion and went up in weight to challenge for Hagler's middleweight crown Hagler won a unanimous 15-round decision, although after 13 rounds, Durán was ahead by one point on two scorecards and even on the third Hagler, with his left eye swollen and cut, came on strong in the last two rounds to win the fight Judge Guy Jutras scored the bout 144–142 Judge Ove Ovesen scored it 144–143 Judge Yusaku Yoshida scored it 146–145.\n\n\nMore title defenses\nThen came Juan Roldán of Argentina, who became the only man to be credited with a knockdown of Hagler, scoring one mere seconds into the fight Hagler protested bitterly that he had been pulled/pushed to the canvas Hagler thumbed Roldan's left eye, then brutalized him over ten rounds and finally stopped him in the middle of round ten Sugar Ray Leonard was calling the fight ringside with HBO analyst Barry Tompkins He noted to Tompkins between rounds that Hagler looked older and slower \"Marvin might finally be slowing down, Barry,\" Leonard remarked Many people believe this is the fight that gave Sugar Ray Leonard the idea that he could actually win a fight with the aging Hagler.\n\n\nHagler vs. Hearns\nAfter conquering Hamsho again, Hagler met Thomas Hearns on April 15, 1985, in what was billed as The Fight; it became known as \"The War\".\n\n\nHagler vs. Mugabi\nNext was Olympic silver medalist John Mugabi of Uganda, who was 26–0 with 26 knockouts and was ranked the number one contender by all three major bodies The fight took place on March 10, 1986, as Hagler had hurt his back and could not fight on the first date booked in 1985 Hagler stopped Mugabi in the eleventh round of a brutal fight Many ringside observers, including analyst Gil Clancy, noticed that Hagler was showing signs of advanced ring wear and age He was much slower of hand and foot and seemed much easier to hit He had also completely morphed his ring style from a slick, quick-fisted, boxer/puncher to a strictly flat-footed, stalking, slugger to compensate for his loss of speed and reflexes Hagler was now said to be seriously considering retirement [26] Hagler's promoter Bob Arum was quoted as saying he was expecting Hagler to retire in the face of being challenged by Sugar Ray Leonard.\n\n\nHagler vs. Leonard\nHagler's next challenger was Sugar Ray Leonard, who was returning to the ring after a three-year retirement (having fought just once in the previous five years) During the pre-fight negotiations, in return for granting Hagler a larger share of the purse, Leonard obtained several conditions which were crucial to his strategy: a 22-by-22-foot (6.7 m × 6.7 m) ring instead of a smaller ring, 10-ounce (280-gram) gloves instead of 8-ounce (230-gram) gloves, and the fight was to be over twelve rounds instead of the 15 rounds favoured by Hagler [27] [28] Leonard was two years younger, had half as many fights and unbeknownst to Hagler, had engaged in several 'real' (i.e gloves, rounds, a referee, judges and no headgear) fights behind closed doors in order to shake off his ring rust The fight took place at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on April 6, 1987 Hagler was the clear betting favorite after a dominant six and a half years as the reigning undisputed middleweight champion of the world, having knocked out all opponents as champion except in winning a very close unanimous decision over 15 rounds against Roberto Durán It was Leonard's first fight at middleweight (160 lb or 73 kg weight limit) The fight was to be for Hagler's WBC, lineal and Ring middleweight titles only, as the WBA stripped Hagler of their belt for choosing to face Leonard instead of WBA mandatory challenger Herol Graham The IBF, while keeping Hagler as their champion, refused to sanction his fight against Leonard and said that the IBF middleweight title would be declared vacant if Hagler lost to Leonard.\n\n\nPost-fight reaction\nOfficial ringside judge JoJo Guerra, whose scorecard of 118–110 in favour of Leonard was derided in many quarters, commented that:\n\n\nRematch\nHagler requested a rematch but Leonard chose to retire again (the third of five high-profile retirements announced by Leonard during his professional boxing career), having announced it beforehand [39] [40] Fourteen months following their fight, Hagler retired from boxing on June 13, 1988, after watching WBA middleweight champion Sumbu Kalambay prevail over his brother, Robbie Sims, via unanimous decision [41] Hagler declared that he was \"tired of waiting\" for Leonard to grant him a rematch Just a month succeeding Hagler's retirement, Leonard announced another boxing comeback to fight against WBC light heavyweight champion Donny Lalonde at the 168-pound (76 kg) super middleweight limit In 1990, Leonard finally offered Hagler a rematch which reportedly would have earned him $15 million, but he declined By then, Hagler had settled down into a new life as an actor in Italy and was now uninterested in his past boxing life [42] [43] Hagler said \"A while ago, yeah, I wanted him so bad, but I'm over that.\" [42] At the 1994 Consumer Electronics Show, Hagler and Leonard had a mock rematch by playing against each other in the video game Boxing Legends of the Ring and claimed that an actual rematch was being planned, though it never happened [44]\n\n\nLife after boxing\nAfter the loss to Leonard, Hagler moved to Italy, where he became a well-known star of action films His roles included a U.S Marine in the films Indio (1989) and Indio 2 (1991) In 1997, he starred alongside Terence Hill and Giselle Blondet in Virtual Weapon Hagler also provided boxing commentary for British television Another foray by Hagler into the entertainment field included work on the video game Fight Night: Round 3.\n\n\nPersonal life\nHagler had five children with his first wife, Bertha [43] Although he owned a home in Bartlett, New Hampshire, Hagler lived in Milan [45] In May 2000, he married his second wife, Kay, an Italian, in Pioltello, Italy [46]\n\n\nDeath\nOn March 13, 2021, Hagler's wife, Kay, announced that he had died of natural causes at his home in New Hampshire at the age of 66 His son James said his father was taken to a New Hampshire hospital after experiencing chest pains and difficulty breathing [47] [48] [49]\n\n\nProfessional boxing

their previous team, the Hawks, played for four seasons in the early 1950s before moving to St Louis in 1955 (they are now based in Atlanta) In October, the Bucks played their first NBA regular-season game against the Chicago Bulls before a Milwaukee Arena crowd of 8,467 As is typical with expansion teams, the Bucks' first season (1968–69) was a struggle Their first victory came in their sixth game as the Bucks beat the Detroit Pistons 134–118; they won only 26 more games in their first year That year, the Bucks' record earned them a coin flip against their expansion cousins, the Phoenix Suns, to see who would get the first pick in the upcoming draft It was considered a foregone conclusion that the first pick in the draft would be Lew Alcindor of UCLA The Bucks won the coin flip, but had to win a bidding war with the New York Nets of the upstart American Basketball Association (ABA) to secure him [14]\n\n\n1968–1969: Team creation\nOn January 22, 1968, the NBA awarded a franchise to

Association (ABA) to secure him [14]\n\n\n1969–1975: The Kareem Abdul-Jabbar era\nWith the addition of Alcindor, the Bucks finished with a 56–26 record in 1969–70, second-best in the league behind the New York Knicks Not only was this a near-reversal of their inaugural season, but the 29-game improvement was the best in league history – a record which would stand for ten years until the Boston Celtics jumped from 29 wins in 1978–79 to 61 in 1979–80 The Bucks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in five games in the Eastern Conference semifinals, only to be dispatched in five by the Knicks in the Eastern finals Alcindor was a runaway selection for NBA Rookie of the Year.\n\n\n1976–1979: Post-Abdul-Jabbar era; \"Green 'n Growing\"\nAfter the deal, the Bucks had several seasons in transition, but most of these players would go on to help the team After being sold to Fitzgerald and several partners in 1976, the Bucks would enter into another era of greatness It began with Don Nelson who became head coach in November 1976 after Larry Costello abruptly resigned In the 1977 draft, the Bucks had three first-round picks and drafted Kent Benson, Marques Johnson and Ernie Grunfeld Johnson would become a staple in the Bucks for years to come Rookie Sidney Moncrief made his debut in 1979 Don Nelson went on to win two NBA Coach of the Year awards with the Bucks, both during seasons where the team won division titles, in 1983 and 1985.\n\n\n1979–1990: The Sidney Moncrief era\nThere, they would win six straight division titles and have .500 seasons for the next 11 years Within those years, the Bucks became perennial Eastern Conference contenders, primarily due to the strong play of Moncrief, Marques Johnson, Paul Pressey, Junior Bridgeman and the arrival of Craig Hodges, Terry Cummings, Ricky Pierce and Jack Sikma from trades with the Los Angeles Clippers and Seattle SuperSonics respectively However, the Bucks were unable to make it to the NBA Finals again, being eliminated by either the Celtics or the Sixers each time.\n\n\nOwnership and arena changes\nIn 1985, Fitzgerald and his partners (one of which was Stuart Shadel) decided to sell the Bucks Fitzgerald was having health problems and some of his investors wanted to get out, and he was reeling from the failure of Sportsvue, a pioneering regional sports network–a failure that came in part because Milwaukee itself was not wired for cable By then, Milwaukee Arena was the smallest arena in the NBA, and the city did not want to build a new one Milwaukee businessman and future U.S Senator Herb Kohl bought the Bucks after fears that out-of-town investors could buy the team and move it out of Milwaukee Before the transaction was complete, broadcaster Lloyd Pettit and his wife, Jane Bradley Pettit, announced they were donating a new arena called the Bradley Center In 2003, after considering selling the team, Kohl announced that he had decided against selling the Bucks to Michael Jordan and would \"continue to own them, improve them and commit them to remaining in Wisconsin\".\n\n\n1990–1998: The period of struggles\nFor most of the 1990s, the Bucks franchise was mired in mediocrity under coaches Frank Hamblen, Mike Dunleavy, and Chris Ford They would make the playoffs only three times during the 1990s, winning only one playoff game From 1991 through 1998, the Bucks suffered a franchise-record seven straight losing seasons During this period, the Bucks drafted Glenn Robinson with the first overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft and in 1996 acquired rookie Ray Allen in a draft-day trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves Both players would have prominent roles in the Bucks' resurgence during the late 1990s At the 1998 NBA draft, the Bucks made a trade that would come back to haunt them for years At the draft, the Bucks selected Dirk Nowitzki with the ninth overall pick, but traded him to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Robert Traylor Many rank this as one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, as Nowitzki would go onto a 21-season career with the Mavericks, winning a championship in 2011 while being named Finals MVP in the process, along with winning the NBA MVP award in 2007 Meanwhile, Traylor would spend just two seasons with the Bucks before joining the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n\n1998–2003: The Big Three era; \"Let It Fly\"\nAfter a decade of dwelling near the bottom of the NBA's standings, the Bucks looked to add credibility to their basketball operations In 1998, the team hired veteran coach George Karl, who had reached the NBA Finals with the Seattle SuperSonics Under the leadership of Karl and general manager Ernie Grunfeld, and with the steady addition of talent such as Tim Thomas and Sam Cassell, the Bucks developed into an elite team in the Eastern Conference The nucleus of the \"big three\"—consisting of Ray Allen, Cassell, and Robinson—along with Karl, created a successful renaissance era in Milwaukee The team reached its zenith in 2000–2001, winning 52 games and their first division title in 15 years The Bucks reached the 2001 Eastern Conference Finals by defeating the Charlotte Hornets They lost the Eastern Conference finals in seven games to the 76ers This era became known for many Bucks fans as the \"Let It Fly\" era, due to the high-scoring offense of the team, personified by the shooting of Robinson and Allen.\n\n\n2003–2009: The Michael Redd era\nUnder the direction of new general manager Larry Harris, the Bucks struggled with inconsistency and injury for the next six years During that period, they reached the playoffs twice, first under coach Terry Porter in 2004 and then under Terry Stotts in 2006 In both instances, they were defeated by the Detroit Pistons in five games During that period, Michael Redd blossomed into an all-star and a perimeter shooting threat, becoming the new \"face of the franchise\" [18] The Bucks received the first pick in the 2005 NBA draft, and used it to select center Andrew Bogut Bogut struggled with both inconsistency and injuries in his first four years in Milwaukee, but over time became a key contributor to the Bucks.\n\n\n2009–2013: The Brandon Jennings era\nIn the 2009 NBA draft, the Milwaukee Bucks selected point guard Brandon Jennings, who had not gone to college but played in Italy the previous year Midway through the season, Bucks' general manager John Hammond

They are members of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and play in the Eastern Conference's Central Division.\n\n**History**\n\nOn January 22, 1968, the NBA awarded a franchise to Milwaukee Professional Sports and Services, Inc (Milwaukee Pro), a group headed by Wesley Pavalon and Marvin Fishman. A fan contest was held to name the new team, with over 40,000 fans participating. While the most-voted fan entry was the Robins, named for Wisconsin's state bird, the contest judges went with the second-most popular choice, the Bucks, which was a reference to Wisconsin's official wild animal, the white-tailed deer. One fan, R D Trebilcox, was awarded a new car for his part in reasoning why the Bucks was a good nickname, saying that bucks were \"spirited, good jumpers, fast and agile.\"\n\nThe Bucks marked a return of the NBA to Milwaukee after 13 years; their previous team, the Hawks, played for four seasons in the early 1950s before moving to St Louis in 1955 (they are now based in Atlanta). In October, the Bucks played their first NBA regular-season game against the Chicago Bulls before a Milwaukee Arena crowd of 8,467. As is typical with expansion teams, the Bucks' first season (1968–69) was a struggle. Their first victory came in their sixth game as the Bucks beat the Detroit Pistons 134–118; they won only 26 more games in their first year. That year, the Bucks' record earned them a coin flip against their expansion cousins, the Phoenix Suns, to see who would get the first pick in the upcoming draft. It was considered a foregone conclusion that the first pick in the draft would be Lew Alcindor of UCLA. The Bucks won the coin flip, but had to win a bidding war with the New York Nets of the upstart American Basketball Association (ABA) to secure him.\n\n**1968–1975: The Kareem Abdul-Jabbar era**\n\nWith the addition of Alcindor, the Bucks finished with a 56–26 record in 1969–70, second-best in the league behind the New York Knicks. Not only was this a near-reversal of their inaugural season, but the 29-game improvement was the best in league history – a record which would stand for ten years until the Boston Celtics jumped from 29 wins in 1978–79 to 61 in 1979–80. The Bucks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in five games in the Eastern Conference semifinals, only to be dispatched in five by the Knicks in the Eastern finals Alcindor was a runaway selection for NBA Rookie of the Year.\n\nAfter the deal, the Bucks had several seasons in transition, but most of these players would go on to help the team. Being sold to Fitzgerald and several partners in 1976, the Bucks would enter into another era of greatness. It began with Don Nelson who became head coach in November 1976 after Larry Costello abruptly resigned. In the 1977 draft, the Bucks had three first-round picks and drafted Kent Benson, Marques Johnson and Ernie Grunfeld Johnson would become a staple in the Bucks for years to come. Rookie Sidney Moncrief made his debut in 1979. Don Nelson went on to win two NBA Coach of the Year awards with the Bucks, both during seasons where the team won division titles, in 1983 and 1985.\n\n**1979–1990: The Sidney Moncrief era**\n\nThere, they would win six straight division titles and have .500 seasons for the next 11 years. Within those years, the Bucks became perennial Eastern Conference contenders, primarily due to the strong play of Moncrief, Marques Johnson, Paul Pressey, Junior Bridgeman and the arrival of Craig Hodges, Terry Cummings, Ricky Pierce and Jack Sikma from trades with the Los Angeles Clippers and Seattle SuperSonics respectively. However, the Bucks were unable to make it to the NBA Finals again, being eliminated by either the Celtics or the Sixers each time.\n\n**Ownership and arena changes**\n\nIn 1985, Fitzgerald and his partners (one of which was Stuart Shadel) decided to sell the Bucks. Fitzgerald was having health problems and some of his investors wanted to get out, and he was reeling from the failure of Sportsvue, a pioneering regional sports network–a failure that came in part because Milwaukee itself was not wired for cable. By then, Milwaukee Arena was the smallest arena in the NBA, and the city did not want to build a new one. Milwaukee businessman and future U.S Senator Herb Kohl bought the Bucks after fears that out-of-town investors could buy the team and move it out of Milwaukee. Before the transaction was complete, broadcaster Lloyd Pettit and his wife, Jane Bradley Pettit, announced they were donating a new arena called the Bradley Center.\n\n**1990–1998: The period of struggles**\n\nFor most of the 1990s, the Bucks franchise was mired in mediocrity under coaches Frank Hamblen, Mike Dunleavy, and Chris Ford. They would make the playoffs only three times during the 1990s, winning only one playoff game. From 1991 through 1998, the Bucks suffered a franchise-record seven straight losing seasons. During this period, the Bucks drafted Glenn Robinson with the first overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft and in 1996 acquired rookie Ray Allen in a draft-day trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Both players would have prominent roles in the Bucks' resurgence during the late 1990s. At the 1998 NBA draft, the Bucks made a trade that would come back to haunt them for years. At the draft, the Bucks selected Dirk Nowitzki with the ninth overall pick, but traded him to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Robert Traylor. Many rank this as one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, as Nowitzki would go onto a 21-season career with the Mavericks, winning a championship in 2011 while being named Finals MVP in the process, along with winning the NBA MVP award in 2007. Meanwhile, Traylor would spend just two seasons with the Bucks before joining the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n**1998–2003: The Big Three era; \"Let It Fly\"**\n\nAfter a decade of dwelling near the bottom of the NBA's standings, the Bucks looked to add credibility to their basketball operations. In 1998, the team hired veteran coach George Karl, who had reached the NBA Finals with the Seattle SuperSonics. Under the leadership of Karl and general manager Ernie Grunfeld, and with the steady addition of talent such as Tim Thomas and Sam Cassell, the Bucks developed into an elite team in the Eastern Conference. The nucleus of the \"big three\"—consisting of Ray Allen, Cassell, and Robinson—along with Karl, created a successful renaissance era in Milwaukee. The team reached its zenith in 2000–2001, winning 52 games and their first division title in 15 years. The Bucks reached the 2001 Eastern Conference Finals by defeating the Charlotte Hornets. They lost the Eastern Conference finals in seven games to the 76ers. This era became known for many Bucks fans as the \"Let It Fly\" era, due to the high-scoring offense of the team, personified by the shooting of Robinson and Allen.\n\n**2003–2009: The Michael Redd era**\n\nUnder the direction of new general manager Larry Harris, the Bucks struggled with inconsistency and injury for the next six years. During that period, they reached the playoffs twice, first under coach Terry Porter in 2004 and then under Terry Stotts in 2006. In both instances, they were defeated by the Detroit Pistons in five games. During that period, Michael Redd blossomed into an all-star and a perimeter shooting threat, becoming the new \"face of the franchise.\"\n\n**2009–2013: The Brandon Jennings era**\n\nIn the 2009 NBA draft, the Milwaukee Bucks selected point guard Brandon Jennings, who had not gone to college but played in Italy the previous year. Midway through the season, Bucks' general manager John Hammond traded Hakim Warrick to the Chicago Bulls, and acquired John Salmons. In a Bucks uniform, Salmons averaged a team-leading 19.9 points per game. The play of Jennings, along with the improvement of Andrew Bogut, the improved Ersan İlyasova, and the Salmons trade, catapulted the team to be a playoff contender. At the beginning of the season, the Bucks had low playoffs expectations; they had not been in four years. In October, the Bucks quickly fell behind the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Central Division, but Milwaukee ultimately clinched a playoff berth on April 6, 2010, with a road win over the Chicago Bulls.\n\n**2013–present: The Giannis Antetokounmpo era**\n\nJim Boylan was relieved of his coaching duties and ex-Atlanta Hawks coach Larry Drew was hired. On June 27, 2013, the Bucks chose Greek forward Giannis Antetokounmpo with the 15th overall pick of the 2013 NBA draft. They also brought in O J Mayo, Carlos Delfino, Zaza Pachulia, and Gary Neal as well as seeing Monta Ellis opt-out of the final year of his contract. The Bucks also agreed to sign-and-trade Brandon Jennings to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Brandon Knight, Khris Middleton, and Viacheslav Kravtsov. The Bucks later extended their contract with Larry Sanders with a four-year, $44 million contract and traded Ish Smith and Kravtsov to the Phoenix Suns for Caron Butler. By the start of the 2013–14 season, the Bucks only had four players on their roster from the previous season. The season itself was a struggle, as the Bucks finished with the worst record in the league at 15–67, the worst record in team history.\n\n**2014–2018: under Jason Kidd**\n\nOn July 1, 2014, the Milwaukee Bucks secured the coaching rights for Jason Kidd from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for two second-round draft picks in the 2015 NBA draft, and the 2019 NBA draft. With the acquisition of Kidd, the team fired coach Larry Drew.\n\n**2018–2023: under Mike Budenholzer**\n\nOn May 17, 2018, the Bucks announced former San Antonio Spurs' assistant coach and former Atlanta Hawks head coach Mike Budenholzer as their new head coach. On August 26, 2018, the Bucks' new arena, Fiserv Forum, opened to the public.\n\n**2023–present: coaching changes, arrival of Damian Lillard**\n\nOn June 5, 2023, the Bucks announced that former Toronto Raptors assistant coach Adrian Griffin would be their new head coach. On September 27, 2023, the Bucks acquired seven-time all-star point guard Damian Lillard in a 3-team trade. On January 23, 2024, the Bucks fired Griffin after only 43 games. On January 26, 2024, the Bucks named Doc Rivers as the new head coach.\n\n**Mascot**\n\nThe Bucks' official mascot is Bango. The word \"Bango\" was originally coined by Eddie Doucette, the longtime play-by-play announcer for the Bucks. Doucette used the word whenever a Bucks player connected on a long-range basket. It was often used for sharpshooter Jon McGlocklin. When it came time for the Bucks to choose a name for their new mascot, the name \"Bango\" won the contest.\n\n**Logos and uniforms**\n\nThe Bucks entered the NBA wearing hunter green and white uniforms with red trim. The white uniform featured \"Bucks\" in green serifed letters with red trim and block numbers, while the green uniform has \"Milwaukee\" in white serifed letters with red trim. Both sets have the deer head logo on the left leg. The Bucks would bring back the green uniform in the 2002–03 season, and the white uniform in the 2017–18 season as part of the league's \"Classic\" uniform series.\n\n**Season-by-season

In the 1977 draft, the Bucks had three first-round picks and drafted Kent Benson, Marques Johnson and Ernie Grunfeld Johnson would become a staple in the Bucks for years to come Rookie Sidney Moncrief made his debut in 1979 Don Nelson went on to win two NBA Coach of the Year awards with the Bucks, both during seasons where the team won division titles, in 1983 and 1985.\n\n\n1979–1990: The Sidney Moncrief era\nThere, they would win six straight division titles and have .500 seasons for the next 11 years Within those years, the Bucks became perennial Eastern Conference contenders, primarily due to the strong play of Moncrief, Marques Johnson, Paul Pressey, Junior Bridgeman and the arrival of Craig Hodges, Terry Cummings, Ricky Pierce and Jack Sikma from trades with the Los Angeles Clippers and Seattle SuperSonics respectively However, the Bucks were unable to make it to the NBA Finals again, being eliminated by either the Celtics or the Sixers each time.\n\n\nOwnership and arena changes\nIn 1985, Fitzgerald and his partners (one of which was Stuart Shadel) decided to sell the Bucks Fitzgerald was having health problems and some of his investors wanted to get out, and he was reeling from the failure of Sportsvue, a pioneering regional sports network–a failure that came in part because Milwaukee itself was not wired for cable By then, Milwaukee Arena was the smallest arena in the NBA, and the city did not want to build a new one Milwaukee businessman and future U.S Senator Herb Kohl bought the Bucks after fears that out-of-town investors could buy the team and move it out of Milwaukee Before the transaction was complete, broadcaster Lloyd Pettit and his wife, Jane Bradley Pettit, announced they were donating a new arena called the Bradley Center In 2003, after considering selling the team, Kohl announced that he had decided against selling the Bucks to Michael Jordan and would \"continue to own them, improve them and commit them to remaining in Wisconsin\".\n\n\n1990–1998: The period of struggles\nFor most of the 1990s, the Bucks franchise was mired in mediocrity under coaches Frank Hamblen, Mike Dunleavy, and Chris Ford They would make the playoffs only three times during the 1990s, winning only one playoff game From 1991 through 1998, the Bucks suffered a franchise-record seven straight losing seasons During this period, the Bucks drafted Glenn Robinson with the first overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft and in 1996 acquired rookie Ray Allen in a draft-day trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves Both players would have prominent roles in the Bucks' resurgence during the late 1990s At the 1998 NBA draft, the Bucks made a trade that would come back to haunt them for years At the draft, the Bucks selected Dirk Nowitzki with the ninth overall pick, but traded him to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Robert Traylor Many rank this as one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, as Nowitzki would go onto a 21-season career with the Mavericks, winning a championship in 2011 while being named Finals MVP in the process, along with winning the NBA MVP award in 2007 Meanwhile, Traylor would spend just two seasons with the Bucks before joining the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n\n1998–2003: The Big Three era; \"Let It Fly\"\nAfter a decade of dwelling near the bottom of the NBA's standings, the Bucks looked to add credibility to their basketball operations In 1998, the team hired veteran coach George Karl, who had reached the NBA Finals with the Seattle SuperSonics Under the leadership of Karl and general manager Ernie Grunfeld, and with the steady addition of talent such as Tim Thomas and Sam Cassell, the Bucks developed into an elite team in the Eastern Conference The nucleus of the \"big three\"—consisting of Ray Allen, Cassell, and Robinson—along with Karl, created a successful renaissance era in Milwaukee The team reached its zenith in 2000–2001, winning 52 games and their first division title in 15 years The Bucks reached the 2001 Eastern Conference Finals by defeating the Charlotte Hornets They lost the Eastern Conference finals in seven games to the 76ers This era became known for many Bucks fans as the \"Let It Fly\" era, due to the high-scoring offense of the team, personified by the shooting of Robinson and Allen.\n\n\n2003–2009: The Michael Redd era\nUnder the direction of new general manager Larry Harris, the Bucks struggled with inconsistency and injury for the next six years During that period, they reached the playoffs twice, first under coach Terry Porter in 2004 and then under Terry Stotts in 2006 In both instances, they were defeated by the Detroit Pistons in five games During that period, Michael Redd blossomed into an all-star and a perimeter shooting threat, becoming the new \"face of the franchise\" [18] The Bucks received the first pick in the 2005 NBA draft, and used it to select center Andrew Bogut Bogut struggled with both inconsistency and injuries in his first four years in Milwaukee, but over time became a key contributor to the Bucks.\n\n\n2009–2013: The Brandon Jennings era\nIn the 2009 NBA draft, the Milwaukee Bucks selected point guard Brandon Jennings, who had not gone to college but played in Italy the previous year Midway through the season, Bucks' general manager John Hammond traded Hakim Warrick to the Chicago Bulls, and acquired John Salmons In a Bucks uniform, Salmons averaged a team-leading 19.9 points per game The play of Jennings, along with the improvement of Andrew Bogut, the improved Ersan İlyasova, and the Salmons trade, catapulted the team to be a playoff contender At the beginning of the season, the Bucks had low playoffs expectations; they had not been in four years [21] In October, the Bucks quickly fell behind the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Central Division, but Milwaukee ultimately clinched a playoff berth on April 6, 2010, with a road win over the Chicago Bulls.\n\n\n2013–present: The Giannis Antetokounmpo era\nJim Boylan was relieved of his coaching duties and ex-Atlanta Hawks coach Larry Drew was hired On June 27, 2013, the Bucks chose Greek forward Giannis Antetokounmpo with the 15th overall pick of the 2013 NBA draft They also brought in O J Mayo, Carlos Delfino, Zaza Pachulia, and Gary Neal as well as seeing Monta Ellis opt-out of the final year of his contract The Bucks also agreed to sign-and-trade Brandon Jennings to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Brandon Knight, Khris Middleton, and Viacheslav Kravtsov The Bucks later extended their contract with Larry Sanders with a four-year, $44 million contract and traded Ish Smith and Kravtsov to the Phoenix Suns for Caron Butler By the start of the 2013–14 season, the Bucks only had four players on their roster from the previous season The season itself was a struggle, as the Bucks finished with the worst record in the league at 15–67, the worst record in team history.\n\n\n2013–2014: under Larry Drew\nJim Boylan was relieved of his

following individuals and groups are among the owners of the Bucks:\n\n\nMascot\nThe Bucks' official mascot is Bango The word \"Bango\" was originally coined by Eddie Doucette, the longtime play-by-play announcer for the Bucks Doucette used the word whenever a Bucks player connected on a long-range basket It was often used for sharpshooter Jon McGlocklin When it came time for the Bucks to choose a name for their new mascot, the name \"Bango\" won the contest [65]\n\n\nLogos and uniforms\nThe Bucks entered the NBA wearing hunter green and white uniforms with red trim The white

uniforms It now featured side stripes of kelly, lime and hunter green (a.k.a the \"Irish Rainbows\") Both the hunter green and white uniforms featured the streamlined \"Bucks\" lettering from the team logo and block lettering They removed the color red prior to the 1985–86 season, while lime green was promoted to accent color.\n\n\n1993–2006\nThe Bucks changed their logo and uniforms for the

In general, it refers to something that is not defined or explained, often due to a lack of information or a failure to specify the details.\n\nMathematics\n-----------\n\nIn mathematics, \"undefined\" refers to a term or concept that is not defined or explained, often because it is too complex or abstract to be expressed in mathematical terms. This can occur when working with mathematical concepts that are not yet fully understood or when dealing with mathematical objects that do not have a clear definition.\n\n### Undefined Terms\n\nIn mathematics, undefined terms are used to describe mathematical concepts that are not yet fully understood or that require a deeper level of understanding to be defined. Some examples of undefined terms in mathematics include:\n\n* Point\n* Line\n* Plane\n* Angle\n* Infinity\n\nThese terms are considered undefined because they are not easily expressed in mathematical terms, and their meanings are often taken for granted. However, they are essential to the development of mathematical concepts and are used as a foundation for more complex ideas.\n\n### Undefined Quantities\n\nIn mathematics, undefined quantities refer to numbers or values that are not defined or explained. This can occur when dealing with mathematical expressions that involve variables or unknown values. Some examples of undefined quantities in mathematics include:\n\n* x in the equation 2x + 3 = 5\n* y in the equation y^2 + 4 = 0\n\nIn these cases, the values of x and y are not defined and must be solved for in order to find the solution to the equation.\n\nComputing\n----------\n\nIn computing, \"undefined\" refers to a term or concept that is not defined or explained, often due to a lack of information or a failure to specify the details.

Born on June 24, 1971, in Jackson, Mississippi, Notaro has become known for her unique blend of humor, wit, and vulnerability.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nNotaro was born to Mathilde \"Susie\" O'Callaghan and Pat Notaro. Her mother was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, and later moved to Mississippi. Notaro's family relocated to Spring, Texas, a suburb of Houston, when she was young. She has a brother, Renaud, who is a year older and works as a radio talk show host. Notaro's childhood nickname, \"Tig,\" was given to her by her brother when she was two years old. The family was Catholic, and Notaro has credited her upbringing with shaping her perspective on life and humor.\n\n**Career**\n\nNotaro's entry into the entertainment industry began with her passion for music. She became a band manager, working under the name Tignation Promotions in the mid-1990s. Her work promoting bands took her to Los Angeles, where she tried stand-up comedy for the first time in the late 1990s. Notaro's unique voice and perspective quickly gained attention, and she became a regular on Comedy Central Presents. She also appeared on The Sarah Silverman Program as a lesbian police officer, a role that showcased her versatility as a comedian.\n\nNotaro frequently collaborates with her writing partner, Kyle Dunnigan. Together, they co-hosted the popular podcast Professor Blastoff from May 2011 until July 2015. Dunnigan and Notaro's chemistry and comedic timing made the podcast a hit, and it remains one of the most beloved comedy podcasts of the past decade.\n\n**Comedic Style**\n\nNotaro's approach to comedy is characterized by her fearlessness and willingness to tackle difficult topics. She has said, \"I'm always going to do whatever I think is funniest. If something's dark, I'll do it. If it's a sock puppet... There's no preconceived idea of who I think I might be now.\" Notaro's comedy is not for the faint of heart, but it is also deeply human and relatable.\n\nIn the years following her cancer diagnosis, Notaro has shifted her focus from dark comedy to more personal and introspective material. She has reflected on her childhood and life, sharing stories and anecdotes that are both humorous and poignant. Notaro's willingness to be vulnerable and honest has resonated with audiences and helped to establish her as one of the most innovative and exciting comedians working today.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nNotaro met her wife, Stephanie Allynne, on the set of the film In a World... in 2012. The two were engaged on January 1, 2015, and married on October 24, 2015, by a Catholic deacon (Notaro's cousin). In 2016, Notaro and Allynne welcomed twin sons, conceived via a surrogate using Allynne's eggs.\n\n**Cancer**\n\nOn July 30, 2012, Notaro was diagnosed with cancer in both breasts. Just days later, she addressed her cancer diagnosis and other personal difficulties during a live stage show at Largo in Los Angeles.

Revolution\n USSR 1922–41\n Kingdom of Romania 1941–44\n USSR 1944–91\n Ukraine 1991–present\n\n\nEarly history\nOdesa was the site of a large Greek settlement no later than the middle of the 6th century BC (a necropolis from the 5th–3rd centuries BC has long been known in this area) Some scholars believe it to have been a trade settlement established by the Greek city of Histria Whether the Bay of Odesa is the ancient \"Port of the Histrians\" cannot yet be considered a settled question based on the available evidence [36] Archaeological artifacts confirm extensive links between the Odesa area and the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n\nOttoman conquest\nKhadjibey came under direct control of the Ottoman Empire after 1529 [37] In the mid-18th century, the Ottomans rebuilt the fortress at Khadjibey (also known as Hocabey), which was named Yeni Dünya [37] (literally \"New World\").\n\n\nRussian conquest of Sanjak of Özi (Ochakiv Oblast)\nA series of wars between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, as well as the demise of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, allowed Russia to start to fully exploit the ancient Black Sea trade across the coastal area through the steppe across southern and eastern Ukraine, into the hinterland of East Central Europe Stable commercial activity in this region in practice in the past required both security through the overland routes, and knowledge of where products could go overseas In antiquity, various Greek colonies had taken this role, followed by the Varangians who established Kievan Rus' in the 9th century, as well as various Italian colonies after the Mongol invasion of Europe [22]: 1-3  Under Catherine the Great, Russia gained, via the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, the lands where Mariupol, Kherson, and Mykolaiv would be founded However, they were all handicapped in various ways relative to how much commercial interest there was For example, the latter two cities were situated in lowlands near marshes, which provided for poor sanitary conditions in the technology available at that time [22]: 5 \n\n\nRenaming of the settlement and establishment of sea port\nIn 1795, Khadjibey was officially renamed with the feminine name \"Одесса (Odessa)\" after a Greek colony of Odessos that supposedly was located in the area The first census that was conducted in Odesa was in 1797 which accounted for 3,455 people [37] Since 1795, the city had its own city magistrate, and since 1796 a city council of six members and the Odesa Commodity Exchange [37] In 1801, in Odesa had opened the first commercial bank [37] In 1803, the city accounted for 9,000 people [44]\n\n\nBeginnings of revolution\nIn 1905, Odesa was the site of a workers' uprising supported by the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin and the Menshevik's Iskra Sergei Eisenstein's famous motion picture The Battleship Potemkin commemorated the uprising and included a scene where hundreds of Odesan citizens were murdered on the great stone staircase (now popularly known as the \"Potemkin Steps\"), in one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history At the top of the steps, which lead down to the port, stands a statue of the Duc de Richelieu [56]\n\n\nWorld War II\nDuring World War II, Odesa was attacked by Romanian and German troops in August 1941 The defense of Odesa started on 5 August 1941 and lasted for 73 days The defense was organized on three lines with emplacements consisting of trenches, anti-tank ditches and pillboxes The first line was 80 kilometres (50 miles) long and situated some 25 to 30 kilometres (16 to 19 miles) from the city The second and main line of defense was situated 6 to 8 kilometres (3.7 to 5.0 miles) from the city and was about 30 kilometres (19 miles) long The third and last line of defense was organized inside the city itself Lyudmila Pavlichenko, the famous female sniper, took part in the battle for Odesa She recorded 187 confirmed kills during the defense of Odesa Pavlichenko's confirmed kills during World War II totaled 309 (including 36 enemy snipers).\n\n\nPostwar Soviet period\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the city grew Nevertheless, the majority of Odesa's Jews emigrated to Israel, the United States and other Western countries between the 1970s and 1990s [citation needed] Many ended up in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brighton Beach, sometimes known as \"Little Odesa\" Domestic migration of the Odesan middle and upper classes to Moscow and Leningrad, cities that offered even greater opportunities for career advancement, also occurred on a large scale Despite this, the city grew rapidly by filling the void of those left with new migrants from rural Ukraine and industrial professionals invited from all over the Soviet Union.\n\n\nIndependence

century BC (a necropolis from the 5th–3rd centuries BC has long been known in this area) Some scholars believe it to have been a trade settlement established by the Greek city of Histria Whether the Bay of Odesa is the ancient \"Port of the Histrians\" cannot yet be considered a settled question based on the available evidence [36] Archaeological artifacts confirm extensive links between the Odesa area and the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n\nOttoman conquest\nKhadjibey came under direct control of the Ottoman Empire after 1529 [37] In the mid-18th century, the Ottomans rebuilt the fortress at Khadjibey (also known as Hocabey), which was named Yeni Dünya [37] (literally \"New World\").\n\n\nRussian conquest of Sanjak of Özi (Ochakiv Oblast)\nA series of wars between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, as well as the demise of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, allowed Russia to start to fully exploit the ancient Black Sea trade across the coastal area through the steppe across southern and eastern Ukraine, into the hinterland of East Central Europe Stable commercial activity in this region in practice in the past required both security through the overland routes, and knowledge of where products could go overseas In antiquity, various Greek colonies had taken this role, followed by the Varangians who established Kievan Rus' in the 9th century, as well as various Italian colonies after the Mongol invasion of Europe [22]: 1-3  Under Catherine the Great, Russia gained, via the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, the lands where Mariupol, Kherson, and Mykolaiv would be founded However, they were all handicapped in various ways relative to how much commercial interest there was For example, the latter two cities were situated in lowlands near marshes, which provided for poor sanitary conditions in the technology available at that time [22]: 5 \n\n\nRenaming of the settlement and establishment of sea port\nIn 1795, Khadjibey was officially renamed with the feminine name \"Одесса (Odessa)\" after a Greek colony of Odessos that supposedly was located in the area The first census that was conducted in Odesa was in 1797 which accounted for 3,455 people [37] Since 1795, the city had its own city magistrate, and since 1796 a city council of six members and the Odesa Commodity Exchange [37] In 1801, in Odesa had opened the first commercial bank [37] In 1803, the city accounted for 9,000 people [44]\n\n\nBeginnings of revolution\nIn 1905, Odesa was the site of a workers' uprising supported by the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin and the Menshevik's Iskra Sergei Eisenstein's famous motion picture The Battleship Potemkin commemorated the uprising and included a scene where hundreds of Odesan citizens were murdered on the great stone staircase (now popularly known as the \"Potemkin Steps\"), in one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history At the top of the steps, which lead down to the port, stands a statue of the Duc de Richelieu [56]\n\n\nWorld War II\nDuring World War II, Odesa was attacked by Romanian and German troops in August 1941 The defense of Odesa started on 5 August 1941 and lasted for 73 days The defense was organized on three lines with emplacements consisting of trenches, anti-tank ditches and pillboxes The first line was 80 kilometres (50 miles) long and situated some 25 to 30 kilometres (16 to 19 miles) from the city The second and main line of defense was situated 6 to 8 kilometres (3.7 to 5.0 miles) from the city and was about 30 kilometres (19 miles) long The third and last line of defense was organized inside the city itself Lyudmila Pavlichenko, the famous female sniper, took part in the battle for Odesa She recorded 187 confirmed kills during the defense of Odesa Pavlichenko's confirmed kills during World War II totaled 309 (including 36 enemy snipers).\n\n\nPostwar Soviet period\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the city grew Nevertheless, the majority of Odesa's Jews emigrated to Israel, the United States and other Western countries between the 1970s and 1990s [citation needed] Many ended up in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brighton Beach, sometimes known as \"Little Odesa\" Domestic migration of the Odesan middle and upper classes to Moscow and Leningrad, cities that offered even greater opportunities for career advancement, also occurred on a large scale Despite this, the city grew rapidly by filling the void of those left with new migrants from rural Ukraine and industrial professionals invited from all over the Soviet Union.\n\n\nIndependence

affecting the industry in mid-March 2020, WWE had to present the majority of its programming from a behind closed doors set Initially, Raw and SmackDown's television shows and PPVs were done at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida [7] A limited number of Performance Center trainees and friends and family members of the wrestlers were later utilized to serve as the live audience [8] [9] In late August, these programs were moved to a bio-secure bubble called the WWE ThunderDome The select live audience was no longer utilized as the bubble allowed fans to attend the events virtually for free and be seen on the nearly 1,000 LED boards within the arena Additionally, the ThunderDome utilized various special effects to further enhance wrestlers' entrances, and arena audio was mixed with that of the chants from the virtual fans [10] After being hosted at Orlando's Amway Center, [11] the ThunderDome was relocated to Tropicana Field in St Petersburg, Florida in December [12]

A limited number of Performance Center trainees and friends and family members of the wrestlers were later utilized to serve as the live audience.

The select live audience was no longer utilized as the bubble allowed fans to attend the events virtually for free and be seen on the nearly 1,000 LED boards within the arena.

addition to engineering innovations, David Bradley also developed early initiatives in advertising to children such as what was known as the \"Birthday Book\" This was a book containing all the birth dates of the children living within the area of the Park that he could obtain In doing so, he made it possible to send each of them a balloon and a greeting card for their birthdays, [2] which were often celebrated at the Park itself For example, Bunker Spreckels, son of Kay Williams, celebrated his third birthday there [6]\n\n\n\"Guest Book\"\nBesides the Birthday book, Bradley created a

Hills, Los Angeles County, California, USA. The park was affectionately known as \"Kiddieland\" due to its primary focus on children's entertainment. This article will explore the history, operations, and legacy of Beverly Park, a iconic destination that captured the hearts of many Angelenos during its 31-year run.\n\n**Location and Access**\n\nBeverly Park was situated in a rural area of Beverly Hills, a location that was particularly suitable for an amusement park due to its spacious grounds and proximity to major roads. The park was located next to the largest drugstore in the world, which added to its visibility and accessibility. Nearby, Ponyland, another amusement site owned and operated by Leo \"Pat\" Murphy and his wife Viva, was also a popular destination for families.\n\nInitially, the park measured 200 by 200 feet (0.91 acres), but it doubled in size in the first four years to reach 400 by 200 feet (1.83 acres) by 1947. This expansion allowed the park to accommodate more rides, restaurants, and amenities, making it a more comprehensive entertainment destination.\n\n**History**\n\nThe concept of \"Kiddieland\" emerged in the aftermath of World War II, as the amusement park industry experienced a surge in popularity due to the post-war economic situation and the baby boom that occurred until the 1960s. The idea of creating a park specifically designed for children was born out of the need for family-friendly entertainment and a sense of nostalgia for a bygone era.\n\nBeverly Park was built in 1943 by Frock & Meyer Company, but it was later purchased by Dave Bradley and his partner Donald Kaye in 1945. Bradley, an innovator in the amusement park industry, brought his expertise and enthusiasm for creating a park that would become a beloved destination for children.\n\n**Origins**\n\nThe idea of creating a park specifically designed for children was a revolutionary concept at the time. The term \"Kiddieland\" was not a franchise in its original sense but rather a general noun identifying amusement parks designed specifically for children. Redondo Beach, West Los Angeles, Woodland Hills, and Westchester were among the locations in Los Angeles County where Kiddielands were built.\n\nBeverly Park was a hub for entertainment, offering a unique blend of rides, restaurants, and amenities that catered to children and families. The park's popularity was fueled by its innovative approach to entertainment, which included the creation of themed areas, interactive exhibits, and a range of attractions that catered to different age groups.\n\n**From the Opening**\n\nWhen Beverly Park opened in 1943, it featured 12 child-sized rides, including roller coasters and fun houses, as well as several restaurants, places dedicated to animals, food stands, and candy shops. The park's initial success was fueled by its innovative approach to entertainment and its commitment to providing a safe and enjoyable experience for children.\n\nThe park's founders, Dave Bradley and Donald Kaye, were instrumental in shaping the park's vision and operations. They brought a wealth of experience in the amusement park industry and a deep understanding of what children and families wanted in an entertainment destination.\n\n**Operating Years**\n\nDuring its operating years, Beverly Park underwent several changes and expansions. The park's management team, led by Dave Bradley and his family, worked tirelessly to ensure that the park remained a popular destination for families. The park's popularity was fueled by its innovative approach to entertainment, which included the creation of themed areas, interactive exhibits, and a range of attractions that catered to different age groups.\n\nThe park's success was also fueled by its commitment to customer service and its reputation for providing a safe and enjoyable experience for children. The park's management team worked closely with families and community leaders to ensure that the park remained a beloved destination for generations of Angelenos.\n\n**To the Closure**\n\nIn the late 1950s, the amusement park industry peaked, and Beverly Park was no exception. However, the park's popularity began to decline in the 1960s due to a range of factors, including urban decay, suburban growth, and the creation and rapid growth of new entertainment sources, such as television.\n\nDespite its decline, Beverly Park remained a beloved destination for families until its closure in 1974. The park's legacy lived on, however, as many Angelenos continued to remember the park fondly and share stories of its importance in their lives.\n\n**Amenities**\n\nBeverly Park was known for its wide range of amenities, including food stands, restaurants, and places dedicated to animals. The park's food stands offered a variety of snacks, including popcorn, hot dogs, cotton candy, and peanuts. These snacks were packed in striped paper bags, which made them easily recognizable and added to the overall feel and atmosphere of the park.\n\nThe park's restaurants offered a range of dining options, from burgers and sandwiches to salads and snacks. The park's places dedicated to animals, such as the petting zoo and the pony rides, were also popular attractions.\n\n**Rides**\n\nBeverly Park featured a range of rides, including roller coasters, fun houses, and child-sized attractions. The park's rides were designed to cater to different age groups and provided a unique experience for children and families.\n\nThe park's roller coasters were a particular favorite among visitors, offering a thrilling experience that was both exciting and safe. The park's fun houses, on the other hand, provided a unique experience that was both entertaining and interactive.\n\n**Marketing and Publicity**\n\nDave Bradley was instrumental in publicizing the park and creating a buzz around its opening. He used a range of marketing and publicity techniques, including regular coverage in Billboard magazine, to promote the park and attract visitors.\n\nBradley also didn't discourage gate-crashers, which added to the park's reputation for being a popular destination for families. The park's marketing and publicity efforts helped to create a sense of excitement and anticipation around its opening, which fueled its popularity and made it a beloved destination for generations of Angelenos.\n\n**\"Birthday Book\"**\n\nIn addition to engineering innovations, David Bradley also developed early initiatives in advertising to children, such as the \"Birthday Book.\" This was a book containing all the birth dates of the children living within the area of the park that he could obtain. By doing so, he made it possible to send each of them a balloon and a greeting card for their birthdays, which were often celebrated at the park itself.\n\n**\"Guest Book\"**\n\nBradley also created a \"Guest Book,\" which contained the signatures of many famous people who were regular clients of the park. These included celebrities such as Glen Ford, Charles Boyer, Bob Hutton, Robert Walker, Mary Pickford, Paul Henreid, Ann Rutherford, Ingrid Bergman, Judy Garland, Charles Chaplin, Oona O'Neil, Cleatus Caldwell, Norman Taurog, Kay Kyser, Jack Carson, Ken Murray, Joan Bennett, Walter Wanger, Franchot Tone, Brian Donlevy, Roy Rogers, Margaret O'Brien, and John Garfield, among others.\n\nThe guest book was not only a fun way for visitors to see which celebrities had visited the park but also contributed to improve its reputation. The park's management team worked closely with families and community leaders to ensure that the park remained a beloved destination for generations of Angelenos.\n\n**The Kiddieland Site in the Present Day**\n\nThe original site of Beverly Park is now the location of the Beverly Center Shopping Mall and the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The park's site was originally occupied by underground oil wells, which can still be found underneath the modern buildings.\n\n**Beverly Park in Popular Culture**\n\nBeverly Park has been widely referenced in popular fiction, including books and films. The park's legacy continues to be celebrated by many Angelenos who remember it fondly and share stories of its importance in their lives.\n\n**Remembering Beverly Park**\n\nDuring the last twenty years of the park's operations, from 1954 to 1974, the site was filled with up to 30,000 visitors on a single weekend. Beverly Park's popularity is still widely remembered by many Los Angeles area citizens who used to enjoy its rides.\n\nIn the fall of 2020, the City of West Hollywood's Art Division presented \"Remembering Beverly Park,\" an exhibition shown at the West Hollywood Library. The event was intended to bring the memory of Beverly Park to life by displaying photographs taken from Jay Jennings' book dedicated to the amusement park: Beverly Park: L.A.'s Kiddieland, 1943-74.",

{"title": "Rajaraja_I", "content": "\nEarly life\nRajaraja was the son of Chola King Parantaka II, also known as Sundara Chola, and Queen Vanavan Mahadevi  [15] As recorded in the Thiruvalangadu copper-plate inscription, his birth name was Arun Mozhi Varman, meaning “The Word of Sun Clan.” [1] [16] He was born around 947 CE during the Tamil month of Aipassi, under the Sadhayam star [17] The Government of Tamil Nadu recognizes his birthdate as 3 November 947 [18] Rajaraja had an elder brother, Aditha II, [3] and an elder sister, Kundavai [19]\n\n\nMilitary conquests\nWhen Rajaraja came into power, he inherited a kingdom that was only centered around the Thanjavur-Tiruchirappalli region, which was the heart of traditional Chola territory [1] However, this kingdom was not very large, and it was still recovering from attacks by the Rashtrakutas in previous years Rajaraja changed this by transforming the kingdom into a well-organized empire with a powerful army and navy Under his rule, the northern kingdom of Vengi became closely allied with the Cholas, and their influence expanded along the eastern coast all the way up to Kalinga in the north  [3]\n\n\nAgainst Kandalur Salai\nRajaraja's earliest inscriptions commemorate a significant triumph at Kandalur Salai, located in present-day Kerala, around 988 CE He is acclaimed as \"Kāndalūr śālai Kalam-arutta,\" which translates to 'the one who destroyed Kandalur Salai.' [23]\n\n\nConquest of Kerala and the Pandyas\nRajaraja's inscriptions begin to appear in Kanyakumari district in the 990s and in Thiruvananthapuram district in the early 1000s The Chola subjugation of Kerala can be dated to the early years of the 11th century [24] The Senur inscription dated to 1005 CE, attributed to Rajaraja, records his military achievements It mentions the destruction of the Pandya capital, Madurai, as well as the conquest of several regions These include defeating the formidable rulers of Kollam (Venad), Kolla-desham (Mushika), and Kodungallur (the Chera Perumals of Makotai) [24] [25] [full citation needed]Certain triumphs in the region of Malainadu were possibly achieved by Prince Rajendra Chola I on behalf of his father, Rajaraja Chola [26]\n\n\nConquest of Sri Lanka\nDuring the reign of King Mahinda V, the Sinhalese kingdom of Anuradhapura experienced a significant military revolt around the year 982 AD, primarily as a consequence of the monarch's economic policies The armed forces of the Anuradhapura capital predominantly consisted of Tamil mercenaries recruited from coastal regions By 882 CE, tensions escalated into a full-fledged uprising led by these mercenaries, resulting in a protracted civil conflict The ensuing turmoil compelled the vulnerable Sinhala ruler to seek refuge in the Rohana principality, thereby plunging the capital city of Anuradhapura into an extended period of civil unrest lasting approximately eleven years, marked by widespread disorder and lawlessness.\n [29] [30]\n\n\nChalukyan conflict\nIn 998 CE, Rajaraja annexed Gangapadi, Nolambapadi, and Tadigaipadi (present-day Karnataka) [33] During this campaign, Raja Chola subdued the Nolambas, who were previously vassals of the Ganga dynasty [34] [35]  These territories were initially under the suzerainty of the Rashtrakutas, who had been defeated by the Western Chalukyas in 973 CE Consequently, the Cholas found themselves in direct conflict with the Chalukyas [36] An inscription of Irivabedanga Satyashraya from Dharwar describes him as a vassal of the Western Chalukyas and acknowledges the Chola onslaught [37]\n\n\nHoysala conflicts\nThere were hostile encounters between the Cholas and the Hoysalas, a group who were vassals of the Western Chalukyas [citation needed] An inscription from the Gopalakrishna temple at Narasipur, dated to 1006, records that Rajaraja's general Aprameya killed Hoysala generals and a minister identified as Naganna [46] Additionally, a similar inscription in Channapatna describes Rajaraja defeating the Hoysalas [47]\n\n\nKalinga conquest\nThe invasion of the kingdom of Kalinga occurred after the conquest of Vengi [48] This conquest marked the northern boundary of the Chola Empire at that time and established their control over the entirety of South and South-East India [citation needed]\n\n\nConquest of Kuda-malai-nadu\nIn multiple historical accounts, there are mentions of King Rajaraja's conquest of a place called \"Kuda-malai-nadu\" around the year 1000 CE [10] [49] In certain inscriptions found in Karnataka, the term \"Kudagu-malai-nadu\" is used instead of \"Kuda-malai-nadu.\" Scholars generally believe that this region corresponds to Coorg (Kudagu) [10] [50]\n\n\nNaval expedition\n\"A naval campaign led to the conquest of the Maldive Islands, the Malabar Coast, and northern Sri Lanka, all of which were essential to the Chola control over trade with Southeast Asia and with Arabia and eastern Africa These were the transit areas, ports of call for the Arab traders and ships to Southeast Asia and China, which were the source of the valuable spices sold at a high profit to Europe.\"\n\nPersonal life\nRajaraja married several women, including the following: Vanathi aka Thiripuvāna Mādēviyār, Dantisakti Vitanki aka Lokamadevi, Panchavan Madeviyar, Chola Mahadevi, Trailokya Mahadevi, Lata Mahadevi, Prithvi Mahadevi, Meenavan Mahadevi, Viranarayani and Villavan Mahadevi [58] [59] [60] He had at least three daughters and two sons The older son, Rajendra, was born to Thiripuvāna Mādēviyār [61] [62] [63] The younger son was named Araiyan Rajarajan, and the identiey of his mother is unknown [citation needed] He had his first daughter Kundavai with Lokamadev who eventually married Chalukya prince Vimaladithan [citation needed] Rajaraja had two other daughters [citation needed] Rajaraja died in 1014 CE in the Tamil month of Maka and was succeeded by Rajendra Chola I [64]\n\n\nAdministration\nBefore the reign of Rajaraja I, portions of the Chola territory were ruled by hereditary lords and princes who were in a loose alliance with the Chola rulers [65] Rajaraja initiated a project of land survey and assessment in 1000 CE which led to the reorganization of the empire into units known as valanadus [13] [14] From the reign of Rajaraja I until the reign of Vikrama Chola in 1133 CE, the hereditary lords and local princes were either replaced or turned into dependent officials [65] This led to the king exercising closer control over the different parts of the empire [65] Rajaraja strengthened the local self-governments and installed a system of audit and control by which the village assemblies and other public bodies were held to account while retaining their autonomy [66] [67] [68] To promote trade, he sent the first Chola mission to China [69] Furthermore, his elder sister Kundavai assisted him in the administration and management of temples [70]\n\n\nOfficials\nRajendra Chola I was appointed as a co-regent towards the end of Rajaraja's reign He held the position of supreme commander over the northern and northwestern territories Under Raja Chola's rule, there was a notable expansion of the administrative system, resulting in a greater number of offices and officials documented in Chola records compared to previous eras [13] Villavan Muvendavelan, one of the top officials of Rajaraja figures in many of his inscriptions [73] The names of other officials found in the inscriptions are the Bana prince Narasimhavarman, a general Senapathi Krishnan Raman, the Samanta chief Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan, the revenue official Irayiravan Pallavarayan and Kuruvan Ulagalandan, who organised the country-wide land surveys [74]\n\n\nReligious policy\nRajaraja was a follower of Shaivism denomination of Hinduism but he also dedicated several temples to Vishnu [citation needed]\n\n\nArts and architecture\nRajaraja embarked on a mission to recover the hymns after hearing short excerpts of Thevaram in his court [81] He sought the help of Nambi Andar Nambi [82] It is believed that by divine intervention Nambi found the presence of scripts, in the form of cadijam leaves half eaten by white ants in a chamber inside the second precinct in Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram [83] [82]  The brahmanas (Dikshitars) in the temple opposed the mission, but Rajaraja intervened by consecrating the images of the saint-poets through the streets of Chidambaram [83] [84] Rajaraja thus became known as Tirumurai Kanda Cholan meaning one who saved the Tirumurai In his work Nambiyandar Nambi Puranam alias Tirumurai Kanda Puranam, Nambi identifies his patron as Rasarasamannan-Abhayakula-sekharan, that is king Rajaraja, the best of the race of Abhaya [85] At that time, Shiva temples only had images of god forms, but after the advent of Rajaraja, the images of the Nayanar saints were also placed inside the temple [84]  Nambi organized the hymns of three saint poets—Sambandar, Appar, and Sundarar—as the first seven books He included Manickavasagar's Tirukovayar and Tiruvacakam as the 8th book, and the hymns of nine other saints as the 9th book The Tirumandiram of Tirumular was designated as the 10th book, while 40 hymns by 12 other poets constituted the 11th book Additionally, Nambi added Tirutotanar Tiruvanthathi, the sacred anthathi of the labors of the 63 nayanar saints, along with his own hymns as the 12th book [86] The initial seven books were later recognized as Tevaram [86] With the addition of Sekkizhar's Periya Puranam (1135) as the twelfth book, the entire Saiva canon became known as Tirumurai, the holy scripture Consequently, Saiva literature now encompasses approximately 600 years of religious, philosophical, and literary development [86]\n\n\nBrihadisvara Temple\nDuring 1010 CE, Rajaraja built the Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur and dedicated it to Lord Shiva The temple, also known as Periya Kovil, RajaRajeswara Temple and Rajarajeswaram, and the capital were centres of both religious and economic activity [87]  [88] [89] The temple, which turned 1000 years old in 2010, is one of the largest temples in India and is an example of Dravidian architecture of the Chola period [90]  [91] Along with Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple and Airavatesvara temple, Brihadisvara is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the \"Great Living Chola Temples\" [92]\n\n\nCoins\nPrior to Rajaraja's reign, Chola coins featured the tiger emblem on the obverse, along with the fish and bow emblems representing the Pandya and Chera Dynasties, while the reverse side displayed the name of the King However, a new type of coin emerged during Rajaraja's rule These new coins showcased the figure of the standing king on the obverse side, while the reverse side depicted a seated goddess [95] The coins spread across much of southern India and were copied by Sri Lankan kings [96]\n\n\nInscriptions\nDue to Rajaraja's desire to record his military achievements, he recorded the important events of his life in stone An inscription in Tamil from Mulbagal in Karnataka shows his accomplishments as early as the 19th year An excerpt from such a Meikeerthi, an inscription recording great accomplishments, follows: [97]\n\n\nIn popular culture\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Rajaraja I**\n\nRajaraja I (also known as Rajaraja the Great) was a Chola emperor who ruled from 985 to 1014 CE.

Scholars generally believe that this region corresponds to Coorg (Kudagu).\n\n**Naval Expedition**\n\nA naval campaign led to the conquest of the Maldive Islands, the Malabar Coast, and northern Sri Lanka. These were the transit areas, ports of call for the Arab traders and ships to Southeast Asia and China, which were the source of the valuable spices sold at a high profit to Europe.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nRajaraja married several women, including the following: Vanathi aka Thiripuvāna Mādēviyār, Dantisakti Vitanki aka Lokamadevi, Panchavan Madeviyar, Chola Mahadevi, Trailokya Mahadevi, Lata Mahadevi, Prithvi Mahadevi, Meenavan Mahadevi, Viranarayani, and Villavan Mahadevi. He had at least three daughters and two sons. The older son, Rajendra, was born to Thiripuvāna Mādēviyār. The younger son was named Araiyan Rajarajan, and the identity of his mother is unknown.\n\n**Administration**\n\nBefore the reign of Rajaraja I, portions of the Chola territory were ruled by hereditary lords and princes who were in a loose alliance with the Chola rulers. Rajaraja initiated a project of land survey and assessment in 1000 CE, which led to the reorganization of the empire into units known as valanadus.\n\n**Officials**\n\nRajendra Chola I was appointed as a co-regent towards the end of Rajaraja's reign. He held the position of supreme commander over the northern and northwestern territories. Under Raja Chola's rule, there was a notable expansion of the administrative system, resulting in a greater number of offices and officials documented in Chola records compared to previous eras.\n\n**Religious Policy**\n\nRajaraja was a follower of Shaivism denomination of Hinduism but also dedicated several temples to Vishnu.\n\n**Arts and Architecture**\n\nRajaraja embarked on a mission to recover the hymns after hearing short excerpts of Thevaram in his court. He sought the help of Nambi Andar Nambi. It is believed that by divine intervention, Nambi found the presence of scripts, in the form of cadijam leaves half eaten by white ants in a chamber inside the second precinct in Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram. The brahmanas (Dikshitars) in the temple opposed the mission, but Rajaraja intervened by consecrating the images of the saint-poets through the streets of Chidambaram.\n\n**Brihadisvara Temple**\n\nDuring 1010 CE, Rajaraja built the Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur and dedicated it to Lord Shiva. The temple, also known as Periya Kovil, RajaRajeswara Temple, and Rajarajeswaram, and the capital were centres of both religious and economic activity. The temple, which turned 1000 years old in 2010, is one of the largest temples in India and is an example of Dravidian architecture of the Chola period.\n\n**Coins**\n\nPrior to Rajaraja's reign, Chola coins featured the tiger emblem on the obverse, along with the fish and bow emblems representing the Pandya and Chera Dynasties, while the reverse side displayed the name of the King. However, a new type of coin emerged during Rajaraja's rule. These new coins showcased the figure of the standing king on the obverse side, while the reverse side depicted a seated goddess.\n\n**Inscriptions**\n\nDue to Rajaraja's desire to record his military achievements, he recorded the important events of his life in stone. An inscription in Tamil from Mulbagal in Karnataka shows his accomplishments as early as the 19th year. An excerpt from such a Meikeerthi, an inscription recording great accomplishments, follows:\n\n\"The king, who, with the might of his army, conquered the island of Sri Lanka, and, with his valour, subdued the great Pandyan, and, with his wisdom, brought prosperity to his kingdom, and, with his generosity, made his people happy, and, with his justice, protected his subjects, and, with his mercy, comforted the weak, and, with his kindness, benefited the poor, and, with his love for his people, ruled his kingdom with happiness, and, with his glory, made his name famous, and, with his fame, made his kingdom prosperous, and, with his prosperity, made his people happy.\"", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Rajaraja_I\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nRajaraja was the son of Chola King Parantaka II, also known as Sundara Chola, and Queen Vanavan Mahadevi  [15] As recorded in the Thiruvalangadu copper-plate inscription, his birth name was Arun Mozhi Varman, meaning “The Word of Sun Clan.” [1] [16] He was born around 947 CE during the Tamil month of Aipassi, under the Sadhayam star [17] The Government of Tamil Nadu recognizes his birthdate as 3 November 947 [18] Rajaraja had an elder brother, Aditha II, [3] and an elder sister, Kundavai [19]\n\n\nMilitary conquests\nWhen Rajaraja came into power, he inherited a kingdom that was only centered around the Thanjavur-Tiruchirappalli region, which was the heart of traditional Chola territory [1] However, this kingdom was not very large, and it was still recovering from attacks by the Rashtrakutas in previous years Rajaraja changed this by transforming the kingdom into a well-organized empire with a powerful army and navy Under his rule, the northern kingdom of Vengi became closely allied with the Cholas, and their influence expanded along the eastern coast all the way up to Kalinga in the north  [3]\n\n\nAgainst Kandalur Salai\nRajaraja's earliest inscriptions commemorate a significant triumph at Kandalur Salai, located in present-day Kerala, around 988 CE He is acclaimed as \"Kāndalūr śālai Kalam-arutta,\" which translates to 'the one who destroyed Kandalur Salai.' [23]\n\n\nConquest of Kerala and the Pandyas\nRajaraja's inscriptions begin to appear in Kanyakumari district in the 990s and in Thiruvananthapuram district in the early 1000s The Chola subjugation of Kerala can be dated to the early years of the 11th century [24] The Senur inscription dated to 1005 CE, attributed to Rajaraja, records his military achievements It mentions the destruction of the Pandya capital, Madurai, as well as the conquest of several regions These include defeating the formidable rulers of Kollam (Venad), Kolla-desham (Mushika), and Kodungallur (the Chera Perumals of Makotai) [24] [25] [full citation needed]Certain triumphs in the region of Malainadu were possibly achieved by Prince Rajendra Chola I on behalf of his father, Rajaraja Chola [26]\n\n\nConquest of Sri Lanka\nDuring the reign of King Mahinda V, the Sinhalese kingdom of Anuradhapura experienced a significant military revolt around the year 982 AD, primarily as a consequence of the monarch's economic policies The armed forces of the Anuradhapura capital predominantly consisted of Tamil mercenaries recruited from coastal regions By 882 CE, tensions escalated into a full-fledged uprising led by these mercenaries, resulting in a protracted civil conflict The ensuing turmoil compelled the vulnerable Sinhala ruler to seek refuge in the Rohana principality, thereby plunging the capital city of Anuradhapura into an extended period of civil unrest lasting approximately eleven years, marked by widespread disorder and lawlessness.\n [29] [30]\n\n\nChalukyan conflict\nIn 998 CE, Rajaraja annexed Gangapadi, Nolambapadi, and Tadigaipadi (present-day Karnataka) [33] During this campaign, Raja Chola subdued the Nolambas, who were previously vassals of the Ganga dynasty [34] [35]  These territories were initially under the suzerainty of the Rashtrakutas, who had been defeated by the Western Chalukyas in 973 CE Consequently, the Cholas found themselves in direct conflict with the Chalukyas [36] An inscription of Irivabedanga Satyashraya from Dharwar describes him as a vassal of the Western Chalukyas and acknowledges the Chola onslaught [37]\n\n\nHoysala conflicts\nThere were hostile encounters between the Cholas and the Hoysalas, a group who were vassals of the Western Chalukyas [citation needed] An inscription from the Gopalakrishna temple at Narasipur, dated to 1006, records that Rajaraja's general Aprameya killed Hoysala generals and a minister identified as Naganna [46] Additionally, a similar inscription in Channapatna describes Rajaraja defeating the Hoysalas [47]\n\n\nKalinga conquest\nThe invasion of the kingdom of Kalinga occurred after the conquest of Vengi [48] This conquest marked the northern boundary of the Chola Empire at that time and established their control over the entirety of South and South-East India [citation needed]\n\n\nConquest of Kuda-malai-nadu\nIn multiple historical accounts, there are mentions of King Rajaraja's conquest of a place called \"Kuda-malai-nadu\" around the year 1000 CE [10] [49] In certain inscriptions found in Karnataka, the term \"Kudagu-malai-nadu\" is used instead of \"Kuda-malai-nadu.\" Scholars generally believe that this region corresponds to Coorg (Kudagu) [10] [50]\n\n\nNaval expedition\n\"A naval campaign led to the conquest of the Maldive Islands, the Malabar Coast, and northern Sri Lanka, all of which were essential to the Chola control over trade with Southeast Asia and with Arabia and eastern Africa These were the transit areas, ports of call for the Arab traders and ships to Southeast Asia and China, which were the source of the valuable spices sold at a high profit to Europe.\"\n\nPersonal life\nRajaraja married several women, including the following: Vanathi aka Thiripuvāna Mādēviyār, Dantisakti Vitanki aka Lokamadevi, Panchavan Madeviyar, Chola Mahadevi, Trailokya Mahadevi, Lata Mahadevi, Prithvi Mahadevi, Meenavan Mahadevi, Viranarayani and Villavan Mahadevi [58] [59] [60] He had at least three daughters and two sons The older son, Rajendra, was born to Thiripuvāna Mādēviyār [61] [62] [63] The younger son was named Araiyan Rajarajan, and the identiey of his mother is unknown [citation needed] He had his first daughter Kundavai with Lokamadev who eventually married Chalukya prince Vimaladithan [citation needed] Rajaraja had two other daughters [citation needed] Rajaraja died in 1014 CE in the Tamil month of Maka and was succeeded by Rajendra Chola I [64]\n\n\nAdministration\nBefore the reign of Rajaraja I, portions of the Chola territory were ruled by hereditary lords and princes who were in a loose alliance with the Chola rulers [65] Rajaraja initiated a project of land survey and assessment in 1000 CE which led to the reorganization of the empire into units known as valanadus [13] [14] From the reign of Rajaraja I until the reign of Vikrama Chola in 1133 CE, the hereditary lords and local princes were either replaced or turned into dependent officials [65] This led to the king exercising closer control over the different parts of the empire [65] Rajaraja strengthened the local self-governments and installed a system of audit and control by which the village assemblies and other public bodies were held to account while retaining their autonomy [66] [67] [68] To promote trade, he sent the first Chola mission to China [69] Furthermore, his elder sister Kundavai assisted him in the administration and management of temples [70]\n\n\nOfficials\nRajendra Chola I was appointed as a co-regent towards the end of Rajaraja's reign He held the position of supreme commander over the northern and northwestern territories Under Raja Chola's rule, there was a notable expansion of the administrative system, resulting in a greater number of offices and officials documented in Chola records compared to previous eras [13] Villavan Muvendavelan, one of the top officials of Rajaraja figures in many of his inscriptions [73] The names of other officials found in the inscriptions are the Bana prince Narasimhavarman, a general Senapathi Krishnan Raman, the Samanta chief Vallavaraiyan Vandiyadevan, the revenue official Irayiravan Pallavarayan and Kuruvan Ulagalandan, who organised the country-wide land surveys [74]\n\n\nReligious policy\nRajaraja was a follower of Shaivism denomination of Hinduism but he also dedicated several temples to Vishnu [citation needed]\n\n\nArts and architecture\nRajaraja embarked on a mission to recover the hymns after hearing short excerpts of Thevaram in his court [81] He sought the help of Nambi Andar Nambi [82] It is believed that by divine intervention Nambi found the presence of scripts, in the form of cadijam leaves half eaten by white ants in a chamber inside the second precinct in Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram [83] [82]  The brahmanas (Dikshitars) in the temple opposed the mission, but Rajaraja intervened by consecrating the images of the saint-poets through the streets of Chidambaram [83] [84] Rajaraja thus became known as Tirumurai Kanda Cholan meaning one who saved the Tirumurai In his work Nambiyandar Nambi Puranam alias Tirumurai Kanda Puranam, Nambi identifies his patron as Rasarasamannan-Abhayakula-sekharan, that is king Rajaraja, the best of the race of Abhaya [85] At that time, Shiva temples only had images of god forms, but after the advent of Rajaraja, the images of the Nayanar saints were also placed inside the temple [84]  Nambi organized the hymns of three saint poets—Sambandar, Appar, and Sundarar—as the first seven books He included Manickavasagar's Tirukovayar and Tiruvacakam as the 8th book, and the hymns of nine other saints as the 9th book The Tirumandiram of Tirumular was designated as the 10th book, while 40 hymns by 12 other poets constituted the 11th book Additionally, Nambi added Tirutotanar Tiruvanthathi, the sacred anthathi of the labors of the 63 nayanar saints, along with his own hymns as the 12th book [86] The initial seven books were later recognized as Tevaram [86] With the addition of Sekkizhar's Periya Puranam (1135) as the twelfth book, the entire Saiva canon became known as Tirumurai, the holy scripture Consequently, Saiva literature now encompasses approximately 600 years of religious, philosophical, and literary development [86]\n\n\nBrihadisvara Temple\nDuring 1010 CE, Rajaraja built the Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur and dedicated it to Lord Shiva The temple, also known as Periya Kovil, RajaRajeswara Temple and Rajarajeswaram, and the capital were centres of both religious and economic activity [87]  [88] [89] The temple, which turned 1000 years old in 2010, is one of the largest temples in India and is an example of Dravidian architecture of the Chola period [90]  [91] Along with Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple and Airavatesvara temple, Brihadisvara is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the \"Great Living Chola Temples\" [92]\n\n\nCoins\nPrior to Rajaraja's reign, Chola coins featured the tiger emblem on the obverse, along with the fish and bow emblems representing the Pandya and Chera Dynasties, while the reverse side displayed the name of the King However, a new type of coin emerged during Rajaraja's rule These new coins showcased the figure of the standing king on the obverse side, while the reverse side depicted a seated goddess [95] The coins spread across much of southern India and were copied by Sri Lankan kings [96]\n\n\nInscriptions\nDue to Rajaraja's desire to record his military achievements, he recorded the important events of his life in stone An inscription in Tamil from Mulbagal in Karnataka shows his accomplishments as early as the 19th year An excerpt from such a Meikeerthi, an inscription recording great

only 48 of these may be active (eligible to play) on game days [49] Each team can also have a sixteen-player practice squad separate from its main roster [50]\n\n\nOrganizational structure\nAt the corporate level, the National Football League considers itself a trade association made up of and financed by its 32 member teams [64] Up until 2015, the league was an unincorporated nonprofit 501(c)(6) association [65] Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code provides an exemption from federal income taxation for \"Business leagues, chambers of commerce, real-estate boards, boards of trade, or professional football leagues (whether or not administering a pension fund for football players), not organized for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.\" [66] In contrast, each individual team, with the exception of the non-profit Green Bay Packers, [67] is subject to tax because they make a profit [68]\n\n\nSeason format\nThe NFL season format consists of a three-week preseason, an 18-week regular season (each team plays 17 games), and a 14-team single-elimination playoff culminating in the Super Bowl, the league's championship game.\n\n\nPreseason\nThe NFL preseason begins with the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, played at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton [73] Each NFL team is required to schedule three preseason games NFC teams must play at least two of these at home in odd numbered years and AFC teams must play at least two at home in even numbered years However, the teams involved in the Hall of Fame game, as well as any team that played in an American Bowl game, play four preseason games [74] Preseason games are exhibition matches and do not count towards regular-season totals [75] Because the preseason does not count towards standings, teams generally do not focus on winning games; instead, they are used by coaches to evaluate their teams and by players to show their performance, both to their current team and to other teams if they get cut [76] The quality of preseason games has been criticized by some fans, who dislike having to pay full price for exhibition games, [77] as well as by some players and coaches, who dislike the risk of injury the games have, while others have felt the preseason is a necessary part of the NFL season [76] [77]\n\n\nRegular season\nCurrently, the 14 opponents each team faces over the 17-game regular season schedule are set using a predetermined formula: [78] The league runs an 18-week, 272-game regular season [79] Since 2021, the season has begun the week after Labor Day (the first Monday in September) and concluded the week after New Year [80] The opening game of the season is normally a home game on a Thursday for the league's defending champion [81]\n\n\nPostseason\nFollowing the conclusion of the regular season, the NFL Playoffs, a 14-team single-elimination tournament, is then held Seven teams are selected from each conference: the winners of each of the four divisions as well as three wild card teams (the three remaining teams with the best overall record, with tiebreakers in the event of two or more teams having the same record) These teams are seeded according to overall record and tiebreakers, with the division champions always ranking higher than the wild card teams [89] The top team (seeded one) from each conference are awarded a bye week, while the remaining six teams (seeded 2–7) from each conference compete in the first round of the playoffs, the Wild Card round, with the 2-seed competing against the 7-seed, the 3-seed competing against the 6-seed and the 4-seed competing against the 5-seed The winners of the Wild Card round advance to the Divisional Round, which matches the lower seeded team against the 1-seed and the two remaining teams against each other The winners of those games then compete in the Conference Championships, with the higher remaining seed hosting the lower remaining seed The AFC and NFC champions then compete in the Super Bowl to determine the league champion.\n\n\nTrophies and awards\nThe National Football League has used three different trophies to honor its champion over its existence The first trophy, the Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup, was donated to the NFL (then APFA) in 1920 by the Brunswick-Balke Collender Corporation The trophy, the appearance of which is only known by its description as a \"silver loving cup\", was intended to be a traveling trophy and not to become permanent until a team had won at least three titles The league awarded it to the Akron Pros, champions of the inaugural 1920 season; however, the trophy was discontinued and its current whereabouts are unknown [92]\n\n\nTeam trophies\nThe National Football League has used three different trophies to honor its champion over its existence The first trophy, the Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup, was donated to the NFL (then APFA) in 1920 by the Brunswick-Balke Collender Corporation The trophy, the appearance of which is only known by its description as a \"silver loving cup\", was intended to be a traveling trophy and not to become permanent until a team had won at least three titles The league awarded it to the Akron Pros, champions of the inaugural 1920 season;
