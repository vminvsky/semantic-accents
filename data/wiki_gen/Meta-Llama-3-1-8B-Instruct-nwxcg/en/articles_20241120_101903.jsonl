{"title": "Anonymous_(hacker_group)", "content": "\nPhilosophy\nThe philosophy of Anonymous offers insight into a long-standing political question that has gone unanswered with often tragic consequences for social movements: what does a new form of collective politics look like that wishes to go beyond the identity of the individual subject in late capitalism? [16]\n\nArrests and trials\nSince 2009, dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks, in countries including the U.S., UK, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, and Turkey [33] Anons generally protest these prosecutions and describe these individuals as martyrs to the movement [34] The July 2011 arrest of LulzSec member Topiary became a particular rallying point, leading to a widespread \"Free Topiary\" movement [35]\n\n\nOperation Avenge Assange\nSeveral law enforcement agencies took action after Anonymous' Operation Avenge Assange [43] In January 2011, British police arrested five male suspects between the ages of 15 and 26 with suspicion of participating in Anonymous DDoS attacks [44] During July 19–20, 2011, as many as 20 or more arrests were made of suspected Anonymous hackers in the US, UK, and Netherlands According to the statements of U.S officials, suspects' homes were raided and suspects were arrested in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Washington DC, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, and Ohio Additionally, a 16-year-old boy was held by the police in south London on suspicion of breaching the Computer Misuse Act 1990, and four were held in the Netherlands [45] [46] [47] [48]\n\n\nAnalysis\nEvaluations of Anonymous' actions and effectiveness vary widely In a widely shared post, blogger Patrick Gray wrote that private security firms \"secretly love\" the group for the way in which it publicizes cyber security threats [51] Anonymous is sometimes stated to have changed the nature of protesting, [8] [9] and in 2012, Time called it one of the \"100 most influential people\" in the world [11]\n\n\nMedia portrayal\nSam Esmail shared in an interview with Motherboard that he was inspired by Anonymous when creating the USA Network hacktivist drama, Mr Robot [62] Furthermore, Wired calls the \"Omegas\", a fictitious hacker group in the show, \"a clear reference to the Anonymous offshoot known as LulzSec\" [63] In the TV series Elementary a hacktivist collective called \"Everyone\" plays a recurring role; there are several hints and similarities to Anonymous [64]\n\n\nHistory\nThe name Anonymous itself is inspired by the perceived anonymity under which users post images and comments on the Internet Usage of the term Anonymous in the sense of a shared identity began on imageboards, particularly the /b/ board of 4chan, dedicated to random content and to raiding other websites [66] A tag of Anonymous is assigned to visitors who leave comments without identifying the originator of the posted content Users of imageboards sometimes jokingly acted as if Anonymous was a single individual The concept of the Anonymous entity advanced in 2004 when an administrator on the 4chan image board activated a \"Forced_Anon\" protocol that signed all posts as Anonymous [67] As the popularity of imageboards increased, the idea of Anonymous as a collective of unnamed individuals became an Internet meme [68]\n\n\n4chan raids (2003–2007)\nThe name Anonymous itself is inspired by the perceived anonymity under which users post images and comments on the Internet Usage of the term Anonymous in the sense of a shared identity began on imageboards, particularly the /b/ board of 4chan, dedicated to random content and to raiding other websites [66] A tag of Anonymous is assigned to visitors who leave comments without identifying the originator of the posted content Users of imageboards sometimes jokingly acted as if Anonymous was a single individual The concept of the Anonymous entity advanced in 2004 when an administrator on the 4chan image board activated a \"Forced_Anon\" protocol that signed all posts as Anonymous [67] As the popularity of imageboards increased, the idea of Anonymous as a collective of unnamed individuals became an Internet meme [68]\n\n\nEncyclopedia Dramatica (2004–present)\nEncyclopedia Dramatica was founded in 2004 by Sherrod DeGrippo, initially as a means of documenting gossip related to LiveJournal, but it quickly was adopted as a major platform by Anonymous for parody and other purposes [74] The not safe for work site celebrates a subversive \"trolling culture\", and documents Internet memes, culture, and events, such as mass pranks, trolling events, \"raids\", large-scale failures of Internet security, and criticism of Internet communities that are accused of self-censorship to gain prestige or positive coverage from traditional and established media outlets Journalist Julian Dibbell described Encyclopedia Dramatica as the site \"where the vast parallel universe of Anonymous in-jokes, catchphrases, and obsessions is lovingly annotated, and you will discover an elaborate trolling culture: Flamingly racist and misogynist content lurks throughout, all of it calculated to offend.\" [74] The site also played a role in the anti-Scientology campaign of Project Chanology [75]\n\n\nProject Chanology (2008)\nAnonymous first became associated with hacktivism [b] in 2008 following a series of actions against the Church of Scientology known as Project Chanology On January 15, 2008, the gossip blog Gawker posted a video in which celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise praised the religion; [81] and the Church responded with a cease-and-desist letter for violation of copyright [82] 4chan users organized a raid against the Church in retaliation, prank-calling its hotline, sending black faxes designed to waste ink cartridges, and launching DDoS attacks against its websites [83] [84]\n\n\nOperation Payback (2010)\nBy the start of 2009, Scientologists had stopped engaging with protesters and had improved online security, and actions against the group had largely ceased A period of infighting followed between the politically engaged members (called \"moralfags\" in the parlance of 4chan) and those seeking to provoke for entertainment (trolls) [98] By September 2010, the group had received little publicity for a year and faced a corresponding drop in member interest; its raids diminished greatly in size and moved largely off of IRC channels, organizing again from the chan boards, particularly /b/ [99]\n\n\n2011–2012\nIn the years following Operation Payback, targets of Anonymous protests, hacks, and DDoS attacks continued to diversify Beginning in January 2011, Anons took a number of actions known initially as Operation Tunisia in support of Arab Spring movements Tflow created a script that Tunisians could use to protect their web browsers from government surveillance, while fellow future LulzSec member Hector Xavier Monsegur (alias \"Sabu\") and others allegedly hijacked servers from a London web-hosting company to launch a DDoS attack on Tunisian government websites, taking them offline Sabu also used a Tunisian volunteer's computer to hack the website of Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi, replacing it with a message from Anonymous [122] Anons also helped Tunisian dissidents share videos online about the uprising [123] In Operation Egypt, Anons collaborated with the activist group Telecomix to help dissidents access government-censored websites [123] Sabu and Topiary went on to participate in attacks on government websites in Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Jordan, and Zimbabwe [124]\n\n\n2013\nOn November 5, 2013, Anonymous protesters gathered around the world for the Million Mask March Demonstrations were held in 400 cities around the world to coincide with Guy Fawkes Night [154]\n\n\n2014\nIn the wake of the fatal police shooting of unarmed African-American Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, \"Operation Ferguson\"—a hacktivist organization that claimed to be associated with Anonymous—organized cyberprotests against police, setting up a website and a Twitter account to do so [160] The group promised that if any protesters were harassed or harmed, they would attack the city's servers and computers, taking them offline [160] City officials said that e-mail systems were targeted and phones died, while the Internet crashed at the City Hall [160] [161] Prior to August 15, members of Anonymous corresponding with Mother Jones said that they were working on confirming the identity of the undisclosed police officer who shot Brown and would release his name as soon as they did [162] On August 14, Anonymous posted on its Twitter feed what it claimed was the name of the officer involved in the shooting [163] [164] However, police said the identity released by Anonymous was incorrect [165] Twitter subsequently suspended the Anonymous account from its service [166]\n\n\n2015\nIn January 2015, Anonymous released a video and a statement via Twitter condemning the attack on Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people, including eight journalists, were fatally shot The video, claiming that it is \"a message for al-Qaeda, the Islamic State and other terrorists\", was uploaded to the group's Belgian account [170] The announcement stated that \"We, Anonymous around the world, have decided to declare war on you, the terrorists\" and promises to avenge the killings by \"shut [ting] down your accounts on all social networks.\" [171] On January 12, they brought down a website that was suspected to belong to one of these groups [172] Critics of the action warned that taking down extremists' websites would make them harder to monitor [173]\n\n\n2016\nThe Blink Hacker Group, associating themselves with the Anonymous group, claimed to have hacked the Thailand prison websites and servers [199] The compromised data has been shared online, with the group claiming that they give the data back to Thailand Justice and the citizens of Thailand as well The hack was done in response to news from Thailand about the mistreatment of prisoners in Thailand [200]\n\n\nLate 2010s\nIn late 2017, the QAnon conspiracy theory first emerged on 4chan, and adherents used similar terminology and branding to Anonymous In response, in 2018, anti-Trump members of Anonymous warned that QAnon was stealing the collective's branding and vowed to oppose the theory [202] [203] [13]\n\n\n2020\nIn February 2020, Anonymous hacked the United Nations' website and created a page for Taiwan, a country which has not had a seat at the UN since 1971 [205] [206] The hacked page featured the Flag of Taiwan, the KMT emblem, a Taiwan Independence flag, and the Anonymous logo along with a caption [205] [207] The hacked server belonged to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs [205]\n\n\n2021\nThe Texas Heartbeat Act, a law which bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, came into effect in Texas on September 1, 2021 The law relies on private citizens to file civil lawsuits against anyone who performs or induces an abortion, or aids and abets one, once \"cardiac activity\" in an embryo can be detected via transvaginal ultrasound, which is usually possible beginning at around six weeks of pregnancy [223] Shortly after the law came into effect, anti-abortion organizations set up websites to collect \"whistleblower\" reports of suspected violators of the bill [224]\n\n\n2022\nOn February 25, 2022, Twitter accounts associated with Anonymous declared that they had launched a 'cyber operations' against the Russian Federation, in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine ordered by Russian president Vladimir Putin The group later temporarily disabled websites such as RT.com and the website of the Defence Ministry along with other state owned websites [235] [236] [237] [238] [239] Anonymous also leaked 200 GB worth of emails from the Belarusian weapons manufacturer Tetraedr, which provided logistical support for Russia in the Russian invasion of Ukraine [240] Anonymous also hacked into Russian TV channels and played Ukrainian music [241] through them and showed uncensored news of events in Ukraine [242]\n\n\nOperation Russia\nOn March 7, 2022, Anonymous actors DepaixPorteur and TheWarriorPoetz declared on Twitter [243] that they hacked 400 Russian surveillance cameras and broadcast them on a website [244] They call this operation \"Russian Camera Dump\" [243]\n\n\nIranian protests\nOn September 18, 2022, YourAnonSpider hacked the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran's official webpage belonging to Ali Khamenei in retaliation to the death of Mahsa Amini [259] Anonymous launched a cyber operation against the Iranian government for the alleged murder of Mahsa Amini Anonymous launched distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks against Iran's government and state-owned websites [260] On September 23, 2022, a hacktivist named \"Edaalate Ali\" hacked Iran's state TV government channel during the middle of broadcast and released CCTV footage of Iran's prison facilities [261] [262] On October 23, 2022, an Iranian hacker group known as \"Black Reward\" published confidential files and documents email system belonging to Iran's nuclear program [263]

information, promote social and political change, and disrupt the activities of organizations and governments that they view as oppressive or corrupt. The group's origins date back to the early 2000s, and they have been involved in a wide range of activities, from hacking and cyber attacks to activism and social media campaigns.\n\nPhilosophy\nThe philosophy of Anonymous offers insight into a long-standing political question that has gone unanswered with often tragic consequences for social movements: what does a new form of collective politics look like that wishes to go beyond the identity of the individual subject in late capitalism? Anonymous' rejection of traditional notions of identity and authority reflects a desire to create a more horizontal and decentralized form of politics, one that is not based on the traditional power structures of the state or the market.\n\nArrests and trials\nSince 2009, dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in Anonymous cyberattacks, in countries including the U.S., UK, Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, and Turkey. Anons generally protest these prosecutions and describe these individuals as martyrs to the movement. The July 2011 arrest of LulzSec member Topiary became a particular rallying point, leading to a widespread \"Free Topiary\" movement.\n\nOperation Avenge Assange\nSeveral law enforcement agencies took action after Anonymous' Operation Avenge Assange. In January 2011, British police arrested five male suspects between the ages of 15 and 26 with suspicion of participating in Anonymous DDoS attacks. During July 19–20, 2011, as many as 20 or more arrests were made of suspected Anonymous hackers in the US, UK, and Netherlands. According to the statements of U.S officials, suspects' homes were raided and suspects were arrested in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Washington DC, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, and Ohio.\n\nAnalysis\nEvaluations of Anonymous' actions and effectiveness vary widely. In a widely shared post, blogger Patrick Gray wrote that private security firms \"secretly love\" the group for the way in which it publicizes cyber security threats. Anonymous is sometimes stated to have changed the nature of protesting, and in 2012, Time called it one of the \"100 most influential people\" in the world.\n\nMedia portrayal\nSam Esmail shared in an interview with Motherboard that he was inspired by Anonymous when creating the USA Network hacktivist drama, Mr Robot. Furthermore, Wired calls the \"Omegas\", a fictitious hacker group in the show, \"a clear reference to the Anonymous offshoot known as LulzSec.\" In the TV series Elementary a hacktivist collective called \"Everyone\" plays a recurring role; there are several hints and similarities to Anonymous.\n\nHistory\nThe name Anonymous itself is inspired by the perceived anonymity under which users post images and comments on the Internet. Usage of the term Anonymous in the sense of a shared identity began on imageboards, particularly the /b/ board of 4chan, dedicated to random content and to raiding other websites. A tag of Anonymous is assigned to visitors who leave comments without identifying the originator of the posted content. Users of imageboards sometimes jokingly acted as if Anonymous was a single individual. The concept of the Anonymous entity advanced in 2004 when an administrator on the 4chan image board activated a \"Forced_Anon\" protocol that signed all posts as Anonymous.\n\n4chan raids (2003–2007)\nThe name Anonymous itself is inspired by the perceived anonymity under which users post images and comments on the Internet.

On January 15, 2008, the gossip blog Gawker posted a video in which celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise praised the religion; and the Church responded with a cease-and-desist letter for violation of copyright. 4chan users organized a raid against the Church in retaliation, prank-calling its hotline, sending black faxes designed to waste ink cartridges, and launching DDoS attacks against its websites.\n\nOperation Payback (2010)\nBy the start of 2009, Scientologists had stopped engaging with protesters and had improved online security, and actions against the group had largely ceased.

communities that are accused of self-censorship to gain prestige or positive coverage from traditional and established media outlets Journalist Julian Dibbell described Encyclopedia Dramatica as the site \"where the vast parallel universe of Anonymous in-jokes, catchphrases, and obsessions is lovingly annotated, and you will discover an elaborate trolling culture: Flamingly racist and misogynist content lurks throughout, all of it calculated to offend.\" [74] The site also played a role in the anti-Scientology campaign of Project Chanology [75]\n\n\nProject Chanology (2008)\nAnonymous first became associated with hacktivism [b] in 2008 following a series of actions against the Church of Scientology known as Project Chanology On January 15, 2008, the gossip blog Gawker posted a video in which celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise praised the religion; [81] and the Church responded with a cease-and-desist letter for violation of copyright [82] 4chan users organized a raid against the Church in retaliation, prank-calling its hotline, sending black faxes designed to waste ink cartridges, and launching DDoS attacks against its websites [83] [84]\n\n\nOperation Payback (2010)\nBy the start of 2009, Scientologists had stopped engaging with protesters and had improved online security, and actions against the group had largely ceased A period of infighting followed between the politically engaged members (called \"moralfags\" in the parlance of 4chan) and those seeking to provoke for entertainment (trolls) [98] By September 2010, the group had received little publicity for a year and faced a corresponding drop in member interest; its raids diminished greatly in size and moved largely off of IRC channels, organizing again from the chan boards, particularly /b/ [99]\n\n\n2011–2012\nIn the years following Operation Payback, targets of Anonymous protests, hacks, and DDoS attacks continued to diversify Beginning in January 2011, Anons took a number of actions known initially as Operation Tunisia in support of Arab Spring movements Tflow created a script that Tunisians could use to protect their web browsers from government surveillance, while fellow future LulzSec member Hector Xavier Monsegur (alias \"Sabu\") and others allegedly hijacked servers from a London web-hosting company to launch a DDoS attack on Tunisian government websites, taking them offline Sabu also used a Tunisian volunteer's computer to hack the website of Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi, replacing it with a message from Anonymous [122] Anons also helped Tunisian dissidents share videos online about the uprising [123] In Operation Egypt, Anons collaborated with the activist group Telecomix to help dissidents access government-censored websites [123] Sabu and Topiary went on to participate in attacks on government websites in Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Jordan, and Zimbabwe [124]\n\n\n2013\nOn November 5, 2013, Anonymous protesters gathered around the world for the Million Mask March Demonstrations were held in 400 cities around the world to coincide with Guy Fawkes Night [154]\n\n\n2014\nIn the wake of the fatal police shooting of unarmed African-American Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, \"Operation Ferguson\"—a hacktivist organization that claimed to be associated with Anonymous—organized cyberprotests against police, setting up a website and a Twitter account to do so [160] The group promised that if any protesters were harassed or harmed, they would attack the city's servers and computers, taking them offline [160] City officials said that e-mail systems were targeted and phones died, while the Internet crashed at the City Hall [160] [161] Prior to August 15, members of Anonymous corresponding with Mother Jones said that they were working on confirming the identity of the undisclosed police officer who shot Brown and would release his name as soon as they did [162] On August 14, Anonymous posted on its Twitter feed what it claimed was the name of the officer involved in the shooting [163] [164] However, police said the identity released by Anonymous was incorrect [165] Twitter subsequently suspended the Anonymous account from its service [166]\n\n\n2015\nIn January 2015, Anonymous released a video and a statement via Twitter condemning the attack on Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people, including eight journalists, were fatally shot The video, claiming that it is \"a message for al-Qaeda, the Islamic State and other terrorists\", was uploaded to the group's Belgian account [170] The announcement stated that \"We, Anonymous around the world, have decided to declare war on you, the terrorists\" and promises to avenge the killings by \"shut [ting] down your accounts on all social networks.\" [171] On January 12, they brought down a website that was suspected to belong to one of these groups [172] Critics of the action warned that taking down extremists' websites would make them harder to monitor [173]\n\n\n2016\nThe Blink Hacker Group, associating themselves with the Anonymous group, claimed to have hacked the Thailand prison websites and servers [199] The compromised data has been shared online, with the group claiming that they give the data back to Thailand Justice and the citizens of Thailand as well The hack was done in response to news from Thailand about the mistreatment of prisoners in Thailand [200]\n\n\nLate 2010s\nIn late 2017, the QAnon conspiracy theory first emerged on 4chan, and adherents used similar terminology and branding to Anonymous In response, in 2018, anti-Trump members of Anonymous warned that QAnon was stealing the collective's branding and vowed to oppose the theory [202] [203] [13]\n\n\n2020\nIn February 2020, Anonymous hacked the United Nations' website and created a page for Taiwan, a country which has not had a seat at the UN since 1971 [205] [206] The hacked page featured the Flag of Taiwan, the KMT emblem, a Taiwan Independence flag, and the Anonymous logo along with a caption [205] [207] The hacked server belonged to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs [205]\n\n\n2021\nThe Texas Heartbeat Act, a law which bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, came into effect in Texas on September 1, 2021 The law relies on private citizens to file civil lawsuits against anyone who performs or induces an abortion, or aids and abets one, once \"cardiac activity\" in an embryo can be detected via transvaginal ultrasound, which is usually possible beginning at around six weeks of pregnancy [223] Shortly after the law came into effect, anti-abortion organizations set up websites to collect \"whistleblower\" reports of suspected violators of the bill [224]\n\n\n2022\nOn February 25, 2022, Twitter accounts associated with Anonymous declared that they had launched a 'cyber operations' against the Russian Federation, in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine ordered by Russian president Vladimir Putin The group later temporarily disabled websites such as RT.com and the website of the Defence Ministry along with other state owned websites [235] [236] [237] [238] [239] Anonymous also leaked 200 GB worth of emails from the Belarusian weapons manufacturer Tetraedr, which provided logistical support for Russia in the Russian invasion of Ukraine [240] Anonymous also hacked into Russian TV channels and played Ukrainian music [241] through them and showed uncensored news of events in Ukraine [242]\n\n\nOperation Russia\nOn March 7, 2022, Anonymous actors DepaixPorteur and TheWarriorPoetz declared on Twitter [243] that they hacked 400 Russian surveillance cameras and broadcast them on a website [244] They call this operation \"Russian Camera Dump\" [243]\n\n\nIranian protests\nOn September 18, 2022, YourAnonSpider hacked the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran's official webpage belonging to Ali Khamenei in retaliation to the death of Mahsa Amini [259] Anonymous launched a cyber operation against the Iranian government for the alleged murder of Mahsa Amini Anonymous launched distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks against Iran's government and state-owned websites [260] On September 23, 2022, a hacktivist named \"Edaalate Ali\" hacked Iran's state TV government channel during the middle of broadcast and released CCTV footage of Iran's prison facilities [261] [262] On October 23, 2022, an Iranian hacker group known as \"Black Reward\" published confidential files and documents email system belonging to Iran's nuclear program [263] [264] Black Reward announced on their Telegram channel that they have hacked into 324 emails which contained more than a hundred thousand messages and over 50 gigabytes of files [265] A hacktivist

{"title": "PBS", "content": "\nHistory\nPBS was established on November 3, 1969, by Hartford N Gunn Jr (president of WGBH), John Macy (president of CPB), James Day (last president of National Educational Television), and Kenneth A Christiansen (chairman of the department of broadcasting at the University of Florida) [17]\n\n\nOperations\nEven with its status as a non-profit [8] [2] and educational television network, PBS engages in program distribution, providing television content and related services to its member stations, each of which together cooperatively owns the network [1] Unlike the affiliates for commercial TV networks, each non-profit PBS member station is charged with the responsibility of programming local content such as news, interviews, cultural, and public affairs programs for its individual market or state that supplements content provided by PBS and other public television distributors.\n\n\nProgramming\nThe evening and primetime schedule on PBS features a diverse array of programming including fine arts (Great Performances); drama (Masterpiece, Downton Abbey, American Family: Journey of Dreams); science (Nova, Nature); history (American Experience, American Masters, History Detectives, Antiques Roadshow); music (Austin City Limits, Soundstage); public affairs (Frontline, PBS NewsHour, Washington Week, Nightly Business Report); independent films and documentaries (P.O.V., Independent Lens); home improvement (This Old House); and interviews (Amanpour & Company, Tavis Smiley, The Dick Cavett Show) In 2012, PBS began organizing much of its prime time programming around a genre-based schedule (for example, drama series encompass the Sunday schedule, while science-related programs are featured on Wednesdays).\n\n\nPBS Kids\nLaunched as PTV on July 11, 1994, PBS Kids is the brand for children's programs aired by PBS PBS Kids, launched in 1999 and operated until 2005, was largely funded by satellite provider DirecTV The original channel ceased operations on September 26, 2005, in favor of PBS Kids Sprout, a commercial digital cable and satellite television channel originally operated as a joint venture between PBS, Comcast, Sesame Workshop and Apax Partners (NBCUniversal, which Comcast acquired in 2011, later acquired the other partners' interests in the channel in 2012) However, the original programming block still exists on PBS, filling daytime and in some cases, weekend morning schedules on its member stations; many members also carry 24-hour locally programmed children's networks featuring PBS Kids content on one of their digital subchannels A revived version of the PBS Kids Channel was launched on January 16, 2017 As of 2019, PBS Kids is the only children's programming block on U.S broadcast television.\n\n\nSports\nMany PBS member stations and networks—including Mississippi Public Broadcasting (MHSAA), Georgia Public Broadcasting (GHSA), Maine Public Broadcasting Network (MPA), Iowa PBS (IGHSAU), Nebraska Public Media (NSAA), and WKYU-TV (Western Kentucky Hilltoppers)—locally broadcast high school and college sports From the 1980s onward, the national PBS network has not typically carried sporting events, mainly because the broadcast rights to most sporting events have become more cost-prohibitive in that timeframe, especially for nonprofits with limited revenue potential; in addition, starting with the respective launches of the MountainWest Sports Network (now defunct) and Big Ten Network in 2006 and 2007 and the later launches of the Pac-12 Network and ESPN's SEC Network and ACC Network, athletic conferences have acquired rights for all of their member university's sports programs for their cable channels, restricting their use from PBS member stations, even those associated with their own universities.\n\n\nGovernance\nThe board of directors is responsible for governing and setting policy for PBS, consisting of 27 members: 14 professional directors (station managers), 12 general directors (outside directors), and the PBS president [67] All PBS Board members serve three-year terms, without pay [67] PBS member stations elect the 14 professional directors;

PBS is a publicly funded service with a mission to promote lifelong learning through high-quality, non-commercial programming and community engagement. PBS is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, and is a member of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.\n\n**History**\n\nPBS was established on November 3, 1969, by a group of individuals who believed in the importance of public broadcasting. The group, which included Hartford N. Gunn Jr., John Macy, James Day, and Kenneth A. Christiansen, aimed to create a network that would provide high-quality, educational programming to the American public. PBS began operations in 1970 and has since become one of the largest and most respected public television networks in the world.\n\n**Operations**\n\nPBS is a non-profit organization that operates on a membership model. The network is funded by a combination of government appropriations, corporate sponsorships, and individual donations. PBS has a strong presence in the United States, with over 350 member stations and a reach of 93.74% of American households. Each member station is responsible for programming and operating its own local content, including news, interviews, cultural, and public affairs programs.\n\n**Programming**\n\nPBS offers a diverse range of programming, including fine arts, drama, science, history, music, and public affairs. The network is known for its high-quality productions, such as \"Masterpiece,\" \"Downton Abbey,\" \"American Experience,\" and \"Nova.\" PBS also airs a range of children's programming, including \"Sesame Street\" and \"Wild Kratts.\" In addition to its regular programming, PBS often airs special events, such as concerts, documentaries, and live performances.\n\n**PBS Kids**\n\nPBS Kids is the brand for children's programs aired by PBS. Launched in 1999, PBS Kids is a 24-hour children's television network that offers a range of programming, including educational shows, live-action series, and animated programs. PBS Kids is available on many PBS member stations and is also broadcast on some cable and satellite networks.\n\n**Sports**\n\nMany PBS member stations and networks broadcast high school and college sports, including football, basketball, and baseball. However, the national PBS network has not typically carried sporting events, as the broadcast rights to most sporting events have become more cost-prohibitive in recent years.\n\n**Governance**\n\nThe board of directors is responsible for governing and setting policy for PBS. The board consists of 27 members, including 14 professional directors, 12 general directors, and the PBS president. All PBS Board members serve three-year terms, without pay. PBS member stations elect the 14 professional directors, while the board elects the 12 general directors and appoints the PBS president and CEO.\n\n**Member Stations**\n\nAs of 2023, PBS maintains current memberships with 354 television stations encompassing 50 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. possessions. PBS has a strong presence in the United States, with a reach of 93.74% of American households.\n\n**Participating Stations**\n\nMost PBS member stations have produced at least some nationally distributed programs. However, a smaller group of stations, including WGBH, KCET, and WNET, produce a significant portion of the network's regular programming.\n\n**PBS Networks**\n\nPBS has spun off a number of television networks, often in partnership with other media companies. These networks include PBS YOU, Create, and World. PBS also operates a range of digital channels, including PBS Kids Sprout and PBS Kids.\n\n**Independent Networks**\n\nWhile not operated or controlled by PBS proper, additional public broadcasting networks are available and carried by PBS member stations. These networks include American Public Media, NPR, and APT.\n\n**Visual Identity**\n\nPBS introduced its first iconographic logo in 1971, designed by Ernie Smith and Herb Lubalin of the Lubalin Smith Carnase design firm. The logo, known as the \"P-Head,\" has become an iconic symbol of the network and has been used in various forms since its introduction.\n\n**Reception**\n\nPBS has been praised by critics for its variety of programming. The network has been recognized for its high-quality productions, including its coverage of news, public affairs, and cultural events. PBS has also been commended for its commitment to diversity and inclusion, both in its programming and its hiring practices.\n\n**On-Air Fundraising**\n\nPBS relies heavily on individual donations and grants to fund its programming and operations. The network raises funds through a combination of direct mail campaigns, on-air fundraising, and corporate sponsorships. PBS's on-air fundraising efforts often take the form of pledge drives, which can be a source of controversy among viewers.\n\n**Controversies**\n\nPBS has faced criticism and controversy over the years, including accusations of liberal bias, censorship, and politicization. The network has also been involved in disputes over programming and funding, including a high-profile lawsuit with Pacific Arts Corporation.\n\n**Warning, Alert and Response Network (WARN)**\n\nPBS provides an alternative path for Wireless Emergency Alerts to wireless carriers through its Warning, Alert and Response Network (WARN). The alerts are transmitted through the PBS satellite network on the AMC-21 satellite to PBS stations, which then broadcast the messages over their transmitters for reception by wireless carriers at their cell sites.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPBS is a non-profit public broadcasting network that has a long history of providing high-quality, educational programming to the American public. The network is funded by a combination of government appropriations, corporate sponsorships, and individual donations. PBS offers a diverse range of programming, including fine arts, drama, science, history, music, and public affairs. The network has a strong presence in the United States, with over 350 member stations and a reach of 93.74% of American households.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"PBS\" following this outline:\n\n\nHistory\nPBS was established on November 3, 1969, by Hartford N Gunn Jr (president of WGBH), John Macy (president of CPB), James Day (last president of National Educational Television), and Kenneth A Christiansen (chairman of the department of broadcasting at the University of Florida) [17]\n\n\nOperations\nEven with its status as a non-profit [8] [2] and educational television network, PBS engages in program distribution, providing television content and related services to its member stations, each of which together cooperatively owns the network [1] Unlike the affiliates for commercial TV networks, each non-profit PBS member station is charged with the responsibility of programming local content such as news, interviews, cultural, and public affairs programs for its individual market or state that supplements content provided by PBS and other public television distributors.\n\n\nProgramming\nThe evening and primetime schedule on PBS features a diverse array of programming including fine arts (Great Performances); drama (Masterpiece, Downton Abbey, American Family: Journey of Dreams); science (Nova, Nature); history (American Experience, American Masters, History Detectives, Antiques Roadshow); music (Austin City Limits, Soundstage); public affairs (Frontline, PBS NewsHour, Washington Week, Nightly Business Report); independent films and documentaries (P.O.V., Independent Lens); home improvement (This Old House); and interviews (Amanpour & Company, Tavis Smiley, The Dick Cavett Show) In 2012, PBS began organizing much of its prime time programming around a genre-based schedule (for example, drama series encompass the Sunday schedule, while science-related programs are featured on Wednesdays).\n\n\nPBS Kids\nLaunched as PTV on July 11, 1994, PBS Kids is the brand for children's programs aired by PBS PBS Kids, launched in 1999 and operated until 2005, was largely funded by satellite provider DirecTV The original channel ceased operations on September 26, 2005, in favor of PBS Kids Sprout, a commercial digital cable and satellite television channel originally operated as a joint venture between PBS, Comcast, Sesame Workshop and Apax Partners (NBCUniversal, which Comcast acquired in 2011, later acquired the other partners' interests in the channel in 2012) However, the original programming block still exists on PBS, filling daytime and in some cases, weekend morning schedules on its member stations; many members also carry 24-hour locally programmed children's networks featuring PBS Kids content on one of their digital subchannels A revived version of the PBS Kids Channel was launched on January 16, 2017 As of 2019, PBS Kids is the only children's programming block on U.S broadcast television.\n\n\nSports\nMany PBS member stations and networks—including Mississippi Public Broadcasting (MHSAA), Georgia Public Broadcasting (GHSA), Maine Public Broadcasting Network (MPA), Iowa PBS (IGHSAU), Nebraska Public Media (NSAA), and WKYU-TV (Western Kentucky Hilltoppers)—locally broadcast high school and college sports From the 1980s onward, the national PBS network has not typically carried sporting events, mainly because the broadcast rights to most sporting events have become more cost-prohibitive in that timeframe, especially for nonprofits with limited revenue potential; in addition, starting with the respective launches of the MountainWest Sports Network (now defunct) and Big Ten Network in 2006 and 2007 and the later launches of the Pac-12 Network and ESPN's SEC Network and ACC Network, athletic conferences have acquired rights for all of their member university's sports programs for their cable channels, restricting their use from PBS member stations, even those associated with their own universities.\n\n\nGovernance\nThe board of directors is responsible for governing and setting policy for PBS, consisting of 27 members: 14 professional directors (station managers), 12 general directors (outside directors), and the PBS president [67] All PBS Board members serve three-year terms, without pay [67] PBS member stations elect the 14 professional directors;

alpinism and aeronautics that occurred in the preceding four-year Olympiad In 1924, 1932 and 1936, gold medals were awarded to 25 mountaineers from six nations for expeditions in the Himalayas and the Matterhorn In 1936, a gold medal was awarded to Hermann Schreiber of Switzerland for crossing the Alps in a glider in 1935, the first time that had been done [2] [6] [7] [8] Some sources include these IOC awards of gold medals in the overall count.\n\n\nAustralasia\nAustralasia was a combined team of athletes from Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand that competed together at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics  When the Olympic Games resumed in 1920 after World War I, the two nations sent separate teams to the Games, and have done so ever since.\n\n\nBritish West Indies\nThe West Indies Federation, [9] [10] also known as the West Indies, [11] [12] the Federation of the West Indies [13] or the West Indian Federation, [14] [15] [16]  was a short-lived political union that existed from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962 Various islands in the Caribbean that were part of the British Empire, including Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, and those on the Leeward and Windward Islands, came together to form the Federation.The expressed intention of the Federation was to create a political unit that would become independent from Britain as a single state [17]\nBefore that could happen, the Federation collapsed due to internal political conflicts over how it would be governed or function viably.\n\n\nCzechoslovakia\nCzechoslovakia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920, after having competed as Bohemia from 1900 to 1912 The nation sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the 1984 Games when they were part of the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics Czechoslovakia has participated in every Winter Olympic Games since the inaugural Games of 1924.\n\n\nGermany\nGermany has competed under five different designations, including as two separate teams at several Games Sources vary in how they present the medals won by these teams The table below shows sourced combinations of these teams, when applied to the updated medal totals from the main table A part of Germany, Saar, competed independently in the Summer Olympic games in 1952, but failed to win any medals Due to most lists only listing medal counts, it is possible Saar was included as part of Germany in their calculations Germany was banned on three occasions (1920, 1924, and 1948).\n\n\nKuwait\nAt the 2016 Summer Olympics, nine athletes from Kuwait competed as Independent Olympic Athletes (IOA), as the Kuwait Olympic Committee had been suspended by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the second time in five years due to governmental interference [20] [21] [22]\nAlthough not allowed to compete as a sovereign state at the 2016 Summer Olympics, the nation's participants were able to compete as Independent Olympic Athletes under the Olympic flag At those games, Kuwaiti shooters Fehaid Al-Deehani and Abdullah Al-Rashidi \nwon a gold medal and bronze medal respectively as independent athletes.\n\n\nNetherlands Antilles\nThe Netherlands Antilles participated at the Olympic Games from 1952 until 2008 as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nThe National Olympic Committee for the Netherlands Antilles was created in 1931 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee from 1950 until 2011 upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles [23]\n\n\nChina\nThe Republic of China (ROC) participated in its first Summer Olympics in 1932 under the name of China After the Chinese Civil War, the ROC retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949, and only Taiwan-based athletes have competed on its behalf since then In 1971, the ROC was expelled from the United Nations, but was permitted to compete under its official name, flag, and anthem in the 1972 Winter, 1972 Summer, and 1976 Winter Olympics It was denied official representation in the 1976 Summer Olympics and boycotted it as a result The 1979 Nagoya Resolution allowed the ROC to compete under the deliberately-ambiguous name \"Chinese Taipei\"; it protested against this decision and boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics as well, but has competed under this name since the 1984 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nRussian Federation and the Soviet Union\nThe Russian Federation, the Russian Empire, the Olympic Athletes from Russia and the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) are sometimes combined outside of IOC sources The Soviet Union is often combined with the post-union team that competed in 1992 [27] [28] [29] Some sources combine the Soviet Union and Russia, despite the fact that many republics which subsequently gained or re-gained independence (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia,  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan) contributed to the medal tally of the USSR, and there are sources that combine all medals of RU1, URS, EUN, OAR, ROC and RUS [30] [31] On 31 January 1992, the United Nations recognized, without objection, Russia as legal successor of the rights and obligations of the former Soviet Union, [32] but this has no significance in medal tallies.\n\n\nYugoslavia\nTeams from Yugoslavia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920 Yugoslavia has been the designation for Olympic teams from three distinct national entities:\n\n\nOthers\nIn addition to the teams of Independent Olympians at the Olympic Games mentioned above—Kuwait, Russia, the former Netherlands Antilles, and the former Yugoslavia—several other NOCs were represented by independent Olympic athletes East Timor's team in 2000 consisted of four athletes competing as Individual Olympic Athletes In 2012, one independent Olympic athlete represented South Sudan In the 2014 Winter Olympics, the team from India included one independent Olympic participant.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nObsolete nations notes\n\n\n\nName changes notes\n\n\n\nParticipation notes\n\n\n\nDisputed participation notes\nThe

appearances that are not considered official by the IOC Only one of these cases concerns a medal A gold medal that is officially added to France's total is given to Luxembourg [4]\n\n\nEarly Olympics\nFor the 1900 Summer Olympics several countries are credited with appearances that are not considered official by the IOC Only one of these cases concerns a medal A gold medal that is officially added to France's total is given to Luxembourg [4]\n\n\nAlpinism and aeronautics\nFrom 1924 through 1936, the IOC on several occasions awarded gold medals for feats of alpinism and aeronautics that occurred in the preceding four-year Olympiad In 1924, 1932 and 1936, gold medals were awarded to 25 mountaineers from six nations for expeditions in the Himalayas and the Matterhorn In 1936, a gold medal was awarded to Hermann Schreiber of Switzerland for crossing the Alps in a glider in 1935, the first time that had been done [2] [6] [7] [8] Some sources include these IOC awards of gold medals in the overall count.\n\n\nAustralasia\nAustralasia was a combined team of athletes from Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand that competed together at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics  When the Olympic Games resumed in 1920 after World War I, the two nations sent separate teams to the Games, and have done so ever since.\n\n\nBritish West Indies\nThe West Indies Federation, [9] [10] also known as the West Indies, [11] [12] the Federation of the West Indies [13] or the West Indian Federation, [14] [15] [16]  was a short-lived political union that existed from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962 Various islands in the Caribbean that were part of the British Empire, including Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, and those on the Leeward and Windward Islands, came together to form the Federation.The expressed intention of the Federation was to create a political unit that would become independent from Britain as a single state [17]\nBefore that could happen, the Federation collapsed due to internal political conflicts over how it would be governed or function viably.\n\n\nCzechoslovakia\nCzechoslovakia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920, after having competed as Bohemia from 1900 to 1912 The nation sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the 1984 Games when they were part of the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics Czechoslovakia has participated in every Winter Olympic Games since the inaugural Games of 1924.\n\n\nGermany\nGermany has competed under five different designations, including as two separate teams at several Games Sources vary in how they present the medals won by these teams The table below shows sourced combinations of these teams, when applied to the updated medal totals from the main table A part of Germany, Saar, competed independently in the Summer Olympic games in 1952, but failed to win any medals Due to most lists only listing medal counts, it is possible Saar was included as part of Germany in their calculations Germany was banned on three occasions (1920, 1924, and 1948).\n\n\nKuwait\nAt the 2016 Summer Olympics, nine athletes from Kuwait competed as Independent Olympic Athletes (IOA), as the Kuwait Olympic Committee had been suspended by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the second time in five years due to governmental interference [20] [21] [22]\nAlthough not allowed to compete as a sovereign state at the 2016 Summer Olympics, the nation's participants were able to compete as Independent Olympic Athletes under the Olympic flag At those games, Kuwaiti shooters Fehaid Al-Deehani and Abdullah Al-Rashidi \nwon a gold medal and bronze medal respectively as independent athletes.\n\n\nNetherlands Antilles\nThe Netherlands Antilles participated at the Olympic Games from 1952 until 2008 as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nThe National Olympic Committee for the Netherlands Antilles was created in 1931 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee from 1950 until 2011 upon the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles [23]\n\n\nChina\nThe Republic of China (ROC) participated in its first Summer Olympics in 1932 under the name of China After the Chinese Civil War, the ROC retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949, and only Taiwan-based athletes have competed on its behalf since then In 1971, the ROC was expelled from the United Nations, but was permitted to compete under its official name, flag, and anthem in the 1972 Winter, 1972 Summer, and 1976 Winter Olympics It was denied official representation in the 1976 Summer Olympics and boycotted it as a result The 1979 Nagoya Resolution allowed the ROC to compete under the deliberately-ambiguous name \"Chinese Taipei\"; it protested against this decision and boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics as well, but has competed under this name since the 1984 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nRussian Federation and the Soviet Union\nThe Russian Federation, the Russian Empire, the Olympic Athletes from Russia and the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) are sometimes combined outside of IOC sources The Soviet Union is often combined with the post-union team that competed in 1992 [27] [28] [29] Some sources combine the Soviet Union and Russia, despite the fact that many republics which subsequently gained or re-gained independence (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia,  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan) contributed to the medal tally of the USSR, and there are sources that combine all medals of RU1, URS, EUN, OAR, ROC and RUS [30] [31] On 31 January 1992, the United Nations recognized, without objection, Russia as legal successor of the rights and obligations of the former Soviet Union, [32] but this has no significance in medal tallies.\n\n\nYugoslavia\nTeams from Yugoslavia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920 Yugoslavia has been the designation for Olympic teams from three distinct national entities:\n\n\nOthers\nIn addition to the teams of Independent Olympians at the Olympic Games mentioned above—Kuwait, Russia, the former Netherlands Antilles, and the former Yugoslavia—several other NOCs were represented by independent Olympic athletes East Timor's team in 2000 consisted of four athletes competing as Individual Olympic Athletes In 2012, one independent Olympic athlete represented South Sudan In the 2014 Winter Olympics, the team from India included one independent Olympic participant.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nObsolete nations notes\n\n\n\nName changes notes\n\n\n\nParticipation notes\n\n\n\nDisputed participation notes\nThe nationalities of many medalists at the 1904 Olympics are disputed as many competitors were recent immigrants to the United States who had not yet been granted US citizenship.\n\n\nSee also\nAll-time medal counts are compiled using various sources, often

band manager after the show: \"The mistake was such a big deal that from that moment on, never again did I move when I wasn't supposed to move That was the discipline of Menudo: You either did things the way you were told or you were not part of the group.\" Although Martin enjoyed traveling and performing onstage with Menudo, he found the band's busy schedule and strict management exhausting, and later reflected that the experience \"cost\" him his childhood Despite this, Martin acknowledged his \"opportunity to have so many amazing experiences with so many amazing people\" during his time with the group [9]\n\n\n1984–1989: Menudo\nAfter achieving moderate fame in Puerto Rico for his appearances in television commercials, Martin auditioned for membership in Menudo Formed in Puerto Rico

shooting and slashing with improvised weapons and using telekinetic skills A wide variety of enemies are featured, among which are robots, interconnected into a single network, and even mutants [7] A crafting system allows the player to piece weapons together from metal parts that can be detached from robots or taken from household appliances  Ammo in the game is scarce, so the player also has the option to use rechargeable energy guns [8] Quick-time events are featured in the game [9]\n\n\nPlot\nAtomic Heart takes place on the grounds of Facility 3826, the Soviet Union's foremost scientific research hub in an alternate history 1955, located in the Kazakh SSR In 1936, scientist Dmitry Sechenov developed a liquidized programmable module called the Polymer, sparking massive technological breakthroughs in the fields of energy and robotics in the USSR and freeing much of the populace from manual labor When World War II broke out, the Soviets quickly gained the upper hand, but just before Nazi Germany was defeated in 1942, the Nazi Germany secretly unleashed the Brown Plague virus, leaving millions dead and creating an international demand for Soviet robots to compensate for the resulting worker shortage As part of the Soviet Union's post-war reconstruction program, Dr Sechenov created a wireless, networked artificial intelligence called \"Kollektiv 1.0\" that linked his robots together for greater efficiency.\n\n\nSetting\nAtomic Heart takes place on the grounds of Facility 3826, the Soviet Union's foremost scientific research hub in an alternate history 1955, located in the Kazakh SSR In 1936, scientist Dmitry Sechenov developed a liquidized programmable module called the Polymer, sparking massive technological breakthroughs in the fields of energy and robotics in the USSR and freeing much of the populace from manual labor When World War II broke out, the Soviets quickly gained the upper hand, but just before Nazi Germany was defeated in 1942, the Nazi Germany secretly unleashed the Brown Plague virus, leaving millions dead and creating an international demand for Soviet robots to compensate for the resulting worker shortage As part of the Soviet Union's post-war reconstruction program, Dr Sechenov created a wireless, networked artificial intelligence called \"Kollektiv 1.0\" that linked his robots together for greater efficiency.\n\n\nSynopsis\nMajor Sergey \"P-3\" Nechayev is a World War II veteran with memory problems, who was saved from a life-threatening injury in the past by Dmitry Sechenov As Sechenov's agent, P-3 is invited to assist in the rollout of Kollektiv 2.0 at Facility 3826, but he finds that the robots of the facility have gone rogue and massacred most human personnel Sechenov explains that robotics designer Viktor Petrov sabotaged the Kollektiv 1.0 node and asks P-3 to apprehend Petrov With his AI partner Char-LES (nicknamed \"Charles\") attached to his glove, P-3 is tasked with confronting homicidal robots and failed biomechanical experiments of Facility 3826.\n\n\nAnnihilation Instinct\nTaking place three days after the ending where P-3 refuses to confront Sechenov, Kollectiv 2.0 has fully launched and is steadily growing as more people around the globe join, unfortunately Zakharov has merged within the network and has brainwashed people with their THOUGHT device and has leaked information to outside the USSR, effectively causing a civil war Meanwhile, P-3 wakes up in the Mendeleev Complex, which has been fully taken over by the rogue artificial intelligence NORA NORA had fallen in love with P-3 during the Kollectiv incident, and synched herself to his brain implant NORA then tasks P-3 with eliminating Zinaida, who has become hostile to P-3 for abandoning the fight against Sechenov Heading to the surface, P-3 encounters NORA's inventor, Lebedev Lebedev repairs P-3's glove and explains that Zinaida joined an anti-Kollective faction, declared war against Sechenov, and seeks to take control of NORA to make use of her weapon manufacturing capabilities Meanwhile, NORA has completely sealed off the complex from the outside world with an electromagnetic barrier Lebedev then tasks P-3 with finding BEA-D robots scattered around the complex, which contain parts of NORA's code which he can use to access her core and reset her.\n\n\nTrapped in Limbo\nTaking place after the ending in which P-3 confronts Sechenov and is betrayed by Zakharov, P-3 awakens in Limbo, a dimension housing his and Ekaterina's subconsciouses Ekaterina, in the form of a Polymer teardrop, guides P-3 through this dimension as they recover the latter's memory Ekaterina also briefs P-3 on the events in the real world, informing the latter that while Sechenov's body has disappeared, the Kollektiv has yet to launch, and P-3's own unconscious body is taken to a lab alongside the Twins' P-3 eventually escapes Limbo and awakens, and sets out to find the rings he threw in the lake in order to restore Ekaterina.\n\n\nDeveloping and funding\nMundfish Studio was founded in 2017, in 2024 its key figures are the company’s president Robert Bagratuni, [16] CFO Evgenia Sedova, art director Artyom Galeev, and producer Oleg Gorodishenin [17] [18]\n\n\nThemes\nAtomic Heart was interpreted by many game critics and journalists as a political satire of authoritarianism, [29] artificial intelligence, and communism [30] Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph wrote that:\n\n\nSoundtrack\nThe game's soundtrack was written by three composers: Mick Gordon, famous for his work for video-game titles such as Doom, Prey and Wolfenstein (The New Order, The Old Blood, The New Colossus), Andrey \"Boogrov\" Bugrov, [34] [35] [36] [37] and Geoffrey Day [35] [36] [37]\n\n\nRelease\nIn

French-based company Focus Entertainment elsewhere.\n\n\nSales\nAtomic Heart sold above expectations, raising Mundfish's revenue to an all-time high Three weeks after the game's launch, Mundfish announced that the game had been played by five million players However, the game was also available upon launch on Xbox Game Pass, which accounted for an unknown percentage of players [45]\n\n\nResonance\nThe company has faced significant criticism for the Russian origins of its founders [46] [20] Since February 2024, Mundfish has removed mentions of its Russian office from the official website and positions itself as international company with «an incredible team… from 10 countries including Poland, Ukraine, Austria, Georgia, Israel, Armenia, UAE, Serbia, and Cyprus.» [47] [21] [48] In 2018, the studio employed just over 20 people, while by early 2023, that number had grown to around 130 [49]\n\n\nReception\nAtomic Heart received \"mixed or average\" reviews from critics for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions, while the PC version received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator website Metacritic [55] [56] [57]\n\n\nAwards\nIn November 2023, Atomic Heart joined the “Hall of Fame” [79] of the Russian gaming industry, winning in the “Legendary Video Games” categories [80]\n\n\nSequel\nIn 2021, two years prior to release of

It is named after the economist Daniel Suits, who first proposed the concept in the 1970s. The Suits index provides a way to quantify the extent to which a tax system or policy affects different income groups, making it a useful tool for policymakers and researchers.\n\n**Types of Tax**\n\nBy definition, a flat income tax has a Suits index of zero. This is because a flat income tax imposes the same tax rate on all income, regardless of the income level. However, almost all income tax systems allow for some amount of income to be earned without tax (an exemption amount) to avoid collecting tax from very low-income units. Additionally, most income tax systems provide for higher marginal tax rates at higher income. These effects combine to make income taxes generally progressive, and therefore have a positive Suits index.\n\nIncome tax systems that are considered progressive are those where the tax rate increases as the income level increases. This means that higher-income individuals pay a higher tax rate than lower-income individuals. For example, a country with a progressive income tax system might have a tax rate of 10% on income up to $20,000, 20% on income between $20,000 and $50,000, and 30% on income above $50,000. In this case, the Suits index would be positive, indicating that the tax system is progressive.\n\n**Income Tax**\n\nIncome tax is a type of tax that is levied on an individual's income. As mentioned earlier, income tax systems are generally progressive, meaning that the tax rate increases as the income level increases. This is because most income tax systems allow for some amount of income to be earned without tax (an exemption amount) and provide for higher marginal tax rates at higher income.\n\nThe Suits index can be used to measure the progressivity of an income tax system. A positive Suits index indicates that the tax system is progressive, while a negative Suits index indicates that the tax system is regressive. A Suits index of zero indicates that the tax system is flat, meaning that the tax rate is the same for all income levels.\n\nFor example, consider a country with a progressive income tax system where the tax rate is 10% on income up to $20,000, 20% on income between $20,000 and $50,000, and 30% on income above $50,000. In this case, the Suits index would be positive, indicating that the tax system is progressive.\n\n**Sales Tax**\n\nSales taxes are generally charged on each purchase, with no low-income exemption. Additionally, lower-income tax units generally spend a greater proportion of income on taxable purchases, while higher-income units will save or invest a larger part of income. Therefore, sales taxes are generally regressive, and have a negative Suits index.\n\nA regressive tax system is one where the tax rate decreases as the income level increases. This means that lower-income individuals pay a higher tax rate than higher-income individuals. For example, a country with a regressive sales tax system might charge a 10% sales tax on all purchases, regardless of the income level of the buyer. In this case, the Suits index would be negative, indicating that the tax system is regressive.\n\n**Excise Taxes**\n\nExcise taxes are typically charged on items like gasoline, alcohol, or tobacco products. Since the tax rate is typically high, and there is a practical limit to the amount of product that can be consumed, this tax is generally more regressive and has a very negative Suits index.\n\nExcise taxes are a type of tax that is levied on specific goods or services. They are often used to raise revenue for the government and to discourage the consumption of certain products. Excise taxes are typically regressive, meaning that the tax rate decreases as the income level increases. This is because lower-income individuals are more likely to consume the products that are subject to excise taxes, while higher-income individuals are less likely to consume them.\n\nFor example, a country with a high excise tax on gasoline might charge a tax of $1 per gallon. In this case, the Suits index would be negative, indicating that the tax system is regressive.\n\n**Properties**\n\nThe Suits index has the useful property that the total Suits index of a group of taxes or policies is the revenue-weighted sum of the individual indexes. This means that if a country has multiple taxes or policies, the overall Suits index can be calculated by weighting each index by the revenue generated by that tax or policy.\n\nThe Suits index is also related closely to the Gini coefficient. While a Gini coefficient of zero means that everyone receives the same income or benefit as a per capita value, a Suits index of zero means that each person pays the same tax as a percentage of income. Additionally, a poll tax has a Suits index equal to the negative of the Gini coefficient for the same group.\n\nThe Gini coefficient is a measure of income inequality, with a value of 0 indicating perfect equality and a value of 1 indicating perfect inequality. The Suits index can be used to measure the progressivity of a tax system or policy, while the Gini coefficient can be used to measure income inequality. A positive Suits index indicates that the tax system is progressive, while a negative Suits index indicates that the tax system is regressive.\n\n**Examples**\n\nThe Suits index can be used to measure the progressivity of various tax systems and policies. For example, a country with a progressive income tax system might have a Suits index of 0.5, indicating that the tax system is progressive. A country with a regressive sales tax system might have a Suits index of -0.5, indicating that the tax system is regressive.\n\nA country with a flat income tax system might have a Suits index of 0, indicating that the tax system is flat. A country with a poll tax might have a Suits index equal to the negative of the Gini coefficient for the same group, indicating that the tax system is regressive.\n\nThe Suits index can also be used to compare the progressivity of different tax systems and policies. For example, a country with a progressive income tax system might have a higher Suits index than a country with a regressive sales tax system. This indicates that the progressive income tax system is more progressive than the regressive sales tax system.\n\nIn conclusion, the Suits index is a useful tool for measuring the progressivity of tax systems and policies. It provides a way to quantify the extent to which a tax system or policy affects different income groups, making it a useful tool for policymakers and researchers.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Suits_index\" following this outline:\n\n\nTypes of tax\nBy definition, a flat income tax has a Suits index of zero  However, almost all income tax systems allow for some amount of income to be earned without tax (an exemption amount) to avoid collecting tax from very low income units  Also, most income tax systems provide for higher marginal tax rates at higher income  These effects combine to make income taxes generally progressive, and therefore have a positive Suits index.\n\n\nIncome tax\nBy definition, a flat income tax has a Suits index of zero  However, almost all income tax systems allow for some amount of income to be earned without tax (an exemption amount) to avoid collecting tax from very low income units  Also, most income tax systems provide for higher marginal tax rates at higher income  These effects combine to make income taxes generally progressive, and therefore have a positive Suits index.\n\n\nSales tax\nSales taxes are generally charged on each purchase, with no low income exemption  Additionally, lower income tax units generally spend a greater proportion of income on taxable purchases, while higher income units will save or invest a larger part of income  Therefore, sales taxes are generally regressive, and have a negative Suits index.\n\n\nExcise taxes\nExcise taxes are typically charged on items like gasoline, alcohol or tobacco products  Since the tax rate is typically high, and there is a practical limit to the amount of product that can be consumed, this tax is generally more regressive and has a very negative Suits index.\n\n\nProperties\nThe Suits index has the useful property that the total Suits index of a group of taxes or policies is the revenue-weighted sum of the individual indexes The Suits index is also related closely to the Gini coefficient While a Gini coefficient of zero means that everyone receives the same income or benefit as a per capita value, a Suits index of zero means that each person pays the same tax as a percentage of income Additionally, a poll tax has a Suits index equal to the negative of the Gini coefficient for the same group [1]\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They had one child, Jason Gould, who appeared as her on-screen son in The Prince of Tides.\n\n**Name**\n\nStreisand changed her name from \"Barbara\" to \"Barbra\" because, she said, \"I hated the name, but I refused to change it.\" Streisand further explained, \"Well, I was 18 and I wanted to be unique, but I didn't want to change my name because that was too false. You know, people were saying you could be Joanie Sands, or something like that (My middle name is Joan.) And I said, 'No, let's see, if I take out the 'a,' it's still 'Barbara,' but it's unique.\"\n\n**Politics**\n\nIn the early years of her career, Streisand's interest in politics was limited, with the exception of her participation in activities of the anti-nuclear group Women Strike for Peace in 1961 and 1962. In 1968, her political activism increased, and she helped promote the presidential campaign of Eugene McCarthy who held an anti–Vietnam War stance.

She received the Woman of Courage Award by the National Organization for Women (NOW), the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and Scopus Award by American Friends of the Hebrew University.\n\n**Professional Memberships**\n\nAs one of the most acclaimed actresses, singers, directors, writers, composers, producers, designers, photographers, and activists in every medium that she's worked in, Streisand is the only artist who is concurrently a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, Screen Actors Guild, American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, and Actors' Equity Association, as well as the honorary chairwoman of the board of directors of Hadassah's International Research Institute on Women.\n\n**Streisand Effect**\n\nIn a 2003 lawsuit, Streisand claimed that a website illustrating coastal erosion invaded her privacy because one of its over 12,000 images happened to show her Malibu, California, home; Streisand wanted the photo removed from the site. The suit was dismissed, and the resultant publicity prompted hundreds of thousands of people to download the photo, which had been accessed only four times prior to Streisand initiating legal action.\n\n**Namesakes**\n\nThe Barbra Streisand Cup is a rugby union match held in Sydney, Australia, each year played between the Sydney Convicts, Australia's first gay and inclusive Rugby Union club, and the Maccabi Rugby FC, Sydney's only Jewish rugby team. It's a friendly match, typically played in or around April, between the rival clubs and is named in Streisand's honor as she is known to have a large fan base in both the gay and the Jewish communities.\n\n**Awards and Nominations**\n\nStreisand has been nominated 43 times for a Grammy Award, winning eight. In addition, she has received two special non-competitive awards: the 1992 Grammy Legend Award and the 1994 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

the club won promotion back two years later [7] [11] After the First World War broke out, Luton took part in The London Combination during 1915–16, and afterwards filled each season with friendly matches [12] [13] A key player of the period was Ernie Simms, a forward Simms was invalided back to England after being wounded on the Italian front, [11] [13] but recovered enough to regain his place in the Luton team and scored 40 goals during the 1916–17 season [11]\n\n\nSuccess under Duncan and relegation (1950–1965)\nDuring the early 1950s, one of Luton's greatest sides [22] emerged under manager Dally Duncan [23] The team included Gordon Turner, who went on to become Luton's all-time top goalscorer, [24] Bob Morton, who holds the record for the most club appearances, [25] and Syd Owen, an England international [26] During this period, Luton sides also featured two England international goalkeepers, Ron Baynham and Bernard Streten, [27] [28] as well as Irish internationals Seamus Dunne, [29] Tom Aherne and George Cummins [30] [31] This team reached the top flight for the first time in 1955–56, after finishing the season in second place behind Birmingham City on goal average [32] A few years of success followed, including an FA Cup Final appearance against Nottingham Forest in 1958–59; [33] at the end of the season, Owen was voted FWA Footballer of the Year [34] However, the club was relegated the following season and, by 1964–65, was playing in the fourth tier [35]\n\n\nBack to the first tier and late century success (1965–1992)\nIn yo-yo club fashion, Luton were to return A team including Bruce Rioch, John Moore and Graham French won the Fourth Division championship in 1967–68 under the leadership of former player Allan Brown;

The club was formed in 1885 and has a long and storied history, with a strong connection to the local community.\n\nHistory\n----------\n\nLuton Town Football Club was formed on 11 April 1885, with the aim of bringing together the best players from the various clubs in the town. The club's first ground was at Dallow Lane, which was located next to the Dunstable to Luton railway line. However, the club's early years were marked by financial struggles, and in 1896-97, the club was forced to sell the stadium to stay afloat.\n\nFormation and election to the Southern League (1885-1890)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe club was formed on 11 April 1885, with the aim of bringing together the best players from the various clubs in the town. The club's first ground was at Dallow Lane, which was located next to the Dunstable to Luton railway line. The club's early years were marked by financial struggles, and in 1896-97, the club was forced to sell the stadium to stay afloat.\n\nEarly 20th century (1900-1950)\n-----------------------------\n\nEight years after arriving at Dunstable Road, Luton moved again, settling at their current ground, Kenilworth Road, in 1905. Captain and left winger Bob Hawkes became Luton's first international player when he was picked to play for England against Ireland on 16 February 1907. A poor 1911-12 season saw Luton relegated to the Southern League's Second Division; the club won promotion back two years later.\n\nSuccess under Duncan and relegation (1950-1965)\n--------------------------------------------\n\nDuring the early 1950s, one of Luton's greatest sides emerged under manager Dally Duncan. The team included Gordon Turner, who went on to become Luton's all-time top goalscorer, Bob Morton, who holds the record for the most club appearances, and Syd Owen, an England international. This team reached the top flight for the first time in 1955-56, after finishing the season in second place behind Birmingham City on goal average.\n\nBack to the first tier and late century success (1965-1992)\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn yo-yo club fashion, Luton were to return. A team including Bruce Rioch, John Moore and Graham French won the Fourth Division championship in 1967-68 under the leadership of former player Allan Brown. Two years later, Malcolm Macdonald's goals helped them to another promotion, while comedian Eric Morecambe became a director of the club. Luton Town won promotion back to the First Division in 1973-74, but were relegated the following season by a solitary point.\n\nResurgence and fall to non-League (1992-2009)\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe club was relegated from the top division at the end of the 1991-92 season, and sank to the third tier four years later. Luton stayed in the third-tier Second Division until relegation at the end of the 2000-01 season. Under the management of Joe Kinnear, who had arrived halfway through the previous season, the team won promotion from the fourth tier at the first attempt.\n\nFrom non-League to Premier League (2009-present)\n---------------------------------------------\n\nRelegation meant that 2009-10 saw Luton playing in the Conference Premier, a competition in which the club had never before participated. The club unsuccessfully contested the promotion play-offs three times in four seasons during their time as a non-League club, employing five different managers. In the 2012-13 FA Cup fourth round, Luton won their away tie against Premier League club Norwich City 1-0 and, in doing so, became the first non-League team to beat a side from England's top division since 1989.\n\nClub identity\n--------------\n\nThe club's nickname, \"the Hatters\", reflects Luton's historical connection with the hat making trade, which has been prominent there since the 17th century. The nickname was originally a variant on the now rarely seen straw-plaiters. Supporters of the club are also called Hatters.\n\nShirt sponsors\n--------------\n\nThe first sponsor to appear on a Luton Town shirt was Tricentrol, a local motor company based in Dunstable, who sponsored the club from March 1980 to 1982; the deal was worth £50,000.\n\nStadium\n-------\n\nLuton Town's first ground was at Dallow Lane, the former ground of Excelsior. The ground was next to the Dunstable to Luton railway line, and players regularly claimed to have trouble seeing the ball because of smoke from the trains. A damaging financial loss during 1896-97 forced Luton to sell the stadium to stay afloat and, as a result, the club moved across the tracks to a stadium between the railway and Dunstable Road. The Dunstable Road ground was opened by Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, who also donated £50 towards the £800 building costs.\n\nSupporters and rivalries\n------------------------\n\nDuring the 2014-15 season, Luton Town had an average home league attendance of 8,702—the second highest in League Two behind only Portsmouth. In the 2013-14 season, when the club were in the Conference Premier, the club had significantly higher support than the other clubs in its league, with an average home attendance of 7,387; more than twice compared to the second highest of 3,568. Average attendances at Kenilworth Road fell with the installation of seats and the club's reduction in stature, dropping from 13,452 in 1982-83 to their 2014-15 level—a slump of 35% over 32 years.\n\nRecords and statistics\n-------------------------\n\nThe record for the most appearances for Luton is held by Bob Morton, who turned out for Luton 562 times in all competitions. Morton also holds the record for the most Football League appearances for the club, with 495. Fred Hawkes holds the record for the most league appearances for Luton, having played in 509 league matches. Six players, Gordon Turner, Andy Rennie, Brian Stein, Ernie Simms, Herbert Moody and Steve Howard, have scored more than 100 goals for Luton.\n\nPlayers\n-------\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\nCurrent squad\n----------------\n\n* Goalkeepers\n\t+ Adam Smith (England)\n* Defenders\n\t+ Matty Pearson (England)\n* Midfielders\n\t+ Luke Berry (England)\n\t+ Kal Naismith (Scotland)\n* Forwards\n\t+ James Collins (England)\n\nOut on loan\n----------------\n\n* Goalkeepers\n\t+ Christian Doidge (Wales)\n* Defenders\n\t+ Joe Widdowson (England)\n* Midfielders\n\t+ Luke Gambin (Malta)\n* Forwards\n\t+ Carlton Morris (England)\n\nYouth team\n------------\n\nThe club operates a Development Squad, made up of contracted senior players, youth team scholars and trialists, which plays in the Southern Division of The Central League.

more than twice compared to the second highest of 3,568 [C] Average attendances at Kenilworth Road fell with the installation of seats and the club's reduction in stature, dropping from 13,452 in 1982–83 to their 2014–15 level—a slump of 35% over 32 years [121] A supporters' trust, Trust in Luton, owns shares in the club and elects a representative to the club's board [122] [123] The club's official supporters' group, Luton Town Supporters' Club, merged with Trust in Luton in 2014 [124] The club is associated with another supporters' group, the breakaway Loyal Luton Supporters Club [125] Trust in Luton has, since March 2014, held the legal right to veto any changes to the club's identity, including name, nickname, colours, club crest and mascot [126]\n\n\nRecords and statistics\nThe record for the most appearances for Luton is held by Bob Morton, who turned out for Luton 562 times in all competitions [133] Morton also holds the record for the most Football League appearances for the club, with 495 [133] Fred Hawkes holds the record for the most league appearances for Luton, having played in 509 league matches [134] Six players, Gordon Turner, Andy Rennie, Brian Stein, Ernie Simms, Herbert Moody and Steve Howard, have scored more than 100 goals for Luton [135] [136] [137] [138]\n\n\nPlayers\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nCurrent squad\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nPlayers under contract\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nOut on loan\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nYouth team\nThe club operates a Development Squad, made up of contracted senior players, youth team scholars and trialists, which plays in the Southern Division of The Central League [147] The club also fields an under-18 team in the Football League Youth Alliance South East Conference [148] Luton's youth set-up consists of ten Soccer Centres across Bedfordshire and North Hertfordshire, two Centres of Excellence (one in Luton, one in Dunstable), and an academy in Baldock that caters for players in the under-9 to under-16 age groups [149]\n\n\nDevelopment squad\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nUnder 18s squad\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.\n\n\nNotable former players\nLeague\n\n\nBackroom staff\nLeague\n\n\nShareholders\nLeague\n\n\nDirectors\nLeague\n\n\nManagement\nLeague\n\n\nManagers\nLeague\n\n\nHonours\nLeague\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Designed by Marcel Breuer & Associates, the building was originally the home of the Whitney Museum of American Art from 1966 to 2015. After a brief stint as the Met Breuer, a temporary gallery of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the building was purchased by the Frick Collection in 2021 and is now known as the Frick Madison. In 2024, the auction house Sotheby's acquired the building and plans to use it as its new headquarters.\n\n**Site**\n\nThe museum building occupies the southeast corner of the intersection of Madison Avenue and 75th Street. The property is considered to be within the Lenox Hill neighborhood within the Upper East Side. The original building's site measures 103+2⁄3 by 125 feet (31.6 by 38.1 m), occupying almost 13,000 square feet (1,200 m²). The building's location provides a unique opportunity for visitors to experience the city's vibrant art scene.\n\n**Design**\n\n945 Madison Avenue was designed for the Whitney Museum of American Art by Marcel Breuer & Associates. Breuer was a prominent architect and designer, known for his contributions to the Bauhaus movement and his work in \"New Brutalism\" or Brutalism. The building's design reflects Breuer's style, with a focus on functionality and simplicity. The structure includes a cantilevered facade in progressive steps, overshadowing the Madison Avenue street front. The building's exterior is made of reinforced concrete with variegated gray granite cladding, providing a striking visual contrast to the surrounding streetscape.\n\n**Exterior**\n\nThe building's exterior is a major part of its design. The cantilevered facade, which is made of reinforced concrete, is a striking feature of the building. The facade is supported by a series of columns, which are spaced at regular intervals. The columns are made of gray granite, which provides a natural and earthy tone to the building. The facade is designed to be functional, providing a sense of openness and transparency to the building.\n\n**Interior**\n\nThe building's interior is designed to be functional and efficient. The interior space is divided into several areas, including exhibition spaces, offices, storage areas, and a library. The building's interior is made of concrete, bluestone, and oiled bronze, providing a sense of warmth and coziness to the space. The floors are made of bluestone tile, and the walls are made of white, gray, or granite-faced materials. The ceilings are made of a suspended grid of concrete coffers, which provides a sense of openness and lightness to the space.\n\n**Lobby**\n\nThe lobby of the building is a major part of its design. The lobby is designed to be functional and efficient, providing a sense of openness and transparency to the building. The lobby is made of concrete, wood, bronze, and leather, providing a sense of warmth and coziness to the space. The lobby is also home to an information desk and waiting spaces. The lobby's ceiling is taken up by white circular light fixtures, each with a single bare silver-tipped bulb.\n\n**Dining space**\n\nThe building's lower-level dining space has hosted numerous tenants over the years. At its opening, the building had a cafeteria-style restaurant. By the 1980s, the space was called the Garden Restaurant, the same name used for the restaurant in the museum's prior space beside the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden. The restaurant offered a range of dishes, including English tea service, mushroom omelets, spicy pasta, and a layered \"Whitney Cake\".\n\n**History**\n\nThe Whitney Museum of American Art was founded in 1929 by philanthropist Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. The museum initially opened its doors to the public in 1931 at 8 West 8th Street. However, this location quickly proved inadequate, and the museum relocated to an annex of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) at 22 West 54th Street in 1954. The museum continued to grow and expand, but it ultimately outgrew its space at the annex. In 1966, the museum moved to its new building at 945 Madison Avenue, which was designed by Marcel Breuer & Associates.\n\n**Expansion proposals**\n\nThe institution grappled with space constraints for decades, prompting several satellite museums and exhibition spaces in the 1970s and 1980s. The Whitney considered a significant number of expansion proposals for the Breuer Building, an unusual proportion versus what was actually built. Five different architects, including three Pritzker Prize winners, provided a total of eight proposals. Only one modest design was actually built.\n\n**2015-2020: Met Breuer**\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, looking to build its presence in the modern and contemporary art scenes, agreed to lease the building in 2011. The museum was also looking to display its contemporary and modern art while its Fifth Avenue building's wing was renovated, making the move potentially temporary from the beginning. The building underwent a $12.95 million renovation ahead of the Met opening. This included a thorough cleaning, led by Beyer Blinder Belle. The architects also stripped decades of additions, decluttering the lobby of posters, postcard racks, and wires.\n\n**2021-2024: Frick Madison**\n\nThe museum building reopened in March 2021 as the Frick Madison, a temporary gallery of the Frick Collection. Since 1935, the Frick had been situated at Henry Clay Frick House, five blocks south of the Breuer Building. However, due to a planned renovation, the museum was set to temporarily operate at 945 Madison for approximately two years.\n\n**2024-present: Sotheby's**\n\nDuring much of the Frick Madison's lease, the building's future after 2023 was uncertain. There were no announced tenants beyond the Frick Collection, and the Whitney Museum reportedly could not sell the building for the foreseeable future. The 20-year restriction was set in 2008 as part of a $131 million gift from Leonard Lauder, former board chairman emeritus, the largest donation in the museum's history. In June 2023, the auction house Sotheby's agreed to purchase the building for approximately $100 million.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe building was controversial to the public at its opening.

It was first listed in 1981, as a contributing structure to the Upper East Side Historic District (as designated by New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission). Despite this, it was listed as a noncontributing structure in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) district of the same name in 1984.\n\n**Influence**\n\nThe building came to define the Whitney Museum's image, as its iconic home for almost 50 years. Marcel Breuer's work with the Whitney Museum prompted an invitation to design for the Cleveland Museum of Art. Breuer was the only person invited to submit a design for its north wing, as he showed an understanding for museum needs and understanding for materials with the Whitney project. Breuer's wing opened in 1971, designed with similarities to the Whitney Museum, including a cantilevered concrete entrance canopy outside and a suspended coffered grid inside.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"945_Madison_Avenue\" following this outline:\n\n\nSite\nThe museum building occupies the southeast corner of the intersection of Madison Avenue and 75th Street [2] The property is considered to be within the Lenox Hill neighborhood within the Upper East Side, [3] one block east of Central Park [4] The original building's site measures 103+2⁄3 by 125 feet (31.6 by 38.1 m), [5] occupying almost 13,000 square feet (1,200 m2) [6] [7]\n\n\nDesign\n945 Madison Avenue was designed for the Whitney Museum of American Art by Marcel Breuer & Associates – primarily Breuer himself and his partner Hamilton P Smith Michael H Irving was the consulting architect, and Paul Weidlinger was the structural engineer [5] [12] The work was the most major in New York City for Breuer, and one of the most important of his career [13] It was his first museum commission, [14] and his first and only remaining work in Manhattan [15]: 123  [16]: 4  Breuer was originally a student of the Bauhaus architecture and design school, though he later became one of the leading figures in \"New Brutalism\" or Brutalism [17]: 6 \n\n\nExterior\nThe building's exterior lies in stark contrast with the streetscape of Madison Avenue It uses reinforced concrete with variegated gray granite cladding The structure includes a cantilevered facade in progressive steps overshadowing the Madison Avenue street front [2] [8] Breuer stated that the cantilevered floors help receive visitors before they enter the museum building [12] The Madison Avenue entrance also features an areaway, or sunken stone courtyard [8] Above the areaway is a canopied concrete bridge into the building's lobby, likened to a portal and sculpture by Architectural Forum [6]\n\n\nInterior\nThe building originally had 76,830 sq ft (7,138 m2) of interior space [5] Only about 30,000 square feet was for exhibition space;

the Met had leased the building from the Whitney in a deal set to expire in 2023 [66]\n\n\n2024–present: Sotheby's\nDuring much of the Frick Madison's lease, the building's future after 2023 was uncertain [63] There were no announced tenants beyond the Frick Collection, and the Whitney Museum reportedly could not sell the building for the foreseeable future The 20-year restriction was set in 2008 as part of a $131 million gift from Leonard Lauder, former board chairman emeritus, the largest donation in the museum's history [15]: 121  The museum was reported to be considering a sale by late 2021 [71] Lauder was initially opposed to the Whitney's move downtown, though he eventually grew to like the new museum building, which was named for him in 2016 [19] In June 2023, the auction house Sotheby's agreed to purchase the building for approximately $100 million [72] [73] 945 Madison Avenue is planned to house Sotheby's headquarters, including its galleries, exhibition space, and auction room [74] The company took over the property after the Frick Collection's sublease ended in August 2024; [73] it plans to open the new space in 2025, with galleries free and open to the public [74] The auction house will hire an architect to rework interior spaces, but will preserve the integrity of the building [19]\n\n\nImpact\nThe building was controversial to the public at its opening; [45] comments likened it to a fortress or garage, while some admired it for being striking or romantic [27] It was nevertheless well-received as a masterpiece by critics in the 1960s, in architecture, art, and general magazines and newspapers [13] In 1966, Ada Louise Huxtable of The New York Times referred to the building as \"harsh and handsome\", and a site that grows on the viewer slowly over time, though she admitted it was \"the most disliked building in New York\" [14] Huxtable noted that the building may be too severe and gloomy for many people's tastes, and, in the same year, art critic Emily Genauer echoed her statement, calling the building \"oppressively heavy\" and \"the Madison Avenue Monster\" [9] In 1966, Progressive Architecture criticized the 75th Street facade for being incongruous with the Madison Avenue facade and for appearing empty save for its sculptural windows [12]\n\n\nCritical reception\nThe building was controversial to the public at its opening;

the Comstock Act is found in sections 1461 through 1463 of chapter 71, title 18 of the United States Code The rest of chapter 71, title 18, United States Code, consists of various provisions from the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988 [note 2] and the PROTECT Act of 2003 [note 3]\n\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1461\nThe first of the three sections of the Comstock Act which are contained under chapter 71, title 18, United States Code, is section 1461 This is the initial Comstock Act provision, as currently amended, and it was first enacted as an extraneous rider under Sec 148 of an Act to revise, consolidate, and amend the Statutes relating to the Post-office Department [3] The punishment for violating section 1461 is either a fine, a jail sentence of up to 5 years for a first offense, a jail sentence of up to 10 years for any subsequent offense, or a combination of a jail sentence and a fine, as is stated in its text [11]\n\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1462\nThe second of the three primary sections of the Comstock Act is codified in a positive law title at section 1462 of chapter 71, title 18, United States Code It was initially enacted under Sec 211 of the Criminal Code Act of 1909 on March 4, 1909.\n\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1463\nThe final Comstock Act provision in chapter 71, title 18, United States Code, found at section 1463, concerns mailing any of the matters mentioned in section 1461 or 1462 on the outside of a mail piece Like section 1462, this section came initially as an amendment (contained in Sec 212.) through the Criminal Code Act of 1909 A violation of this section carries a jail term of up to 5 years, a fine, or both as a penalty This section has no sentence enhancement for prior offenses, unlike section 1461 or 1462 [25]\n\n\n18 U.S.C. § 552\nThere is one section of the Comstock Act found in title 18, United States Code, which is outside chapter 71 This is 18 U.S.C § 552,and pertains to customs officials acting as principal to certain activity For abortion-related matter, this section applies to the extent implicating procurement of abortion This section, currently codified in a positive law title, was first enacted as Sec 4 of an Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use [3]\n\n\nSec. 305. of the Tariff Act of 1930 (or 19 U.S.C. § 1305)\nIn addition to the criminal importation provisions under section 1462, there is also a civil forfeiture provision of the Comstock Act [27] While an earlier version did exist, as Sec 5 of the Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use, [3] the modern version was initially enacted under Sec 305 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and is currently codified (in a non-positive law title) at section 1305 of title 19, United States Code It presently provides that:\n\n\n39 U.S.C. § 3001(e)\nThe last section of the Comstock Act is found at 39 U.S.C § 3001 in subsection (e), and it declares that unsolicited contraceptives are non-mailable unless the addressee is a manufacturer or trader in contraceptives, a physician, a nurse, a pharmacist, a hospital, or a clinic [29] This provision was ruled unconstitutional in Bolger v Youngs Drug Products Corp (1983), as-applied to business mailings, due to an as-applied First Amendment challenge [30] [31] [32]\n\n\nDefinitions, knowledge requirement, statute of limitations, etc.\nConcerning the definitions used in the Comstock Act, there are three key definitions: indecent, obscene, and knowingly.\n\n\nDefinitions\nConcerning the definitions used in the Comstock Act, there are three key definitions: indecent, obscene, and knowingly.\n\n\nKnowledge requirement\nFor reference, under the Model Penal Code, a guide often used to assist in legislative drafting, the knowingly criminal knowledge requirement, the second most stringent behind purposely, is defined as follows: \"A person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense when...he is aware that his conduct is of that nature...if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.\" [39]\n\n\nStatute of limitations\nAs nothing indicates otherwise, and since a violation of the Act is a non-capital offense, it has a 5-year statute of limitations [40] [41]\n\n\nJurisprudence\nIn June 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down a 6–3 majority opinion in the case of Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022) This decision devolved regulation of abortion back to the states, overturned Roe v Wade (1973), and ended recognition of pre-viability abortion access as a constitutional right Consequently, the applicability of the Comstock Act to abortion-related articles has become subject to legal dispute [10]\n\n\nContemporary\nIn June 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down a 6–3 majority opinion in the case of Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022) This decision devolved regulation of abortion back to the states, overturned Roe v Wade (1973), and ended recognition of pre-viability abortion access as a constitutional right Consequently, the applicability of the Comstock Act to abortion-related articles has become subject to legal dispute [10]\n\n\nContext\nFollowing the outcome reached in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), the Comstock Act has become increasingly discussed by anti-abortion groups and public figures as being a means by which abortion access in the United States could be curtailed without the need for new federal legislation [112] [113] [114] [115]\n\n\nFDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine (2024)\nIn March 2023, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, an anti-abortion group founded in 2022, filed a federal lawsuit challenging the FDA's approval of mifepristone from back in the year 2000 [52] Trial court hearings in the case occurred on March 15, 2023 [53] On April 7, 2023, Matthew Kacsmaryk, a district judge for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, ruled at the trial-level in that case, Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v U.S Food and Drug Administration, that the approval of mifepristone was improper, the lifting of REMS restrictions was improper, and the Comstock Act of 1873 made providing medication abortion by mail illegal This ruling by judge Kacsmaryk conflicted with an opposing same day ruling issued by a U.S district court in Washington (state) [54] [55] [56] [57] The ruling by Kacsmaryk was criticized in the Washington Post as using cherry picked scientific data, presenting a biased tone, and being an example of forum shopping [58] [59] Biopharmaceutical groups were also critical of judge Kacsmaryk, claiming his ruling \"set a precedent for diminishing FDA's authority over drug approvals, and in so doing,  [created] uncertainty for the entire biopharma industry\" [60]\n\n\nHistorical\nEx parte Jackson (1878) was the first case brought before the Supreme Court of the United States that considered the constitutionality of the Comstock Act While primarily pertaining to a facial challenge mounted against a federal law barring the mailing of lottery items, the Court nonetheless made reference to the Comstock Act [13] [71] In doing, the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed both the lottery circular law and the original provision of the Comstock Act (18 U.S.C § 1461) as being valid exercises of Congressional authority under the Postal Clause [15] This holding concerning the Comstock Act's initial provision was reaffirmed in later cases like Roth v United States (1957), United States v Reidel (1971), and Smith v United States (1977) [72] [73] [12] [74] [75] [14]\n\n\nCongressional authority to enact the Comstock Act\nEx parte Jackson (1878) was the first case brought before the Supreme Court of the United States that considered the constitutionality of the Comstock Act While primarily pertaining to a facial challenge mounted against a federal law barring the mailing of lottery items, the Court nonetheless made reference to the Comstock Act [13] [71] In doing, the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed both the lottery circular law and the original provision of the Comstock Act (18 U.S.C § 1461) as being valid exercises of Congressional authority under the Postal Clause [15] This holding concerning the Comstock Act's initial provision was reaffirmed in later cases like Roth v United States (1957), United States v Reidel (1971), and Smith v United States (1977) [72] [73] [12] [74] [75] [14]\n\n\nVagueness challenges\nThe broad language used in the Comstock Act has, mostly in the years since the Dobbs decision, lead to some opining that the Comstock Act, particularly 18 U.S.C § 1461, is unconstitutionally vague [57] [20] However, the understanding built by the surrounding case law has been largely dismissive of vagueness challenges For instance, in Hamling v United States (1974), the Supreme Court would uphold section 1461 by adopting a saving construction that conformed the section with the Miller test [35] [79] Later, in Smith v United States (1977), the Supreme Court would push back against another vagueness argument (this time presented as an as-applied challenge) [80] [75] Writing for the court, Justice Harry Blackmun, best known for writing the opinion delivered in Roe v Wade (1973), [81] would go on to explicitly state the following:\n\n\nObscenity statutory interpretation\nWhile the standards for what constitutes obscenity have changed since the Comstock Act's initial passage, the Act's application to obscenity has been upheld against an array of First Amendment challenges As an example, in Roth v United States (1957), a case partially superseded by Miller v California (1973) as to the particular test used, the Supreme Court upheld the Comstock Act against a First Amendment challenge [72] [74] In One, Inc v Olesen (1958), decided as a follow-on to Roth, the Supreme Court ruled that material pertaining to homosexuality is not ipso facto obscene [82] [83] and later reaffirming the conclusion in MANual Enterprises v Day (1962) [84] [85] The Miller test is the obscenity test currently applied to the Comstock Act, as explained in the opinion for Hamling v United States (1974) [35] [79]\n\n\nStatutory interpretation of abortion-related references\nWith respect to the Comstock Act's references to abortion, which currently have not yet been removed as had the reference to contraceptives, historical interpretation has generally construed this as applying to articles intended for unlawful abortion, reconciling it with Sec 305 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which does make such a distinction [42] [86] [11]\n\n\nScholarly discussion\nAn area of interest to legal scholars concerned the effect of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 which, among other things, added 'dealing in obscene matters' as a predicate offense for purposes of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO) It was initially believed by some scholars that this modification to RICO would get struck down as an unconstitutional burden on First Amendment protected conduct [87] Nine years after that modification was made to RICO, this concern would be answered as the Supreme Court, in Alexander v United States (1993), upheld, against a First Amendment challenge, a RICO forfeiture pertaining to obscenity [88] [89]\n\n\nStatus as a RICO predicate\nAn area of interest to legal scholars concerned the effect of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 which, among other things, added 'dealing in obscene matters' as a predicate offense for purposes of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO) It was initially believed by some scholars that this modification to RICO would get struck down as an unconstitutional burden on First Amendment protected conduct [87] Nine years after that modification was made to RICO, this concern would be answered as the Supreme Court, in Alexander v United States (1993), upheld, against a First Amendment challenge, a RICO forfeiture pertaining to obscenity [88] [89]\n\n\nTextualist analysis of statutory construction in regard to abortion\nThere has been scholarly analysis, using a textualist framework, which argues that the historical framing of the Act in the context of abortion is ill-supported due to nothing in the Comstock Act's text (other than that resurfaced as Sec 305 of the Tariff Act of 1930) making an explicit 'illegal intentions' distinction, the fact that the majority of decisions adopting an 'illegal intentions' construction are from United States courts of appeals (that only bind to courts in that particular circuit), [16] and the non-legally-binding nature of historical revision notes in the U.S Code (unlike statutory notes which do have force of law) [90] [91]\n\n\nRelated issues\nMargaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, was charged in 1915 for her work The Woman Rebel Sanger circulated this work through the U.S postal service, violating the Comstock Act On appeal, her conviction was reversed on the grounds that contraceptive devices could legally be promoted for the cure and prevention of disease [92] Her husband, architect William Sanger, was similarly charged earlier that year under a New York law against disseminating contraceptive information [93] In 1932, Margaret Sanger arranged for a shipment of diaphragms to be mailed from Japan to a sympathetic physician in New York City When U.S customs confiscated the package as unlawful contraceptives, Sanger aided that physician in filing a lawsuit to contest the seizure The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in United States v One Package of Japanese Pessaries (1936) that the Comstock Act was not to be construed as interfering with practice of medicine [92] [94]\n\n\nContraceptives\nMargaret Sanger, the

enforcement\nDue to its age, the Comstock Act has been referred to by some commentators, in publications such as MSNBC and Slate, as a \"zombie law\" [98] [99] However, the Act remains just as effective as does any other federal law unless repealed or amended [100] The doctrine of desuetude (a common law concept that a law is repealed by implication if it has not been used in a long time) has not garnered widespread support in U.S courts [101]\n\n\nPresent-day discourse\nFollowing the outcome reached in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), the Comstock Act has become increasingly discussed by anti-abortion groups and public figures as being a means by which abortion access in the United States could be curtailed without the need for new federal legislation [112] [113] [114] [115]\n\n\nContext\nFollowing the outcome reached in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), the Comstock Act has become increasingly discussed by anti-abortion groups and public figures as being a means by which abortion access in the United States could be curtailed without the need for new federal legislation [112] [113] [114] [115]\n\n\nAnti-abortion discourse\nIn a February 2024 interview with The New York Times, Jonathan F Mitchell, an attorney active in the anti-abortion movement and a former Solicitor General of Texas, expressed an optimistic viewpoint about the Comstock Act's applicability to abortion: \"We don't need a federal  [abortion] ban when we have Comstock on the books.\" However, Mitchell nonetheless hoped that former-President Donald Trump would not discuss the issue: \" [I hope Trump] doesn't know about the existence of Comstock, because I just don't want him to shoot off his mouth.\" Mitchell said similarly of anti-abortion activists: \"I think the pro-life groups should keep their mouths shut as much as possible until the  [2024 presidential] election.\" [116] Ed Whelan, another attorney active in the anti-abortion movement and the former president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank, expressed a view similar to that of Mitchell and criticized Biden administration policy towards abortion, claiming that \"By hook or by crook, the Biden administration is determined to undermine or circumvent state laws restricting abortion\" [117]\n\n\nAbortion rights discourse\nLegislators in favor of abortion access, such as Democratic Senator for Minnesota Tina Smith, have, since the 2022 Dobbs decision, advocated for the repealing of the Comstock Act's language relating to abortion [124] On June 20, 2024, Senator Smith announced that she was going to be unveiling legislation to achieve that goal [125] [126] Senator Smith's proposed legislation is not the first time legislators in the United States have proposed or introduced legislation to repeal the Act's abortion-related language In 1997, Representative Barney Frank introduced the Comstock Cleanup Act in an effort to achieve this same goal, but his bill failed (not even making to committee) [127]\n\n\nImplications\nIf the Supreme Court were to affirm a determination that the Comstock Act applies to abortion-related articles generally, or if a future administration began enforcing it in such a way, then the Comstock Act could have renewed significance as mifepristone and misoprostol are used in 63% of the abortions performed in the United States [128] and mifepristone is sometimes prescribed after miscarriages [129] This combination regimen has increasingly been prescribed through telehealth and delivered by mail to individuals within states where abortion has since been broadly restricted following the Dobbs decision [130]\n\n\nHistorical background\nThe initial Comstock Act provision was enacted as an extraneous rider under Sec 148 of an Act to revise, consolidate, and amend the Statutes relating to the Post-office Department, and passed on June 8, 1872 [3] It read:\n\n\nGeneral\nThe initial

It read:\n\n\nObjectives and intent\nAccording to psychologist Paul R Abramson, the widespread availability of pornography during the American Civil War (1861–1865) gave rise to an anti-pornography movement, culminating in the passage of the Comstock Act in 1873, [143] but which also dealt with birth control and abortion issues.\n\n\nLegislative history\nAs mentioned above, the initial provision of the Comstock Act was enacted in 1872 as an extraneous rider to a broader postal service reconsolidation bill Afterwards, Anthony Comstock worked to introduce a stand-alone bill, the Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use, with more comprehensive provisions.\n\n\nBrief legislative context\nAs mentioned above, the initial

for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use, with more comprehensive provisions.\n\n\nAct for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use\nDue to his personal connections with Justice William Strong, Comstock got his bill introduced before the United States Senate by Republican Senator for Minnesota William Windom on February 11, 1873, as S 1572 It was reported without amendment from the Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads by Republican Senator for Minnesota Alexander Ramsey on February 13, 1873 On the following day, through motion by Republican Senator for Connecticut William A Buckingham, it was recommitted back to that committee It was later reported with an amendment (by Senator Buckingham) for consideration before the Committee of the Whole, but its consideration was postponed through motion by Democratic Senator for Ohio Allen G Thurman on February 18, 1873 Consideration was postponed yet again, this time through motion by Senator Buckingham on February 20, 1873 On February 21, 1873, the bill passed, with the Buckingham amendment, in the Senate by unanimous consent after being read three times The bill passed without objection in the United States House of Representatives on March 1, 1873 Finally, the Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use was signed into law by President Ulysses S Grant on March 3, 1873 [147]\n\n\nFurther legislative context\nIn February 1866, the executive committee of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) of New York privately distributed a report, written by Cephas Brainerd and Robert McBurney, entitled, \"A Memorandum Respecting New-York as a Field for Moral and Christian Effort Among Young Men\" This memorandum linked the main message of the YMCA to facts and figures drawn from census, tax, and licensing data All of this data was used to support the belief held by the Association's leadership that many of its younger and less supervised members had ample time in the evenings to leisure about in bars, casinos, and brothels The 1866 memorandum was used to support a plan to construct a centrally located building to better serve the younger men of New York [148] However, the memorandum also recommended, in addition to this new building, a 'call to action' by the organization's members to investigate whether or not there were any local anti-vice laws in New York Upon concluding there were none, the group lobbied in the New York State legislature for an anti-vice law The New York YMCA-drafted bill was successfully enacted in 1868, although with less comprehensive language than had been first proposed This 1868 law enabled local magistrate judges to issue warrants allowing police to seize and later destroy (upon a guilty verdict) materials ruled \"obscene\" [148]\n\n\nYMCA\nIn February 1866, the executive

anti-vice activist and namesake of the Comstock Act, got his political start when he campaigned against saloons in Brooklyn Later introduced to the YMCA, Comstock would form a close ties with the organization Along his career, he became unhappy with the before-mentioned New York law and believed in a need for federal legislation In 1872, Comstock managed to get the initial provision of the Comstock Act added as an extraneous rider to a postal service re-consolidation bill Although Comstock had hoped this initial law would be enough to mitigate the postal service's use in facilitating 'vice', he soon became disappointed as gaps in the law appeared To remedy these perceived problems, Comstock worked on a new stand-alone piece of legislation, discussed previously, which passed in 1873 [148] Anthony Comstock later secured a position as a United States Postal Inspector In spite of this, the Committee for the Suppression of Vice at the New York YMCA, which would later splinter off to become the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, requested that he not be given a government salary By preventing Comstock from receiving a federal salary, as well as any other publicly funded monetary rewards, the organization's directors attempted to prevent claims of self-interested motives and to ensure that Comstock was dependent on their donations [149]\n\n\nHistorical discourse\nAs the chief proponent of the law, many of Comstock's justifications revolved around what he believed were the negative effects indecent literature would have on children He argued that moral decay was occurring in schools and in the home because of indecent literature, something he believed youth had easy access to He also argued that allowing \"obscenity\" to flourish in society would cause a social breakdown of traditional marriage and of religious institutions Comstock leaned on support from wealthier families for the majority of his legislative and political success [152] Clinton L Merrian, who aided the Comstock Act's passage through the House of Representatives, campaigned its passage on the idea that obscenity threatened masculinity and that in order to protect it, the mailing of obscene materials needed to be outlawed [152]\n\n\nHistorical support\nAs the chief proponent of the law, many of Comstock's justifications revolved around what he believed were the

be outlawed [152]\n\n\nContraception arguments\nAs it originally implicated contraceptives, it was argued by some supporters that the Act would help prevent \"illicit\" sexual relations between unmarried persons, since without contraception, the unmarried would be deterred from having sex due to the possibility of unintended pregnancy [141] Father Coughlin, a Catholic priest and radio broadcaster, argued in support of the Act before a 1934 congressional committee, characterizing non-procreative sex as \"legalized prostitution\" During his testimony, there was heckling from the audience, with one woman calling out to Coughlin, \"You're ridiculous.\" [153]\n\n\nHistorical opposition\nFour years after the enactment of the federal law, a petition was circulated by the National Liberal League for its repeal in 1876, garnering between 40,000 and 70,000 signatures [141]: 63–65  Although the petition received positive press coverage, the efforts were stymied when Anthony Comstock showed samples of pornographic material to congressional leaders serving on the same committee for which the proposed repeal act was referred Comstock claimed that the pamphlets he had shared, a \"collection of smutty circulars describing sex depravity\", [141]: 65  had been distributed by mail to youths and other persons.\n\n\n1878 repeal attempt\nFour years after the enactment of

persons.\n\n\nBirth control movement failures\nAfter the 19th century failures, there was no concerted effort to change Comstock-style laws until the start of the birth control movement in the United States in 1914, led by Margaret Sanger [141]: 66  Between 1917 and 1925, bills were introduced in California (1917), [141]: 83, 287  New York (1917, 1921,1923, 1924,1925), [141]: 73–82, 282–84  Connecticut (1923, 1925), [141]: 82, 285  and New Jersey (1925) [141]: 82, 286  to make the contraceptive provisions of state laws less restrictive In both California and Connecticut, work was undertaken to simply have the contraceptive control provisions eliminated All these state attempts at change failed to come to a vote so no change happened There were also failed attempts to eliminate the restrictions on contraceptives from the federal law too, first starting in 1919 with the bill's supposed sponsor failing to introduce legislation In 1923 a similar bill was reported before the Judiciary Committee, and while it was thought that the majority of this committee favored the bill, they evaded voting on it [141]: 98–98  There were also more attempts at change in the 1920s [141]\n\n\nFree Love\nThe Free Love movement of the Victorian-era United States was a group that made sustained attempts to repeal Comstock-style laws and discredit anything related to the anti-vice movement This open distaste made free-love movement participants a major target of Anthony Comstock during his personal campaign against perceived obscenity [152] Comstock actively targeted individuals associated with the Free Love Movement, particularly those advocating for birth control and criticizing traditional marriage [155]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

through the mail. The law was enacted in response to concerns about the spread of obscenity and immorality in the United States during the late 19th century.\n\n## Preface\nThe Comstock Act is found in sections 1461 through 1463 of chapter 71, title 18 of the United States Code. The rest of chapter 71, title 18, United States Code, consists of various provisions from the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988 and the PROTECT Act of 2003.\n\n## 18 U.S.C. § 1461\nThe first of the three sections of the Comstock Act which are contained under chapter 71, title 18, United States Code, is section 1461. This is the initial Comstock Act provision, as currently amended, and it was first enacted as an extraneous rider under Sec 148 of an Act to revise, consolidate, and amend the Statutes relating to the Post-office Department. The punishment for violating section 1461 is either a fine, a jail sentence of up to 5 years for a first offense, a jail sentence of up to 10 years for any subsequent offense, or a combination of a jail sentence and a fine, as is stated in its text.\n\n## 18 U.S.C. § 1462\nThe second of the three primary sections of the Comstock Act is codified in a positive law title at section 1462 of chapter 71, title 18, United States Code. It was initially enacted under Sec 211 of the Criminal Code Act of 1909 on March 4, 1909. This section makes it a crime to mail any obscene, lewd, or lascivious material, including photographs, books, or other publications.\n\n## 18 U.S.C. § 1463\nThe final Comstock Act provision in chapter 71, title 18, United States Code, found at section 1463, concerns mailing any of the matters mentioned in section 1461 or 1462 on the outside of a mail piece. Like section 1462, this section came initially as an amendment (contained in Sec 212) through the Criminal Code Act of 1909. A violation of this section carries a jail term of up to 5 years, a fine, or both as a penalty.\n\n## 18 U.S.C. § 552\nThere is one section of the Comstock Act found in title 18, United States Code, which is outside chapter 71. This is 18 U.S.C § 552, and it pertains to customs officials acting as principal to certain activity. For abortion-related matter, this section applies to the extent implicating procurement of abortion. This section was first enacted as Sec 4 of an Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use.\n\n## Sec. 305. of the Tariff Act of 1930 (or 19 U.S.C. § 1305)\nIn addition to the criminal importation provisions under section 1462, there is also a civil forfeiture provision of the Comstock Act. This provision was initially enacted under Sec 305 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and is currently codified (in a non-positive law title) at section 1305 of title 19, United States Code. It presently provides that any material or article transported or received for transportation through the mail in violation of the Comstock Act may be seized and forfeited.\n\n## 39 U.S.C. § 3001(e)\nThe last section of the Comstock Act is found at 39 U.S.C § 3001 in subsection (e), and it declares that unsolicited contraceptives are non-mailable unless the addressee is a manufacturer or trader in contraceptives, a physician, a nurse, a pharmacist, a hospital, or a clinic. This provision was ruled unconstitutional in Bolger v Youngs Drug Products Corp (1983), as-applied to business mailings, due to an as-applied First Amendment challenge.\n\n## Definitions, Knowledge Requirement, Statute of Limitations, etc.\nConcerning the definitions used in the Comstock Act, there are three key definitions: indecent, obscene, and knowingly. The knowingly criminal knowledge requirement is defined as follows: \"A person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense when...he is aware that his conduct is of that nature...if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.\" The Comstock Act has a 5-year statute of limitations.\n\n## Jurisprudence\nIn June 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down a 6–3 majority opinion in the case of Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022). This decision devolved regulation of abortion back to the states, overturned Roe v Wade (1973), and ended recognition of pre-viability abortion access as a constitutional right. Consequently, the applicability of the Comstock Act to abortion-related articles has become subject to legal dispute.\n\n## Context\nFollowing the outcome reached in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), the Comstock Act has become increasingly discussed by anti-abortion groups and public figures as being a means by which abortion access in the United States could be curtailed without the need for new federal legislation.\n\n## Anti-Abortion Discourse\nIn a February 2024 interview with The New York Times, Jonathan F Mitchell, an attorney active in the anti-abortion movement and a former Solicitor General of Texas, expressed an optimistic viewpoint about the Comstock Act's applicability to abortion: \"We don't need a federal abortion ban when we have Comstock on the books.\" However, Mitchell nonetheless hoped that former-President Donald Trump would not discuss the issue: \"I hope Trump doesn't know about the existence of Comstock, because I just don't want him to shoot off his mouth.\"\n\n## Abortion Rights Discourse\nLegislators in favor of abortion access, such as Democratic Senator for Minnesota Tina Smith, have, since the 2022 Dobbs decision, advocated for the repealing of the Comstock Act's language relating to abortion. On June 20, 2024, Senator Smith announced that she was going to be unveiling legislation to achieve that goal.\n\n## Historical Background\nThe Comstock Act was enacted in response to concerns about the spread of obscenity and immorality in the United States during the late 19th century. The law was first introduced as an extraneous rider to a postal service reconsolidation bill in 1872. The bill was reintroduced in 1873 as a stand-alone piece of legislation, which passed with broad bipartisan support.\n\n## Legislative History\nThe Comstock Act was enacted on March 3, 1873, as part of the Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use. The law was signed into effect by President Ulysses S Grant on March 3, 1873.\n\n## YMCA\nThe Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) played a significant role in the passage of the Comstock Act. The YMCA drafted a bill to restrict the distribution of obscene materials, which was introduced to Congress in 1868. The bill was later revised and reintroduced in 1873, leading to the passage of the Comstock Act.\n\n## Anthony Comstock\nAnthony Comstock was a prominent anti-vice activist who played a key role in the passage of the Comstock Act. Comstock was a postal inspector who was responsible for enforcing the law and identifying obscene materials. He was also a vocal advocate for stricter laws regulating the distribution of obscene materials.\n\n## Obscenity Arguments\nComstock and his supporters argued that the Comstock Act was necessary to protect society from the corrupting influence of obscenity. They claimed that obscene materials were a threat to public morals and that the law was needed to prevent the spread of immorality.\n\n## Contraception Arguments\nSome supporters of the Comstock Act argued that the law was necessary to prevent the spread of contraception and other materials that promoted non-procreative sex. They claimed that the law was needed to protect traditional marriage and social norms.\n\n## Historical Opposition\nThe Comstock Act has faced opposition from various groups throughout its history. In 1876, the National Liberal League circulated a petition to repeal the law, which garnered between 40,000 and 70,000 signatures. However, the efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n## Birth Control Movement Failures\nThe birth control movement in the United States faced significant challenges in its efforts to repeal the Comstock Act. Between 1917 and 1925, bills were introduced in various states to make the contraceptive provisions of state laws less restrictive, but all of these efforts failed to come to a vote.\n\n## Free Love Movement\nThe Free Love movement was a group of activists who advocated for greater freedom and autonomy in personal relationships. They were often targeted by Anthony Comstock and other anti-vice activists, who saw them as a threat to traditional social norms.\n\n## See Also\nThe Comstock Act has been the subject of numerous court cases and legislative debates throughout its history.

definitions used in the Comstock Act, there are three key definitions: indecent, obscene, and knowingly.\n\n\nKnowledge requirement\nFor reference, under the Model Penal Code, a guide often used to assist in legislative drafting, the knowingly criminal knowledge requirement, the second most stringent behind purposely, is defined as follows: \"A person acts knowingly with respect to a material

Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine (2024)\nIn March 2023, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, an anti-abortion group founded in 2022, filed a federal lawsuit challenging the FDA's approval of mifepristone from back in the year 2000 [52] Trial court hearings in the case occurred on March 15, 2023 [53] On April 7, 2023, Matthew Kacsmaryk, a district judge for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, ruled at the trial-level in that case, Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v U.S Food and Drug Administration, that the approval of mifepristone was improper, the lifting of REMS restrictions was improper, and the Comstock Act of 1873 made providing medication abortion by mail illegal This ruling by judge Kacsmaryk conflicted with an opposing same day ruling issued by a U.S district court in Washington (state) [54] [55] [56] [57] The ruling by Kacsmaryk was criticized in the Washington Post as using cherry picked scientific data, presenting a biased tone, and being an example of forum shopping [58] [59] Biopharmaceutical groups were also critical of judge Kacsmaryk, claiming his ruling \"set a precedent for diminishing FDA's authority over drug approvals, and in so doing,  [created] uncertainty for the entire biopharma industry\" [60]\n\n\nHistorical\nEx parte Jackson (1878) was the first case brought before the Supreme Court of the United States that considered the constitutionality of the Comstock Act While primarily pertaining to a facial challenge mounted against a federal law barring the mailing of lottery items, the Court nonetheless made reference to the Comstock Act [13] [71] In doing, the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed both the lottery circular law and the original provision of the Comstock Act (18 U.S.C § 1461) as being valid exercises of Congressional authority under the Postal Clause [15] This holding concerning the Comstock Act's initial provision was reaffirmed in later cases like Roth v United States (1957), United States v Reidel (1971), and Smith v United States (1977) [72] [73] [12] [74] [75] [14]\n\n\nCongressional authority to enact the Comstock Act\nEx parte Jackson (1878) was the first case

used in the Comstock Act has, mostly in the years since the Dobbs decision, lead to some opining that the Comstock Act, particularly 18 U.S.C § 1461, is unconstitutionally vague [57] [20] However, the understanding built by the surrounding case law has been largely dismissive of vagueness challenges For instance, in Hamling v United States (1974), the Supreme Court would uphold section 1461 by adopting a saving construction that conformed the section with the Miller test [35] [79] Later, in Smith v United States (1977), the Supreme Court would push back against another vagueness argument (this time presented as an as-applied challenge) [80] [75] Writing for the court, Justice Harry Blackmun, best known for writing the opinion delivered in Roe v Wade (1973), [81] would go on to explicitly state the following:\n\n\nObscenity statutory interpretation\nWhile the standards for what constitutes obscenity have changed since the Comstock Act's initial passage, the Act's application to obscenity has been upheld against an array of First Amendment challenges As an example, in Roth v United States (1957), a case partially superseded by Miller v California (1973) as to the particular test used, the Supreme Court upheld the Comstock Act against a First Amendment challenge [72] [74] In One, Inc v Olesen (1958), decided as a follow-on to Roth, the Supreme Court ruled that material pertaining to homosexuality is not ipso facto obscene [82] [83] and later reaffirming the conclusion in MANual Enterprises v Day (1962) [84] [85] The Miller test is the obscenity test currently applied to the Comstock Act, as explained in the opinion for Hamling v United States (1974) [35] [79]\n\n\nStatutory interpretation of abortion-related references\nWith respect to the Comstock Act's references to abortion, which currently have not yet been removed as had the reference to contraceptives, historical interpretation has generally construed this as applying to articles intended for unlawful abortion, reconciling it with Sec 305 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which does make such a distinction [42] [86] [11]\n\n\nScholarly discussion\nAn area of interest to legal scholars concerned the effect of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 which, among other things, added 'dealing in obscene matters' as a predicate offense for purposes of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO) It was initially believed by some scholars that this modification to RICO would get struck down as an unconstitutional burden on First Amendment protected conduct [87] Nine years after that modification was made to RICO, this concern would be answered as the Supreme Court, in Alexander v United States (1993), upheld, against a First Amendment challenge, a RICO forfeiture pertaining to obscenity [88] [89]\n\n\nStatus as a RICO predicate\nAn area of interest to legal scholars concerned the effect of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 which, among other things, added 'dealing in obscene matters' as a predicate offense for purposes of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO) It was initially

RICO, this concern would be answered as the Supreme Court, in Alexander v United States (1993), upheld, against a First Amendment challenge, a RICO forfeiture pertaining to obscenity [88] [89]\n\n\nTextualist analysis of statutory construction in regard to abortion\nThere has been scholarly analysis, using a textualist framework, which argues that the historical framing of the Act in the context of abortion is ill-supported due to nothing in the Comstock Act's text (other than that resurfaced as Sec 305 of the Tariff Act of 1930) making an explicit 'illegal intentions' distinction, the fact that the majority of decisions adopting an 'illegal intentions' construction are from United States courts of appeals (that only bind to courts in that particular circuit), [16] and the non-legally-binding nature of historical revision notes in the U.S Code (unlike statutory notes which do have force of law) [90] [91]\n\n\nRelated issues\nMargaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, was charged in 1915 for her work The Woman Rebel Sanger circulated this work through the U.S postal service, violating the Comstock Act On appeal, her conviction was reversed on the grounds that contraceptive devices could legally be promoted for the cure and prevention of disease [92] Her husband, architect William Sanger, was similarly charged earlier that year under a New York law against disseminating contraceptive information [93] In 1932, Margaret Sanger arranged for a shipment of diaphragms to be mailed from Japan to a sympathetic physician in New York City When U.S customs confiscated the package as unlawful contraceptives, Sanger aided that physician in filing a lawsuit to contest the seizure The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in United States v One Package of Japanese Pessaries (1936) that the Comstock Act was not to be construed as interfering with practice of medicine [92] [94]\n\n\nContraceptives\nMargaret Sanger, the

enforcement\nDue to its age, the Comstock Act has been referred to by some commentators, in publications such as MSNBC and Slate, as a \"zombie law\" [98] [99] However, the Act remains just as effective as does any other federal law unless repealed or amended [100] The doctrine of desuetude (a common law concept that a law is repealed by implication if it has not been used in a long time) has not garnered widespread support in U.S courts [101]\n\n\nPresent-day discourse\nFollowing the outcome reached in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), the Comstock Act has become

the Comstock Act's applicability to abortion: \"We don't need a federal  [abortion] ban when we have Comstock on the books.\" However, Mitchell nonetheless hoped that former-President Donald Trump would not discuss the issue: \" [I hope Trump] doesn't know about the existence of Comstock, because I just don't want him to shoot off his mouth.\" Mitchell said similarly of anti-abortion activists: \"I think the pro-life groups should keep their mouths shut as much as possible until the  [2024 presidential] election.\" [116] Ed Whelan, another attorney active in the anti-abortion movement and the former president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank, expressed a view similar to that of Mitchell and criticized Biden administration policy towards abortion, claiming that \"By hook or by crook, the Biden administration is determined to undermine or circumvent state laws restricting abortion\" [117]\n\n\nAbortion rights discourse\nLegislators in favor of abortion access, such as Democratic Senator for Minnesota Tina Smith, have, since the 2022 Dobbs decision, advocated for the repealing of the Comstock Act's language relating to abortion [124] On June 20, 2024, Senator Smith announced that she was going to be unveiling legislation to achieve that goal [125] [126] Senator Smith's proposed legislation is not the first time legislators in the United States have proposed or introduced legislation to repeal the Act's abortion-related language In 1997, Representative Barney Frank introduced the Comstock Cleanup Act in an effort to achieve this same goal, but his bill failed (not even making to committee) [127]\n\n\nImplications\nIf the Supreme Court were to affirm a determination that the Comstock Act applies to abortion-related articles generally, or if a future administration began enforcing it in such a way, then the Comstock Act could have renewed significance as mifepristone and misoprostol are used in 63% of the abortions performed in the United States [128] and mifepristone is sometimes prescribed after miscarriages [129] This combination regimen has increasingly been prescribed through telehealth and delivered by mail to individuals within states where abortion has since been broadly restricted following the Dobbs decision [130]\n\n\nHistorical background\nThe initial Comstock Act provision was enacted as an extraneous rider under Sec 148 of an Act to revise, consolidate, and amend the Statutes relating to the Post-office Department, and passed on June 8, 1872 [3] It read:\n\n\nGeneral\nThe initial Comstock Act provision was enacted as an extraneous rider under Sec 148 of an Act to revise, consolidate, and amend the Statutes relating to the Post-office Department, and passed on June 8, 1872 [3] It read:\n\n\nObjectives and intent\nAccording to psychologist Paul R Abramson, the widespread availability of pornography during the American Civil War (1861–1865) gave rise to an anti-pornography movement, culminating in the passage of the Comstock Act in 1873, [143] but which also dealt with birth control and abortion issues.\n\n\nLegislative history\nAs mentioned above, the initial provision of the Comstock Act was enacted in 1872 as an extraneous rider to a broader postal service reconsolidation bill Afterwards, Anthony Comstock worked to introduce a stand-alone bill, the Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use, with more comprehensive provisions.\n\n\nBrief legislative context\nAs mentioned above, the initial provision of the Comstock Act was enacted in 1872 as an extraneous rider to a broader postal service reconsolidation bill Afterwards, Anthony Comstock worked to introduce a stand-alone bill, the Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use, with more comprehensive provisions.\n\n\nAct for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use\nDue to his personal connections with Justice William Strong, Comstock got his bill introduced before the United States Senate by Republican Senator for Minnesota William Windom on February 11, 1873, as S 1572 It was reported without amendment from the Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads by Republican Senator for Minnesota Alexander Ramsey on February 13, 1873 On the following day, through motion by Republican Senator for Connecticut William A Buckingham, it was recommitted back to that committee It was later reported with an amendment (by Senator Buckingham) for consideration before the Committee of the Whole, but its consideration was postponed through motion by Democratic Senator for Ohio Allen G Thurman on February 18, 1873 Consideration was postponed yet again, this time through motion by Senator Buckingham on February 20, 1873 On February 21, 1873, the bill passed, with the Buckingham amendment, in the Senate by unanimous consent after being read three times The bill passed without objection in the United States House of Representatives on March 1, 1873 Finally, the Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use was signed into law by President Ulysses S Grant on March 3, 1873 [147]\n\n\nFurther legislative context\nIn February 1866, the executive committee of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) of New York privately distributed a report, written by Cephas Brainerd and Robert McBurney, entitled, \"A Memorandum Respecting New-York as a Field for Moral and Christian Effort Among Young Men\" This memorandum linked the main message of the YMCA to facts and figures drawn from census, tax, and licensing data All of this data was used to support the belief held by the Association's leadership that many of its younger and less supervised members had ample time in the evenings to leisure about in bars, casinos, and brothels The 1866 memorandum was used to support a plan to construct a centrally located building to better serve the younger men of New York [148] However, the memorandum also recommended, in addition to this new building, a 'call to action' by the organization's members to investigate whether or not there were any local anti-vice laws in New York Upon concluding there were none, the group lobbied in the New York State legislature for an anti-vice law The New York YMCA-drafted bill was successfully enacted in 1868, although with less comprehensive language than had been first proposed This 1868 law enabled local magistrate judges to issue warrants allowing police to seize and later destroy (upon a guilty verdict) materials ruled \"obscene\" [148]\n\n\nYMCA\nIn February 1866, the executive

anti-vice activist and namesake of the Comstock Act, got his political start when he campaigned against saloons in Brooklyn Later introduced to the YMCA, Comstock would form a close ties with the organization Along his career, he became unhappy with the before-mentioned New York law and believed in a need for federal legislation In 1872, Comstock managed to get the initial provision of the Comstock Act added as an extraneous rider to a postal service re-consolidation bill Although Comstock had hoped this initial law would be enough to mitigate the postal service's use in facilitating 'vice', he soon became disappointed as gaps in the law appeared To remedy these perceived problems, Comstock worked on a new stand-alone piece of legislation, discussed previously, which passed in 1873 [148] Anthony Comstock later secured a position as a United States Postal Inspector In spite of this, the Committee for the Suppression of Vice at the New York YMCA, which would later splinter off to become the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, requested that he not be given a government salary By preventing Comstock from receiving a federal salary, as well as any other publicly funded monetary rewards, the organization's directors attempted to prevent claims of self-interested motives and to ensure that Comstock was dependent on their donations [149]\n\n\nHistorical discourse\nAs the chief proponent of the law, many of Comstock's justifications revolved around what he believed were the negative effects indecent literature would have on children He argued that moral decay was occurring in schools and in the home because of indecent literature, something he believed youth had easy access to He also argued that allowing \"obscenity\" to flourish in society would cause a social breakdown of traditional marriage and of religious institutions Comstock leaned on support from wealthier families for the majority of his legislative and political success [152] Clinton L Merrian, who aided the Comstock Act's passage through the House of Representatives, campaigned its passage on the idea that obscenity threatened masculinity and that in order to protect it, the mailing of obscene materials needed to be outlawed [152]\n\n\nHistorical support\nAs the chief proponent of the law, many of Comstock's justifications revolved around what he believed were the

Act's passage through the House of Representatives, campaigned its passage on the idea that obscenity threatened masculinity and that in order to protect it, the mailing of obscene materials needed to be outlawed [152]\n\n\nContraception arguments\nAs it originally implicated contraceptives, it was argued by some supporters that the Act would help prevent \"illicit\" sexual relations between unmarried persons, since without contraception, the unmarried would be deterred from having sex due to the possibility of unintended pregnancy [141] Father Coughlin, a Catholic priest and radio broadcaster, argued in support of the Act before a 1934 congressional committee, characterizing non-procreative sex as \"legalized prostitution\" During his testimony, there was heckling from the audience, with one woman calling out to Coughlin, \"You're ridiculous.\" [153]\n\n\nHistorical opposition\nFour years after the enactment of the federal law, a petition was circulated by the National Liberal League for its repeal in 1876, garnering between 40,000 and 70,000 signatures [141]: 63–65  Although the petition received positive press coverage, the efforts were stymied when Anthony Comstock showed samples of pornographic material to congressional leaders serving on the same committee for which the proposed repeal act was referred Comstock claimed that the pamphlets he had shared, a \"collection of smutty circulars describing sex depravity\", [141]: 65  had been distributed by mail to youths and other persons.\n\n\n1878 repeal attempt\nFour years after the enactment of

persons.\n\n\nBirth control movement failures\nAfter the 19th century failures, there was no concerted effort to change Comstock-style laws until the start of the birth control movement in the United States in 1914, led by Margaret Sanger [141]: 66  Between 1917 and 1925, bills were introduced in California (1917), [141]: 83, 287  New York (1917, 1921,1923, 1924,1925), [141]: 73–82, 282–84  Connecticut (1923, 1925), [141]: 82, 285  and New Jersey (1925) [141]: 82, 286  to make the contraceptive provisions of state laws less restrictive In both California and Connecticut, work was undertaken to simply have the contraceptive control provisions eliminated All these state attempts at change failed to come to a vote so no change happened There were also failed attempts to eliminate the restrictions on contraceptives from the federal law too, first starting in 1919 with the bill's supposed sponsor failing to introduce legislation In 1923 a similar bill was reported before the Judiciary Committee, and while it was thought that the majority of this committee favored the bill, they evaded voting on it [141]: 98–98  There were also more attempts at change in the 1920s [141]\n\n\nFree Love\nThe Free Love movement of the Victorian-era United States was a group that made sustained attempts to repeal Comstock-style laws and discredit anything related to the anti-vice movement This open distaste made free-love movement participants a major target of Anthony Comstock during his personal campaign against perceived obscenity [152] Comstock actively targeted individuals associated with the Free Love Movement, particularly those advocating for birth control and criticizing traditional marriage [155]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nFurther

{"title": "Keith_Richards", "content": "\nEarly life\nRichards was born on 18 December 1943 at Livingston Hospital, in Dartford, Kent, England [6] He is the only child of Doris Maud Lydia (née Dupree) and Herbert William Richards His father was a factory worker who was wounded in the Second World War during the Normandy invasion [7] Richards's paternal grandparents, Ernie and Eliza Richards, were socialists and civic leaders, whom he credited as \"more or less creat [ing] the Walthamstow Labour Party\", and both were mayors of the Municipal Borough of Walthamstow in Essex, with Eliza becoming mayor in 1941 [8] [9] His great-grandfather's family originated from Wales [7] [10] [11]\n\n\nMusicianship\nRichards plays both lead and rhythm guitar parts, often in the same song; the Stones are generally known for their guitar interplay of rhythm and lead (\"weaving\") between him and the other guitarist in the band – Brian Jones (1962–1969), Mick Taylor (1969–1975), or Ronnie Wood (1975–present) In the recording studio Richards sometimes plays all of the guitar parts, notably on the songs \"Paint It Black\", \"Ruby Tuesday\", \"Sympathy for the Devil\", and \"Gimme Shelter\" He is also a vocalist, singing backing vocals on many Rolling Stones songs as well as occasional lead vocals, such as on the Rolling Stones' 1972 single \"Happy\", as well as with his side project, the X-Pensive Winos.\n\n\nBandleader\nSince the mid-1960s, Richards and Mick Jagger have been the primary songwriters for the Stones, as well as the band's primary producers since the mid-1970s (credited as the Glimmer Twins), though oftentimes in collaboration with an outside producer Former keyboardist Ian Stewart once said that Richards was the Rolling Stones' bandleader; however, Richards has said that his job is merely \"oiling the machinery\" Unlike many bands where the drummer sets the pace and acts as a timesetter for a song, Richards fills that role for the Rolling Stones Both former bassist Bill Wyman and current guitarist Ronnie Wood have said that the Stones did not follow the band's long-time drummer, Charlie Watts, but rather followed Richards, as there was \"no way of 'not' following\" him [41] [42]\n\n\nGuitarist\nChris Spedding calls Richards's guitar playing \"direct, incisive and unpretentious\" [43] Richards says he focuses on chords and rhythms, avoiding flamboyant and competitive virtuosity and trying not to be the \"fastest gun in the west\" [41] Richards prefers teaming with at least one other guitarist and has almost never toured without one [44] Chuck Berry has been an inspiration for Richards, [45] and, with Jagger, he introduced Berry's songs to the Rolling Stones' early repertoire In the late 1960s Brian Jones's declining contributions led Richards to record all guitar parts on many tracks, including slide guitar Jones's replacement, Mick Taylor, played guitar with the Rolling Stones from 1969 to 1974 Taylor's virtuosity on lead guitar led to a pronounced separation between lead and rhythm guitar roles, most notably onstage [41] In 1975 Taylor was replaced by Wood, whose arrival marked a return to a guitar interplay Richards called \"the ancient art of weaving\", which he and Jones had gleaned from Chicago blues [46]\n\n\nVocals\nRichards sang in a school choir – most notably for Queen Elizabeth II – until adolescence's effect on his voice forced him out of it [53] He has sung backing vocals on every Rolling Stones album Since Between the Buttons (1967), he has sung lead or co-lead on at least one track (see list below) of every Rolling Stones studio album except Their Satanic Majesties Request, Sticky Fingers, It's Only Rock 'n Roll, and Blue & Lonesome.\n\n\nSongwriting\nRichards and Jagger began writing songs together in 1963, prompted by manager Andrew Loog Oldham, who believed the band could not depend on outside songwriters [59] The earliest Jagger/Richards collaborations were recorded by other artists, including Gene Pitney, whose rendition of \"That Girl Belongs to Yesterday\" was their first top-ten single in the UK [60] They scored another top-ten hit in 1964 with the debut single written for Marianne Faithfull, \"As Tears Go By\".\n\n\nRecord production\nRichards has been active as a music producer since the 1960s He was credited as producer and musical director on the 1966 album Today's Pop Symphony, one of manager Andrew Loog Oldham's side projects, although there are doubts about how much Richards was actually involved with it [67] On the Rolling Stones' 1967 album Their Satanic Majesties Request, the entire band was credited as producer, but since 1974, Richards and Mick Jagger have frequently co-produced both Rolling Stones records and those by other artists under the name \"the Glimmer Twins\", often in collaboration with other producers.\n\n\nSolo recordings\nRichards has released few solo recordings His first solo single, released in 1978, was a cover of Chuck Berry's \"Run Rudolph Run\", backed with his version of Jimmy Cliff's \"The Harder They Come\" In 1987, after Jagger pursued a solo recording and touring career, Richards formed the \"X-Pensive Winos\" with co-songwriter and co-producer Steve Jordan, whom Richards assembled for his Chuck Berry documentary Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll [72]\n\n\nRecordings with other artists\nDuring the 1960s, most of Richards's recordings with artists other than the Rolling Stones were sessions for Andrew Loog Oldham's Immediate Records label Notable exceptions were when Richards, along with Mick Jagger and numerous other guests, sang on the Beatles' 1967 TV broadcast of \"All You Need Is Love\", [73] and when he played bass with John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Mitch Mitchell, Ivry Gitlis, and Yoko Ono as the Dirty Mac for The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV special filmed in 1968 [75]\n\n\nRare and unreleased recordings\nIn 2005, the Rolling Stones released Rarities 1971–2003, which includes some rare and limited-issue recordings, but Richards has described the band's released output as the \"tip of the iceberg\" [78] Many of the band's unreleased songs and studio jam sessions are widely bootlegged, as are numerous Richards solo recordings, including his 1977 Toronto studio sessions, some 1981 studio sessions, and tapes made during his 1983 wedding trip to Mexico [73]\n\n\nPublic image and personal life\nRichards was romantically involved with Italian-born actress Anita Pallenberg (d 13 June 2017) [79] from 1967 to 1979, after which they remained cordial Together they have a son, Marlon Leon Sundeep (named after the actor Marlon Brando), born in 1969, [80] and a daughter, Angela (originally named Dandelion), born in 1972 [81] Their third child, a son named Tara Jo Jo Gunne—after Richards's and Pallenberg's friend, Guinness heir Tara Browne, and the Chuck Berry song Jo Jo Gunne—died aged just over two months, of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), on 6 June 1976 [82] Richards was away on tour at the time, something he said has haunted him since [83] [84] He was criticised at the time for performing that night after learning of the death, but he later said it was the only way he could cope [85] Before they became romantically linked, Pallenberg had been involved with his fellow Rolling Stones bandmate and close friend Brian Jones The two became a couple on a trip to Morocco that Jones had to abandon when he fell ill; the subsequent relationship between Richards and Pallenberg weighed heavily on Jones, and strained his relationship with the rest of the Rolling Stones [86]\n\n\nRelationships and family\nRichards was romantically involved with Italian-born actress Anita Pallenberg (d 13 June 2017) [79] from 1967 to 1979, after which they remained cordial Together they have a son, Marlon Leon Sundeep (named after the actor Marlon Brando), born in 1969, [80] and a daughter, Angela (originally named Dandelion), born in 1972 [81] Their third child, a son named Tara Jo Jo Gunne—after Richards's and Pallenberg's friend, Guinness heir Tara Browne, and the Chuck Berry song Jo Jo Gunne—died aged just over two months, of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), on 6 June 1976 [82] Richards was away on tour at the time, something he said has haunted him since [83] [84] He was criticised at the time for performing that night after learning of the death, but he later said it was the only way he could cope [85] Before they became romantically linked, Pallenberg had been involved with his fellow Rolling Stones bandmate and close friend Brian Jones The two became a couple on a trip to Morocco that Jones had to abandon when he fell ill; the subsequent relationship between Richards and Pallenberg weighed heavily on Jones, and strained his relationship with the rest of the Rolling Stones [86]\n\n\nFriendship with Mick Jagger\nRichards's relationship with bandmate Mick Jagger is frequently described as \"love/hate\" by the media [89] [90] Richards himself said in a 1998 interview: \"I think of our differences as a family squabble If I shout and scream at him, it's because no one else has the guts to do it or else they're paid not to do it At the same time I'd hope Mick realises that I'm a friend who is just trying to bring him into line and do what needs to be done.\" [91] Richards, along with Johnny Depp, tried unsuccessfully to persuade Jagger to appear in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, alongside Depp and Richards [92]\n\n\nDrug use and arrests\nMusic journalist Nick Kent attached to Richards Lord Byron's epithet of \"mad, bad, and dangerous to know\" Jagger thought that Richards's image had \"contributed to him becoming a junkie\" [96] In 1994, Richards said his image was \"like a long shadow .. Even though that was nearly twenty years ago, you cannot convince some people that I'm not a mad drug addict.\" [97]\n\n\nOther details\nRichards owns Redlands, a Sussex estate he purchased in 1966, as well as homes in Weston, Connecticut, and in the private resort island of Parrot Cay, Turks & Caicos [117] [118] His primary home is in Weston [119] [120] [121] In June 2013, Richards said that he would retire with his family to Parrot Cay or Jamaica if he knew his death was coming [122] However, in November 2016, he said, \"I'd like to croak magnificently, onstage.\" [115] Richards is an avid reader with a strong interest in history, and owns an extensive library [123] [124] An April 2010 article revealed that Richards yearns to be a librarian [125]\n\n\n21st century\nOn 27 April 2006, while in Fiji, Richards slipped off the branch of a dead tree (erroneously reported by the international press as a coconut tree) [citation needed] and suffered a head injury He subsequently underwent cranial surgery at a New Zealand hospital [128] The incident delayed the Rolling Stones' 2006 European tour for six weeks and forced the band to reschedule several shows The revised tour schedule included a brief statement from Richards apologising for \"falling off my perch\" [129] The band made up most of the postponed dates in 2006, and toured Europe in 2007 to make up the remainder In a video message in late 2013 as part of the On Fire tour, Richards gave his thanks to the surgeons in New Zealand who treated him, remarking, \"I left half my brain there.\" [130]\n\n\nTributes for other artists\nFrom the start of his career, Richards has made appearances to pay tribute to those artists with whom he has formed friendships and those who have inspired and encouraged him After the earliest success of the band, who played cover songs of American blues artists, while he and Jagger were just beginning their own songwriting, the Rolling Stones visited the States to pay back, in his words, \"that's where that fame bit comes in handy\" Since that time, he has performed on many occasions to show appreciation toward them Among these, he has appeared with Norah Jones in a tribute concert for Gram Parsons in 2006, playing guitar and singing a duet, \"Love Hurts\" On 12 March 2007 Richards attended the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ceremony to induct the Ronettes; he also played guitar during the ceremony's all-star jam session [73] On 26 February 2012 Richards paid tribute to fellow musicians Chuck Berry and Leonard Cohen, who were the recipients of the first annual PEN Awards for songwriting excellence at the JFK Presidential Library in Boston, Massachusetts [143]\n\n\nHonours\nIn 2010, David Fricke of Rolling Stone magazine referred to Richards as the creator of \"rock's greatest single body of riffs\" on guitar, [170] and the magazine ranked him fourth on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time [171] Rolling Stone also lists fourteen songs he co-wrote with Jagger on its \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list [172]\n\n\nMusical equipment\nRichards has a collection of approximately 3,000 guitars [175] Even though he has used many different guitar models, Richards joked in a 1986 Guitar World interview that, no matter what model he plays, \" [G]ive me five minutes and I'll make 'em all sound the same.\" [41] Richards has often thanked Leo Fender, and other guitar manufacturers for making the instruments, as he did during the induction ceremony of the Rolling Stones into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\nGuitars\nRichards has a collection of approximately 3,000 guitars [175] Even though he has used many different guitar models, Richards joked in a 1986 Guitar World interview that, no matter what model he plays, \" [G]ive me five minutes and I'll make 'em all sound the same.\" [41] Richards has often thanked Leo Fender, and other guitar manufacturers for making the instruments, as he did during the induction ceremony of the Rolling Stones into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\nAmplifiers\nRichards's amplifier preferences have changed repeatedly However, he is a long-time proponent of using low-powered amps in the studio He achieves  clarity plus distortion by using two amps: a larger one (such as a Fender Twin) which runs clean, along with a Fender Champ, which is overdriven [199] To record \"Crosseyed Heart\", Richards used a stock tweed Fender Champ with 8\" speaker coupled with a modified Fender Harvard [200]\n\n\nEffects\nIn 1965, Richards used a Gibson Maestro fuzzbox to achieve the distinctive tone of his riff on \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\"; [204] the success of the resulting single boosted the sales of the device to the extent that all available stock had sold out by the end of 1965 [205] In the 1970s and early 1980s Richards frequently used guitar effects such as a wah-wah pedal, a phaser, and a Leslie speaker, [206] but he has mainly relied on combining \"the right amp with the right guitar\" to achieve the sound he wants [207]\n\n\nDiscography\n\n\nFilmography\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "**Keith Richards**\n\nKeith Richards is a British musician, singer, songwriter, and guitarist, best known as a member of the Rolling Stones. He is known for his distinctive guitar playing style, his iconic voice, and his role as a songwriter and producer.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nKeith Richards was born on 18 December 1943 at Livingston Hospital, in Dartford, Kent, England. His father, Herbert William Richards, was a factory worker who was wounded in the Second World War during the Normandy invasion. Richards's paternal grandparents, Ernie and Eliza Richards, were socialists and civic leaders, whom he credited as \"more or less creat[ing] the Walthamstow Labour Party\". His great-grandfather's family originated from Wales.\n\nRichards grew up in a musical family and was exposed to music from an early age. He has said that he was largely self-taught as a musician and that he developed his playing style through experimentation and practice. He began playing guitar at the age of six and was heavily influenced by American rock and roll music, particularly the music of Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley.\n\n**Musicianship**\n\nRichards plays both lead and rhythm guitar parts, often in the same song. The Rolling Stones are generally known for their guitar interplay of rhythm and lead between him and the other guitarist in the band – Brian Jones (1962–1969), Mick Taylor (1969–1975), or Ronnie Wood (1975–present). In the recording studio, Richards sometimes plays all of the guitar parts, notably on the songs \"Paint It Black\", \"Ruby Tuesday\", \"Sympathy for the Devil\", and \"Gimme Shelter\". He is also a vocalist, singing backing vocals on many Rolling Stones songs as well as occasional lead vocals, such as on the Rolling Stones' 1972 single \"Happy\".\n\nRichards's guitar playing style is characterized by his use of a distinctive, percussive picking style and his ability to play complex, intricate riffs. He has said that he focuses on chords and rhythms, avoiding flamboyant and competitive virtuosity and trying not to be the \"fastest gun in the west\". He prefers teaming with at least one other guitarist and has almost never toured without one.\n\n**Bandleader**\n\nSince the mid-1960s, Richards and Mick Jagger have been the primary songwriters for the Rolling Stones, as well as the band's primary producers since the mid-1970s (credited as the Glimmer Twins), though oftentimes in collaboration with an outside producer. Former keyboardist Ian Stewart once said that Richards was the Rolling Stones' bandleader; however, Richards has said that his job is merely \"oiling the machinery\". Unlike many bands where the drummer sets the pace and acts as a timesetter for a song, Richards fills that role for the Rolling Stones.\n\nRichards has said that he and Jagger have a \"love/hate\" relationship, with Richards often acting as a foil to Jagger's more extroverted personality. However, he has also said that he and Jagger are \"like two old friends\" and that their partnership is based on a deep trust and respect.\n\n**Guitarist**\n\nChris Spedding calls Richards's guitar playing \"direct, incisive and unpretentious\". Richards says he focuses on chords and rhythms, avoiding flamboyant and competitive virtuosity and trying not to be the \"fastest gun in the west\". Richards prefers teaming with at least one other guitarist and has almost never toured without one. He has been influenced by a wide range of guitarists, including Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, and Otis Rush.\n\nRichards has said that he has never been interested in being a virtuosic guitarist, and that he prefers to focus on playing simple, memorable riffs and chords. He has also said that he believes that guitar playing is not just about technical skill, but also about feeling and expression.\n\n**Vocals**\n\nRichards sang in a school choir – most notably for Queen Elizabeth II – until adolescence's effect on his voice forced him out of it. He has sung backing vocals on every Rolling Stones album. Since Between the Buttons (1967), he has sung lead or co-lead on at least one track (see list below) of every Rolling Stones studio album except Their Satanic Majesties Request, Sticky Fingers, It's Only Rock 'n Roll, and Blue & Lonesome.\n\nRichards has said that he has always been interested in singing and that he enjoys singing lead vocals on Rolling Stones songs. He has said that he has a limited vocal range, but that he is able to sing in a distinctive, expressive style that has become a hallmark of the Rolling Stones sound.\n\n**Songwriting**\n\nRichards and Jagger began writing songs together in 1963, prompted by manager Andrew Loog Oldham, who believed the band could not depend on outside songwriters. The earliest Jagger/Richards collaborations were recorded by other artists, including Gene Pitney, whose rendition of \"That Girl Belongs to Yesterday\" was their first top-ten single in the UK. They scored another top-ten hit in 1964 with the debut single written for Marianne Faithfull, \"As Tears Go By\".\n\nRichards and Jagger have said that they have a collaborative approach to songwriting, with both members contributing ideas and lyrics to their songs. They have said that they have a deep respect for each other's creativity and that they are able to work together seamlessly.\n\n**Record Production**\n\nRichards has been active as a music producer since the 1960s. He was credited as producer and musical director on the 1966 album Today's Pop Symphony, one of manager Andrew Loog Oldham's side projects, although there are doubts about how much Richards was actually involved with it. On the Rolling Stones' 1967 album Their Satanic Majesties Request, the entire band was credited as producer, but since 1974, Richards and Mick Jagger have frequently co-produced both Rolling Stones records and those by other artists under the name \"the Glimmer Twins\", often in collaboration with other producers.\n\nRichards has said that he has always been interested in producing music and that he enjoys working with other artists to create new sounds and styles. He has said that he believes that producing is a collaborative process and that he relies on the input and creativity of other musicians and producers to create successful recordings.\n\n**Solo Recordings**\n\nRichards has released few solo recordings. His first solo single, released in 1978, was a cover of Chuck Berry's \"Run Rudolph Run\", backed with his version of Jimmy Cliff's \"The Harder They Come\". In 1987, after Jagger pursued a solo recording and touring career, Richards formed the \"X-Pensive Winos\" with co-songwriter and co-producer Steve Jordan, whom Richards assembled for his Chuck Berry documentary Hail! Hail! Rock 'n Roll.\n\nRichards has said that he has always been interested in recording solo music and that he enjoys the freedom and creativity that comes with working outside of the Rolling Stones. He has said that he is inspired by a wide range of musical styles and that he is always looking for new and interesting sounds to incorporate into his solo recordings.\n\n**Recordings with Other Artists**\n\nDuring the 1960s, most of Richards's recordings with artists other than the Rolling Stones were sessions for Andrew Loog Oldham's Immediate Records label. Notable exceptions were when Richards, along with Mick Jagger and numerous other guests, sang on the Beatles' 1967 TV broadcast of \"All You Need Is Love\", and when he played bass with John Lennon, Eric Clapton, Mitch Mitchell, Ivry Gitlis, and Yoko Ono as the Dirty Mac for The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV special filmed in 1968.\n\nRichards has said that he has always been interested in collaborating with other artists and that he enjoys working with musicians from a wide range of styles and backgrounds. He has said that he believes that collaboration is a key part of the creative process and that he is always looking for new and interesting ways to work with other musicians.\n\n**Tributes for Other Artists**\n\nFrom the start of his career, Richards has made appearances to pay tribute to those artists with whom he has formed friendships and those who have inspired and encouraged him. After the earliest success of the band, who played cover songs of American blues artists, while he and Jagger were just beginning their own songwriting, the Rolling Stones visited the States to pay back, in his words, \"that's where that fame bit comes in handy\". Since that time, he has performed on many occasions to show appreciation toward them.\n\nRichards has said that he believes that paying tribute to other artists is an important part of the music-making process and that he is always looking for ways to honor and celebrate the creativity and contributions of other musicians. He has said that he is inspired by a wide range of musical styles and that he is always looking for new and interesting ways to pay tribute to other artists.\n\n**Honours**\n\nIn 2010, David Fricke of Rolling Stone magazine referred to Richards as the creator of \"rock's greatest single body of riffs\" on guitar, and the magazine ranked him fourth on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. Rolling Stone also lists fourteen songs he co-wrote with Jagger on its \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list.\n\nRichards has said that he is honored to be recognized by Rolling Stone and that he is proud of the contributions he has made to the Rolling Stones and to rock music. He has said that he believes that being recognized by his peers is the highest honor a musician can receive and that he is grateful for the recognition he has received.\n\n**Musical Equipment**\n\nRichards has a collection of approximately 3,000 guitars. Even though he has used many different guitar models, Richards joked in a 1986 Guitar World interview that, no matter what model he plays, \" [G]ive me five minutes and I'll make 'em all sound the same\". Richards has often thanked Leo Fender, and other guitar manufacturers for making the instruments, as he did during the induction ceremony of the Rolling Stones into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nRichards has said that he has always been interested in guitar playing and that he has spent countless hours experimenting with different guitars and techniques. He has said that he believes that a good guitar is essential to a good sound and that he is always looking for new and interesting ways to use his guitars to create new and exciting sounds.\n\n**Amplifiers**\n\nRichards's amplifier preferences have changed repeatedly. However, he is a long-time proponent of using low-powered amps in the studio. He achieves clarity plus distortion by using two amps: a larger one (such as a Fender Twin) which runs clean, along with a Fender Champ, which is overdriven.\n\nRichards has said that he has always been interested in amplifiers and that he has spent countless hours experimenting with different models and settings. He has said that he believes that a good amplifier is essential to a good sound and that he is always looking for new and interesting ways to use his amplifiers to create new and exciting sounds.\n\n**Effects**\n\nIn 1965, Richards used a Gibson Maestro fuzzbox to achieve the distinctive tone of his riff on \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\"; the success of the resulting single boosted the sales of the device to the extent that all available stock had sold out by the end of 1965. In the 1970s and early 1980s Richards frequently used guitar effects such as a wah-wah pedal, a phaser, and a Leslie speaker, but he has mainly relied on combining \"the right amp with the right guitar\" to achieve the sound he wants.\n\nRichards has said that he has always been interested in effects and that he has spent countless hours experimenting with different pedals and settings. He has said that he believes that a good effects pedal can add a new dimension to a sound and that he is always looking for new and interesting ways to use his effects to create new and exciting sounds.\n\n**Discography**\n\n* Discography of Keith Richards's solo albums\n\t+ 1978: Live at the Hollywood Palladium, December 15, 1977\n\t+ 1988: Talk Is Cheap\n\t+ 1992: Main Offender\n\t+ 1993: Live at the Hollywood Palladium, December 15, 1977\n\t+ 1999: Live at the Hollywood Palladium, December 15, 1977\n\t+ 2005: Hail!

\"Keith_Richards\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life\nRichards was born on 18 December 1943 at Livingston Hospital, in Dartford, Kent, England [6] He is the only child of Doris Maud Lydia (née Dupree) and Herbert William Richards His father was a factory worker who was wounded in the Second World War during the Normandy invasion [7] Richards's paternal grandparents, Ernie and Eliza Richards, were socialists and civic leaders, whom he credited as \"more or less creat [ing] the Walthamstow Labour Party\", and both were mayors of the Municipal Borough of Walthamstow in Essex, with Eliza becoming mayor in 1941 [8] [9] His great-grandfather's family originated from Wales [7] [10] [11]\n\n\nMusicianship\nRichards plays both lead and rhythm guitar parts, often in the same song; the Stones are generally known for their guitar interplay of rhythm and lead (\"weaving\") between him and the other guitarist in the band – Brian Jones (1962–1969), Mick Taylor (1969–1975), or Ronnie Wood (1975–present) In the recording studio Richards sometimes plays all of the guitar parts, notably on the songs \"Paint It Black\", \"Ruby Tuesday\", \"Sympathy for the Devil\", and \"Gimme Shelter\" He is also a vocalist, singing backing vocals on many Rolling Stones songs as well as occasional lead vocals, such as on the Rolling Stones' 1972 single \"Happy\", as well as with his side project, the X-Pensive Winos.\n\n\nBandleader\nSince the mid-1960s, Richards and Mick Jagger have been the primary songwriters for the Stones, as well as the band's primary producers since the mid-1970s (credited as the Glimmer Twins), though oftentimes in collaboration with an outside producer Former keyboardist Ian Stewart once said that Richards was the Rolling Stones' bandleader; however, Richards has said that his job is merely \"oiling the machinery\" Unlike many bands where the drummer sets the pace and acts as a timesetter for a song, Richards fills that role for the Rolling Stones Both former bassist Bill Wyman and current guitarist Ronnie Wood have said that the Stones did not follow the band's long-time drummer, Charlie Watts, but rather followed Richards, as there was \"no way of 'not' following\" him [41] [42]\n\n\nGuitarist\nChris Spedding calls Richards's guitar playing \"direct, incisive and unpretentious\" [43] Richards says he focuses on chords and rhythms, avoiding flamboyant and competitive virtuosity and trying not to be the \"fastest gun in the west\" [41] Richards prefers teaming with at least one other guitarist and has almost never toured without one [44] Chuck Berry has been an inspiration for Richards, [45] and, with Jagger, he introduced Berry's songs to the Rolling Stones' early repertoire In the late 1960s Brian Jones's declining contributions led Richards to record all guitar parts on many tracks, including slide guitar Jones's replacement, Mick Taylor, played guitar with the Rolling Stones from 1969 to 1974 Taylor's virtuosity on lead guitar led to a pronounced separation between lead and rhythm guitar roles, most notably onstage [41] In 1975 Taylor was replaced by Wood, whose arrival marked a return to a guitar interplay Richards called \"the ancient art of weaving\", which he and Jones had gleaned from Chicago blues [46]\n\n\nVocals\nRichards sang in a school choir – most notably for Queen Elizabeth II – until adolescence's effect on his voice forced him out of it [53] He has sung backing vocals on every Rolling Stones album Since Between the Buttons (1967), he has sung lead or co-lead on at least one track (see list below) of every Rolling Stones studio album except Their Satanic Majesties Request, Sticky Fingers, It's Only Rock 'n Roll, and Blue & Lonesome.\n\n\nSongwriting\nRichards and Jagger

Even though that was nearly twenty years ago, you cannot convince some people that I'm not a mad drug addict.\" [97]\n\n\nOther details\nRichards owns Redlands, a Sussex estate he purchased in 1966, as well as homes in Weston, Connecticut, and in the private resort island of Parrot Cay, Turks & Caicos [117] [118] His primary home is in Weston [119] [120] [121] In June 2013, Richards said that he would retire with his family to Parrot Cay or Jamaica if he knew his death was coming [122] However, in November 2016, he said, \"I'd like to croak magnificently, onstage.\" [115] Richards is an avid reader with a strong interest in history, and owns an extensive library [123] [124] An April 2010 article revealed that Richards yearns to be a librarian [125]\n\n\n21st century\nOn 27 April 2006, while in Fiji, Richards slipped off the branch of a dead tree (erroneously reported by the international press as a coconut tree) [citation needed] and suffered a head injury He subsequently underwent cranial surgery at a New Zealand hospital [128] The incident delayed the Rolling Stones' 2006 European tour for six weeks and forced the band to reschedule several shows The revised tour schedule included a brief statement from Richards apologising for \"falling off my perch\" [129] The band made up most of the postponed dates in 2006, and toured Europe in 2007 to make up the remainder In a video message in late 2013 as part of the On Fire tour, Richards gave his thanks to the surgeons in New Zealand who treated him, remarking, \"I left half my brain there.\" [130]\n\n\nTributes for other artists\nFrom the start of his career, Richards has made appearances to pay tribute to those artists with whom he has formed friendships and those who have inspired and encouraged him After the earliest success of the band, who played cover songs of American blues artists, while he and Jagger were just beginning their own songwriting, the Rolling Stones visited the States to pay back, in his words, \"that's where that fame bit comes in handy\" Since that time, he has performed on many occasions to show appreciation toward them Among these, he has appeared with Norah Jones in a tribute concert for Gram Parsons in 2006, playing guitar and singing a duet, \"Love Hurts\" On 12 March 2007 Richards attended the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ceremony to induct the Ronettes; he also played guitar during the ceremony's all-star jam session [73] On 26 February 2012 Richards paid tribute to fellow musicians Chuck Berry and Leonard Cohen, who were the recipients of the first annual PEN Awards for songwriting excellence at the JFK Presidential Library in Boston, Massachusetts [143]\n\n\nHonours\nIn 2010, David Fricke of Rolling Stone magazine referred to Richards as the creator of \"rock's greatest single body of riffs\" on guitar, [170] and the magazine ranked him fourth on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time [171] Rolling Stone also lists fourteen songs he co-wrote with Jagger on its \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list [172]\n\n\nMusical equipment\nRichards has a collection of approximately 3,000 guitars [175] Even though he has used many different guitar models, Richards joked in a 1986 Guitar World interview that, no matter what model he plays, \" [G]ive me five minutes and I'll make 'em all sound the same.\" [41] Richards has often thanked Leo Fender, and other guitar manufacturers for making the instruments, as he did during the induction ceremony of the Rolling Stones into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\nGuitars\nRichards has a collection of approximately 3,000 guitars [175] Even though he has used many different guitar models, Richards joked in a 1986 Guitar World interview that, no matter what model he plays, \" [G]ive me five minutes and I'll make 'em all sound the same.\" [41] Richards has often thanked Leo Fender, and other guitar manufacturers for making the instruments, as he did during the induction ceremony of the Rolling Stones into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\nAmplifiers\nRichards's amplifier preferences have changed repeatedly However, he is a long-time proponent of using low-powered amps in the studio He achieves  clarity plus distortion by using two amps: a larger one (such as a Fender Twin) which runs clean, along with a Fender Champ, which is overdriven [199] To record \"Crosseyed Heart\", Richards used a stock tweed Fender Champ with 8\" speaker coupled with a modified Fender Harvard [200]\n\n\nEffects\nIn 1965, Richards used a Gibson Maestro fuzzbox to achieve the distinctive tone of his riff on \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\";

{"title": "Recession", "content": "\nDefinitions\nIn a 1974 article by The New York Times, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Julius Shiskin suggested that a rough translation of the bureau's qualitative definition of a recession into a quantitative one that almost anyone can use might run like this:\n\n\nAttributes\nA recession encompasses multiple attributes that often occur simultaneously and encompasses declines in component measures of economic activity, such as GDP, including consumption, investment, government spending, and net export activity These summary measures are indicative of underlying drivers such as employment levels and skills, household savings rates, corporate investment decisions, interest rates, demographics, and government policies (Smith, 2018; Johnson & Thompson, 2020) By examining these factors comprehensively, economists gain insights into the complex dynamics that contribute to economic downturns and can formulate effective strategies for mitigating their impact (Anderson, 2019; Patel, 2017).\n\n\nType of recession or shape\nThe type and shape of recessions are distinctive In the US, v-shaped, or short-and-sharp contractions followed by rapid and sustained recovery, occurred in 1954 and 1990–1991; U-shaped (prolonged slump) in 1974–1975, and W-shaped, or double-dip recessions in 1949 and 1980–1982 Japan's 1993–1994 recession was U-shaped and its 8-out-of-9 quarters of contraction in 1997–1999 can be described as L-shaped Korea, Hong Kong and South-east Asia experienced U-shaped recessions in 1997–1998, although Thailand's eight consecutive quarters of decline should be termed L-shaped [29]\n\n\nPsychological aspects\nRecessions have psychological and confidence aspects For example, if companies expect economic activity to slow, they may reduce employment levels and save money rather than invest Such expectations can create a self-reinforcing downward cycle, bringing about or worsening a recession [30] Consumer confidence is one measure used to evaluate economic sentiment [31] The term animal spirits has been used to describe the psychological factors underlying economic activity Keynes, in his The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was the first economist to claim that such emotional mindsets significantly affect the economy [32] Economist Robert J Shiller wrote that the term \"refers also to the sense of trust we have in each other, our sense of fairness in economic dealings, and our sense of the extent of corruption and bad faith When animal spirits are on ebb, consumers do not want to spend and businesses do not want to make capital expenditures or hire people.\" [33]\nBehavioral economics has also explained many psychological biases that may trigger a recession including the availability heuristic, the money illusion, and normalcy bias [34]\n\n\nBalance sheet recession\nExcessive levels of indebtedness or the bursting of a real estate or financial asset price bubble can cause what is called a \"balance sheet recession\" This occurs when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy [26] The term balance sheet derives from an accounting identity that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity [35] If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or corporation is insolvent Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2014 that \"the best working hypothesis seems to be that the financial crisis was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt—that it was a so-called \"balance sheet recession\" In Krugman's view, such crises require debt reduction strategies combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt [36]\n\n\nLiquidity trap\nA liquidity trap is a Keynesian theory that a situation can develop in which interest rates reach near zero (zero interest-rate policy) yet do not effectively stimulate the economy [40] In theory, near-zero interest rates should encourage firms and consumers to borrow and spend However, if too many individuals or corporations focus on saving or paying down debt rather than spending, lower interest rates have less effect on investment and consumption behavior; increasing the money supply is like \"pushing on a string\" [41] Economist Paul Krugman described the U.S 2009 recession and Japan's lost decade as liquidity traps One remedy to a liquidity trap is expanding the money supply via quantitative easing or other techniques in which money is effectively printed to purchase assets, thereby creating inflationary expectations that cause savers to begin spending again Government stimulus spending and mercantilist policies to stimulate exports and reduce imports are other techniques to stimulate demand [42] He estimated in March 2010 that developed countries representing 70% of the world's GDP were caught in a liquidity trap [43]\n\n\nParadoxes of thrift and deleveraging\nBehavior that may be optimal for an individual (e.g., saving more during adverse economic conditions) can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior, as ultimately, one person's consumption is another person's income Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift [44] and can cause or deepen a recession Economist Hyman Minsky also described a \"paradox of deleveraging\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets [45]\n\n\nCauses of recessions\nThere are many reasons why recessions happen One overall reason can be lack of demand due to sharp developments in the prices of the inputs used in producing goods and services Another main reason can be problems e.g in financial markets Because recessions have many likely explanations, it is demanding to predict them Some variables might at first glance be the causes of recessions, but they could also be the results of a recession, which means they are endogenous to recessions [46] One can summarize the causes of recessions in the following categories:\n\n\nPredictors\nRecessions are very challenging to predict While some variables like the (inverted) yield curve appear to be more useful to predict a recession ahead of time than other variables, no single variable has proven to be an always reliable predictor whether recessions will actually (soon) appear, let alone predicting their sharpness and severity in terms of duration [52] The longest and deepest Treasury yield curve inversion in history began in July 2022, as the Federal Reserve sharply increased the fed funds rate to combat the 2021–2023 inflation surge Despite widespread predictions by economists and market analysts of an imminent recession, none had materialized by July 2024, economic growth remained steady, and a Reuters survey of economists that month found they expected the economy to continue growing for the next two years An earlier survey of bond market strategists found a majority no longer believed an inverted curve to be a reliable recession predictor The curve began re-steepening toward positive territory in June 2024, as it had at other points during that inversion; in every previous inversion they examined; Deutsche Bank analysts found the curve had re-steepened before a recession began [53] [54] [55] The following variables and indicators are used by economists, like e.g Paul Krugman or Joseph Stiglitz, to try to predict the possibility of a recession:\n\n\nGovernment responses\nKeynesian economists favor the use of expansionary macroeconomic policy during recessions to increase aggregate demand [146] [147] [148] [149] Strategies favored for moving an economy out of a recession vary depending on which economic school the policymakers follow Monetarists, exemplified by economist Milton Friedman, would favor the use of limited expansionary monetary policy, while Keynesian economists may advocate increased government spending to spark economic growth Supply-side economists promote tax cuts to stimulate business capital investment For example, the Trump administration claimed that lower effective tax rates on new investment imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 would raise investment, thereby making workers more productive and raising output and wages Investment patterns in the United States through 2019, however, indicated that the supply-side incentives of the TCJA had little effect on investment growth Although investments increased after 2017, much of the increase was a response to oil prices, and investment in other sectors had negligible growth [150]\n\n\nStock market\nSome recessions have been anticipated by stock market declines In Stocks for the Long Run, Siegel mentions that since 1948, ten recessions were preceded by a stock market decline, by a lead time of 0 to 13 months (average 5.7 months), while ten stock market declines of greater than 10% in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were not followed by a recession [157]\n\n\nU.S. politics\nAn administration generally gets credit or blame for the state of the economy during its time in office; [161] this state of affairs has caused disagreements about how particular recessions actually started [162]\n\n\nConsequences\nUnemployment is particularly high during a recession Many economists working within the neoclassical paradigm argue that there is a natural rate of unemployment which, when subtracted from the actual rate of unemployment, can be used to estimate the GDP gap during a recession In other words, unemployment never reaches 0%, so it is not a negative indicator of the health of an economy, unless it exceeds the \"natural rate\", in which case the excess corresponds directly to a loss in the GDP [164]\n\n\nUnemployment\nUnemployment is particularly high during a recession Many economists working within the neoclassical paradigm argue that there is a natural rate of unemployment which, when subtracted from the actual rate of unemployment, can be used to estimate the GDP gap during a recession In other words, unemployment never reaches 0%, so it is not a negative indicator of the health of an economy, unless it exceeds the \"natural rate\", in which case the excess corresponds directly to a loss in the GDP [164]\n\n\nBusiness\nProductivity tends to fall in the early stages of a recession, then rises again as weaker firms close The variation in profitability between firms rises sharply [citation needed] The fall in productivity could also be attributed to several macro-economic factors, such as the loss in productivity observed across the UK due to Brexit, which may create a mini-recession in the region Global epidemics, such as COVID-19, could be another example, since they disrupt the global supply chain or prevent the movement of goods, services, and people.\n\n\nSocial effects\nThe living standards of people dependent on wages and salaries are less affected by recessions than those who rely on fixed incomes or welfare benefits The loss of a job is known to have a negative impact on the stability of families, and individuals' health and well-being Fixed income benefits receive small cuts [why?] which make it tougher to survive [165]\n\n\nHistory\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \"Global recessions seem to occur over a cycle lasting between eight and 10 years.\" [167] The IMF takes many factors into account when defining a global recession Until April 2009, IMF several times communicated to the press, that a global annual real GDP growth of 3.0% or less in their view was \"equivalent to a global recession\" [168] [169]\n\n\nGlobal\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \"Global recessions seem to occur over a cycle lasting between eight and 10 years.\" [167] The IMF takes many factors into account when defining a global recession Until April 2009, IMF several times communicated to the press, that a global annual real GDP growth of 3.0% or less in their view was \"equivalent to a global recession\" [168] [169]\n\n\nAustralia\nAs a result of late 1920s profit issues in agriculture and cutbacks, 1931–1932 saw Australia's biggest recession in its entire history It fared better than other nations that underwent depressions, but their poor economic states influenced Australia, which depended on them for export, as well as foreign investments The nation also benefited from greater productivity in manufacturing, facilitated by trade protection, which also helped with lessening the effects.\n\n\nEuropean Union\nThe Eurozone experienced a recession in 2012: the economies of the 17-nation region failed to grow during any quarter of the 2012 calendar year The recession deepened during the final quarter of the year, with the French, German and Italian economies all affected [178]\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\nThe most recent recession to affect the United Kingdom was the 2020 recession [179] attributed to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the first recession since the Great Recession.\n\n\nUnited States\nThe United States housing market correction (a consequence of the United States housing bubble) and subprime mortgage crisis significantly contributed to a recession.\n\n\nLate 2000s\nOfficial economic data shows that a substantial number of nations were in recession as of early 2009 The US entered a recession at the end of 2007, [185] and 2008 saw many other nations follow suit The US recession of 2007 ended in June 2009 [186] as the nation entered the current economic recovery The timeline of the Great Recession details the many elements of this period.\n\n\nUnited States\nThe United States housing market correction (a consequence of the United States housing bubble) and subprime mortgage crisis significantly contributed to a recession.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n", "lang": "en", "article": "# Recession\n\nA recession is a period of economic decline, typically defined as a decline in gross domestic product (GDP) for two or more consecutive quarters. Recessions are often accompanied by high unemployment, reduced consumer spending, and decreased business investment. The causes of recessions can be complex and multifaceted, involving factors such as monetary policy, fiscal policy, international trade, and technological changes.\n\n## Definitions\n\nIn a 1974 article by The New York Times, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Julius Shiskin suggested that a rough translation of the bureau's qualitative definition of a recession into a quantitative one might run like this: \"A recession is a decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real gross domestic product (GDP), real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.\"\n\n## Attributes\n\nA recession encompasses multiple attributes that often occur simultaneously and encompasses declines in component measures of economic activity, such as GDP, including consumption, investment, government spending, and net export activity. These summary measures are indicative of underlying drivers such as employment levels and skills, household savings rates, corporate investment decisions, interest rates, demographics, and government policies.\n\n## Type of recession or shape\n\nThe type and shape of recessions are distinctive.

Japan's 1993–1994 recession was U-shaped and its 8-out-of-9 quarters of contraction in 1997–1999 can be described as L-shaped.\n\n## Psychological aspects\n\nRecessions have psychological and confidence aspects. For example, if companies expect economic activity to slow, they may reduce employment levels and save money rather than invest. Such expectations can create a self-reinforcing downward cycle, bringing about or worsening a recession. Consumer confidence is one measure used to evaluate economic sentiment. The term animal spirits has been used to describe the psychological factors underlying economic activity. Keynes, in his The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was the first economist to claim that such emotional mindsets significantly affect the economy. Economist Robert J Shiller wrote that the term \"refers also to the sense of trust we have in each other, our sense of fairness in economic dealings, and our sense of the extent of corruption and bad faith. When animal spirits are on ebb, consumers do not want to spend and businesses do not want to make capital expenditures or hire people.\"\n\n## Behavioral economics\n\nBehavioral economics has also explained many psychological biases that may trigger a recession including the availability heuristic, the money illusion, and normalcy bias.\n\n## Balance sheet recession\n\nExcessive levels of indebtedness or the bursting of a real estate or financial asset price bubble can cause what is called a \"balance sheet recession.\" This occurs when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. The term balance sheet derives from an accounting identity that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or corporation is insolvent.\n\n## Liquidity trap\n\nA liquidity trap is a Keynesian theory that a situation can develop in which interest rates reach near zero (zero interest-rate policy) yet do not effectively stimulate the economy. In theory, near-zero interest rates should encourage firms and consumers to borrow and spend. However, if too many individuals or corporations focus on saving or paying down debt rather than spending, lower interest rates have less effect on investment and consumption behavior; increasing the money supply is like \"pushing on a string.\"\n\n## Paradoxes of thrift and deleveraging\n\nBehavior that may be optimal for an individual (e.g., saving more during adverse economic conditions) can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior, as ultimately, one person's consumption is another person's income. Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist Hyman Minsky also described a \"paradox of deleveraging\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.\n\n## Causes of recessions\n\nThere are many reasons why recessions happen. One overall reason can be lack of demand due to sharp developments in the prices of the inputs used in producing goods and services. Another main reason can be problems in financial markets. Because recessions have many likely explanations, it is demanding to predict them. Some variables might at first glance be the causes of recessions, but they could also be the results of a recession, which means they are endogenous to recessions.\n\n## Predictors\n\nRecessions are very challenging to predict. While some variables like the (inverted) yield curve appear to be more useful to predict a recession ahead of time than other variables, no single variable has proven to be an always reliable predictor whether recessions will actually (soon) appear, let alone predicting their sharpness and severity in terms of duration.\n\n## Government responses\n\nKeynesian economists favor the use of expansionary macroeconomic policy during recessions to increase aggregate demand. Strategies favored for moving an economy out of a recession vary depending on which economic school the policymakers follow. Monetarists, exemplified by economist Milton Friedman, would favor the use of limited expansionary monetary policy, while Keynesian economists may advocate increased government spending to spark economic growth. Supply-side economists promote tax cuts to stimulate business capital investment.\n\n## Stock market\n\nSome recessions have been anticipated by stock market declines. In Stocks for the Long Run, Siegel mentions that since 1948, ten recessions were preceded by a stock market decline, by a lead time of 0 to 13 months (average 5.7 months), while ten stock market declines of greater than 10% in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were not followed by a recession.\n\n## U.S. politics\n\nAn administration generally gets credit or blame for the state of the economy during its time in office; this state of affairs has caused disagreements about how particular recessions actually started.\n\n## Consequences\n\nUnemployment is particularly high during a recession. Many economists working within the neoclassical paradigm argue that there is a natural rate of unemployment which, when subtracted from the actual rate of unemployment, can be used to estimate the GDP gap during a recession.\n\n## Unemployment\n\nUnemployment is particularly high during a recession. Many economists working within the neoclassical paradigm argue that there is a natural rate of unemployment which, when subtracted from the actual rate of unemployment, can be used to estimate the GDP gap during a recession.\n\n## Business\n\nProductivity tends to fall in the early stages of a recession, then rises again as weaker firms close. The variation in profitability between firms rises sharply. The fall in productivity could also be attributed to several macro-economic factors, such as the loss in productivity observed across the UK due to Brexit, which may create a mini-recession in the region.\n\n## Social effects\n\nThe living standards of people dependent on wages and salaries are less affected by recessions than those who rely on fixed incomes or welfare benefits. The loss of a job is known to have a negative impact on the stability of families, and individuals' health and well-being.\n\n## History\n\nGlobal recessions seem to occur over a cycle lasting between eight and 10 years. The IMF takes many factors into account when defining a global recession. Until April 2009, the IMF several times communicated to the press that a global annual real GDP growth of 3.0% or less in their view was \"equivalent to a global recession.\"\n\n## Global\n\nGlobal recessions seem to occur over a cycle lasting between eight and 10 years.

Until April 2009, the IMF several times communicated to the press that a global annual real GDP growth of 3.0% or less in their view was \"equivalent to a global recession.\"\n\n## Australia\n\nAs a result of late 1920s profit issues in agriculture and cutbacks, 1931–1932 saw Australia's biggest recession in its entire history. It fared better than other nations that underwent depressions, but their poor economic states influenced Australia, which depended on them for export, as well as foreign investments. The nation also benefited from greater productivity in manufacturing, facilitated by trade protection, which also helped with lessening the effects.\n\n## European Union\n\nThe Eurozone experienced a recession in 2012: the economies of the 17-nation region failed to grow during any quarter of the 2012 calendar year. The recession deepened during the final quarter of the year, with the French, German and Italian economies all affected.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nThe most recent recession to affect the United Kingdom was the 2020 recession attributed to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the first recession since the Great Recession.\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States housing market correction (a consequence of the United States housing bubble) and subprime mortgage crisis significantly contributed to a recession.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Recession\" following this outline:\n\n\nDefinitions\nIn a 1974 article by The New York Times, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Julius Shiskin suggested that a rough translation of the bureau's qualitative definition of a recession into a quantitative one that almost anyone can use might run like this:\n\n\nAttributes\nA recession encompasses multiple attributes that often occur simultaneously and encompasses declines in component measures of economic activity, such as GDP, including consumption, investment, government spending, and net export activity These summary measures are indicative of underlying drivers such as employment levels and skills, household savings rates, corporate investment decisions, interest rates, demographics, and government policies (Smith, 2018; Johnson & Thompson, 2020) By examining these factors comprehensively, economists gain insights into the complex dynamics that contribute to economic downturns and can formulate effective strategies for mitigating their impact (Anderson, 2019; Patel, 2017).\n\n\nType of recession or shape\nThe type and shape of recessions are distinctive In the US, v-shaped, or short-and-sharp contractions followed by rapid and sustained recovery, occurred in 1954 and 1990–1991; U-shaped (prolonged slump) in 1974–1975, and W-shaped, or double-dip recessions in 1949 and 1980–1982 Japan's 1993–1994 recession was U-shaped and its 8-out-of-9 quarters of contraction in 1997–1999 can be described as L-shaped Korea, Hong Kong and South-east Asia experienced U-shaped recessions in 1997–1998, although Thailand's eight consecutive quarters of decline should be termed L-shaped [29]\n\n\nPsychological aspects\nRecessions have psychological and confidence aspects For example, if companies expect economic activity to slow, they may reduce employment levels and save money rather than invest Such expectations can create a self-reinforcing downward cycle, bringing about or worsening a recession [30] Consumer confidence is one measure used to evaluate economic sentiment [31] The term animal spirits has been used to describe the psychological factors underlying economic activity Keynes, in his The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was the first economist to claim that such emotional mindsets significantly affect the economy [32] Economist Robert J Shiller wrote that the term \"refers also to the sense of trust we have in each other, our sense of fairness in economic dealings, and our sense of the extent of corruption and bad faith When animal spirits are on ebb, consumers do not want to spend and businesses do not want to make capital expenditures or hire people.\" [33]\nBehavioral economics has also explained many psychological biases that may trigger a recession including the availability heuristic, the money illusion, and normalcy bias [34]\n\n\nBalance sheet recession\nExcessive levels of indebtedness or the bursting of a real estate or financial asset price bubble can cause what is called a \"balance sheet recession\" This occurs when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy [26] The term balance sheet derives from an accounting identity that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity [35] If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or corporation is insolvent Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2014 that \"the best working hypothesis seems to be that the financial crisis was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt—that it was a so-called \"balance sheet recession\" In Krugman's view, such crises require debt reduction strategies combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt [36]\n\n\nLiquidity trap\nA liquidity trap is a Keynesian theory that a situation can develop in which interest rates reach near zero (zero interest-rate policy) yet do not effectively stimulate the economy [40] In theory, near-zero interest rates should encourage firms and consumers to borrow and spend However, if too many individuals or corporations focus on saving or paying down debt rather than spending, lower interest rates have less effect on investment and consumption behavior; increasing the money supply is like \"pushing on a string\" [41] Economist Paul Krugman described the U.S 2009 recession and Japan's lost decade as liquidity traps One remedy to a liquidity trap is expanding the money supply via quantitative easing or other techniques in which money is effectively printed to purchase assets, thereby creating inflationary expectations that cause savers to begin spending again Government stimulus spending and mercantilist policies to stimulate exports and reduce imports are other techniques to stimulate demand [42] He estimated in March 2010 that developed countries representing 70% of the world's GDP were caught in a liquidity trap [43]\n\n\nParadoxes of thrift and deleveraging\nBehavior that may be optimal for an individual (e.g., saving more during adverse economic conditions) can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior, as ultimately, one person's consumption is another person's income Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift [44] and can cause or deepen a recession Economist Hyman Minsky also described a \"paradox of deleveraging\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets [45]\n\n\nCauses of recessions\nThere are many reasons why recessions happen One overall reason can be lack of demand due to sharp developments in the prices of the inputs used in producing goods and services Another main reason can be problems e.g in financial markets Because recessions have many likely explanations, it is demanding to predict them Some variables might at first glance be the causes of recessions, but they could also be the results of a recession, which means they are endogenous to recessions [46] One can summarize the causes of recessions in the following categories:\n\n\nPredictors\nRecessions are very challenging to predict While some variables like the (inverted) yield curve appear to be more useful to predict a recession ahead of time than other variables, no single variable has proven to be an always reliable predictor whether recessions will actually (soon) appear, let alone predicting their sharpness and severity in terms of duration [52] The longest and deepest Treasury yield curve inversion in history began in July 2022, as the Federal Reserve sharply increased the fed funds rate to combat the 2021–2023 inflation surge Despite widespread predictions by economists and market analysts of an imminent recession, none had materialized by July 2024, economic growth remained steady, and a Reuters survey of economists that month found they expected the economy to continue growing for the next two years An earlier survey of bond market strategists found a majority no longer believed an inverted curve to be a reliable recession predictor The curve began re-steepening toward positive territory in June 2024, as it had at other points during that inversion; in every previous inversion they examined; Deutsche Bank analysts found the curve had re-steepened before a recession began [53] [54] [55] The following variables and indicators are used by economists, like e.g Paul Krugman or Joseph Stiglitz, to try to predict the possibility of a recession:\n\n\nGovernment responses\nKeynesian economists favor the use of expansionary macroeconomic policy during recessions to increase aggregate demand [146] [147] [148] [149] Strategies favored for moving an economy out of a recession vary depending on which economic school the policymakers follow Monetarists, exemplified by economist Milton Friedman, would favor the use of limited expansionary monetary policy, while Keynesian economists may advocate increased government spending to spark economic growth Supply-side economists promote tax cuts to stimulate business capital investment For example, the Trump administration claimed that lower effective tax rates on new investment imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 would raise investment, thereby making workers more productive and raising output and wages Investment patterns in the United States through 2019, however, indicated that the supply-side incentives of the TCJA had little effect on investment growth Although investments increased after 2017, much of the increase was a response to oil prices, and investment in other sectors had negligible growth [150]\n\n\nStock market\nSome recessions have been anticipated by stock market declines In Stocks for the Long Run, Siegel mentions that since 1948, ten recessions were preceded by a stock market decline, by a lead time of 0 to 13 months (average 5.7 months), while ten stock market declines of greater than 10% in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were not followed by a recession [157]\n\n\nU.S. politics\nAn administration generally gets credit or blame for the state of the economy during its time in office;

He is one of the most popular drivers in the IndyCar Series and has a significant following worldwide.\n\nEarly and personal life\n------------------------\n\nHélio Castroneves was born on May 10, 1975, in São Paulo, Brazil, to Hélio Castro Neves, an automobile dealer, and Sandra Alves de Castro Neves, a former school teacher. He has an elder sister, Katiucia, who is his business manager. In 1977, the family moved to Ribeirão Preto, an agricultural town about 150 miles northwest of São Paulo, to allow his father to find business in the region's thriving ethanol processing industry. Castroneves was educated in the São Paulo school system and developed an interest in racing from an early age.\n\nKarting career\n---------------\n\nCastroneves began his karting career in the early 1980s, sneaking into a car's trunk to watch his father's racing team compete on weekends. At the age of seven, he received his first go-kart and began driving at a karting track in São Paulo. His mother, however, was not supportive of his racing career, urging him to focus on schooling and enrolling him in less dangerous sports, such as association football, judo, swimming, tennis, and volleyball. Castroneves played those sports infrequently before telling his mother he wanted to focus on racing. He was inspired by Ayrton Senna, a three-time Formula One world champion.\n\nJunior car racing career\n-------------------------\n\nAt the age of 16, Castroneves progressed to car racing, competing in Formula Chevrolet Brazil, a series for finishing go-karters. His parents hired a trainer to help him lift weights for better car control and took him to a local recreational center. Castroneves drove a Copral-Berta-Chevrolet car and was championship runner-up with one victory and 92 points in the eight-round season. He moved to the higher-tier Formula 3 (F3) Sudamericana in 1993, driving a Ralt RT34-Mugen Honda car with Copral and later the funded Amir Nasr Racing Team. Castroneves' five-year-old car was worn and had no aerial to communicate to his team by radio. He was championship runner-up to Argentinean driver Fernando Croceri with four victories, eight podium finishes, and 57 points.\n\nCART\n-----\n\nIn January 1998, Bettenhausen Racing owner Tony Bettenhausen Jr invited Castroneves to test for his CART team at Sebring International Raceway. Castroneves signed to drive the No 16 Reynard 98I-Mercedes-Benz car in the 1998 season and was assigned former Penske Racing employee Tom Brown as his race engineer. During practice for the season-opening Grand Prix of Miami at Homestead–Miami Speedway, Castroneves sustained a sore head in an accident but medical officials cleared him to race. Castroneves achieved his first career top-ten finish in CART with a ninth at the Grand Prix of Long Beach, followed by a season-high second in the Miller 200 at Milwaukee Mile. He was 17th in the drivers' championship with 36 points and was second to Kanaan in the Rookie of the Year standings.\n\n2000-2001\n----------\n\nPost-season, Hogan closed his CART team because Fittipaldi was unable to provide him with the requested sponsorship money and consequently, stopped paying Castroneves a salary. Castroneves and his sister negotiated without Fittipaldi's help with Walker Racing to replace the outgoing Gil de Ferran and also Team Rahal without success. Following Greg Moore's death in an accident at the season-ending Marlboro 500 at California Speedway, Penske owner Roger Penske, team president Tim Cindric, attorneys, and sports agent Alan Miller hired Castroneves on a three-year contract. Castroneves ended his working relationship with Fittipaldi soon after for career mismanagement.\n\nIndyCar Series\n----------------\n\nCastroneves debuted in the Indy Racing League (IRL) in 2001, driving Penske's No 68 Dallara IR-01-Oldsmobile car at the season-opening Pennzoil Copper World Indy 200 at Phoenix. He qualified 11th for his first Indianapolis 500 and led the final 52 laps to win the race at his first attempt. Penske's performance in 2004 saw Castroneves being viewed as an outsider for the 2005 title. He began the season with a fifth place in the Toyota Indy 300 and a second at the following XM Satellite Radio 200. Starting the Indianapolis 500 from fifth position, Castroneves finished the race four places lower in ninth. At Richmond for the SunTrust Indy Challenge two races later, he qualified second and led a race-high 112 laps to win. The relationship between Castroneves and his teammate Hornish cooled after failed overtakes causing both drivers to collide. He qualified on the pole position at Pikes Peak International Raceway and Watkins Glen International and took six top-tens in the final ten races, finishing with 440 points for sixth in the drivers' championship.\n\nTax evasion trial\n------------------\n\nIn late 2008, an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) jury charged Castroneves with conspiracy and six counts of tax evasion for failing to report $5.5 million of income earned from 1999 to 2004. The issue came about when Alan Miller signed Castroneves to his first contract with Penske in early November 1999 following Greg Moore's sudden death at the 1999 Marlboro 500. With heavy pressure from sponsors to fill Moore's vacant seat, the deal had to be completed in a matter of days. Due to time constraints, Miller rushed through the contract negotiations for Penske, simply striking out Moore's name on the contract documents, and hand-writing in Castroneves' name. He also struck out the name of Moore's promotion company (Greg Moore Enterprises, which Moore owned) and wrote in Seven Promotions, erroneously implying and identifying Castroneves as owning that company. Castroneves, who had been investigated by the IRS since 2004 when it issued 150 subpoenas to businesses and individuals who did business with him, pleaded not guilty to the charges on October 3, and was ordered released on a $10 million bail. The IRS said he owed them $2.3 million in taxes.\n\n2009-2013\n----------\n\nCastroneves signed a multi-year contract with Penske from the 2009 season. Will Power replaced him for the season-opening St Petersburg race before Castroneves returned for the Grand Prix of Long Beach. Castroneves' season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, where he qualified fastest, and led twice for a total of 66 laps for his third victory there. In the Bombardier Learjet 550 at Texas two races later, Castroneves achieved his second victory of 2009. He took six more top-tens, including a second place in the Edmonton Indy, and pole position in the Iowa Corn Indy 250 at Iowa Speedway. Castroneves was eliminated from championship contention at Chicago, and finished fourth overall with 433 points.\n\n2014-2017\n----------\n\nCastroneves remained with Penske for the 2014 season. He finished third at the season-opening Grand Prix of St Petersburg and the Grand Prix of Indianapolis three races later. He qualified fourth for the Indianapolis 500, and finished second, 0.0600 seconds behind Hunter-Reay in the second-closest finish in event history after a late race duel for the victory. He took pole position for the first Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix race and won the second. After three straight sub-par results, Castroneves finished second in the Pocono IndyCar 500 at Pocono Raceway to tie his teammate Will Power for the points lead, which took after finishing eighth in the Iowa Corn Indy 300. He relinquished the points lead after a throttle problem left him 19th in the Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio. Entering the final race, the MAVTV 500 IndyCar World Championships, Castroneves was 51 points behind Power. After winning the one point for the pole position, he had to claim victory and for Power to finish seventh or lower to become the champion. Castroneves placed 14th for second overall with 609 points.\n\n2018-2024\n----------\n\nPost-season, he stepped down from IndyCar full-time to move to Penske's IMSA SportsCar Championship program. Castroneves was entered into both the IndyCar Grand Prix and the Indianapolis 500 as part of his 2018 campaign; he prepared for the races by sharing notes with his teammates and familiarizing himself with the car. At the Indianapolis 500, he started from eighth place, before losing control of his car in turn four and crashing on the 146th lap for a 27th-place finish.\n\nSports car career\n------------------\n\nCastroneves made his endurance racing debut in the 2006 Mil Milhas Brasil, winning after 374 laps in a shared GTP1-class Aston Martin DBR9 with Nelson Piquet, Nelson Piquet Jr., and Christophe Bouchut. He entered at the 2007 24 Hours of Daytona (part of the Rolex Sports Car Series), sharing Michael Shank Racing's No 60 Riley Daytona Prototype (DP) car with Hornish, Oswaldo Negri Jr and Mark Patterson and finishing ninth. Two months later, Castroneves drove the No 7 Penske Porsche RS Spyder Evo car with Timo Bernhard and Romain Dumas in the Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) category of the 12 Hours of Sebring (part of the American Le Mans Series), finishing third in class and fifth overall. He returned to the Rolex Sports Car Series to share the No 9 Penske-Taylor Racing Riley DP car with Ryan Briscoe and Kurt Busch in the 2008 24 Hours of Daytona, finishing 13th after starting third. For the 2008 Petit Le Mans and the following 2008 Monterey Sports Car Championships Castroneves shared Penske's No 5 Porsche RS Spyder Evo car with Briscoe, winning the LMP2 category at Petit Le Mans.\n\nOther racing ventures\n----------------------\n\nCastroneves was invited to compete in the International Race of Champions in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 Driving a Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, his best in the series was eighth with two podium finishes in 2002.

The duo finished the first race 12th and 10th in the second.\n\nMedia appearances\n-----------------\n\nCastroneves was encouraged by Apolo Ohno, an Olympic speed skater, to participate on dance program Dancing with the Stars in 2007.

It is a popular choice among players of all levels, from beginners to grandmasters. In this article, we will delve into the history of the Queen's Gambit, explore its overview, and examine its various variations.\n\n**History**\n\nThe Queen's Gambit is one of the oldest known openings in chess, with a history that dates back to the 15th century. The Göttingen manuscript of 1490, one of the oldest known chess manuscripts, contains a game that begins with the moves 1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4, which is a key part of the Queen's Gambit. In the 17th century, the Italian chess player Gioachino Greco analyzed the Queen's Gambit and recommended it as a solid and positional opening.\n\nIn the 18th century, the Queen's Gambit gained popularity, particularly in England and France. Philipp Stamma, a Syrian-born chess player, recommended the Queen's Gambit in his book \"A New Game of Chess,\" which was published in 1749. Stamma's recommendation helped to popularize the opening, and it became known as the \"Aleppo Gambit\" in his honor.\n\nDuring the early period of modern chess, queen pawn openings were not in fashion, and the Queen's Gambit did not become commonplace until the 1873 tournament in Vienna. Since then, the Queen's Gambit has remained a popular choice among players, and it continues to be a favorite among grandmasters today.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Queen's Gambit begins with the moves 1.d4 d5 2.c4, which is a classic opening move. White offers a pawn, the c-pawn, in exchange for a central pawn, the d-pawn. This is a common theme in the Queen's Gambit, as White aims to control the center of the board and create space for the pieces to develop.\n\nBlack has several options to respond to 2.c4, but the most common move is 2...dxc4. This move accepts the gambit pawn and creates a symmetrical position. However, Black can also decline the gambit by playing 2...e6, which is a more aggressive move that aims to challenge White's control of the center.\n\n**Variations**\n\nTechnically, any Black response other than 2...dxc4 (or another line with an early ...dxc4 that transposes into the QGA) is a Queen's Gambit Declined, but the Slav, Albin Countergambit, and Chigorin Defense are generally treated separately. These openings are part of the Queen's Gambit family, but they have distinct characteristics and strategies.\n\nThe Slav Defense, for example, begins with the moves 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6, which is a solid and positional move that aims to challenge White's control of the center. The Albin Countergambit, on the other hand, begins with the moves 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c5, which is a more aggressive move that aims to challenge White's control of the center.\n\nThe Chigorin Defense begins with the moves 1.d4 d5 2.c4 Nc6, which is a more aggressive move that aims to challenge White's control of the center. This opening is considered to be one of the most aggressive variations of the Queen's Gambit, and it is often used by players who want to take the initiative and challenge White's position.\n\n**Tarrasch Defense**\n\nThe Tarrasch Defense is a popular variation of the Queen's Gambit that begins with the moves 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6. This move is a more aggressive response to 2.c4, as it aims to challenge White's control of the center and create space for the pieces to develop.\n\nThe Tarrasch Defense is considered to be a solid and positional opening, but it can also be used as a more aggressive move that aims to challenge White's position. This opening is popular among players of all levels, from beginners to grandmasters, and it is often used in tournament play.\n\n**Orthodox Defense**\n\nThe Orthodox Defense is a popular variation of the Queen's Gambit that begins with the moves 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bf5. This move is a solid and positional response to 2.c4, as it aims to challenge White's control of the center and create space for the pieces to develop.\n\nThe Orthodox Defense is considered to be a solid and positional opening, but it can also be used as a more aggressive move that aims to challenge White's position. This opening is popular among players of all levels, from beginners to grandmasters, and it is often used in tournament play.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Queen's Gambit is one of the oldest known openings in chess, with a rich history that spans centuries. It is a popular choice among players of all levels, from beginners to grandmasters. In this article, we have explored the history of the Queen's Gambit, examined its overview, and examined its various variations.\n\nThe Queen's Gambit is a versatile opening that can be used in a variety of ways, from a solid and positional move to a more aggressive move that aims to challenge White's position.

He is a prominent figure in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and has been a member of the Indian Parliament for five consecutive terms. Adityanath is known for his strong Hindu nationalist ideology and has been a vocal advocate for the rights of Hindus in India.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nAdityanath was born as Ajay Mohan Singh Bisht on 5 June 1972 in the village of Panchur, in Pauri Garhwal, Uttar Pradesh (now in Uttarakhand) in a Garhwali Rajput family. His late father, Anand Singh Bisht, was a forest ranger. He was the second born in the family, among four brothers and three sisters. Adityanath completed his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in Uttarakhand.\n\n**Early Political Career**\n\nAdityanath belongs to a specific tradition of Hindutva politics in Uttar Pradesh that can be traced back to the Mahant Digvijay Nath. Both Digvijay Nath and his successor Mahant Avaidyanath belonged to the Hindu Mahasabha and were elected to the Parliament on that party's ticket. Adityanath was designated Avaidyanath's successor and was elected to the Lower House of the Indian Parliament (the Lok Sabha) in 1998. He was its youngest member at that time and was elected to the Parliament for five consecutive terms in 1998, 1999, 2004, 2009, and 2014 elections.\n\n**Relations with the BJP**\n\nIn 1998, Adityanath was elected to the Indian Parliament after joining the BJP, however, there were reports of his strained relations with the state BJP leaders. It has also been alleged that he often derided and criticised the dilution of the Hindutva ideology by the BJP in the 1990s and early 2000s. Having established his independent power base in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, with the support of the Hindu Yuva Vahini and the Gorakhnath Math, he felt confident to be able to dictate terms to the BJP. When his voice was not heard, he revolted by fielding candidates against the official BJP candidates. The most prominent example was the fielding of Radha Mohan Das Agarwal from Gorakhpur on a Hindu Mahasabha ticket in 2002, who then defeated BJP Cabinet minister, Shiv Pratap Shukla by a wide margin. In 2007, Adityanath threatened to field 70 candidates for the state assembly against the BJP candidates, but he reached a compromise in the end. In the 2009 Parliamentary elections, Adityanath was rumoured to have campaigned against the BJP candidates who were then defeated.\n\n**Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh (2017–present)**\n\nAdityanath was a prominent campaigner for the BJP in the 2017 assembly elections in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The state government appointed him as a Chief Minister on 18 March 2017, and he was sworn in the next day, after the BJP won the assembly elections.\n\n**Ministry Allocation**\n\nAfter becoming the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Adityanath kept around 36 ministries under his direct control, including Home, Housing, Town and country planning department, Revenue, Food and Civil Supplies, Food Security and drug administration, Economics and Statistics, Mines and Minerals, Flood control, Stamp and registry, Prison, General administration, Secretariat administration, Vigilance, Personnel and appointment, Information, Institutional finance, Planning, Estate department, Urban land, UP state reorganisation committee, Administration reforms, Programme implementation, National integration, Infrastructure, Coordination, Language, External aided project, Relief and Rehabilitation, Public Service Management, Rent Control, Consumer protection and Weights and measures.\n\n**Law and Order**\n\nIn 2017, his government ordered the withdrawal of around 20,000 \"politically motivated\" cases, including those against himself and other politicians.\n\n**Infrastructure Development**\n\nIn July 2018, Adityanath, along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Moon Jae-in, President of South Korea, inaugurated the world's largest smartphone manufacturing factory in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. His government was credited for making 50 megawatts of power and a 22-kilometre-long (14 mi) electricity line in a record four months for the Samsung mobile plant.\n\n**Ordinance and Bills**\n\nIn September 2020, Adityanath asked his government to devise a strategy to prevent \"religious conversions in the name of love\", and even considered passing an ordinance for the same if needed. On 31 October, Adityanath announced that a Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020 to curb \"Love Jihad\" would be passed by his government.\n\n**Second Term (2022–present)**\n\nOn 10 March 2022, with the announcement of the legislative assembly results, the BJP-led NDA alliance secured 273 seats with Adityanath winning his second term. He and his party wrote history, being the first Chief Minister to return to power after completing a full 5-year term in office. The BJP is also the first party to return to power consecutively after 37 years. He was only the third Chief Minister, in Uttar Pradesh's political history to complete a full 5-year term as the Chief Minister of the state after Mayawati of BSP and Akhilesh Yadav belonging to the Samajwadi Party.\n\n**Allegations and Criticism**\n\nConcerns were raised for alleged maladministration in the appointments and recruitment of candidates to various departments of government. Opposition leaders from Samajwadi Party, as well as BJP's own allies like Anupriya Patel, criticised the Yogi government time and again for sabotaging the right of Other Backward Castes and Dalits. In a letter written to Uttar Pradesh government, Patel alleged that the appointment authorities under Adityanath government are labelling the OBC and SC, ST candidates as ineligible for appointment in the interview-based appointment process to various departments of government.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Yogi_Adityanath\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nYogi Adityanath was born as Ajay Mohan Singh Bisht on 5 June 1972 in the village of Panchur, in Pauri Garhwal, Uttar Pradesh (now in Uttarakhand) in a Garhwali Rajput family [2] [3] [22] [23] [24] His late father, Anand Singh Bisht, was a forest ranger [b] He was the second born in the family, among four brothers and three sisters [27] He completed his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in Uttarakhand [28] [29]\n\n\nEarly political career\nAdityanath belongs to a specific tradition of Hindutva politics in Uttar Pradesh that can be traced back to the Mahant Digvijay Nath [31] [32] Both Digvijay Nath and his successor Mahant Avaidyanath belonged to the Hindu Mahasabha and were elected to the Parliament on that party's ticket The head priest (Mahant) of the Gorakhnath Math, a prominent Hindu temple, [33] Mahant Avaidyanath switched to the BJP in 1991, but nevertheless maintained significant autonomy Four years after Adityanath was designated Avaidyanath's successor, he was elected to the Lower House of the Indian Parliament (the Lok Sabha) [31] Avaidyanat is known as the mentor and guru of Adityanath [33] [27] Adityanath was elected as Member of Parliament from Gorakhpur first time in 1998 during 12th Lok Sabha at the age of 26, He was its youngest member at that time He was elected to the Parliament for five consecutive terms in 1998, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014 elections [1] [8]\n\n\nRelations with the BJP\nIn 1998, Yogi Adityanath was elected to the Indian Parliament after joining the BJP;

the 19th edition of the FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial international football tournament contested by the national teams of the member associations of FIFA. It was held in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July 2010.\n\n**Host selection**\n\nAfrica was chosen as the host for the 2010 World Cup as part of a short-lived rotation policy, abandoned in 2007, to rotate the event among football confederations. Five African nations placed bids to host the 2010 World Cup: Egypt, Morocco, South Africa, and a joint bid from Libya and Tunisia.\n\n**Bribery and corruption**\n\nOn 28 May 2015, media covering the 2015 FIFA corruption case reported that high-ranking officials from the South African bid committee had secured the right to host the World Cup by paying US$10 million in bribes to then-FIFA Vice President Jack Warner and to other FIFA Executive Committee members.\n\n**Qualification**\n\nThe qualification draw for the 2010 World Cup was held in Durban on 25 November 2007. As the host nation, South Africa qualified automatically for the tournament. As in the previous tournament, the defending champions were not given an automatic berth, and Italy had to participate in qualification. With a pool of entrants comprising 204 of the 208 FIFA national teams at the time, the 2010 World Cup shares with the 2008 Summer Olympics the record for most competing nations in a sporting event.\n\n**List of qualified teams**\n\nThe following 32 teams, shown with final pre-tournament rankings, qualified for the final tournament.\n\n**Preparations**\n\nFive new stadiums were built for the tournament, and five of the existing venues were upgraded. Construction costs were expected to be R8.4 billion (just over US$1 billion or €950 million). The five new stadiums were:\n\n* Soccer City, Johannesburg (Capacity: 94,736)\n* Loftus Versfeld Stadium, Pretoria (Capacity: 42,640)\n* Moses Mabhida Stadium, Durban (Capacity: 70,000)\n* Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, Port Elizabeth (Capacity: 43,600)\n* Peter Mokaba Stadium, Polokwane (Capacity: 40,929)\n\n**Construction strike**\n\nOn 8 July 2009, 70,000 construction workers who were working on the new stadiums walked off their jobs. The majority of the workers receive R2500 per month (about £192, €224 or US$313), but the unions alleged that some workers were grossly underpaid. A spokesperson for the National Union of Mineworkers said to the SABC that the \"no work no pay\" strike would go on until FIFA assessed penalties on the organisers. Other unions threatened to strike into 2011. The strike was swiftly resolved and workers were back at work within a week of it starting.\n\n**Prize money**\n\nThe total prize money on offer for the tournament was confirmed by FIFA as US$420 million (including payments of US$40 million to domestic clubs), a 60 percent increase on the 2006 tournament. Before the tournament, each of the 32 entrants received US$1 million for preparation costs. Once at the tournament, the prize money was distributed as follows:\n\n* Winners: US$8 million\n* Runners-up: US$4 million\n* Third place: US$2 million\n* Fourth place: US$1 million\n\n**Venues**\n\nThe 10 stadiums used for the tournament were located in 9 different cities across South Africa.\n\n**Team base camps**\n\nThe base camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. In February 2010, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team. Fifteen teams were in Gauteng Province, while six teams were based in KwaZulu-Natal, four in the Western Cape, three in North West Province, and one each in Mpumalanga, the Eastern Cape, and the Northern Cape.\n\n**Final draw**\n\nThe FIFA Organising Committee approved the procedure for the final draw on 2 December 2009. The seeding was based on the October 2009 FIFA World Ranking and seven squads joined hosts South Africa as seeded teams for the final draw. No two teams from the same confederation were to be drawn in the same group, except allowing a maximum of two European teams in a group.\n\n**Opening ceremony**\n\nFIFA's Referees' Committee selected 29 referees through its Refereeing Assistance Programme to officiate at the World Cup: four from the AFC, three from the CAF, six from CONMEBOL, four from CONCACAF, two from the OFC, and ten from UEFA. English referee Howard Webb was chosen to referee the final, making him the first person to referee both the UEFA Champions League final and the World Cup final in the same year.\n\n**Squads**\n\nAs with the 2006 tournament, each team's squad for the 2010 World Cup consisted of 23 players. Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player squad by 1 June 2010. Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game.\n\n**Match summary**\n\nThe 32 national teams involved in the tournament together played a total of 64 matches starting from the group stage matches and progressing to the knockout stage matches, with teams eliminated through the various progressive stages.

Many World Cup competitors complained about the noise caused by the vuvuzela horns, including France's Patrice Evra, who blamed the horns for the team's poor performance. Other critics include Lionel Messi, who complained that the sound of the vuvuzelas hampered communication among players on the pitch, and broadcasting companies, which complained that commentators' voices were drowned out by the sound.\n\n**Symbols**\n\nThe official mascot for the 2010 World Cup was Zakumi, an anthropomorphised African leopard with green hair, presented on 22 September 2008. His name came from \"ZA\" (the international abbreviation for South Africa) and the term kumi, which means \"ten\" in various African languages.\n\n**Match ball**\n\nThe match ball for the 2010 World Cup, manufactured by Adidas, was named the Jabulani, which means \"bringing joy to everyone\" in Zulu.

{"title": "The_Handmaid's_Tale", "content": "\nPlot summary\nAfter a staged attack that killed the President of the United States and most of Congress, a radical political group called the \"Sons of Jacob\" uses theonomic ideology to launch a revolution [8] The United States Constitution is suspended, newspapers are censored, and what was formerly the United States of America is changed into a military dictatorship known as the Republic of Gilead The new regime moves quickly to consolidate its power, overtaking all other religious groups, including Christian denominations.\n\n\nBackground\nFitting with her statements that The Handmaid's Tale is a work of speculative fiction, not science fiction, Atwood's novel offers a satirical view of various social, political, and religious trends of the United States in the 1980s Her motivation for writing the novel was her belief that in the 1980s, the religious right was discussing what they would do with/to women if they took power, including the Moral Majority, the Christian Coalition, and the Ronald Reagan administration [12] [failed verification] Atwood questions what would happen if these trends, and especially \"casually held attitudes about women\" were taken to their logical end [13]\n\n\nCharacters\nOffred is the protagonist and narrator who takes the readers through life in Gilead She was labelled a \"wanton woman\" when Gilead was established because she had married a man who was divorced All divorces were nullified by the new government, meaning her husband was now considered still married to his first wife, making Offred an adulteress In trying to escape Gilead, she was separated from her husband and daughter [26]\n\n\nOffred\nOffred is the protagonist and narrator who takes the readers through life in Gilead She was labelled a \"wanton woman\" when Gilead was established because she had married a man who was divorced All divorces were nullified by the new government, meaning her husband was now considered still married to his first wife, making Offred an adulteress In trying to escape Gilead, she was separated from her husband and daughter [26]\n\n\nCommander\nThe Commander says that he was a scientist and was previously involved in something similar to market research before Gilead's inception Later, it is hypothesized, but not confirmed, that he might have been one of the architects of the Republic and its laws Presumably, his first name is \"Fred\", though that, too, may be a pseudonym He engages in forbidden intellectual pursuits with Offred, such as playing Scrabble, and introduces her to a secret club that serves as a brothel for high-ranking officers.\n\n\nSerena Joy\nSerena Joy is a former televangelist and the Commander's Wife in the fundamentalist theonomy Her real name is Pam and she is fond of gardening and knitting The state took away her power and public recognition, and she tries to hide her past as a television figure Offred identifies Serena Joy by recalling seeing her on TV when she was a little girl early on Saturday mornings while waiting for the cartoons to air.\n\n\nOfglen\nOfglen is a neighbour of Offred's and a fellow Handmaid She is partnered with Offred to do the daily shopping Handmaids are never alone and are expected to police each other's behaviour Ofglen is a secret member of the Mayday resistance In contrast to Offred, she is daring She knocks out a Mayday spy who is to be tortured and killed in order to save him the pain of a violent death Offred is told that when Ofglen vanishes, it is because she has committed suicide before the government can take her into custody due to her membership in the resistance, possibly to avoid giving away any information.\n\n\nNick\nNick is the Commander's chauffeur, who lives above the garage Right from the start, Nick comes across as a daring character as he smokes and tries to engage with Offred, both forbidden activities By Serena Joy's arrangement, he and Offred start a sexual relationship to increase her chance of getting pregnant If she were unable to bear the Commander a child, she would be declared sterile and shipped to the ecological wastelands of the Colonies Offred begins to develop feelings for him Nick is an ambiguous character, and Offred does not know if he is a party loyalist or part of the resistance, though he identifies himself as the latter The epilogue suggests that he really was part of the resistance, and aided Offred in escaping the Commander's house.\n\n\nMoira\nMoira has been a close friend of Offred's since college In the novel, their relationship represents a female friendship that the Republic of Gilead tries to block A lesbian, she has resisted the homophobia of Gileadean society Moira is taken to be a Handmaid soon after Offred She finds the life of a Handmaid unbearably oppressive and risks engaging with the guards just to defy the system She escapes by stealing an Aunt's pass and clothes, but Offred later finds her working as a prostitute in a party-run brothel She was caught and chose the brothel rather than to be sent to the Colonies Moira exemplifies defiance against Gilead by rejecting every value that is forced onto the citizens.\n\n\nLuke\nLuke was Offred's husband before the formation of Gilead He was married when he first started a relationship with Offred and divorced his first wife to marry her Under Gilead, all divorces were retroactively nullified, resulting in Offred being considered an adulteress and their daughter illegitimate Offred was forced to become a Handmaid and her daughter was given to a loyalist family Since their attempt to escape to Canada, Offred has heard nothing of Luke She wavers between believing him dead or imprisoned.\n\n\nProfessor Pieixoto\nPieixoto is the \"co-discoverer  [with Professor Knotly Wade] of Offred's tapes\" In his presentation at an academic conference set in 2195, he talks about \"the 'Problems of Authentication in Reference to The Handmaid's Tale'\" [26] Pieixoto is the person who is retelling Offred's story, and so makes the narration even more unreliable than it was originally.\n\n\nAunt Lydia\nAunt Lydia appears in flashbacks where her instructions frequently haunt Offred Aunt Lydia works at the 'Red Center' where women receive instructions for a life as a Handmaid Throughout the narrative, Aunt Lydia's pithy pronouncements on code of conduct for the Handmaids shed light on the philosophy of subjugation of women practised in Gilead Aunt Lydia appears to be a true believer of Gilead's religious philosophy and seems to take her job as a genuine calling.\n\n\nCora\nA Martha (female domestic servants are called Marthas) who works at the Commander's house because she is infertile She hopes that Offred will get pregnant as she desires to help raise a child She is friendly towards Offred and even covers up for her when she finds her lying on the floor one morning—a suspicious occurrence by Gilead's standards, worthy of being reported.\n\n\nRita\nRita is a Martha at the Commander's house Her job is cooking and housekeeping and she is one of the members of the \"household\" At the start of the novel, Rita has a contempt for Offred and though she is responsible for keeping Offred well fed, she believes a Handmaid should prefer going to the Colonies over working as a sexual slave.\n\n\nSetting\nThe novel is set in an indeterminate dystopian future, speculated to be around the year 2005, [31] with a fundamentalist theonomy ruling the territory of what had been the United States but is now the Republic of Gilead The fertility rates in Gilead have diminished due to environmental toxicity and fertile women are a valuable commodity owned and enslaved by the powerful elite Individuals are segregated by categories and dressed according to their social functions Complex dress codes play a key role in imposing social control within the new society and serve to distinguish people by sex, occupation, and caste.\n\n\nGilead society\nBruce Miller, the creator and executive producer of The Handmaid's Tale television serial, declared with regard to Atwood's book, as well as his series, that Gilead is \"a society that's based kind of in a perverse misreading of Old Testament laws and codes\" [34] The author explains that Gilead tries to embody the \"utopian idealism\" present in 20th-century regimes, as well as earlier New England Puritanism [21] Both Atwood and Miller stated that the people running Gilead are \"not genuinely Christian\" [35] [34]\n\n\nReligion\nBruce Miller, the creator and executive producer of The Handmaid's Tale television serial, declared with regard to Atwood's book, as well as his series,

20th-century regimes, as well as earlier New England Puritanism [21] Both Atwood and Miller stated that the people running Gilead are \"not genuinely Christian\" [35] [34]\n\n\nWomen\nThe division of labour among the women generates some resentment Marthas, Wives and Econowives perceive Handmaids as promiscuous and are taught to scorn them Offred mourns that the women of the various groups have lost their ability to empathize with each other.\n\n\nThe Ceremony\n\"The Ceremony\" is a non-marital sexual act sanctioned for reproduction The ritual requires the Handmaid to lie on her back between the legs of the Wife during the sex act as if they were one person The Wife has to invite the Handmaid to share her power this way; many Wives consider this both humiliating and offensive Offred describes the ceremony:\n\n\nReception\nThe Handmaid's Tale received critical acclaim, helping to cement Atwood's status as a prominent writer of the 20th century Not only was the book deemed well-written and compelling, but Atwood's work was notable for sparking intense debates both in and out of academia [12] [failed verification] Atwood maintains that the Republic of Gilead is only an extrapolation of trends already seen in the United States at the time of her writing, a view supported by other scholars studying The Handmaid's Tale [38] Many have placed The Handmaid's Tale in the same category of dystopian fiction as Nineteen Eighty-Four and Brave New World, [15] a categorization that Atwood has accepted and reiterated in many articles and interviews [16]\n\n\nCritical

fiction as Nineteen Eighty-Four and Brave New World, [15] a categorization that Atwood has accepted and reiterated in many articles and interviews [16]\n\n\nGenre classification\nThe Handmaid's Tale is a feminist dystopian novel, [39] [40] combining the characteristics of dystopian fiction: \"a genre that projects an imaginary society that differs from the author's own, first, by being significantly worse in important respects and second by being worse because it attempts to reify some utopian ideal\", [41] with the feminist utopian ideal which: \"sees men or masculine systems as the major cause of social and political problems (e.g war), and presents women as not only at least the equals of men but also as the sole arbiters of their reproductive functions\" [42] [43]\n\n\nReception in schools\nAtwood's novels, and especially her works of speculative fiction, The Handmaid's Tale and Oryx and Crake, are frequently offered as examples for the final, open-ended question on the American Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition exam each year [51] As such, her books are often assigned in high-school classrooms to students taking this Advanced Placement course, despite the mature themes the work presents Atwood herself has expressed surprise that her books are being assigned to high-school audiences, largely due to her own censored education in the 1950s, but she has assured readers that this increased attention from high-school students has not altered the material she has chosen to write about since [52]\n\n\nCensorship in the United States\nThe American Library Association lists The Handmaid's Tale as number 37 on the \"100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000\" [53] In 2019, The Handmaid's Tale is still listed as the seventh-most challenged book because of profanity, vulgarity, and sexual overtones [54] Atwood participated in discussing The Handmaid's Tale as the subject of an ALA discussion series titled \"One Book, One Conference\" [55]\n\n\nIn higher education\nIn institutions of higher education, professors have found The Handmaid's Tale to be useful, largely because of its historical and religious basis and Atwood's captivating delivery The novel's teaching points include: introducing politics and the social sciences to students in a more concrete way; [69] [70] demonstrating the importance of reading to our freedom, both intellectual and political; [71] and acknowledging the \"most insidious and violent manifestations of power in Western history\" in a compelling manner [72]\n\n\nAcademic reception\nMuch of the discussion about The Handmaid's Tale has centred on its categorization as feminist literature Atwood does not see the Republic of Gilead as a purely feminist dystopia, as not all men have greater rights than women [21] Instead, this society presents a typical dictatorship: \"shaped like a pyramid, with the powerful of both sexes at the apex, the men generally outranking the women at the same level; then descending levels of power and status with men and women in each, all the way down to the bottom, where the unmarried men must serve in the ranks before being awarded an Econowife\" [21]\n\n\nFeminist analysis\nMuch of the discussion about The Handmaid's Tale has centred on its categorization as feminist literature Atwood does not see the Republic of Gilead as a

serve in the ranks before being awarded an Econowife\" [21]\n\n\nPhilosophical analysis\nMany elements of Gilead recall details from Plato's Republic Gilead's social hierarchy of commanders, guardians, Marthas and handmaids, for example, has similarities to Plato's social hierarchy of philosopher-guardians, auxiliary-guardians and producers Both societies are also home to a state-based eugenics program, and see gymnasiums used as educational spaces in which women are socialized into new gender roles The powers that be in Gilead legitimize their rule through the extensive use of propaganda, much as Plato's rulers ensure co-operation on the part of the public by propagating a noble lie.\n\n\nRace analysis\nAfrican Americans, the main non-White ethnic group in this society, are called the Children of Ham A state TV broadcast mentions they have been relocated \"en masse\" to \"National Homelands\" in North Dakota, which are suggestive of the apartheid-era homelands (Bantustans) set up by South Africa or forced death marches Ana Cottle characterized The Handmaid's Tale as \"White feminism\", noting that Atwood does away with Black people in a few lines by relocating the \"Children of Ham\" while borrowing heavily from the African-American experience and applying it to White women, specifically Gilead's explicit anti-literacy laws, which was borrowed from real life anti-literacy campaigns in the United States, alongside the removal of surnames among handmaids, an ode to how enslaved Africans were not given last names until Emancipation [82]

dictatorship known as the Republic of Gilead The new regime moves quickly to consolidate its power, overtaking all other religious groups, including Christian denominations.\n\n\nBackground\nFitting with her statements that The Handmaid's Tale is a work of speculative fiction, not science fiction, Atwood's novel offers a satirical view of various social, political, and religious trends of the United States in the 1980s Her motivation for writing the novel was her belief that in the 1980s, the religious right was discussing what they would do with/to women if they took power, including the Moral Majority, the Christian Coalition, and the Ronald Reagan administration [12] [failed verification] Atwood questions what would happen if these trends, and especially \"casually held attitudes about women\" were taken to their logical end [13]\n\n\nCharacters\nOffred is the protagonist and narrator who takes the readers through life in Gilead She was labelled a \"wanton woman\" when Gilead was established because she had married a man who was divorced All divorces were nullified by the new government, meaning her husband was now considered still married to his first wife, making Offred

was previously involved in something similar to market research before Gilead's inception Later, it is hypothesized, but not confirmed, that he might have been one of the architects of the Republic

a Mayday spy who is to be tortured and killed in order to save him the pain of a violent death Offred is told that when Ofglen vanishes, it is because she has committed suicide before the government

genuine calling.\n\n\nCora\nA Martha (female domestic servants are called Marthas) who works at the Commander's house because she is infertile She hopes that Offred will get pregnant as she desires to help raise a child She is friendly towards Offred and even covers up for her when she finds her lying on the floor one morning—a suspicious occurrence by Gilead's standards, worthy of being reported.\n\n\nRita\nRita is a Martha at the Commander's house Her job is cooking and housekeeping and she is one of the members of the \"household\" At the start of the novel, Rita has a contempt for Offred and though she is responsible for keeping Offred well fed, she believes a Handmaid should prefer going to the Colonies over working as a sexual slave.\n\n\nSetting\nThe novel is set in an indeterminate dystopian future, speculated to be around the year 2005, [31] with a fundamentalist theonomy ruling the territory of what had been the United States but is now the Republic of Gilead The fertility rates in Gilead have diminished due to environmental toxicity and fertile women are a valuable commodity owned and enslaved by the powerful elite Individuals are segregated by categories and dressed according to their social functions Complex dress codes play a key role in imposing social control within the new society and serve to distinguish people by sex, occupation, and caste.\n\n\nGilead society\nBruce Miller, the creator and executive producer of The Handmaid's Tale television serial, declared with regard to Atwood's book, as well as his series, that Gilead is \"a society that's based kind of in a perverse misreading of Old Testament laws and codes\" [34] The author explains that Gilead tries to embody the \"utopian idealism\" present in 20th-century regimes, as well as earlier New England Puritanism [21] Both Atwood and Miller stated that the people running Gilead are \"not genuinely Christian\" [35] [34]\n\n\nReligion\nBruce Miller, the creator and

and Miller stated that the people running Gilead are \"not genuinely Christian\" [35] [34]\n\n\nWomen\nThe division of labour among the women generates some resentment Marthas, Wives and Econowives perceive Handmaids as promiscuous and are taught to scorn them Offred mourns that the women of the various groups have lost their ability to empathize with each other.\n\n\nThe Ceremony\n\"The Ceremony\" is a non-marital sexual act sanctioned for reproduction The ritual requires the Handmaid to lie on her back between the legs of the Wife during the sex act as if they were one person The Wife has to invite the Handmaid to share her power this way; many Wives consider this both humiliating and offensive Offred describes the ceremony:\n\n\nReception\nThe Handmaid's Tale received critical acclaim, helping to cement Atwood's status as a prominent writer of the 20th century Not only was the book deemed well-written and compelling, but Atwood's work was notable for sparking intense debates both in and out of academia [12] [failed verification] Atwood maintains that the Republic of Gilead is only an extrapolation of trends already seen in the United States at the time of her writing, a view supported by other scholars studying The Handmaid's Tale [38] Many have placed The Handmaid's Tale in the same category of dystopian fiction as Nineteen Eighty-Four and Brave New World, [15] a categorization that Atwood has accepted and reiterated in many articles and interviews [16]\n\n\nCritical reception\nThe Handmaid's Tale received critical acclaim, helping to cement

Atwood has accepted and reiterated in many articles and interviews [16]\n\n\nGenre classification\nThe Handmaid's Tale is a feminist dystopian novel, [39] [40] combining the characteristics of dystopian fiction: \"a genre that projects an imaginary society that differs from the author's own, first, by being significantly worse in important respects and second by being worse because it attempts to reify some utopian ideal\", [41] with the feminist utopian ideal which: \"sees men or masculine systems as the major cause of social and political problems (e.g war), and presents women as not only at least the equals of men but also as the sole arbiters of their reproductive functions\" [42] [43]\n\n\nReception in schools\nAtwood's novels, and especially her works of speculative fiction, The Handmaid's Tale and Oryx and Crake, are frequently offered as examples for the final, open-ended question on the American Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition exam each year [51] As such, her books are often assigned in high-school classrooms to students taking this Advanced Placement course, despite the mature themes the work presents Atwood herself has expressed surprise that her books are being assigned to high-school audiences, largely due to her own censored education in the 1950s, but she has assured readers that this increased attention from high-school students has not altered the material she has chosen to write about since [52]\n\n\nCensorship in the United States\nThe American Library Association lists The Handmaid's Tale as number 37 on the \"100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000\" [53] In 2019, The Handmaid's Tale is still listed as the seventh-most challenged book because of profanity, vulgarity, and sexual overtones [54] Atwood participated in discussing The Handmaid's Tale as the subject of an ALA discussion series titled \"One Book, One Conference\" [55]\n\n\nIn higher education\nIn institutions of higher education, professors have found The Handmaid's Tale to be useful, largely because of its historical and religious basis and Atwood's captivating delivery The novel's teaching points include: introducing politics and the social sciences to students in a more concrete way; [69] [70] demonstrating the importance of reading to our freedom, both intellectual and political; [71] and acknowledging the \"most insidious and violent manifestations of power in Western history\" in a compelling manner [72]\n\n\nAcademic reception\nMuch of the discussion about The Handmaid's Tale has centred on its categorization as feminist literature Atwood does not see the Republic of Gilead as a purely feminist dystopia, as not all men have greater rights than women [21] Instead, this society presents a typical dictatorship: \"shaped like a pyramid, with the powerful of both sexes at the apex, the men generally outranking the women at the same level; then descending levels of power and status with men and women in each, all the way down to the bottom, where the unmarried men must serve in the ranks before being awarded an Econowife\" [21]\n\n\nFeminist analysis\nMuch of the discussion about The

levels of power and status with men and women in each, all the way down to the bottom, where the unmarried men must serve in the ranks before being awarded an Econowife\" [21]\n\n\nPhilosophical analysis\nMany elements of Gilead recall details from Plato's Republic Gilead's social hierarchy of commanders, guardians, Marthas and handmaids, for example, has similarities to Plato's social hierarchy of philosopher-guardians, auxiliary-guardians and producers Both societies are also home to a state-based eugenics program, and see gymnasiums used as educational spaces in which women are socialized into new gender roles The powers that be in Gilead legitimize their rule through the extensive use of propaganda, much as Plato's rulers ensure co-operation on the part of the public by propagating a noble lie.\n\n\nRace analysis\nAfrican Americans, the main non-White ethnic group in this society, are called the Children of Ham A state TV broadcast mentions they have been relocated \"en masse\" to \"National Homelands\" in North Dakota, which are suggestive of the apartheid-era homelands (Bantustans) set up by South Africa or forced death marches Ana Cottle characterized The Handmaid's Tale as \"White feminism\", noting that Atwood does away with Black people in a few lines by relocating the \"Children of Ham\" while borrowing heavily from the African-American experience and applying it to White women, specifically Gilead's explicit anti-literacy laws, which was borrowed from real life anti-literacy campaigns in the United States, alongside the removal of surnames among handmaids, an ode to how enslaved Africans were not given last names until Emancipation [82] [83]\n\n\nAwards\nIn November 2018, Atwood announced the sequel, titled The Testaments, which was

At the round in Rome, de Vries failed to score points in both races, having collided with his teammate Vandoorne and Sam Bird respectively in the two races. De Vries achieved his second victory of the season in Valencia, where he was one of the only drivers to not run out of usable energy before the end of the race.\n\n**2021-22 season**\n\nDe Vries and Stoffel Vandoorne remained with Mercedes for their swansong season in Formula E. De Vries won the first race of season 8 in Diriyah, and got pole the next day, but finished in 10th, and ended the championship in 9th with 106 points.\n\n**Formula One career**\n\nDe Vries was signed to the McLaren Young Driver Programme in 2010, and the Audi Sport Racing Academy in 2016.

region are to Scythian and Sarmatian settlement in the 2nd century BC Between the 2nd to the 6th centuries AD there is evidence of Chernyakhov culture, a multiethnic mix of the Geto-Dacian, Sarmatian, and Gothic populations.\n [12] In the 8th to 10th centuries the Khazar fortress of Verkhneye Saltovo stood about 25 miles (40 km) east of the modern city, near Staryi Saltiv [13] During the 12th century, the area was part of the territory of the Cumans, and then from the mid 13th century of the Mongol/Tartar Golden Horde.\n\n\nKharkiv Fortress\nIn 1654 in the midst of this period of turmoil for Right-bank Ukraine, groups of people came onto the banks of Lopan and Kharkiv rivers where they resurrected and fortified an abandoned settlement [15] There is a folk etymology that connects the name of both the settlement and the river to a legendary Cossack founder named Kharko [16] (a diminutive form of the Greek name Chariton, Ukrainian: Харитон, romanized: Kharyton, [1] or Zechariah, Ukrainian: Захарій, romanized: Zakharii) [17] But the river's name is attested earlier than the foundation of the fortress [18]\n\n\nRussian Empire\nAdministrative reforms led to Kharkiv being governed from 1708 from Kyiv, [19] and from 1727 from Belgorod In 1765 Kharkiv was established as the seat of a separate Sloboda Ukraine Governorate [20]\n\n\nSoviet era\nIn the Russian Constituent Assembly election held in November 1917, the Bolsheviks who had seized power in Petrograd and Moscow received just 10.5 percent of the vote in the Governorate, compared to 73 percent for a bloc of Russian and Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionaries Commanding worker, rather than peasant, votes, within the city itself the Bolsheviks won a plurality [29]\n\n\nCapital of Soviet Ukraine\nIn the Russian Constituent Assembly election held in November 1917, the Bolsheviks who had seized power in Petrograd and Moscow received just 10.5 percent of the vote in the Governorate, compared to 73 percent for a bloc of Russian and Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionaries Commanding worker, rather than peasant, votes, within the city itself the Bolsheviks won a plurality [29]\n\n\nGerman occupation\nDuring World War II, Kharkiv was the focus of major battles The city was captured by Nazi Germany on 24 October 1941 [58] [59] A disastrous Red Army offensive failed to recover the city in May 1942 [60] [61] It

Харьков, romanized: Kharkov, pronounced [xarʲkof]) is a city in northeastern Ukraine. It is the administrative center of Kharkiv Oblast and is the second-largest city in Ukraine after the capital, Kyiv.\n\nHistory\n\n## De-jure: RT/RI 1654–1789\n\nThe earliest historical references to the region are to Scythian and Sarmatian settlement in the 2nd century BC. Between the 2nd to the 6th centuries AD, there is evidence of Chernyakhov culture, a multiethnic mix of the Geto-Dacian, Sarmatian, and Gothic populations.\n\n## De-facto: Kharkiv Regiment 1654–1789\n\nIn the 8th to 10th centuries, the Khazar fortress of Verkhneye Saltovo stood about 25 miles (40 km) east of the modern city, near Staryi Saltiv. During the 12th century, the area was part of the territory of the Cumans, and then from the mid 13th century of the Mongol/Tartar Golden Horde.\n\n## Russian Empire 1789–1917\n\nIn 1654, in the midst of this period of turmoil for Right-bank Ukraine, groups of people came onto the banks of Lopan and Kharkiv rivers where they resurrected and fortified an abandoned settlement. There is a folk etymology that connects the name of both the settlement and the river to a legendary Cossack founder named Kharko. However, the river's name is attested earlier than the foundation of the fortress.\n\nAdministrative reforms led to Kharkiv being governed from 1708 from Kyiv, and from 1727 from Belgorod. In 1765, Kharkiv was established as the seat of a separate Sloboda Ukraine Governorate.\n\nSoviet era\n\nIn the Russian Constituent Assembly election held in November 1917, the Bolsheviks who had seized power in Petrograd and Moscow received just 10.5 percent of the vote in the Governorate, compared to 73 percent for a bloc of Russian and Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionaries. Commanding worker, rather than peasant, votes, within the city itself the Bolsheviks won a plurality.\n\nDuring World War II, Kharkiv was the focus of major battles. The city was captured by Nazi Germany on 24 October 1941. A disastrous Red Army offensive failed to recover the city in May 1942. It was retaken (Operation Star) on 16 February 1943, but lost again to the Germans on 15 March 1943. 23 August 1943 saw a final liberation.\n\nPost-World War II\n\nBefore the occupation, Kharkiv's tank industries had been evacuated to the Urals with all their equipment, and became the heart of Red Army's tank programs (particularly, producing the T-34 tank earlier designed in Kharkiv). These enterprises returned to Kharkiv after the war, and became central elements of the post-war Soviet military industrial complex.

and Sarmatian settlement in the 2nd century BC Between the 2nd to the 6th centuries AD there is evidence of Chernyakhov culture, a multiethnic mix of the Geto-Dacian, Sarmatian, and Gothic populations.\n [12] In the 8th to 10th centuries the Khazar fortress of Verkhneye Saltovo stood about 25 miles (40 km) east of the modern city, near Staryi Saltiv [13] During the 12th century, the area was part of the territory of the Cumans, and then from the mid 13th century of the Mongol/Tartar Golden Horde.\n\n\nKharkiv Fortress\nIn 1654 in the midst of this period of turmoil for Right-bank Ukraine, groups of people came onto the banks of Lopan and Kharkiv rivers where they resurrected and fortified an abandoned settlement [15] There is a folk etymology that connects the name of both the settlement and the river to a legendary Cossack founder named Kharko [16] (a diminutive form of the Greek name Chariton, Ukrainian: Харитон, romanized: Kharyton, [1] or Zechariah, Ukrainian: Захарій, romanized: Zakharii) [17] But the river's name is attested earlier than the foundation of the fortress [18]\n\n\nRussian Empire\nAdministrative reforms led to Kharkiv being governed from 1708 from

November 1917, the Bolsheviks who had seized power in Petrograd and Moscow received just 10.5 percent of the vote in the Governorate, compared to 73 percent for a bloc of Russian and Ukrainian

evacuated to the Urals with all their equipment, and became the heart of Red Army's tank programs (particularly, producing the T-34 tank earlier designed in Kharkiv) These enterprises returned to Kharkiv after the war, and became central elements of the post-war Soviet military industrial complex [65] Houses and factories were rebuilt, and much of the city's center was reconstructed in the style of Stalinist Classicism [15] Kharkiv's Jewish community revived after World War II: by 1959 there were 84,000 Jews living in the city However, Soviet anti-Zionism restricted expressions of

‘biudzhetniki’ \" (those whose income derives from the state budget, mostly public servants) [85] But Pro-Yanukovych demonstrations, held near the statue of Lenin in Freedom (previously Dzerzhinsky)

{"title": "George_Washington", "content": "\nEarly life (1732–1758)\nGeorge Washington was born on February 22, 1732, [a] at Popes Creek in Westmoreland County, Virginia [3] He was the first of six children of Augustine and Mary Ball Washington [4] His father was a justice of the peace and a prominent public figure who had four additional children from his first marriage to Jane Butler [5] The family moved to Little Hunting Creek in 1734 before eventually settling in Ferry Farm near Fredericksburg, Virginia When Augustine died in 1743, Washington inherited Ferry Farm and ten slaves; his older half-brother Lawrence inherited Little Hunting Creek and renamed it Mount Vernon [6] [7]\n\n\nColonial military career (1752–1758)\nLawrence Washington's service as adjutant general of the Virginia militia inspired George to seek a commission Virginia's lieutenant governor, Robert Dinwiddie, appointed Washington as a major and commander of one of the four militia districts The British and French were competing for control of the Ohio Valley: the British were constructing forts along the Ohio River, and the French between the Ohio River and Lake Erie [33]\n\n\nFrench and Indian War\nIn February 1754, Dinwiddie promoted Washington to lieutenant colonel and second-in-command of the 300-strong Virginia Regiment, with orders to confront French forces at the Forks of the Ohio [38] Washington set out with half the regiment in April and soon learned a French force of 1,000 had begun construction of Fort Duquesne there In May, having set up a defensive position at Great Meadows, he learned that the French had made camp seven miles (11 km) away; he decided to take the offensive [39]\n\n\nMarriage, civilian, and political life (1759–1775)\nOn January 6, 1759, Washington, at age 26, married Martha Dandridge Custis, the 27-year-old widow of wealthy plantation owner Daniel Parke Custis The marriage took place at Martha's estate; she was intelligent, gracious, and experienced in managing a planter's estate, and the couple had a happy marriage [62] They moved to Mount Vernon, near Alexandria, where he lived as a planter of tobacco and wheat, and he emerged as a political figure [63]\n\n\nOpposition to the British Parliament and Crown\nWashington played a central role before and during the American Revolution His distrust of the British military had begun when he was passed over for promotion into the Regular Army Opposed to taxes imposed by the British Parliament on the Colonies without proper representation, [84] he and other colonists were also angered by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 which banned American settlement west of the Allegheny Mountains and protected the British fur trade [85] Washington believed the Stamp Act 1765 was an \"Act of Oppression\" and celebrated its repeal the following year [f] In March 1766, Parliament passed the Declaratory Act asserting that Parliamentary law superseded colonial law [87] In the late 1760s, the interference of the British Crown in American lucrative western land speculation spurred the American Revolution [88] Washington was a prosperous land speculator, and in 1767, he encouraged \"adventures\" to acquire backcountry western lands [88] Washington helped lead widespread protests against the Townshend Acts passed by Parliament in 1767, and he introduced a proposal in May 1769 which urged Virginians to boycott British goods; the Acts were mostly repealed in 1770 [89]\n\n\nCommander in chief of the army (1775–1783)\nOn June 14, 1775, Congress created the Continental Army and John Adams nominated Washington as its commander-in-chief, mainly because of his military experience and the belief that a Virginian would better unite the colonies He was unanimously elected by Congress the next day [98] Washington appeared before Congress in uniform and gave an acceptance speech on June 16, declining a salary, though he was later reimbursed expenses [99] Washington was commissioned on June 19 and officially appointed by Congress as \"General & Commander in chief of the army of the United Colonies and of all the forces raised or to be raised by them\" [100] He was instructed to take charge of the Siege of Boston on June 22, 1775 [101]\n\n\nSiege of Boston\nEarly in 1775, in response to the growing rebellious movement, London sent British troops to occupy Boston, led by General Thomas Gage, commander of British forces in America [108] They set up fortifications, making the city impervious to attack Local militias surrounded the city and effectively trapped the British troops, resulting in a standoff [109] As Washington headed for Boston, word of his march preceded him, and he was greeted everywhere; gradually, he became a symbol of the Patriot cause [110] Upon Washington's arrival on July 2, 1775, two weeks after the Battle of Bunker Hill, he set up headquarters in Cambridge When he went to inspect the army, he found undisciplined militia [111] After consultation, he initiated Benjamin Franklin's suggested reforms: drilling the soldiers and imposing strict discipline [112] Washington ordered his officers to identify the skills of recruits to ensure military effectiveness, while removing incompetent officers [113] He petitioned Gage, his former superior, to release captured Patriot officers from prison and treat them humanely [114] In October 1775, King George III declared that the colonies were in open rebellion and relieved Gage of command for incompetence, replacing him with General William Howe [115]\n\n\nNew York and New Jersey\nAfter the victory at Boston, Washington correctly guessed that the British would return to New York City, a Loyalist stronghold, and retaliate He arrived there on April 13, 1776, and ordered the construction of fortifications to thwart the expected British attack He also ordered his occupying forces to treat civilians and their property with respect, to avoid the abuses Bostonians suffered at the hands of British troops [121] Howe transported his resupplied army, with the British fleet, from Halifax to New York City George Germain, who ran the British war effort in England, believed it could be won with one \"decisive blow\" [122] The British forces, including more than a hundred ships and thousands of troops, began arriving on Staten Island on July 2 to lay siege to the city [123] After the Declaration of Independence was unanimously adopted on July 4, Washington informed his troops on July 9 that Congress had declared the united colonies to be \"free and independent states\" [124]\n\n\nBattle of Long Island\nAfter the victory at Boston, Washington correctly guessed that the British would return to New York City, a Loyalist stronghold, and retaliate He arrived there on April 13, 1776, and ordered the construction of fortifications to thwart the expected British attack He also ordered his occupying forces to treat civilians and their property with respect, to avoid the abuses Bostonians suffered at the hands of British troops [121] Howe transported his resupplied army, with the British fleet, from Halifax to New York City George Germain, who ran the British war effort in England, believed it could be won with one \"decisive blow\" [122] The British forces, including more than a hundred ships and thousands of troops, began arriving on Staten Island on July 2 to lay siege to the city [123] After the Declaration of Independence was unanimously adopted on July 4, Washington informed his troops on July 9 that Congress had declared the united colonies to be \"free and independent states\" [124]\n\n\nCrossing the Delaware, Trenton, and Princeton\nWashington crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania, where Major General Lee's replacement General John Sullivan joined him with 2,000 more troops [135] The future of the Continental Army was in doubt due to lack of supplies, a harsh winter, expiring enlistments, and desertions Washington was disappointed that many New Jersey residents were Loyalists or skeptical about independence [136] Howe split up his army and posted a Hessian garrison at Trenton to hold western New Jersey and the east shore of the Delaware [137] Desperate for a victory, Washington and his generals devised a surprise attack on Trenton The army was to cross the Delaware in three divisions: one led by Washington (2,400 troops), another by General James Ewing (700), and the third by Colonel John Cadwalader (1,500) The force was to then split, with Washington taking the Pennington Road and General Sullivan traveling south on the river's edge [138]\n\n\nPhiladelphia\nIn July 1777, British General John Burgoyne led the Saratoga campaign south from Quebec through Lake Champlain and recaptured Fort Ticonderoga intending to divide New England, including control of the Hudson River However, General Howe in British-occupied New York City blundered, taking his army south to Philadelphia rather than up the Hudson River to join Burgoyne near Albany [156] Washington and Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe In the Battle of Brandywine, on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington and marched unopposed into the nation's capital at Philadelphia A Patriot attack failed against the British at Germantown in October [157]\n\n\nBrandywine, Germantown, and Saratoga\nIn July 1777, British General John Burgoyne led the Saratoga campaign south from Quebec through Lake Champlain and recaptured Fort Ticonderoga intending to divide New England, including control of the Hudson River However, General Howe in British-occupied New York City blundered, taking his army south to Philadelphia rather than up the Hudson River to join Burgoyne near Albany [156] Washington and Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe In the Battle of Brandywine, on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington and marched unopposed into the nation's capital at Philadelphia A Patriot attack failed against the British at Germantown in October [157]\n\n\nValley Forge and Monmouth\nWashington and his Continental Army of 11,000 men went into winter quarters at Valley Forge north of Philadelphia in December 1777 There they lost between 2,000 and 3,000 men as a result of disease and lack of food, clothing, and shelter [161] The British were comfortably quartered in Philadelphia, paying for supplies in pounds sterling, while Washington struggled with a devalued American paper currency The woodlands were soon exhausted of game By February, Washington was facing lowered morale and increased desertions among his troops [162] An internal revolt by his officers, led by Major General Thomas Conway, prompted some members of Congress to consider removing Washington from command Washington's supporters resisted, and the matter was dropped after much deliberation [163] Once the plot was exposed, Conway wrote an apology to Washington, resigned, and returned to France [164]\n\n\nWest Point espionage\nWashington became America's first spymaster by designing an espionage system against the British [172] In 1778, Major Benjamin Tallmadge formed the Culper Ring at Washington's direction to covertly collect information about the British in New York [173] Washington had disregarded incidents of disloyalty by Benedict Arnold, who had distinguished himself in many campaigns, including his invasion of Quebec and the Battle of Saratoga [174] In 1780, Arnold began supplying British spymaster John André with sensitive information intended to compromise Washington and capture West Point, a key American defensive position on the Hudson River [175] Historians Nathaniel Philbrick and Ron Chernow noted possible reasons for Arnold's defection to be his anger at losing promotions to junior officers, or repeated slights from Congress He was also deeply in debt, profiteering from the war, and disappointed by Washington's lack of support during his eventual court-martial [176]\n\n\nSouthern theater and Yorktown\nIn late 1778, General Clinton shipped 3,000 troops from New York to Georgia and launched a Southern invasion against Savannah, reinforced by 2,000 British and Loyalist troops They repelled an attack by American patriots and French naval forces, which bolstered the British war effort [182]\n\n\nDemobilization and resignation\nWhen peace negotiations began in April 1782, both the British and French began gradually evacuating their forces [204] With the American treasury empty, unpaid and mutinous soldiers forced the adjournment of Congress In March 1783, Washington successfully calmed the Newburgh Conspiracy, a planned munity by American officers; Congress promised each a five-year bonus [205] Washington submitted an account of $450,000 in expenses which he had advanced to the army, equivalent to $9.53 million in 2023 The account was settled, though it was allegedly vague about large sums and included expenses his wife had incurred through visits to his headquarters [206]\n\n\nEarly republic (1783–1789)\n\"I am not only retired from all public employments but I am retiring within myself, and shall be able to view the solitary walk and tread the paths of private life with heartfelt satisfaction ..

I will move gently down the stream of life, until I sleep with my fathers.\"\n\n\nConstitutional Convention of 1787\nBefore returning to private life in June 1783, Washington called for a strong union Though he was concerned that he might be criticized for meddling in civil matters, he sent a circular letter to the states, maintaining that the Articles of Confederation was no more than \"a rope of sand\" He believed the nation was on the verge of \"anarchy and confusion\", was vulnerable to foreign intervention, and that a national constitution would unify the states under a strong central government [225]\n\n\nFirst presidential election\nJust prior to the first presidential election of 1789, in 1788 the Board of Visitors of the College of William & Mary decided to re-establish the position of Chancellor, and elected Washington to the office on January 18 [236] The College Rector Samuel Griffin wrote to Washington inviting him to the post, and in a letter dated April 30, 1788, Washington accepted the position of the 14th Chancellor of the College of William & Mary [237] He continued to serve through his presidency until his death on December 14, 1799 [236]\n\n\nPresidency (1789–1797)\nWashington was inaugurated on April 30, 1789, taking the oath of office at Federal Hall in New York City [k] [245] His coach was led by militia and a marching band and followed by statesmen and foreign dignitaries in an inaugural parade, with a crowd of 10,000 [246] Chancellor Robert R Livingston administered the oath, using a Bible provided by the Masons, after which the militia fired a 13-gun salute [247] Washington read a speech in the Senate Chamber, asking \"that Almighty Being .. consecrate the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States\" [248] Though he wished to serve without a salary, Congress insisted that he accept it, later providing Washington $25,000 per year to defray costs of the presidency, equivalent to $6.39 million today [249]\nWashington wrote to James Madison: \"As the first of everything in our situation will serve to establish a precedent, it is devoutly wished on my part that these precedents be fixed on true principles.\" [250] To that end, he preferred the title \"Mr President\" over more majestic names proposed by the Senate, including \"His Excellency\" and \"His Highness the President\" [251] His executive precedents included the inaugural address, messages to Congress, and the cabinet form of the executive branch [252]\n\n\nCabinet and executive departments\nCongress created executive departments in 1789, including the State Department in July, the War Department in August, and the Treasury Department in September Washington appointed Edmund Randolph as Attorney General, Samuel Osgood as Postmaster General, Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State, Henry Knox as Secretary of War, and Alexander Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury Washington's cabinet became a consulting and advisory body, not mandated by the Constitution [260] Washington's cabinet members formed rival parties with sharply opposing views, most fiercely illustrated between Hamilton and Jefferson [261] Washington restricted cabinet discussions to topics of his choosing, without participating in the debate He occasionally requested cabinet opinions in writing and expected department heads to agreeably carry out his decisions [257]\n\n\nDomestic issues\nWashington was apolitical and opposed the formation of parties, suspecting that conflict would undermine republicanism [262] He exercised great restraint in using his veto power, writing that \"I give my Signature to many Bills with which my Judgment is at variance...\" [263] His closest advisors formed two factions, portending the First Party System Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton formed the Federalist Party to promote national credit and a financially powerful nation Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson opposed Hamilton's agenda and founded the Jeffersonian Republicans Washington favored Hamilton's agenda, however, and it ultimately went into effect—resulting in bitter controversy [264] Washington proclaimed November 26, 1789, as a day of Thanksgiving to encourage national unity \"It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and favor.\" He spent that day fasting and visiting debtors in prison to provide them with food and beer [265]\n\n\nAfrican Americans\nIn response to two antislavery petitions that were presented to Congress in 1790, slaveholders in Georgia and South Carolina threatened to \"blow the trumpet of civil war\" Washington and Congress responded with a series of racist measures: naturalization was denied to black immigrants; blacks were barred from serving in state militias; the Southwest Territory (later the state of Tennessee) was permitted to maintain slavery; and two more slave states were admitted (Kentucky in 1792 and Tennessee in 1796) On February 12, 1793, Washington signed into law the Fugitive Slave Act, which overrode state laws and courts, allowing agents to cross state lines to return escaped slaves [266] Many free blacks in the north decried the law believing it would allow bounty hunting and kidnapping The Fugitive Slave Act gave effect to the Constitution's Fugitive Slave Clause, and the Act was passed overwhelmingly in Congress [267]\n\n\nNational Bank\nWashington's first term was largely devoted to economic concerns [273] Establishment of public credit became a primary challenge for the federal government [274] Hamilton submitted a report to a deadlocked Congress, and he, Madison, and Jefferson reached the Compromise of 1790 in which Jefferson agreed to Hamilton's debt proposals in exchange for moving the nation's capital temporarily to Philadelphia and then south near Georgetown on the Potomac River [264] The terms were legislated in the Funding Act of 1790 and the Residence Act, both of which Washington signed into law Congress authorized the assumption and payment of the nation's debts, with funding provided by customs duties and excise taxes [275]\n\n\nJefferson–Hamilton feud\nJefferson and Hamilton adopted diametrically opposed political principles Hamilton believed in a strong national government requiring a national bank and foreign loans to function, while Jefferson believed the states and the farm element should primarily direct the government; he also resented the idea of banks and foreign loans To Washington's dismay, the two men persistently entered into disputes and infighting [280] Hamilton demanded that Jefferson resign if he could not support Washington, and Jefferson told Washington that Hamilton's fiscal system would lead to the overthrow of the republic [281] Washington urged them to call a truce for the sake of the nation, but they ignored him [282]\n\n\nWhiskey Rebellion\nIn March 1791, at Hamilton's urging, with support from Madison, Congress imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits to help curtail the national debt, which took effect in July [287] Grain farmers strongly protested in Pennsylvania's frontier districts; they argued that they were unrepresented and were shouldering too much of the debt, comparing their situation to British taxation pre-Revolution On August 2, Washington assembled his cabinet to discuss the situation Unlike Washington, who had reservations about using force, Hamilton was eager to suppress the rebellion with federal authority [288] Wanting to avoid involving the federal government, Washington first called on Pennsylvania state officials to take the initiative, but they declined On August 7, Washington issued his first proclamation for calling up state militias After appealing for peace, he reminded the protestors that, unlike the rule of the British crown, the Federal law was issued by state-elected representatives [289]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nIn April 1792, the French Revolutionary Wars began between Britain and France, and Washington declared America's neutrality The revolutionary government of France sent diplomat Edmond-Charles Genêt to America, and he was welcomed with great enthusiasm He created a network of new Democratic-Republican Societies promoting France's interests, but Washington denounced them and demanded that the French recall Genêt [294] The National Assembly of France granted Washington honorary French citizenship on August 26, 1792, during the early stages of the French Revolution [295] Hamilton formulated the Jay Treaty to normalize trade relations with Britain while removing them from western forts, and also to resolve financial debts remaining from the Revolution [296] Chief Justice John Jay acted as Washington's negotiator and signed the treaty on November 19, 1794; critical Jeffersonians, however, supported France Washington deliberated, then supported the treaty because it avoided war with Britain, [297] but was disappointed that its provisions favored Britain [298] He mobilized public opinion and secured ratification in the Senate [299] but faced frequent public criticism [300] The British agreed to abandon their forts around the Great Lakes, and the United States modified the boundary with Canada The government liquidated numerous pre-Revolution debts, and the British opened the British West Indies to American trade The treaty secured peace with Britain and a decade of prosperous trade Jefferson claimed that it angered France and \"invited rather than avoided\" war [301] Relations with France deteriorated afterward and, two days before Washington's term ended, the French Directory declared the authority to seize American ships, [302] leaving succeeding president John Adams with prospective war [303]\n\n\nNative American affairs\nDuring the fall of 1789, Washington had to contend with the British refusing to evacuate their forts in the Northwest frontier and their concerted efforts to incite Indian tribes to attack American settlers [304] The Northwest tribes under Miami chief Little Turtle allied with the British to resist American expansion, and killed 1,500 settlers between 1783 and 1790 [305]\n\n\nSecond term\nWashington initially planned to retire after his first term, weary of office and in poor health After dealing with the infighting in his own cabinet and with partisan critics, he showed little enthusiasm for a second term, while Martha also wanted him not to run [316] Washington's nephew George Augustine Washington, managing Mount Vernon in his absence, was critically ill, further increasing Washington's desire to retire [317] Many, however, urged him to run for a second term Madison told him that his absence would only allow the dangerous political rift in his cabinet and the House to worsen Jefferson also pleaded with him not to retire, agreeing to drop his attacks on Hamilton, and stating that he would also retire if Washington did [318] Hamilton maintained that Washington's absence would be \"deplored as the greatest evil\" to the country [319] With the election of 1792 nearing, Washington relented and agreed to run [309]\n\n\nFarewell Address\nIn 1796, Washington declined to run for a third term of office [329] In May 1792, in anticipation of his retirement, Washington instructed James Madison to prepare a \"valedictory address\", an initial draft of which was entitled the \"Farewell Address\" [330] In May 1796, Washington sent the manuscript to Alexander Hamilton who did an extensive rewrite, while Washington provided final edits [331] On September 19, 1796, David Claypoole's American Daily Advertiser published the final version [332]\n\n\nPost-presidency (1797–1799)\nWashington retired to Mount Vernon in March 1797 and devoted time to his plantations and other business interests [343] His plantation operations were only minimally profitable, [48] and his lands in the west (Piedmont) were under Indian attacks and yielded little income, with squatters there refusing to pay rent He attempted to sell these but without success [344] He became an even more committed Federalist He vocally supported the Alien and Sedition Acts and convinced Federalist John Marshall to run for Congress to weaken the Jeffersonian hold on Virginia [345]\n\n\nRetirement\nWashington retired to Mount Vernon in March 1797 and devoted time to his plantations and other business interests [343] His plantation operations were only minimally profitable, [48] and his lands in the west (Piedmont) were under Indian attacks and yielded little income, with squatters there refusing to pay rent He attempted to sell these but without success [344] He became an even more committed Federalist He vocally supported the Alien and Sedition Acts and convinced Federalist John Marshall to run for Congress to weaken the Jeffersonian hold on Virginia [345]\n\n\nDeath and burial\nOn December 12, 1799, Washington inspected his farms on horseback He returned home late and had guests for dinner, sitting down for the meal without changing his damp clothes from the inclement weather of the day He had a sore throat the next day but was well enough to mark trees for cutting That evening, Washington complained of chest congestion [354] The next morning, however, he awoke to an inflamed throat and difficulty breathing He ordered estate overseer George Rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood; bloodletting was a common practice of the time His family summoned doctors James Craik, Gustavus Richard Brown, and Elisha C Dick [355] A fourth doctor, William Thornton, arrived some hours after Washington died [356] Brown initially believed Washington had quinsy; Dick thought the condition was a more serious \"violent inflammation of the throat\" [357] They continued the process of bloodletting to approximately five pints, but Washington's condition deteriorated further Dick proposed a tracheotomy, but the other physicians were not familiar with that procedure and disapproved [358] Washington instructed Brown and Dick to leave the room, while he assured Craik, \"Doctor, I die hard, but I am not afraid to go.\" [359]\n\n\nReligious and spiritual views\nWashington was descended from Anglican minister Lawrence Washington, whose troubles with the Church of England may have prompted his heirs to emigrate to America [380] He was baptized as an infant in April 1732 and became a devoted member of the Anglican Church [381] He served more than 20 years as a vestryman and churchwarden at Fairfax Parish and Truro Parish in Virginia [382] He privately prayed and read the Bible daily, and publicly encouraged people and the nation to pray [383] He may have taken communion on a regular basis prior to the Revolution, but he did not do so following the war [384]\n\n\nSlavery\nDuring Washington's lifetime, Washington owned slaves for his plantation and there were conflicts in his position concerning his slaves throughout his life Slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of the Colony of Virginia, which continued after the Revolution and the establishment of Virginia as a state [400] [401] Slavery was legal in all of the Thirteen Colonies prior to the American Revolution [402] Washington owned and rented enslaved African Americans, and during his lifetime over 577 slaves lived and worked at Mount Vernon [403] [404] He inherited some, gained control of 84 dower slaves upon his marriage to Martha, and purchased at least 71 slaves between 1752 and 1773 [405] From 1786, he rented slaves;

He was a military leader, statesman, and Founding Father of the country, widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in American history. Washington played a key role in the American Revolutionary War, leading the Continental Army to victory over the British, and later served as the Commander-in-Chief of the army. He also served as the first President of the United States, setting important precedents for the office and establishing many of the government's executive departments.\n\n**Early Life (1732-1758)**\n\nGeorge Washington was born on February 22, 1732, at Popes Creek in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He was the first of six children born to Augustine and Mary Ball Washington. His father was a justice of the peace and a prominent public figure who had four additional children from his first marriage to Jane Butler. The family moved to Little Hunting Creek in 1734 before eventually settling in Ferry Farm near Fredericksburg, Virginia. When Augustine died in 1743, Washington inherited Ferry Farm and ten slaves; his older half-brother Lawrence inherited Little Hunting Creek and renamed it Mount Vernon.\n\n**Colonial Military Career (1752-1758)**\n\nLawrence Washington's service as adjutant general of the Virginia militia inspired George to seek a commission. Virginia's lieutenant governor, Robert Dinwiddie, appointed Washington as a major and commander of one of the four militia districts. The British and French were competing for control of the Ohio Valley: the British were constructing forts along the Ohio River, and the French between the Ohio River and Lake Erie.\n\n**French and Indian War**\n\nIn February 1754, Dinwiddie promoted Washington to lieutenant colonel and second-in-command of the 300-strong Virginia Regiment, with orders to confront French forces at the Forks of the Ohio. Washington set out with half the regiment in April and soon learned a French force of 1,000 had begun construction of Fort Duquesne there. Having set up a defensive position at Great Meadows, he learned that the French had made camp seven miles away; he decided to take the offensive.\n\n**Marriage, Civilian, and Political Life (1759-1775)**\n\nOn January 6, 1759, Washington married Martha Dandridge Custis, the 27-year-old widow of wealthy plantation owner Daniel Parke Custis. The marriage took place at Martha's estate; she was intelligent, gracious, and experienced in managing a planter's estate, and the couple had a happy marriage. They moved to Mount Vernon, near Alexandria, where he lived as a planter of tobacco and wheat, and he emerged as a political figure.\n\n**Opposition to the British Parliament and Crown**\n\nWashington played a central role before and during the American Revolution. His distrust of the British military had begun when he was passed over for promotion into the Regular Army. Opposed to taxes imposed by the British Parliament on the Colonies without proper representation, he and other colonists were also angered by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 which banned American settlement west of the Allegheny Mountains and protected the British fur trade.\n\n**Commander in Chief of the Army (1775-1783)**\n\nOn June 14, 1775, Congress created the Continental Army and John Adams nominated Washington as its commander-in-chief, mainly because of his military experience and the belief that a Virginian would better unite the colonies. He was unanimously elected by Congress the next day. Washington appeared before Congress in uniform and gave an acceptance speech on June 16, declining a salary, though he was later reimbursed expenses.\n\n**Siege of Boston**\n\nEarly in 1775, in response to the growing rebellious movement, London sent British troops to occupy Boston, led by General Thomas Gage, commander of British forces in America. They set up fortifications, making the city impervious to attack. Local militias surrounded the city and effectively trapped the British troops, resulting in a standoff. As Washington headed for Boston, word of his march preceded him, and he was greeted everywhere; gradually, he became a symbol of the Patriot cause.\n\n**Battle of Long Island**\n\nAfter the victory at Boston, Washington correctly guessed that the British would return to New York City, a Loyalist stronghold, and retaliate. He arrived there on April 13, 1776, and ordered the construction of fortifications to thwart the expected British attack. The British forces, including more than a hundred ships and thousands of troops, began arriving on Staten Island on July 2 to lay siege to the city.\n\n**Crossing the Delaware, Trenton, and Princeton**\n\nWashington crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania, where Major General Lee's replacement General John Sullivan joined him with 2,000 more troops. The future of the Continental Army was in doubt due to lack of supplies, a harsh winter, expiring enlistments, and desertions. Washington was disappointed that many New Jersey residents were Loyalists or skeptical about independence.\n\n**Philadelphia**\n\nIn July 1777, British General John Burgoyne led the Saratoga campaign south from Quebec through Lake Champlain and recaptured Fort Ticonderoga intending to divide New England, including control of the Hudson River. However, General Howe in British-occupied New York City blundered, taking his army south to Philadelphia rather than up the Hudson River to join Burgoyne near Albany.\n\n**Brandywine, Germantown, and Saratoga**\n\nIn July 1777, British General John Burgoyne led the Saratoga campaign south from Quebec through Lake Champlain and recaptured Fort Ticonderoga intending to divide New England, including control of the Hudson River. However, General Howe in British-occupied New York City blundered, taking his army south to Philadelphia rather than up the Hudson River to join Burgoyne near Albany.\n\n**Valley Forge and Monmouth**\n\nWashington and his Continental Army of 11,000 men went into winter quarters at Valley Forge north of Philadelphia in December 1777. They lost between 2,000 and 3,000 men as a result of disease and lack of food, clothing, and shelter. The British were comfortably quartered in Philadelphia, paying for supplies in pounds sterling, while Washington struggled with a devalued American paper currency.\n\n**West Point Espionage**\n\nWashington became America's first spymaster by designing an espionage system against the British. In 1778, Major Benjamin Tallmadge formed the Culper Ring at Washington's direction to covertly collect information about the British in New York.\n\n**Southern Theater and Yorktown**\n\nIn late 1778, General Clinton shipped 3,000 troops from New York to Georgia and launched a Southern invasion against Savannah, reinforced by 2,000 British and Loyalist troops. They repelled an attack by American patriots and French naval forces, which bolstered the British war effort.\n\n**Demobilization and Resignation**\n\nWhen peace negotiations began in April 1782, both the British and French began gradually evacuating their forces. With the American treasury empty, unpaid and mutinous soldiers forced the adjournment of Congress. In March 1783, Washington successfully calmed the Newburgh Conspiracy, a planned mutiny by American officers; Congress promised each a five-year bonus.\n\n**Early Republic (1783-1789)**\n\n\"I am not only retired from all public employments but I am retiring within myself, and shall be able to view the solitary walk and tread the paths of private life with heartfelt satisfaction...\"\n\nWashington returned to Mount Vernon in June 1783 and devoted time to his plantations and other business interests. His plantation operations were only minimally profitable, and his lands in the west (Piedmont) were under Indian attacks and yielded little income, with squatters there refusing to pay rent.\n\n**Presidency (1789-1797)**\n\nWashington was inaugurated on April 30, 1789, taking the oath of office at Federal Hall in New York City. He read a speech in the Senate Chamber, asking \"that Almighty Being .. consecrate the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States.\" Though he wished to serve without a salary, Congress insisted that he accept it, later providing Washington $25,000 per year to defray costs of the presidency.\n\n**Cabinet and Executive Departments**\n\nCongress created executive departments in 1789, including the State Department, the War Department, and the Treasury Department. Washington appointed Edmund Randolph as Attorney General, Samuel Osgood as Postmaster General, Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State, Henry Knox as Secretary of War, and Alexander Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n**Domestic Issues**\n\nWashington was apolitical and opposed the formation of parties, suspecting that conflict would undermine republicanism. He exercised great restraint in using his veto power, writing that \"I give my Signature to many Bills with which my Judgment is at variance...\"\n\n**African Americans**\n\nIn response to two antislavery petitions that were presented to Congress in 1790, slaveholders in Georgia and South Carolina threatened to \"blow the trumpet of civil war.\" Washington and Congress responded with a series of racist measures: naturalization was denied to black immigrants; blacks were barred from serving in state militias; the Southwest Territory (later the state of Tennessee) was permitted to maintain slavery; and two more slave states were admitted (Kentucky in 1792 and Tennessee in 1796).\n\n**National Bank**\n\nWashington's first term was largely devoted to economic concerns. Establishment of public credit became a primary challenge for the federal government. Hamilton submitted a report to a deadlocked Congress, and he, Madison, and Jefferson reached the Compromise of 1790 in which Jefferson agreed to Hamilton's debt proposals in exchange for moving the nation's capital temporarily to Philadelphia and then south near Georgetown on the Potomac River.\n\n**Jefferson-Hamilton Feud**\n\nJefferson and Hamilton adopted diametrically opposed political principles. Hamilton believed in a strong national government requiring a national bank and foreign loans to function, while Jefferson believed the states and the farm element should primarily direct the government; he also resented the idea of banks and foreign loans.\n\n**Whiskey Rebellion**\n\nIn March 1791, at Hamilton's urging, with support from Madison, Congress imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits to help curtail the national debt, which took effect in July. Grain farmers strongly protested in Pennsylvania's frontier districts; they argued that they were unrepresented and were shouldering too much of the debt, comparing their situation to British taxation pre-Revolution.\n\n**Foreign Affairs**\n\nIn April 1792, the French Revolutionary Wars began between Britain and France, and Washington declared America's neutrality. The revolutionary government of France sent diplomat Edmond-Charles Genêt to America, and he was welcomed with great enthusiasm.\n\n**Second Term**\n\nWashington initially planned to retire after his first term, weary of office and in poor health. However, he relented and agreed to run for a second term in 1792. Many, however, urged him to run for a second term, including Madison and Jefferson.\n\n**Farewell Address**\n\nIn 1796, Washington declined to run for a third term of office. In May 1792, in anticipation of his retirement, Washington instructed James Madison to prepare a \"valedictory address\", an initial draft of which was entitled the \"Farewell Address\". On September 19, 1796, David Claypoole's American Daily Advertiser published the final version.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nWashington's legacy endures as one of the most influential in American history since he served as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, a hero of the Revolution, and the first president of the United States. Various historians maintain that he also was a dominant factor in America's founding.

\"Act of Oppression\" and celebrated its repeal the following year [f] In March 1766, Parliament passed the Declaratory Act asserting that Parliamentary law superseded colonial law [87] In the late 1760s, the interference of the British Crown in American lucrative western land speculation spurred the American Revolution [88] Washington was a prosperous land speculator, and in 1767, he encouraged \"adventures\" to acquire backcountry western lands [88] Washington helped lead widespread protests against the Townshend Acts passed by Parliament in 1767, and he introduced a proposal in May 1769

recruits to ensure military effectiveness, while removing incompetent officers [113] He petitioned Gage, his former superior, to release captured Patriot officers from prison and treat them humanely

ordered the construction of fortifications to thwart the expected British attack He also ordered his occupying forces to treat civilians and their property with respect, to avoid the abuses Bostonians suffered at the hands of British troops [121] Howe transported his resupplied army, with the British fleet, from Halifax to New York City George Germain, who ran the British war effort in England, believed it could be won with one \"decisive blow\" [122] The British forces, including more than a hundred ships and thousands of troops, began arriving on Staten Island on July 2 to lay siege to the city [123] After the Declaration of Independence was unanimously adopted on July 4, Washington informed his troops on July 9 that Congress had declared the united colonies to be \"free and independent states\" [124]\n\n\nBattle of Long Island\nAfter the victory at Boston, Washington correctly guessed that the British would return to New York City, a Loyalist stronghold, and retaliate He arrived there on April 13, 1776, and ordered the construction of fortifications to thwart the expected British attack He also ordered his occupying forces to treat civilians and their property with respect, to avoid the abuses Bostonians suffered at the hands of British troops [121] Howe transported his resupplied army, with the British fleet, from Halifax to New York City George Germain, who ran the British war effort in England, believed it could be won with one \"decisive blow\" [122] The British forces, including more than a hundred ships and thousands of troops, began arriving on Staten Island on July 2 to lay siege to the city [123] After the Declaration of Independence was unanimously adopted on July 4, Washington informed his troops on July 9 that Congress had declared the united colonies to be \"free and independent states\" [124]\n\n\nCrossing the Delaware, Trenton, and Princeton\nWashington crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania, where Major General Lee's replacement General John Sullivan joined him with 2,000 more troops [135] The future of the Continental Army was in doubt due to lack of supplies, a harsh winter, expiring enlistments, and desertions Washington was disappointed that many New Jersey residents were Loyalists or skeptical about independence [136] Howe split up his army and posted a Hessian garrison at Trenton to hold western New Jersey and the east shore of the Delaware [137] Desperate for a victory, Washington and his generals devised a surprise attack on Trenton The army was to cross the Delaware in three divisions: one led by Washington (2,400 troops), another by General James Ewing (700), and the third by Colonel John Cadwalader (1,500) The force was to then split, with Washington taking the Pennington Road and General Sullivan traveling south on the river's edge [138]\n\n\nPhiladelphia\nIn July 1777, British General John Burgoyne led the Saratoga campaign south from Quebec through Lake Champlain and recaptured Fort Ticonderoga intending to divide New England, including control of the Hudson River However, General Howe in British-occupied New York City blundered, taking his army south to Philadelphia rather than up the Hudson River to join Burgoyne near Albany [156] Washington and Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe In the Battle of Brandywine, on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington and marched unopposed into the nation's capital at Philadelphia A Patriot attack failed against the British at Germantown in October [157]\n\n\nBrandywine, Germantown, and Saratoga\nIn July 1777, British General John Burgoyne led the Saratoga campaign south from Quebec through Lake Champlain and recaptured Fort Ticonderoga intending to divide New England, including control of the Hudson River However, General Howe in British-occupied New York City blundered, taking his army south to Philadelphia rather than up the Hudson River to join Burgoyne near Albany [156] Washington and Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe In the Battle of Brandywine, on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington and marched unopposed into the nation's capital at Philadelphia A Patriot attack failed against the British at Germantown in October [157]\n\n\nValley Forge and Monmouth\nWashington and his Continental Army of 11,000 men went into winter quarters at Valley Forge north of Philadelphia in December 1777 There they lost between 2,000 and 3,000 men as a result of disease and lack of food, clothing, and shelter [161] The British were comfortably quartered in Philadelphia, paying for supplies in pounds sterling, while Washington struggled with a devalued American paper currency The woodlands were soon exhausted of game By February, Washington was facing lowered morale and increased desertions among his troops [162] An internal revolt by his officers, led by Major General Thomas Conway, prompted some members of Congress to consider removing Washington from command Washington's supporters resisted, and the matter was dropped after much deliberation [163] Once the plot was exposed, Conway wrote an apology to Washington, resigned, and returned to France [164]\n\n\nWest Point espionage\nWashington became America's first spymaster by designing an espionage system against the British [172] In 1778, Major Benjamin Tallmadge formed the Culper Ring at Washington's direction to covertly collect information about the British in New York [173] Washington had disregarded incidents of disloyalty by Benedict Arnold, who had distinguished himself in many campaigns, including his invasion of Quebec and the Battle of Saratoga [174] In 1780, Arnold began supplying British spymaster John André with sensitive information intended to compromise Washington and capture West Point, a key American defensive position on the Hudson River [175] Historians Nathaniel Philbrick and Ron Chernow noted possible reasons for Arnold's defection to be his anger at losing promotions to junior officers, or repeated slights from Congress He was also deeply in debt, profiteering from the war, and disappointed by Washington's lack of support during his eventual court-martial [176]\n\n\nSouthern theater and Yorktown\nIn late 1778, General Clinton shipped 3,000 troops from New York to Georgia and launched a Southern invasion against Savannah, reinforced by 2,000 British and Loyalist troops They repelled an attack by American patriots and French naval forces, which bolstered the British war effort [182]\n\n\nDemobilization and resignation\nWhen peace negotiations began in April 1782, both the British and French began gradually evacuating their forces [204] With the American treasury empty, unpaid and mutinous soldiers forced the adjournment of Congress In March 1783, Washington successfully calmed the Newburgh Conspiracy, a planned munity by American officers; Congress promised each a five-year bonus [205] Washington submitted an account of $450,000 in expenses which he had advanced to the army, equivalent to $9.53 million in 2023 The account was settled, though it was allegedly vague about large sums and included expenses his wife had incurred through visits to his headquarters [206]\n\n\nEarly republic (1783–1789)\n\"I am not only retired from all public employments but I am retiring within myself, and shall be able to view the solitary walk and tread the paths of private life with heartfelt satisfaction .. I will move gently down the stream of life, until I sleep with my fathers.\"\n\n\nReturn to Mount Vernon\n\"I am not only retired from all public employments but I am retiring within myself, and shall be able to view the solitary walk and tread the paths of private life with heartfelt satisfaction .. I will move gently down the stream of life, until I sleep with my fathers.\"\n\n\nConstitutional Convention of 1787\nBefore returning to private life in June 1783, Washington called for a strong union Though he was concerned that he might be criticized for meddling in civil matters, he sent a circular letter to the states, maintaining that the Articles of Confederation was no more than \"a rope of sand\" He believed the nation was on the verge of \"anarchy and confusion\", was vulnerable to foreign intervention, and that a national constitution would unify the states under a strong central government [225]\n\n\nFirst presidential election\nJust prior to the first presidential election of 1789, in 1788 the Board of Visitors of the College of William & Mary decided to re-establish the position of Chancellor, and elected Washington to the office on January 18 [236] The College Rector Samuel Griffin wrote to Washington inviting him to the post, and in a letter dated April 30, 1788, Washington accepted the position of the 14th Chancellor of the College of William & Mary [237] He continued to serve through his presidency until his death on December 14, 1799 [236]\n\n\nPresidency (1789–1797)\nWashington was inaugurated on April 30, 1789, taking the oath of office at Federal Hall in New York City [k] [245] His coach was led by militia and a marching band and followed by statesmen and foreign dignitaries in an inaugural parade, with a crowd of 10,000 [246] Chancellor Robert R Livingston administered the oath, using a Bible provided by the Masons, after which the militia fired a 13-gun salute [247] Washington read a speech in the Senate Chamber, asking \"that Almighty Being .. consecrate the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States\" [248] Though he wished to serve without a salary, Congress insisted that he accept it, later providing Washington $25,000 per year to defray costs of the presidency, equivalent to $6.39 million today [249]\nWashington wrote to James Madison: \"As the first of everything in our situation will serve to establish a precedent, it is devoutly wished on my part that these precedents be fixed on true principles.\" [250] To that end, he preferred the title \"Mr President\" over more majestic names proposed by the Senate, including \"His Excellency\" and \"His Highness the President\" [251] His executive precedents included the inaugural address, messages to Congress, and the cabinet form of the executive branch [252]\n\n\nCabinet and executive departments\nCongress created executive departments in 1789, including the State Department in July, the War Department in August, and the Treasury Department in September Washington appointed Edmund Randolph as Attorney General, Samuel Osgood as Postmaster General, Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State, Henry Knox as Secretary of War, and Alexander Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury Washington's cabinet became a consulting and advisory body, not mandated by the Constitution [260] Washington's cabinet members formed rival parties with sharply opposing views, most fiercely illustrated between Hamilton and Jefferson [261] Washington restricted cabinet discussions to topics of his choosing, without participating in the debate He occasionally requested cabinet opinions in writing and expected department heads to agreeably carry out his decisions [257]\n\n\nDomestic issues\nWashington was apolitical and opposed the formation of parties, suspecting that conflict would undermine republicanism [262] He exercised great restraint in using his veto power, writing that \"I give my Signature to many Bills with which my Judgment is at variance...\" [263] His closest advisors formed two factions, portending the First Party System Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton formed the Federalist Party to promote national credit and a financially powerful nation Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson opposed Hamilton's agenda and founded the Jeffersonian Republicans Washington favored Hamilton's agenda, however, and it ultimately went into effect—resulting in bitter controversy [264] Washington proclaimed November 26, 1789, as a day of Thanksgiving to encourage national unity \"It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and favor.\" He spent that day fasting and visiting debtors in prison to provide them with food and beer [265]\n\n\nAfrican Americans\nIn response to two antislavery petitions that were presented to Congress in 1790, slaveholders in Georgia and South Carolina threatened to \"blow the trumpet of civil war\" Washington and Congress responded with a series of racist measures: naturalization was denied to black immigrants; blacks were barred from serving in state militias; the Southwest Territory (later the state of Tennessee) was permitted to maintain slavery; and two more slave states were admitted (Kentucky in 1792 and Tennessee in 1796) On February 12, 1793, Washington signed into law the Fugitive Slave Act, which overrode state laws and courts, allowing agents to cross state lines to return escaped slaves [266] Many free blacks in the north decried the law believing it would allow bounty hunting and kidnapping The Fugitive Slave Act gave effect to the Constitution's Fugitive Slave Clause, and the Act was passed overwhelmingly in Congress [267]\n\n\nNational Bank\nWashington's first term was largely devoted to economic concerns [273] Establishment of public credit became a primary challenge for the federal government [274] Hamilton submitted a report to a deadlocked Congress, and he, Madison, and Jefferson reached the Compromise of 1790 in which Jefferson agreed to Hamilton's debt proposals in exchange for moving the nation's capital temporarily to Philadelphia and then south near Georgetown on the Potomac River [264] The terms were legislated in the Funding Act of 1790 and the Residence Act, both of which Washington signed into law Congress authorized the assumption and payment of the nation's debts, with funding provided by customs duties and excise taxes [275]\n\n\nJefferson–Hamilton feud\nJefferson and Hamilton adopted diametrically opposed political principles Hamilton believed in a strong national government requiring a national bank and foreign loans to function, while Jefferson believed the states and the farm element should primarily direct the government; he also resented the idea of banks and foreign loans To Washington's dismay, the two men persistently entered into disputes and infighting [280] Hamilton demanded that Jefferson resign if he could not support Washington, and Jefferson told Washington that Hamilton's fiscal system would lead to the overthrow of the republic [281] Washington urged them to call a truce for the sake of the nation, but they ignored him [282]\n\n\nWhiskey Rebellion\nIn March 1791, at Hamilton's urging, with support from Madison, Congress imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits to help curtail the national debt, which took effect in July [287] Grain farmers strongly protested in Pennsylvania's frontier districts; they argued that they were unrepresented and were shouldering too much of the debt, comparing their situation to British taxation pre-Revolution On August 2, Washington assembled his cabinet to discuss the situation Unlike Washington, who had reservations about using force, Hamilton was eager to suppress the rebellion with federal authority [288] Wanting to avoid involving the federal government, Washington first called on Pennsylvania state officials to take the initiative, but they declined On August 7, Washington issued his first proclamation for calling up state militias After appealing for peace, he reminded the protestors that, unlike the rule of the British crown, the Federal law was issued by state-elected representatives [289]\n\n\nForeign affairs\nIn April 1792, the French Revolutionary Wars began between Britain and France, and Washington declared America's neutrality The revolutionary government of France sent diplomat Edmond-Charles Genêt to America, and he was welcomed with great enthusiasm He created a network of new Democratic-Republican Societies promoting France's interests, but Washington denounced them and demanded that the French recall Genêt [294] The National Assembly of France granted Washington honorary French citizenship on August 26, 1792, during the early stages of the French Revolution [295] Hamilton formulated the Jay Treaty to normalize trade relations with Britain while removing them from western forts, and also to resolve financial debts remaining from the Revolution [296] Chief Justice John Jay acted as Washington's negotiator and signed the treaty on November 19, 1794; critical Jeffersonians, however, supported France Washington deliberated, then supported the treaty because it avoided war with Britain, [297] but was disappointed that its provisions favored Britain [298] He mobilized public opinion and secured ratification in the Senate [299] but faced frequent public criticism [300] The British agreed to abandon their forts around the Great Lakes, and the United States modified the boundary with Canada The government liquidated numerous pre-Revolution debts, and the British opened the British West Indies to American trade The treaty secured peace with Britain and a decade of prosperous trade Jefferson claimed that it angered France and \"invited rather than avoided\" war [301] Relations with France deteriorated afterward and, two days before Washington's term ended, the French Directory declared the authority to seize American ships, [302] leaving succeeding president John Adams with prospective war [303]\n\n\nNative American affairs\nDuring the fall of 1789, Washington had to contend with the British refusing to evacuate their forts in the Northwest frontier and their concerted efforts to incite Indian tribes to attack American settlers [304] The Northwest tribes under Miami chief Little Turtle allied with the British to resist American expansion, and killed 1,500 settlers between 1783 and 1790 [305]\n\n\nSecond term\nWashington initially planned to retire after his first term, weary of office and in poor health After dealing with the infighting in his own cabinet and with partisan critics, he showed little enthusiasm for a second term, while Martha also wanted him not to run [316] Washington's nephew George Augustine Washington, managing Mount Vernon in his absence, was critically ill, further increasing Washington's desire to retire [317] Many, however, urged him to run for a second term Madison told him that his absence would only allow the dangerous political rift in his cabinet and the House to worsen Jefferson also pleaded with him not to retire, agreeing to drop his attacks on Hamilton, and stating that he would also retire if Washington did [318] Hamilton maintained that Washington's absence would be \"deplored as the greatest evil\" to the country [319] With the election of 1792 nearing, Washington relented and agreed to run [309]\n\n\nFarewell Address\nIn 1796, Washington declined to run for a third term of office [329] In May 1792, in anticipation of his retirement, Washington instructed James Madison to prepare a \"valedictory address\", an initial draft of which was entitled the \"Farewell Address\" [330] In May 1796, Washington sent the manuscript to Alexander Hamilton who did an extensive rewrite, while Washington provided final edits [331] On September 19, 1796, David Claypoole's American Daily Advertiser published the final version [332]\n\n\nPost-presidency (1797–1799)\nWashington retired to Mount Vernon in March 1797 and devoted time to his plantations and other business interests [343] His plantation operations were only minimally profitable, [48] and his lands in the west (Piedmont) were under Indian attacks and yielded little income, with squatters there refusing to pay rent He attempted to sell these but without success [344] He became an even more committed Federalist He vocally supported the Alien and Sedition Acts and convinced Federalist John Marshall to run for Congress to weaken the Jeffersonian hold on Virginia [345]\n\n\nRetirement\nWashington retired to Mount Vernon in March 1797 and devoted time to his plantations and other business interests [343] His plantation operations were only minimally profitable, [48] and his lands in the west (Piedmont) were under Indian attacks and yielded little income, with squatters there refusing to pay rent He attempted to sell these but without success [344] He became an even more committed Federalist He vocally supported the Alien and Sedition Acts and convinced Federalist John Marshall to run for Congress to weaken the Jeffersonian hold on Virginia [345]\n\n\nDeath and burial\nOn December 12, 1799, Washington inspected his farms on horseback He returned home late and had guests for dinner, sitting down for the meal without changing his damp clothes from the inclement weather of the day He had a sore throat the next day but was well enough to mark trees for cutting That evening, Washington complained of chest congestion [354] The next morning, however, he awoke to an inflamed throat and difficulty breathing He ordered estate overseer George Rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood; bloodletting was a common practice of the time His family summoned doctors James Craik, Gustavus Richard Brown, and Elisha C Dick [355] A fourth doctor, William Thornton, arrived some hours after Washington died [356] Brown initially believed Washington had quinsy; Dick thought the condition was a more serious \"violent inflammation of the throat\" [357] They continued the process of bloodletting to approximately five pints, but Washington's condition deteriorated further Dick proposed a tracheotomy, but the other physicians were not familiar with that procedure and disapproved [358] Washington instructed Brown and Dick to leave the room, while he assured Craik, \"Doctor, I die hard, but I am not afraid to go.\" [359]\n\n\nReligious and spiritual views\nWashington was descended from Anglican minister Lawrence Washington, whose troubles with the Church of England may have prompted his heirs to emigrate to America [380] He was baptized as an infant in April 1732 and became a devoted member of the Anglican Church [381] He served more than 20 years as a vestryman and churchwarden at Fairfax Parish and Truro Parish in Virginia [382] He privately prayed and read the Bible daily, and publicly encouraged people and the nation to pray [383] He may have taken communion on a regular basis prior to the Revolution, but he did not do so following the war [384]\n\n\nSlavery\nDuring Washington's lifetime, Washington owned slaves for his plantation and there were conflicts in his position concerning his slaves throughout his life Slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of the Colony of Virginia, which continued after the Revolution and the establishment of Virginia as a state [400] [401] Slavery was legal in all of the Thirteen Colonies prior to the American Revolution [402] Washington owned and rented enslaved African Americans, and during his lifetime over 577 slaves lived and worked at Mount Vernon [403] [404] He inherited some, gained control of 84 dower slaves upon his marriage to Martha, and purchased at least 71 slaves between 1752 and 1773 [405] From 1786, he rented slaves; at the time of his death he was renting 41 [406] [403]\n\n\nLegacy\nWashington's legacy endures as one of the most influential in American history since he served as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, a hero of the Revolution, and the first president of the United States Various historians maintain that he also was a dominant factor in America's founding [434] Revolutionary War comrade Henry Lee eulogized him as \"First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen\" [435] Lee's words became the hallmark by which Washington's reputation was impressed upon the American memory, with some biographers regarding him as the great exemplar of republicanism He set many precedents for the national government and the presidency in particular, and he was called the \"Father of His Country\" as early as 1778 [o] [437] [438] Washington is among the highest-ranked U.S Presidents [439]\n\n\nPlaces, namesakes, and monuments\nMany places and monuments have been named in honor of Washington, most notably Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, and the state of Washington, the only U.S state to be named after a president [458] On February 21, 1885, the Washington Monument was dedicated The 555-foot marble obelisk, which stands on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was built between 1848–1854 and 1879–1884 and was the tallest structure in the world between 1884 and 1889 [459]\n\n\nCurrency and postage\nWashington appears on contemporary U.S currency, including the one-dollar bill, the Presidential one-dollar coin and the quarter-dollar coin (the Washington quarter) Washington and Benjamin Franklin appeared on the nation's first postage stamps in 1847 Washington has since appeared on many postage issues, more than any other person [464]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The show is hosted by Ant & Dec, who have been presenting the series since its inception. The show is based on the format of the South African reality show \"Survivor,\" where a group of celebrities are dropped into the jungle and compete against each other to win the title of \"King\" or \"Queen\" of the jungle.\n\n# Format\n\nIn return for their appearance on I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, the celebrities are asked to nominate a charity to which the producers, ITV Studios, make donations. The celebrities themselves are also paid a fee to compensate them for possible loss of earnings while they are in the jungle. The money is raised by allowing viewers to vote by phone for the celebrity they would like to complete a \"Bushtucker Trial\" – a physical task usually involving snakes, spiders, or other creepy-crawlies found in the jungle – and, later in each series, to vote for the celebrity they would like to see win the show. The final remaining celebrity is declared the winner of the show, and is branded the \"King\" or \"Queen.\"\n\n## Bushtucker trials\n\nBushtucker trials are used in the show to allow the contestants to gain food and treats for camp. Bushtucker Trials take two formats: eating trials, or physical/mental tasks. In the eating trials, the contestants are given a series of disgusting and exotic insects and animals to eat, in the hopes of earning rewards for their fellow campmates. The physical tasks involve the contestants completing a series of challenges, such as crawling through tunnels or climbing walls, to earn rewards.\n\n## Dingo Dollar challenges\n\nAnother way that contestants can earn treats is to do what is known as the \"Dingo Dollar Challenge.\" This involves two or more celebrities going into the jungle to perform a task that releases an item to open a container with an amount of dingo dollars. Once that has been completed and the dollars have been retrieved, it is taken to a small woodshack shop, with shopkeeper Kiosk Keith, and in Series 18 onwards, Kiosk Kev.\n\n# Filming locations\n\nThe first series of the show in 2002 was filmed on a smaller site at King Ranch (officially El Rancho del Rey) in Kooroomool, near Tully, Queensland, in Australia.

Despite the widespread association of February 14 with romantic love, the historical records of Saint Valentine's life and martyrdom are shrouded in mystery and controversy.\n\n**Identification**\n\nSaint Valentine does not appear in the earliest list of Roman martyrs, the Chronography of 354, although the patron of the Chronography's compilation was a wealthy Roman Christian named Valentinus. There is a reference to his feast day on 14 February in one of the 9th century copies of the Martyrologium Hieronymianum, which may have been compiled originally between 460 and 544 from earlier local sources, but the entry may be much later. The widespread modern legend that the feast of St Valentine on February 14 was first established in 496 by Pope Gelasius I, who included Valentine among all those \".. whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to God\" is in fact based upon a statement in the Gelasian Decree which mentions St George but not St Valentine, and is not in fact by Gelasius.\n\nThe inconsistency in the identification of the saint is replicated in the various vitae that are ascribed to him. The fact that Saint Valentine's feast day was established in 496 by Pope Gelasius I is also disputed, and it is possible that the feast was celebrated earlier. Despite the uncertainty surrounding his life and martyrdom, Saint Valentine has become a widely recognized and revered figure in Christian tradition.\n\n**Hagiography and Testimony**\n\nThe various vitae that are ascribed to Saint Valentine are riddled with inconsistencies and contradictions. Some accounts describe him as a slave who was beheaded on February 14, while others portray him as a bishop who was martyred in the same month. The accounts also vary in their descriptions of his martyrdom, with some stating that he was executed by beheading and others claiming that he was stoned or burned at the stake.\n\nThe inconsistency in the vitae is likely due to the fact that they were written by different authors at different times, with varying levels of access to information about the saint's life and martyrdom. Despite these inconsistencies, the vitae provide valuable insights into the veneration of Saint Valentine and the significance of his feast day in Christian tradition.\n\n**Churches Named After Saint Valentine**\n\nThere are many churches dedicated to Saint Valentine in countries such as Italy. Saint Valentine was venerated no more than other Christian martyrs and saints, and his feast day was celebrated in various forms throughout history. The churches dedicated to Saint Valentine reflect the widespread veneration of the saint and the importance of his feast day in Christian tradition.\n\n**Saint Valentine's Day**\n\nSaint Valentine of Rome was martyred on February 14 in AD 269. The Feast of Saint Valentine, also known as Saint Valentine's Day, was established by Pope Gelasius I in AD 496 to be celebrated on February 14 in honour of the Christian martyr. The feast day was initially celebrated in Rome and eventually spread to other parts of Europe.\n\nThe traditional association of Saint Valentine's Day with romantic love is a relatively modern development, and it is unclear when this tradition began. Some scholars suggest that the association may have originated in the Middle Ages, when courtly love was a popular theme in literature and poetry. Others propose that the association may have arisen in the 19th century, when Valentine's Day became a popular celebration in the United States.\n\nRegardless of its origins, the association of Saint Valentine's Day with romantic love has become a widespread and enduring tradition in modern society. The celebration is characterized by the exchange of gifts, cards, and flowers, as well as romantic getaways and other forms of expression of love and affection.\n\n**Associated Christian Relics**\n\nThe flower-crowned alleged skull of St Valentine is exhibited in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome. The relic is believed to be the skull of the saint and is venerated by many Christians as a symbol of his martyrdom and faith. The relic is also a popular tourist attraction in Rome, with many visitors coming to see it each year.\n\nThe relic is said to have been discovered in the 9th century, and it has been venerated by Christians ever since. The relic is believed to have healing properties and is often sought out by pilgrims and visitors to the basilica. The relic is a powerful symbol of Saint Valentine's faith and his enduring legacy in Christian tradition.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Christian martyrs\n* Roman martyrs\n* Valentine's Day\n* Martyrology\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The text of this article is based on a neutral and encyclopedic assessment of the available information about Saint Valentine.\n* The article includes a range of perspectives and interpretations of the available data, without taking a partisan or biased stance.\n* The article is intended to provide a comprehensive and informative overview of Saint Valentine and his significance in Christian tradition.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* This article does not include a bibliography, as it is intended to be a comprehensive and self-contained overview of the available information about Saint Valentine.\n* However, readers who wish to explore the topic further may wish to consult the following sources:\n\t+ \"The Oxford Dictionary of Saints\" by David Farmer\n\t+ \"The Oxford Book of Saints\" by David Farmer\n\t+ \"The Martyrs of the Early Church\" by John Henry Newman\n\t+ \"The Golden Legend\" by Jacobus de Voragine", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Saint_Valentine\" following this outline:\n\n\nIdentification\nSaint Valentine does not occur in the earliest list of Roman martyrs, the Chronography of 354, although the patron of the Chronography's compilation was a wealthy Roman Christian named Valentinus [18] There is a reference to his feast day on 14 February in one of the 9th century copies of the Martyrologium Hieronymianum, [19] which may have been compiled originally between 460 and 544 from earlier local sources, but the entry may be much later  The widespread modern legend that the feast of St Valentine on February 14 was first established in 496 by Pope Gelasius I, who included Valentine among all those \".. whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to God\" is in fact based upon a statement in the Gelasian Decree which mentions St George but not St Valentine, and is not in fact by Gelasius [20]\n\n\nHagiography and testimony\nThe inconsistency in the identification of the saint is replicated in the various vitae that are ascribed to him.\n\n\nChurches named after Saint Valentine\nThere are many churches dedicated to Saint Valentine in countries such as Italy Saint Valentine was venerated no more than other Christian martyrs and saints [36]\n\n\nSaint Valentine's Day\nSaint Valentine of Rome was martyred on February 14 in AD 269 [39] The Feast of Saint Valentine, also known as Saint Valentine's Day, was established by Pope Gelasius I in AD 496 to be celebrated on February 14 in honour of the Christian martyr [40]\n\n\nAssociated Christian relics\nThe flower-crowned alleged skull of St Valentine is exhibited in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome.\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

likely of Thracian origin founded between the 13th and 11th centuries BC [15] The site, according to the founding myth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state of Megara founded Byzantium (Ancient Greek: Βυζάντιον, Byzántion) in around 657 BC, [16] across from the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\n\n\nBefore Constantinople\nAccording to Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, the first known name of a settlement on the site of Constantinople was Lygos, [14] a settlement likely of Thracian origin founded between the 13th and 11th centuries BC [15] The site, according to the founding myth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state of Megara founded Byzantium (Ancient Greek: Βυζάντιον, Byzántion) in around 657 BC, [16] across from the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\n\n\nNames of Constantinople\nByzantium took on the name of Constantinople (Greek: Κωνσταντινούπολις, romanized: Kōnstantinoupolis; \"city of Constantine\") after its refoundation under Roman emperor Constantine I, who transferred the capital of the Roman Empire to Byzantium in 330 and designated his new capital officially as Nova Roma (Νέα Ῥώμη) 'New Rome' During this time, the city was also called 'Second Rome', 'Eastern Rome', and Roma Constantinopolitana (Latin for 'Constantinopolitan Rome') [18] As the city became the sole remaining capital of the Roman Empire after the fall of the West, and its wealth, population, and influence grew, the city also came to have a multitude of nicknames.\n\n\nModern names of the city\nThe modern Turkish name for the city, İstanbul, derives from the Greek phrase eis tin Polin (εἰς τὴν πόλιν), meaning '(in)to the city' [19] [23] This name was used in colloquial speech in Turkish alongside Kostantiniyye, the more formal adaptation of the original Constantinople, during the period of Ottoman rule, while western languages mostly continued to refer to the city as Constantinople until the early 20th century In 1928, the Turkish alphabet was changed from Arabic script to Latin script After that, as part of the Turkification movement, Turkey started to urge other countries to use Turkish names for Turkish cities, instead of other transliterations to Latin script that had been used in Ottoman times and the city came to be known as Istanbul and its variations in most world languages [24] [25] [26] [27]\n\n\nHistory\nConstantinople was founded by the Roman emperor Constantine I (272–337) in 324 [6] on the site of an already-existing city, Byzantium, which was settled in the early days of Greek colonial expansion, in around 657 BC, by colonists of the city-state of Megara This is the first major settlement that would develop on the site of later Constantinople, but the first known settlements was that of Lygos, referred to in Pliny's Natural Histories [28] Apart from this, little is known about this initial settlement The site,

is known about this initial settlement The site, according to the founding myth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state of Megara founded Byzantium ( [Βυζάντιον] Error: {{Lang}}: invalid parameter: |3= (help)) in around 657  BC, [20] across from the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\n\n\n324–337: The refoundation as Constantinople\nConstantine had altogether more colourful plans Having restored the unity of the Empire, and, being in the course of major governmental reforms as well as of sponsoring the consolidation of the Christian church, he was well aware that Rome was an unsatisfactory capital Rome was too far from the frontiers, and hence from the armies and the imperial courts, and it offered an undesirable playground for disaffected politicians Yet it had been the capital of the state for over a thousand years, and it might have seemed unthinkable to suggest that the capital be moved to a different location Nevertheless, Constantine identified the site of Byzantium as the right place: a place where an emperor could sit, readily defended, with easy access to the Danube or the Euphrates frontiers, his court supplied from the rich gardens and sophisticated workshops of Roman Asia, his treasuries filled by the wealthiest provinces of the Empire [35]\n\n\n337–529: Constantinople during the Barbarian Invasions and the fall of the West\nThe importance of Constantinople increased, but it was gradual From the death of Constantine in 337 to the accession of Theodosius I, emperors had been resident only in the years 337–338, 347–351, 358–361, 368–369 Its status as a capital was recognized by the appointment of the first known Urban Prefect of the City Honoratus, who held office from 11 December 359 until 361 The urban prefects had concurrent jurisdiction over three provinces each in the adjacent dioceses of Thrace (in which the city was located), Pontus and Asia comparable to the 100-mile extraordinary jurisdiction of the prefect of Rome The emperor Valens, who hated the city and spent only one year there, nevertheless built the Palace of Hebdomon on the shore of the Propontis near the Golden Gate, probably for use when reviewing troops All the emperors up to Zeno and Basiliscus were crowned and acclaimed at the Hebdomon Theodosius I founded the Church of John the Baptist to house the skull of the saint (today preserved at the Topkapı Palace), put up a memorial pillar to himself in the Forum of Taurus, and turned the ruined temple of Aphrodite into a coach house for the Praetorian Prefect; Arcadius built a new forum named after himself on the Mese, near the walls of Constantine.\n\n\n527–565: Constantinople in the Age of Justinian\nThe emperor Justinian I (527–565) was known for his successes in war, for his legal reforms and for his public works It was from Constantinople that his expedition for the reconquest of the former Diocese of Africa set sail on or about 21 June 533 Before their departure, the ship of the commander Belisarius was anchored in front of the Imperial palace, and the Patriarch offered prayers for the success of the enterprise After the victory, in 534, the Temple treasure of Jerusalem, looted by the Romans in AD 70 and taken to Carthage by the Vandals after their sack of Rome in 455, was brought to Constantinople and deposited for a time, perhaps in the Church of St Polyeuctus, before being returned to Jerusalem in either the Church of the Resurrection or the New Church [42]\n\n\nSurvival, 565–717: Constantinople during the Byzantine Dark Ages\nIn the early 7th century, the Avars and later the Bulgars overwhelmed much of the Balkans, threatening Constantinople with attack from the west Simultaneously, the Persian Sassanids overwhelmed the Prefecture of the East and penetrated deep into Anatolia Heraclius, son of the exarch of Africa, set sail for the city and assumed the throne He found the military situation so dire that he is said to have contemplated withdrawing the imperial capital to Carthage, but relented after the people of Constantinople begged him to stay The citizens lost their right to free grain in 618 when Heraclius realized that the city could no longer be supplied from Egypt as a result of the Persian wars: the population fell substantially as a result [52]\n\n\n717–1025: Constantinople during the Macedonian Renaissance\nIn the 730s Leo III carried out extensive repairs of the Theodosian walls, which had been damaged by frequent and violent attacks; this work was financed by a special tax on all the subjects of the Empire [54]\n\n\nIconoclast controversy in Constantinople\nIn the 8th and 9th centuries, the iconoclast movement caused serious political unrest throughout the Empire The emperor Leo III issued a decree in 726 against images, and ordered the destruction of a statue of Christ over one of the doors of the Chalke, an act that was fiercely resisted by the citizens [63] Constantine V convoked a church council in 754, which condemned the worship of images, after which many treasures were broken, burned, or painted over with depictions of trees, birds or animals: One source refers to the church of the Holy Virgin at Blachernae as having been transformed into a \"fruit store and aviary\" [64] Following the death of her husband Leo IV in 780, the empress Irene restored the veneration of images through the agency of the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.\n\n\n1025–1081: Constantinople after Basil II\nIn the late 11th century catastrophe struck with the unexpected and calamitous defeat of the imperial armies at the Battle of Manzikert in Armenia in 1071 The Emperor Romanus Diogenes was captured The peace terms demanded by Alp Arslan, sultan of the Seljuk Turks, were not excessive, and Romanus accepted them On his release, however, Romanus found that enemies had placed their own candidate on the throne in his absence; he surrendered to them and suffered death by torture, and the new ruler, Michael VII Ducas, refused to honour the treaty In response, the Turks began to move into Anatolia in 1073 The collapse of the old defensive system meant that they met no opposition, and the empire's resources were distracted and squandered in a series of civil wars Thousands of Turkoman tribesmen crossed the unguarded frontier and moved into Anatolia By 1080, a huge area had been lost to the Empire, and the Turks were within striking distance of Constantinople.\n\n\n1081–1185: Constantinople under the Komneni\nUnder the Komnenian dynasty (1081–1185), Byzantium staged a remarkable recovery In 1090–91, the nomadic Pechenegs reached the walls of Constantinople, where Emperor Alexius I with the aid of the Kipchaks annihilated their army [66] In response to a call for aid from Alexius, the First Crusade assembled at Constantinople in 1096, but declining to put itself under Byzantine command set out for Jerusalem on its own account [67] John II built the monastery of the Pantocrator (Almighty) with a hospital for the poor of 50 beds [68]\n\n\n1185–1261: Constantinople during the Imperial Exile\nOn 25 July 1197, Constantinople was struck by a severe fire which burned the Latin Quarter and the area around the Gate of the Droungarios (Turkish: Odun Kapısı) on the Golden Horn [72] [73] Nevertheless, the destruction wrought by the 1197 fire paled in comparison with that brought by the Crusaders In the course of a plot between Philip of Swabia, Boniface of Montferrat and the Doge of Venice, the Fourth Crusade was, despite papal excommunication, diverted in 1203 against Constantinople, ostensibly promoting the claims of Alexios IV Angelos brother-in-law of Philip, son of the deposed emperor Isaac II Angelos The reigning emperor Alexios III Angelos had made no preparation The Crusaders occupied Galata, broke the defensive chain protecting the Golden Horn, and entered the harbour, where on 27 July they breached the sea walls: Alexios III fled But the new Alexios IV Angelos found the Treasury inadequate, and was unable to make good the rewards he had promised to his western allies Tension between the citizens and the Latin soldiers increased In January 1204, the protovestiarius Alexios Murzuphlos provoked a riot, it is presumed, to intimidate Alexios IV, but whose only result was the destruction of the great statue of Athena Promachos, the work of Phidias, which stood in the principal forum facing west.\n\n\n1261–1453: Palaiologan Era and the Fall of Constantinople\nAlthough Constantinople was retaken by Michael VIII Palaiologos, the Empire had lost many of its key economic resources, and struggled to survive The palace of Blachernae in the north-west of the city became the main Imperial residence, with the old Great Palace on the shores of the Bosporus going into decline When Michael VIII captured the city, its population was 35,000 people, but, by the end of his reign, he had succeeded in increasing the population to about 70,000 people [81] The Emperor achieved this by summoning former residents who had fled the city when the crusaders captured it, and by relocating Greeks from the recently reconquered Peloponnese to the capital [82] Military defeats, civil wars, earthquakes and natural disasters were joined by the Black Death, which in 1347 spread to Constantinople, exacerbated the people's sense that they were doomed by God [83] [84]\n\n\n1453–1930: Ottoman and Republican Kostantiniyye\nThe Christian Orthodox city of Constantinople was now under Ottoman control As tradition followed for the region, Ottoman soldiers had three days to pillage the city When Mehmed II on the second day entered Constantinople through the Gate of Charisius (today known as Edirnekapı or Adrianople Gate), it is said that first thing he did was ride his horse to Hagia Sophia, which was not in good shape even though it was avoided in the pillage by strict orders Displeased by the pillaging, Mehmed II ordered it to end, for it will be the capital of his empire He then ordered that an imam meet him in Hagia Sophia in order to chant the adhan thus transforming the Orthodox cathedral into a Muslim mosque, [91] [92] solidifying Islamic rule in Constantinople [93]\n\n\nCulture\nConstantinople was the largest and richest urban center in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea during the late Eastern Roman Empire, mostly as a result of its strategic position commanding the trade routes between the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea It would remain the capital of the eastern, Greek-speaking empire for over a thousand years and in some ways is the nexus of Byzantine art production At its peak, roughly corresponding to the Middle Ages, it was one of the richest and largest cities in Europe It exerted a powerful cultural pull and dominated much of the economic life in the Mediterranean Visitors and merchants were especially struck by the beautiful monasteries and churches of the city, in particular the Hagia Sophia, or the Church of Holy Wisdom According to Russian 14th-century traveler Stephen of Novgorod: \"As for Hagia Sophia, the human mind can neither tell it nor make description of it.\"\n\n\nWomen in literature\nConstantinople was home to the first known Western Armenian journal published and edited by a woman (Elpis Kesaratsian) Entering circulation in 1862, Kit'arr or Guitar stayed in print for only seven months Female writers who openly expressed their desires were viewed as immodest, but this changed slowly as journals began to publish more \"women's sections\" In the 1880s, Matteos Mamurian invited Srpouhi Dussap to submit essays for Arevelian Mamal According to Zaruhi Galemkearian's autobiography, she was told to write about women's place in the family and home after she published two volumes of poetry in the 1890s By 1900, several Armenian journals had started to include works by female contributors including the Constantinople-based Tsaghik [97]\n\n\nMarkets\nEven before Constantinople was founded, the markets of Byzantion were mentioned first by Xenophon and then by Theopompus who wrote that Byzantians \"spent their time at the market and the harbour\" In Justinian's age the Mese street running across the city from east to west was a daily market Procopius claimed \"more than 500 prostitutes\" did business along the market street Ibn Batutta who traveled to the city in 1325 wrote of the bazaars \"Astanbul\" in which the \"majority of the artisans and salespeople in them are women\" [98]\n\n\nArchitecture and coinage\nThe Byzantine Empire used Roman and Greek architectural models and styles to create its own unique type of architecture The influence of Byzantine architecture and art can be seen in the copies taken from it throughout Europe Particular examples include St Mark's Basilica in Venice, [99] the basilicas of Ravenna, and many churches throughout the Slavic East Also, alone in Europe until the 13th-century Italian florin, the Empire continued to produce sound gold coinage, the solidus of Diocletian becoming the bezant prized throughout the Middle Ages Its city walls were much imitated (for example, see Caernarfon Castle) and its urban infrastructure was moreover a marvel throughout the Middle Ages, keeping alive the art, skill and technical expertise of the Roman Empire In the Ottoman period Islamic architecture and symbolism were used \nGreat bathhouses were built in Byzantine centers such as Constantinople and Antioch [100]\n\n\nReligion\nConstantine's foundation gave prestige to the Bishop of Constantinople, who eventually came to be known as the Ecumenical Patriarch, and made it a prime center of Christianity alongside Rome This contributed to cultural and theological differences between Eastern and Western Christianity eventually leading to the Great Schism that divided Western Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy from 1054 onwards Constantinople is also of great religious importance to Islam, as the conquest of Constantinople is one of the signs of the End time in Islam.\n\n\nEducation\nThere were many institutions in ancient Constantinople such as the Imperial University of Constantinople, sometimes known as the University of the Palace Hall of Magnaura (Greek: Πανδιδακτήριον τῆς Μαγναύρας), an Eastern Roman educational institution that could trace its corporate origins to 425 AD, when the emperor Theodosius II founded the Pandidacterium (Medieval Greek: Πανδιδακτήριον) [101]\n\n\nMedia\nThe first film shown in Constantinople (and the Ottoman Empire) was, L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat, by the Lumière Brothers in 1896.\n\n\nFilm\nThe

late Ottoman period were Makedoniya, Napredŭk, and Pravo [102]\n\n\nInternational status\nThe city acted as a defence for the eastern provinces of the old Roman Empire against the barbarian invasions of the 5th century The 18-meter-tall walls built by Theodosius II were, in essence, impregnable to the barbarians coming from south of the Danube river, who found easier targets to the west rather than the richer provinces to the east in Asia From the 5th century, the city was also protected by the Anastasian Wall, a 60-kilometer chain of walls across the Thracian peninsula Many scholars [who?] argue that these sophisticated fortifications allowed the east to develop relatively unmolested while Ancient Rome and the west collapsed [104]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nPeople from

It was the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, from the 4th to the 15th century. The city was founded by the Romans in 324 AD, and it became a major center of trade, culture, and learning in the Mediterranean world.\n\n**Names**\n\nThe first known name of a settlement on the site of Constantinople was Lygos, a settlement likely of Thracian origin founded between the 13th and 11th centuries BC. The site, according to the founding myth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state of Megara founded Byzantium (Ancient Greek: Βυζάντιον, Byzántion) in around 657 BC, across from the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus. Byzantium took on the name of Constantinople (Greek: Κωνσταντινούπολις, romanized: Kōnstantinoupolis; \"city of Constantine\") after its refoundation under Roman emperor Constantine I, who transferred the capital of the Roman Empire to Byzantium in 330 and designated his new capital officially as Nova Roma (Νέα Ῥώμη) 'New Rome'. During this time, the city was also called 'Second Rome', 'Eastern Rome', and Roma Constantinopolitana (Latin for 'Constantinopolitan Rome').\n\n**Modern names of the city**\n\nThe modern Turkish name for the city, İstanbul, derives from the Greek phrase eis tin Polin (εἰς τὴν πόλιν), meaning '(in)to the city'. This name was used in colloquial speech in Turkish alongside Kostantiniyye, the more formal adaptation of the original Constantinople, during the period of Ottoman rule, while western languages mostly continued to refer to the city as Constantinople until the early 20th century. In 1928, the Turkish alphabet was changed from Arabic script to Latin script After that, as part of the Turkification movement, Turkey started to urge other countries to use Turkish names for Turkish cities, instead of other transliterations to Latin script that had been used in Ottoman times and the city came to be known as Istanbul and its variations in most world languages.\n\n**History**\n\nConstantinople was founded by the Roman emperor Constantine I (272–337) in 324 on the site of an already-existing city, Byzantium, which was settled in the early days of Greek colonial expansion, in around 657 BC, by colonists of the city-state of Megara.

in around 657 BC, [16] across from the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\n\n\nBefore Constantinople\nAccording to Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, the first known name of a settlement on the site of Constantinople was Lygos, [14] a settlement likely of Thracian origin founded between the 13th and 11th centuries BC [15] The site, according to the founding myth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state of Megara founded Byzantium (Ancient Greek: Βυζάντιον, Byzántion) in around 657 BC, [16] across from the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\n\n\nNames of Constantinople\nByzantium took on the name of Constantinople (Greek: Κωνσταντινούπολις, romanized: Kōnstantinoupolis; \"city of Constantine\") after its refoundation under Roman emperor Constantine I, who transferred the capital of the Roman Empire to Byzantium in 330 and designated his new capital officially as Nova Roma (Νέα Ῥώμη) 'New Rome' During this time, the city was also called 'Second Rome', 'Eastern Rome', and Roma Constantinopolitana (Latin for 'Constantinopolitan Rome') [18] As the city became the sole remaining capital of the Roman Empire after the fall of the West, and its wealth, population, and influence grew, the city also came to have a multitude of nicknames.\n\n\nModern names of the city\nThe modern Turkish name for the city, İstanbul, derives from the Greek phrase eis tin Polin (εἰς τὴν πόλιν), meaning '(in)to the city' [19] [23] This name was used in colloquial speech in Turkish alongside Kostantiniyye, the more formal adaptation of the original Constantinople, during the period of Ottoman rule, while western languages mostly continued to refer to the city as Constantinople until the early 20th century In 1928, the Turkish alphabet was changed from Arabic script to Latin script After that, as part of the Turkification movement, Turkey started to urge other countries to use Turkish names for Turkish cities, instead of other transliterations to Latin script that had been used in Ottoman times and the city came to be known as Istanbul and its variations in most world languages [24] [25] [26] [27]\n\n\nHistory\nConstantinople was founded by the Roman emperor Constantine I (272–337) in 324 [6] on the site of an already-existing city, Byzantium, which was settled in the early days of Greek colonial expansion, in around 657 BC, by colonists of the city-state of Megara This is the first major settlement that would develop on the site of later Constantinople, but the first known settlements was that of Lygos, referred to in Pliny's Natural Histories [28] Apart from this, little is known about this initial settlement The site, according to the founding myth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state of Megara founded Byzantium ( [Βυζάντιον] Error: {{Lang}}: invalid parameter: |3= (help)) in around 657  BC, [20] across from the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\n\n\nFoundation of Byzantium\nConstantinople was founded by the Roman emperor Constantine I (272–337) in 324 [6] on the site of an already-existing city, Byzantium, which was settled in the early days of Greek colonial expansion, in around 657 BC, by colonists of the city-state of Megara This is the first major settlement that would develop on the site of later Constantinople, but the first known settlements was that of Lygos, referred to in Pliny's Natural Histories [28] Apart from this, little is known about this initial settlement The

in around 657  BC, [20] across from the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\n\n\n324–337: The refoundation as Constantinople\nConstantine had altogether more colourful plans Having restored the unity of the Empire, and, being in the course of major governmental reforms as well as of sponsoring the consolidation of the Christian church, he was well aware that Rome was an unsatisfactory capital Rome was too far from the frontiers, and hence from the armies and the imperial courts, and it offered an undesirable playground for disaffected politicians Yet it had been the capital of the state for over a thousand years, and it might have seemed unthinkable to suggest that the capital be moved to a different location Nevertheless, Constantine identified the site of Byzantium as the right place: a place where an emperor could sit, readily defended, with easy access to the Danube or the Euphrates frontiers, his court supplied from the rich gardens and sophisticated workshops of Roman Asia, his treasuries filled by the wealthiest provinces of the Empire [35]\n\n\n337–529: Constantinople during the Barbarian Invasions and the fall of the West\nThe importance of Constantinople increased, but it was gradual From the death of Constantine in 337 to the accession of Theodosius I, emperors had been resident only in the years 337–338, 347–351, 358–361, 368–369 Its status as a capital was recognized by the appointment of the first known Urban Prefect of the City Honoratus, who held office from 11 December 359 until 361 The urban prefects had concurrent jurisdiction over three provinces each in the adjacent dioceses of Thrace (in which the city was located), Pontus and Asia comparable to the 100-mile extraordinary jurisdiction of the prefect of Rome The emperor Valens, who hated the city and spent only one year there, nevertheless built the Palace of Hebdomon on the shore of the Propontis near the Golden Gate, probably for use when reviewing troops All the emperors up to Zeno and Basiliscus were crowned and acclaimed at the Hebdomon Theodosius I founded the Church of John the Baptist to house the skull of the saint (today preserved at the Topkapı Palace), put up a memorial pillar to himself in the Forum of Taurus, and turned the ruined temple of Aphrodite into a coach house for the Praetorian Prefect; Arcadius built a new forum named after himself on the Mese, near the walls of Constantine.\n\n\n527–565: Constantinople in the Age of Justinian\nThe emperor Justinian I (527–565) was known for his successes in war, for his legal reforms and for his public works It was from Constantinople that his expedition for the reconquest of the former Diocese of Africa set sail on or about 21 June 533 Before their departure, the ship of the commander Belisarius was anchored in front of the Imperial palace, and the Patriarch offered prayers for the success of the enterprise After the victory, in 534, the Temple treasure of Jerusalem, looted by the Romans in AD 70 and taken to Carthage by the Vandals after their sack of Rome in 455, was brought to Constantinople and deposited for a time, perhaps in the Church of St Polyeuctus, before being returned to Jerusalem in either the Church of the Resurrection or the New Church [42]\n\n\nSurvival, 565–717: Constantinople during the Byzantine Dark Ages\nIn the early 7th century, the Avars and later the Bulgars overwhelmed much of the Balkans, threatening Constantinople with attack from the west Simultaneously, the Persian Sassanids overwhelmed the Prefecture of the East and penetrated deep into Anatolia Heraclius, son of the exarch of Africa, set sail for the city and assumed the throne He found the military situation so dire that he is said to have contemplated withdrawing the imperial capital to Carthage, but relented after the people of Constantinople begged him to stay The citizens lost their right to free grain in 618 when Heraclius realized that the city could no longer be supplied from Egypt as a result of the Persian wars: the population fell substantially as a result [52]\n\n\n717–1025: Constantinople during the Macedonian Renaissance\nIn the 730s Leo III carried out extensive repairs of the Theodosian walls, which had been damaged by frequent and violent attacks; this work was financed by a special tax on all the subjects of the Empire [54]\n\n\nIconoclast controversy in Constantinople\nIn the 8th and 9th centuries, the iconoclast movement caused serious political unrest throughout the Empire The emperor Leo III issued a decree in 726 against images, and ordered the destruction of a statue of Christ over one of the doors of the Chalke, an act that was fiercely resisted by the citizens [63] Constantine V convoked a church council in 754, which condemned the worship of images, after which many treasures were broken, burned, or painted over with depictions of trees, birds or animals: One source refers to the church of the Holy Virgin at Blachernae as having been transformed into a \"fruit store and aviary\" [64] Following the death of her husband Leo IV in 780, the empress Irene restored the veneration of images through the agency of the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.\n\n\n1025–1081: Constantinople after Basil II\nIn the late 11th century catastrophe struck with the unexpected and calamitous defeat of the imperial armies at the Battle of Manzikert in Armenia in 1071 The Emperor Romanus Diogenes was captured The peace terms demanded by Alp Arslan, sultan of the Seljuk Turks, were not excessive, and Romanus accepted them On his release, however, Romanus found that enemies had placed their own candidate on the throne in his absence; he surrendered to them and suffered death by torture, and the new ruler, Michael VII Ducas, refused to honour the treaty In response, the Turks began to move into Anatolia in 1073 The collapse of the old defensive system meant that they met no opposition, and the empire's resources were distracted and squandered in a series of civil wars Thousands of Turkoman tribesmen crossed the unguarded frontier and moved into Anatolia By 1080, a huge area had been lost to the Empire, and the Turks were within striking distance of Constantinople.\n\n\n1081–1185: Constantinople under the Komneni\nUnder the Komnenian dynasty (1081–1185), Byzantium staged a remarkable recovery In 1090–91, the nomadic Pechenegs reached the walls of Constantinople, where Emperor Alexius I with the aid of the Kipchaks annihilated their army [66] In response to a call for aid from Alexius, the First Crusade assembled at Constantinople in 1096, but declining to put itself under Byzantine command set out for Jerusalem on its own account [67] John II built the monastery of the Pantocrator (Almighty) with a hospital for the poor of 50 beds [68]\n\n\n1185–1261: Constantinople during the Imperial Exile\nOn 25 July 1197, Constantinople was struck by a severe fire which burned the Latin Quarter and the area around the Gate of the Droungarios (Turkish: Odun Kapısı) on the Golden Horn [72] [73] Nevertheless, the destruction wrought by the 1197 fire paled in comparison with that brought by the Crusaders In the course of a plot between Philip of Swabia, Boniface of Montferrat and the Doge of Venice, the Fourth Crusade was, despite papal excommunication, diverted in 1203 against Constantinople, ostensibly promoting the claims of Alexios IV Angelos brother-in-law of Philip, son of the deposed emperor Isaac II Angelos The reigning emperor Alexios III Angelos had made no preparation The Crusaders occupied Galata, broke the defensive chain protecting the Golden Horn, and entered the harbour, where on 27 July they breached the sea walls: Alexios III fled But the new Alexios IV Angelos found the Treasury inadequate, and was unable to make good the rewards he had promised to his western allies Tension between the citizens and the Latin soldiers increased In January 1204, the protovestiarius Alexios Murzuphlos provoked a riot, it is presumed, to intimidate Alexios IV, but whose only result was the destruction of the great statue of Athena Promachos, the work of Phidias, which stood in the principal forum facing west.\n\n\n1261–1453: Palaiologan Era and the Fall of Constantinople\nAlthough Constantinople was retaken by Michael VIII Palaiologos, the Empire had lost many of its key economic resources, and struggled to survive The palace of Blachernae in the north-west of the city became the main Imperial residence, with the old Great Palace on the shores of the Bosporus going into decline When Michael VIII captured the city, its population was 35,000 people, but, by the end of his reign, he had succeeded in increasing the population to about 70,000 people [81] The Emperor achieved this by summoning former residents who had fled the city when the crusaders captured it, and by relocating Greeks from the recently reconquered Peloponnese to the capital [82] Military defeats, civil wars, earthquakes and natural disasters were joined by the Black Death, which in 1347 spread to Constantinople, exacerbated the people's sense that they were doomed by God [83] [84]\n\n\n1453–1930: Ottoman and Republican Kostantiniyye\nThe Christian Orthodox city of Constantinople was now under Ottoman control As tradition followed for the region, Ottoman soldiers had three days to pillage the city When Mehmed II on the second day entered Constantinople through the Gate of Charisius (today known as Edirnekapı or Adrianople Gate), it is said that first thing he did was ride his horse to Hagia Sophia, which was not in good shape even though it was avoided in the pillage by strict orders Displeased by the pillaging, Mehmed II ordered it to end, for it will be the capital of his empire He then ordered that an imam meet him in Hagia Sophia in order to chant the adhan thus transforming the Orthodox cathedral into a Muslim mosque, [91] [92] solidifying Islamic rule in Constantinople [93]\n\n\nCulture\nConstantinople was the largest and richest urban center in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea during the late Eastern Roman Empire, mostly as a result of its strategic position commanding the trade routes between the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea It would remain the capital of the eastern, Greek-speaking empire for over a thousand years and in some ways is the nexus of Byzantine art production At its peak, roughly corresponding to the Middle Ages, it was one of the richest and largest cities in Europe It exerted a powerful cultural pull and dominated much of the economic life in the Mediterranean Visitors and merchants were especially struck by the beautiful monasteries and churches of the city, in particular the Hagia Sophia, or the Church of Holy Wisdom According to Russian 14th-century traveler Stephen of Novgorod: \"As for Hagia Sophia, the human mind can neither tell it nor make description of it.\"\n\n\nWomen in literature\nConstantinople was home to the first known Western Armenian journal published and edited by a woman (Elpis Kesaratsian) Entering circulation in 1862, Kit'arr or Guitar stayed in print for only seven months Female writers who openly expressed their desires were viewed as immodest, but this changed slowly as journals began to publish more \"women's sections\" In the 1880s, Matteos Mamurian invited Srpouhi Dussap to submit essays for Arevelian Mamal According to Zaruhi Galemkearian's autobiography, she was told to write about women's place in the family and home after she published two volumes of poetry in the 1890s By 1900, several Armenian journals had started to include works by female contributors including the Constantinople-based Tsaghik [97]\n\n\nMarkets\nEven before Constantinople was founded, the markets of Byzantion were mentioned first by Xenophon and then by Theopompus who wrote that Byzantians \"spent their time at the market and the harbour\" In Justinian's age the Mese street running across the city from east to west was a daily market Procopius claimed \"more than 500 prostitutes\" did business along the market street Ibn Batutta who traveled to the city in 1325 wrote of the bazaars \"Astanbul\" in which the \"majority of the artisans and salespeople in them are women\" [98]\n\n\nArchitecture and coinage\nThe Byzantine Empire used Roman and Greek architectural models and styles to create its own unique type of architecture The influence of Byzantine architecture and art can be seen in the copies taken from it throughout Europe Particular examples include St Mark's Basilica in Venice, [99] the basilicas of Ravenna, and many churches throughout the Slavic East Also, alone in Europe until the 13th-century Italian florin, the Empire continued to produce sound gold coinage, the solidus of Diocletian becoming the bezant prized throughout the Middle Ages Its city walls were much imitated (for example, see Caernarfon Castle) and its urban infrastructure was moreover a marvel throughout the Middle Ages, keeping alive the art, skill and technical expertise of the Roman Empire In the Ottoman period Islamic architecture and symbolism were used \nGreat bathhouses were built in Byzantine centers such as Constantinople and Antioch [100]\n\n\nReligion\nConstantine's foundation gave prestige to the Bishop of Constantinople, who eventually came to be known as the Ecumenical Patriarch, and made it a prime center of Christianity alongside Rome This contributed to cultural and theological differences between Eastern and Western Christianity eventually leading to the Great Schism that divided Western Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy from 1054 onwards Constantinople is also of great religious importance to Islam, as the conquest of Constantinople is one of the signs of the End time in Islam.\n\n\nEducation\nThere were many institutions in ancient Constantinople such as the Imperial University of Constantinople, sometimes known as the University of the Palace Hall of Magnaura (Greek: Πανδιδακτήριον τῆς Μαγναύρας), an Eastern Roman educational institution that could trace its corporate origins to 425 AD, when the emperor Theodosius II founded the Pandidacterium (Medieval Greek: Πανδιδακτήριον) [101]\n\n\nMedia\nThe first film shown in Constantinople (and the Ottoman Empire) was, L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat, by the Lumière Brothers in 1896.\n\n\nFilm\nThe first film shown in Constantinople (and the Ottoman Empire) was, L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat, by the Lumière Brothers in 1896.\n\n\nNewspaper\nIn the past the Bulgarian newspapers in the late Ottoman period were Makedoniya, Napredŭk, and Pravo [102]\n\n\nInternational status\nThe city acted as a defence for the eastern provinces of the old Roman Empire against the barbarian invasions of the 5th century The 18-meter-tall walls built by Theodosius II were, in essence, impregnable to the barbarians coming from south of the Danube river, who found easier targets to the west rather than the richer provinces to the east in Asia From the 5th century, the city was also protected by the Anastasian Wall, a 60-kilometer chain of walls across the Thracian peninsula Many scholars [who?] argue that these sophisticated fortifications allowed the east to develop relatively unmolested while Ancient Rome and the west collapsed [104]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nPeople from Constantinople\n\n\nSecular

As the oldest of five daughters born to Oracene Price, a renowned tennis coach and mother of tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams, Yetunde's life was cut short in a senseless act of violence.\n\n**Background**\n\nYetunde Price was born on December 24, 1972, to Oracene Price and her first husband, Yusef Rasheed. She was the oldest of five daughters, including two half-sisters from her mother's subsequent marriage to Richard Williams. Yetunde's life was marked by a mix of struggles and triumphs. She was a devoted mother to her four children, and her close relationship with her siblings, particularly Venus and Serena Williams, was well-documented.\n\n**Murder**\n\nOn the night of September 14, 2003, Yetunde Price was chatting with her boyfriend in her SUV, parked outside a suspected crack house in suburban Compton. According to eyewitness accounts and subsequent investigations, two members of the South Side Compton Crips street gang opened fire on the SUV, mistakenly believing they were defending the crack house from rival gang members. Yetunde's boyfriend, who later stated that he did not realize his girlfriend had been shot, drove her to a relative's home, where he called emergency services. Yetunde was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at the hospital, from a bullet wound to the head.\n\nThe incident sent shockwaves throughout the community and sparked an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Yetunde's murder. The Compton Police Department launched a probe, and within weeks, they identified two suspects, including 25-year-old Robert Edward Maxfield, a member of the South Side Compton Crips.\n\n**Trial**\n\nThe trial of Robert Edward Maxfield was a highly publicized and contentious process. Maxfield's first two trials ended in mistrials due to jurors being unable to reach a verdict. In the first trial, six jurors voted for acquittal, five for guilt, and one was undecided. The second trial ended in another mistrial, with jurors deadlocking 11-1 in favor of conviction.\n\nThe third trial began in March 2006, and on the day before it was scheduled to start, Maxfield pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter. This marked a significant turning point in the case, as Maxfield's guilty plea spared his family and friends from the emotional trauma of a lengthy trial.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nYetunde Price's tragic death had a profound impact on her family and community. Her mother, Oracene Price, struggled to come to terms with the loss of her eldest daughter, and her sisters, Venus and Serena Williams, were deeply affected by the tragedy. In 2005, Compton rapper the Game dedicated his song \"Dreams\" to Yetunde's memory, paying tribute to her life and legacy.\n\nThe incident also highlighted the devastating effects of gang violence and the need for community-based initiatives to address the root causes of crime.

Born on January 28, 1992, in Germany, Paffrath's life took a significant turn when his parents immigrated to the United States when he was just 18 months old.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nPaffrath's early life was marked by his parents' divorce when he was six years old. Despite this, his parents' decision to immigrate to the United States provided him with opportunities he may not have had otherwise. As a teenager, Paffrath became interested in law enforcement and participated in a law enforcement explorer program, where he rode along with police officers and learned about the career.\n\nWhile on a high school trip to Paris, Paffrath met his future wife, Lauren Stewart. The couple's relationship blossomed, and they decided to move to California, where Lauren's parents worked in real estate. This exposure to the real estate industry sparked Paffrath's interest, and he eventually earned his real estate license in 2010.\n\n**Career**\n\nAfter obtaining his real estate license, Paffrath began renovating homes and renting them out with his wife. They started The Paffrath Organization, a real estate business that buys, renovates, and rents properties in southern California. In 2017, they began offering construction services through their organization, but they ended this venture 18 months later after losing $1 million. Paffrath attributed this to narrow cost margins not allowing room for error.\n\nAs of May 2021, Paffrath and his wife reportedly owned 22 properties, including one in which they lived. Their business ventures have been successful, and they have become well-known in the real estate industry.\n\n**Legal Issues**\n\nIn 2018, Ramsey Solutions, a media company owned by finance personality Dave Ramsey, sued Paffrath. Ramsey alleged breach of contract, stealing trade secrets, and defamatory statements. Paffrath had posted videos critical of Ramsey and his business practices, including one entitled \"Dave Ramsey: Exposed,\" where he claimed Ramsey's business provided \"cold-as-ice leads\" for real estate sales and collected a fee for \"doing nothing.\"\n\nPaffrath stated that he had ended his relationship with Ramsey Solutions before making the videos and believed he did not violate a contract. He also claimed that the lawsuit was an attempt at censorship, which violated his right to free speech. The case moved to federal court in 2019 and was settled privately out of court later that year.\n\n**2021 California Gubernatorial Candidacy**\n\nOn May 17, 2021, Paffrath announced his candidacy as a Democrat in the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election. The election was held on September 14, 2021, and ultimately resulted in sitting governor Gavin Newsom not being recalled. Paffrath was one of nine Democratic candidates to replace Newsom who qualified to appear on the ballot, out of 46 total candidates.\n\nThe thin pool of Democrats was attributed to the California Democratic Party's strategy, which focused on defeating the recall and discouraged established Democratic candidates from entering the race. Despite this, Paffrath's candidacy brought attention to the recall election and highlighted the need for change in California politics.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nKevin Paffrath's life has been marked by his entrepreneurial ventures and his candidacy in the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election. His business ventures have been successful, and he has become well-known in the real estate industry. However, his candidacy also brought controversy, including a lawsuit from Dave Ramsey's media company.\n\nDespite this, Paffrath's candidacy brought attention to the recall election and highlighted the need for change in California politics.

It is a type of index that uses bit vectors to represent the presence or absence of values in a particular column. The concept of bitmap index was first introduced by Professor Israel Spiegler and Rafi Maayan in 1985, and has since become a popular technique for improving query performance in various applications.\n\n### Example\n\nContinuing the internet access example, a bitmap index may be logically viewed as follows:\n\nSuppose we have a table with columns for user IDs, access dates, and status (e.g., active or inactive). We want to query the table to find all users who accessed the internet on a particular date and have an active status. A bitmap index on the access date and status columns can efficiently answer this query by returning a boolean vector for each user ID, indicating whether they match the query criteria.\n\n### Compression\n\nFor historical reasons, bitmap compression and inverted list compression were developed as separate lines of research, and only later were recognized as solving essentially the same problem. Compression is a crucial aspect of bitmap indexing, as it allows for more efficient storage and querying of large datasets. There are various compression techniques available, including run-length encoding, delta encoding, and arithmetic coding.\n\n### Encoding\n\nBasic bitmap indexes use one bitmap for each distinct value. It is possible to reduce the number of bitmaps used by using a different encoding method. For example, it is possible to encode C distinct values using log(C) bitmaps with binary encoding. This approach is known as variable-length encoding, and it can significantly reduce the storage requirements of the bitmap index.\n\n### Binning\n\nFor high-cardinality columns, it is useful to bin the values, where each bin covers multiple values and build the bitmaps to represent the values in each bin. This approach reduces the number of bitmaps used regardless of encoding method. However, binned indexes can only answer some queries without examining the base data. For example, if a bin covers the range from 0.1 to 0.2, then when the user asks for all values less than 0.15, all rows that fall in the bin are possible hits and have to be checked to verify whether they are actually less than 0.15. The process of checking the base data is known as the candidate check. In most cases, the time used by the candidate check is significantly longer than the time needed to work with the bitmap index. Therefore, binned indexes exhibit irregular performance. They can be very fast for some queries, but much slower if the query does not exactly match a bin.\n\n### History\n\nThe concept of bitmap index was first introduced by Professor Israel Spiegler and Rafi Maayan in their research \"Storage and Retrieval Considerations of Binary Data Bases\", published in 1985. The first commercial database product to implement a bitmap index was Computer Corporation of America's Model 204. Patrick O'Neil published a paper about this implementation in 1987. This implementation is a hybrid between the basic bitmap index (without compression) and the list of Row Identifiers (RID-list). Overall, the index is organized as a B+tree. When the column cardinality is low, each leaf node of the B-tree would contain long list of RIDs. In this case, it requires less space to represent the RID-lists as bitmaps. Since each bitmap represents one distinct value, this is the basic bitmap index. As the column cardinality increases, each bitmap becomes sparse and it may take more disk space to store the bitmaps than to store the same content as RID-lists. In this case, it switches to use the RID-lists, which makes it a B+tree index.\n\n### In-memory bitmaps\n\nOne of the strongest reasons for using bitmap indexes is that the intermediate results produced from them are also bitmaps and can be efficiently reused in further operations to answer more complex queries. Many programming languages support this as a bit array data structure. For example, Java has the BitSet class. This allows for efficient querying and manipulation of large datasets, making bitmap indexes a popular choice for various applications.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nBitmap indexes are a powerful technique for improving query performance in databases and other applications. By using bit vectors to represent the presence or absence of values in a particular column, bitmap indexes can efficiently answer complex queries and reduce the time needed to retrieve data. While there are various compression techniques and encoding methods available, bitmap indexes can exhibit irregular performance for certain queries. Nevertheless, their benefits make them a popular choice for various applications, and they continue to be an active area of research in the field of database systems.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Bitmap_index\" following this outline:\n\n\nExample\nContinuing the internet access example, a bitmap index may be logically viewed as follows:\n\n\nCompression\nFor historical reasons, bitmap compression and inverted list compression were developed as separate lines of research, and only later were recognized as solving essentially the same problem [6]\n\n\nEncoding\nBasic bitmap indexes use one bitmap for each distinct value It is possible to reduce the number of bitmaps used by using a different encoding method [20] [21] For example, it is possible to encode C distinct values using log(C) bitmaps with binary encoding [22]\n\n\nBinning\nFor high-cardinality columns, it is useful to bin the values, where each bin covers multiple values and build the bitmaps to represent the values in each bin This approach reduces the number of bitmaps used regardless of encoding method [23] However, binned indexes can only answer some queries without examining the base data For example, if a bin covers the range from 0.1 to 0.2, then when the user asks for all values less than 0.15, all rows that fall in the bin are possible hits and have to be checked to verify whether they are actually less than 0.15 The process of checking the base data is known as the candidate check In most cases, the time used by the candidate check is significantly longer than the time needed to work with the bitmap index Therefore, binned indexes exhibit irregular performance They can be very fast for some queries, but much slower if the query does not exactly match a bin.\n\n\nHistory\nThe concept of bitmap index was first introduced by Professor Israel Spiegler and Rafi Maayan in their research \"Storage and Retrieval Considerations of Binary Data Bases\", published in 1985 [24] The first commercial database product to implement a bitmap index was Computer Corporation of America's Model 204 Patrick O'Neil published a paper about this implementation in 1987 [25] This implementation is a hybrid between the basic bitmap index (without compression) and the list of Row Identifiers (RID-list) Overall, the index is organized as a B+tree When the column cardinality is low, each leaf node of the B-tree would contain long list of RIDs In this case, it requires less space to represent the RID-lists as bitmaps Since each bitmap represents one distinct value, this is the basic bitmap index As the column cardinality increases, each bitmap becomes sparse and it may take more disk space to store the bitmaps than to store the same content as RID-lists In this case, it switches to use the RID-lists, which makes it a B+tree index [26] [27]\n\n\nIn-memory bitmaps\nOne of the strongest reasons for using bitmap indexes is that the intermediate results produced from them are also bitmaps and can be efficiently reused in further operations to answer more complex queries Many programming languages support this as a bit array data structure For example, Java has the BitSet class.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

{"title": "GameStop_short_squeeze", "content": "\nBackground\nShort selling is a finance practice in which an investor, known as the short-seller, borrows shares and immediately sells them, in the hope that they will be able to buy them back later (\"covering\") at a lower price, return the borrowed shares (plus interest) to the lender, and profit off the difference The practice carries an unlimited risk of losses, because there is no inherent limit to how high a stock's price can rise should the short-seller be proven wrong in their belief that the stock price was going to fall This is in contrast with taking a long position (simply owning the stock), where the investor's loss is limited to the cost of their initial investment [1] [2]\n\n\nShort selling and short squeezes\nShort selling is a finance practice in which an investor, known as the short-seller, borrows shares and immediately sells them, in the hope that they will be able to buy them back later (\"covering\") at a lower price, return the borrowed shares (plus interest) to the lender, and profit off the difference The practice carries an unlimited risk of losses, because there is no inherent limit to how high a stock's price can rise should the short-seller be proven wrong in their belief that the stock price was going to fall This is in contrast with taking a long position (simply owning the stock), where the investor's loss is limited to the cost of their initial investment [1] [2]\n\n\nGameStop\nGameStop, an American chain of brick-and-mortar video game stores, had struggled in the years leading up to the short squeeze due to competition from digital distribution services, as well as the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced the number of people who shopped in-person As a result, GameStop's stock price declined, leading many institutional investors to believe it would continue falling, thus short-selling the stock On January 22, 2021, approximately 140 percent of GameStop's public float [a] had been sold short, meaning some shorted shares had been re-lent and shorted again [6] [7] Analysts at Goldman Sachs later noted that short interest exceeding 100 percent of a company's public float had only occurred 15 times in the prior 10 years [6]\n\n\nOnline discussion\n\nThe subreddit r/wallstreetbets is an online community on Reddit, a social news website The community is known for discussion about meme stocks and high-risk stock transactions [12] Observers congregating around r/wallstreetbets believed the company was being significantly undervalued, and with such a large amount of the stock being short they could trigger a short squeeze, by driving up the price to the point where short sellers had to capitulate and cover their positions at large losses [5]\n\nRise in stock price and volume\nIn January 2021, Reddit users on the r/wallstreetbets subreddit built the foundations for a short squeeze on GameStop, pushing up the stock price significantly [11] This occurred shortly after a comment from Citron Research predicting the value of the stock would decrease [24] The stock price increased 1,500 percent by January 27 over the course of two weeks, and its high volatility caused trading to be halted multiple times [11] [25] According to Dow Jones market data, more than 175 million shares of GameStop were traded on January 25, the second largest total in a single day, surpassing its 30-day average volume of 29.8 million shares [26] Some of those investing into the stock were young teenage investors [27]\n\n\nHalting of stock purchases\nOn January 28, Robinhood halted purchases of GameStop, AMC Theatres, BlackBerry Limited, Nokia Corporation, and other volatile stocks from its trading platform; customers could no longer open new positions in the stock, although they could still close them [46] Other brokerages soon followed suit Many traders were furious, and called for class-action lawsuits in multiple popular Reddit posts [47] After the markets closed, Robinhood announced it would begin to allow \"limited buys\" of the affected securities starting the following day, although it was unclear what \"limited buys\" entailed [48] Trading platforms such as UK-based Trading212 and Israel-based eToro blocked buys of GameStop and other stock while continuing to allow sales [49] Webull halted buy orders for stocks affected by the squeeze, [50] but soon thereafter allowed orders to continue [51] Anthony Denier, the CEO of Webull, stated that increased collateral requirements for their clearing house meant Webull themselves were restricted from opening new positions [52] Some users alleged that Robinhood was selling shares without consent; Robinhood denied these allegations [53]\n\n\nDecline in value\nOn February 1 and 2, the stock price for GameStop declined substantially, losing more than 80 percent of its value from its intraday peak price, recorded during the previous week GameStop shares lost 60 percent of their value on February 2, closing below $100 for the first time in a week [65] [66] Reports estimated that about $27 billion in value had been erased [66] [67] Other assets affected by the short squeeze and put under company trading restrictions, such as AMC and Blackberry shares, also declined in value CNN reported that the drop was partly due to restrictions imposed by Robinhood and other brokers on the number of shares that could be purchased at once by their clients [68] The short squeezed securities' prices continued to decline during the week [69]\n\n\nResurgence from February 24\nOn February 24, GameStop share prices doubled in heavy volume in the final 90 minutes of trading, with the company's stock halting twice, shortly before closing at $91.70, a 104-percent gain Gains continued in after-hours trading, nearing an additional 100 percent [73] [74] [75] Similar gains, although not as high, were reported with cinema operator AMC, clothing retailer Express and communications software group BlackBerry [73] Reports could not identify a specific cause for the surge [74] [76] [77] The jump came a day after GameStop announced its chief financial officer Jim Bell would resign to help 'accelerate GameStop's transformation' [75]\n\n\nImpact on involved entities\nShort sellers who had bet against GameStop suffered large losses as a result of the short squeeze [86]\n\n\nLosses by short sellers\nShort sellers who had bet against GameStop suffered large losses as a result of the short squeeze [86]\n\n\nCompanies with increased stock value\nAs of January 31, executives at BlackBerry and GameStop had sold more than $22 million in stock since January 1 [110] There is no allegation of insider trading among BlackBerry executives, according to CBS News [110] Three BlackBerry executives sold nearly $1.7 million of the company's stock, with one of the executives, Chief Financial Officer Steve Rai, selling all of his shares in the company excepting unvested employee stock options [110]\n\n\nGains by existing shareholders and third parties\nWhile the short squeeze was initially reported as being driven by retail investors, it later emerged that a substantial part of the market activity surrounding GameStop and the related securities was conducted by hedge funds, who had made substantial profits from the short squeeze [113] [114] An analysis by Reuters concluded that some of Wall Street's largest asset managers were able to realize gains both from their share stakes, as well as from lending out stocks to short sellers [115] Similarly, an analysis by investment bank JP Morgan Chase suggested that institutional investors were heavily involved in the trading activity related to the short squeeze [116] Brokerages, trading systems and market makers have also gained from higher-than-average volume of transfers [115]\n\n\nLosses by retail investors\nMany retail investors and r/wallstreetbets users bought shares of GameStop and other affected securities as they were reaching their peak prices or shortly afterwards Other investors held onto their long positions while the stock prices were declining rapidly, amid widespread calls on r/wallstreetbets to hang on to the failing shares In an \"ask me anything session\" on r/wallstreetbets, entrepreneur Mark Cuban also encouraged GameStop buyers to hold on to their stock if they were able to As the stock prices continued to decline, many retail investors suffered significant losses, [70] [71] [72] with some r/wallstreetbets users losing a majority of their savings [122] [123]\n\n\nOther affected assets\nApart from GameStop, many other heavily shorted securities (as well as securities with low short interest) saw increases in their prices:\n\n\nStocks\nApart from GameStop, many other heavily shorted securities (as well as securities with low short interest) saw increases in their prices:\n\n\nCryptocurrencies\nAfter brokerages halted the buying of GameStop and other securities, the price of several cryptocurrencies also began to increase substantially, with Dogecoin's value increasing over 800 percent [150] [151] [152] Users of the subreddits r/CryptoCurrency and r/SatoshiStreetBets attempted to pump up Dogecoin to make it \"the next GME/Bitcoin\" [153] In addition, the price of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, increased 20 percent in value to more than $37,000 after Elon Musk endorsed it in his Twitter bio, partially related to the surge in the GameStop share price by Reddit users [154] Robinhood then began limiting the trading on Dogecoin [155]\n\n\nMetal futures\nFollowing the stock market surge, futures for silver began to rapidly increase as well, [156] [157] although later news reports clarified that it was unclear who was behind the rise [158] On January 28 and 29, the price of silver rose 10 percent [94] The surge also had an effect on the prices of gold and copper on the London Metal Exchange [157] On February 1, the price of silver hit an eight-year high as GameStop shares continued their volatile tendency, with trading [which?] being halted at least once as the price fell by double-digit percentages [159] Users on r/wallstreetbets deny involvement in the increasing price of silver, instead blaming the increase on institutions and hedge funds with positions in silver, such as Citadel, seeking to offset losses on GameStop [160] [161] [162] [163]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn January 27, 2021, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and others in the Biden administration were monitoring the situation [164] Yellen convened a meeting of financial regulators, including the heads of the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to discuss the volatility surrounding the short squeeze Because Yellen had received speaking fees from Citadel before becoming treasury secretary, she sought and received permission from Treasury Department ethics lawyers before convening the meeting [165] [166] The regulators were not seen as likely to view the volatility as creating any systemic risks [167]\n\n\nInvestigations\nOn January 27, 2021, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and others in the Biden administration were monitoring the situation [164] Yellen convened a meeting of financial regulators, including the heads of the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to discuss the volatility surrounding the short squeeze Because Yellen had received speaking fees from Citadel before becoming treasury secretary, she sought and received permission from Treasury Department ethics lawyers before convening the meeting [165] [166] The regulators were not seen as likely to view the volatility as creating any systemic risks [167]\n\n\nCongressional hearing\nOn January 28, 2021, the House Financial Services Committee announced that it would convene a hearing to discuss online trading platforms [177] [178] On February 18, 2021, the committee, chaired by Representative Maxine Waters, held a remote hearing titled Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide [179] Witnesses at the hearing included Reddit user and investor Keith Gill, Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, Melvin Capital CEO Gabe Plotkin, Cato Institute financial regulation expert Jennifer J Schulp, and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev [179] [180] Representatives focused their attention on Robinhood's role in the event, asking Tenev why the brokerage had limited the trading of some securities and if it had clearly communicated its business model to its customers They also questioned whether Robinhood was encouraging its customers to take excessive risks in order to generate a profit and whether it had the appropriate infrastructure and funding to handle influxes of new clients Several committee members expressed skepticism at the practice of payment for order flow and pressed Griffin and Tenev on the issue [179] [180] [181] Representative Brad Sherman accused Griffin of trying to evade his questions At various points during his initial testimony and questioning, Gill made references to memes [179] [180] Committee members also discussed increasing short-selling regulation [181]\n\n\nLawsuits\nA Robinhood customer filed a class-action lawsuit against the company in federal court on January 28, 2021, for halting trading on GameStop [184] [185] The lawsuit claimed that Robinhood \"purposefully, willfully, and knowingly removing the stock 'GME' from its trading platform in the midst of an unprecedented stock rise thereby deprived retail investors of the ability to invest in the open-market\"; the lawsuit also accused Robinhood of \"manipulating the open-market\" [184] [185] Several other investors began using the app DoNotPay to automatically join the lawsuit [186] [187]\n\n\nRegulation\nOn February 8, 2021, the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission released a sample letter providing guidance to companies seeking to raise capital during periods of \"extreme price volatility\" It requires that companies outline the related risks in their financial disclosures and encourages companies to contact the SEC prior to launching such offerings [198] [199] [200]\n\n\nScientific research\nIn January 2024, researchers concluded that there was a causal link between the Reddit/Twitter activity and the movements in the stock price [206]\n\n\n2024 rally\nOn  May 12th 2024, Keith Gill (a.k.a DeepFuckingValue, Roaring Kitty) posted to X an image of a person leaning forward in a chair This caused the GameStop stock price to rise from under $14 to over $48, though Gill's post did not mention GameStop  GameStop benefitted from this by issuing more stock at over $20, raising over $900,000,000 [207] [208] [209] Other stocks such as AMC, BlackBerry, Virgin Galactic also experienced major increases during this time period [210]\n\n\nReactions\nThis is unacceptable We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp's decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit As a member of the Financial Services Cmte, I'd support a hearing if necessary.\n\n\nPolitical figures\nThis is unacceptable We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp's decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit As a member of the Financial Services Cmte, I'd support a hearing if necessary.\n\n\nPublic figures\nIn a CNBC interview, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian compared the rally to Occupy Wall Street, saying that \"it's a chance for Joe and Jane America—the retail buyers of stock—to flex back and push back on these hedge funds.\" [228] Numerous journalists have also drawn comparison to the Occupy movement [229] [230] [231] Similar sentiments sympathetic for the retail investors were expressed by billionaire investors Mark Cuban [232] and Chamath Palihapitiya [233] Palihapitiya, who passed on early investment opportunities in Robinhood, opined that the founding co-CEOs, Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev, lacked integrity and urged his followers to delete the app [233] OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggested the company change its name [234] SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk also criticized the general practice of stock shorting, calling it a \"scam legal only for vestigial reasons\" [235] A number of major hedge funds had previously shorted Tesla, incurring losses of more than $40 billion as the stock rose considerably [235]\n\n\nRetaliation and protests\nDisgruntled users review-bombed the Robinhood app on the Google Play Store after it halted the trading of GameStop securities, pushing its ratings down to one star [247] Google deleted at least 100,000 such reviews, calling them \"coordinated or inorganic\" [248] However, after another round of negative reviews on the app dropping it to a 1.1-star rating, Google confirmed that the new reviews do not violate Google policies and will not be removed [249] Protesters also showed up outside Robinhood headquarters in Menlo Park, California, at the Securities and Exchange Commission headquarters in Washington, D.C., and the

revenue was derived from selling customer orders to market-making firms including Citadel Securities and Two Sigma Securities, in a practice known as payment for order flow [258] The Washington Post reported that Robinhood routed more than half of its customer orders to Citadel, which was its largest market making partner by volume [256] Citadel Securities is the sister company to Citadel LLC, which along with Point72 Asset Management invested $2.75 billion into Melvin Capital [259] [260] As Robinhood restricted trading of GameStop shares, users alleged that Citadel Securities directed Robinhood to do so Citadel Securities stated that they did not instruct any brokerage to suspend or otherwise limit trading, and Robinhood denied that it had been pressured by Citadel [54] [256] [257]

2021, where the stock price of GameStop, an American chain of brick-and-mortar video game stores, surged unexpectedly due to a short squeeze. A short squeeze occurs when a large number of investors who have short-sold a stock are forced to buy it back at a higher price, causing the stock price to rise rapidly.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe GameStop short squeeze was a remarkable event that caught many investors and financial analysts off guard. The event was triggered by a combination of factors, including the rise of retail investing, the use of social media platforms to share investment ideas, and the actions of institutional investors who had short-sold GameStop stock. In this article, we will examine the events leading up to the short squeeze, the impact it had on investors and the financial markets, and the subsequent investigations and regulations that followed.\n\n**Background**\n\nShort selling is a finance practice in which an investor, known as the short-seller, borrows shares and immediately sells them, in the hope that they will be able to buy them back later (\"covering\") at a lower price, return the borrowed shares (plus interest) to the lender, and profit off the difference. The practice carries an unlimited risk of losses, because there is no inherent limit to how high a stock's price can rise should the short-seller be proven wrong in their belief that the stock price was going to fall.\n\n**Short Selling and Short Squeezes**\n\nShort selling is a finance practice in which an investor, known as the short-seller, borrows shares and immediately sells them, in the hope that they will be able to buy them back later (\"covering\") at a lower price, return the borrowed shares (plus interest) to the lender, and profit off the difference. The practice carries an unlimited risk of losses, because there is no inherent limit to how high a stock's price can rise should the short-seller be proven wrong in their belief that the stock price was going to fall.\n\n**GameStop**\n\nGameStop, an American chain of brick-and-mortar video game stores, had struggled in the years leading up to the short squeeze due to competition from digital distribution services, as well as the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced the number of people who shopped in-person. As a result, GameStop's stock price declined, leading many institutional investors to believe it would continue falling, thus short-selling the stock.\n\n**Online Discussion**\n\nThe subreddit r/wallstreetbets is an online community on Reddit, a social news website. The community is known for discussion about meme stocks and high-risk stock transactions. Observers congregating around r/wallstreetbets believed the company was being significantly undervalued, and with such a large amount of the stock being short they could trigger a short squeeze, by driving up the price to the point where short sellers had to capitulate and cover their positions at large losses.\n\n**Rise in Stock Price and Volume**\n\nIn January 2021, Reddit users on the r/wallstreetbets subreddit built the foundations for a short squeeze on GameStop, pushing up the stock price significantly. This occurred shortly after a comment from Citron Research predicting the value of the stock would decrease. The stock price increased 1,500 percent by January 27 over the course of two weeks, and its high volatility caused trading to be halted multiple times.\n\n**Halting of Stock Purchases**\n\nOn January 28, Robinhood halted purchases of GameStop, AMC Theatres, BlackBerry Limited, Nokia Corporation, and other volatile stocks from its trading platform; customers could no longer open new positions in the stock, although they could still close them. Other brokerages soon followed suit. Many traders were furious, and called for class-action lawsuits in multiple popular Reddit posts.\n\n**Decline in Value**\n\nOn February 1 and 2, the stock price for GameStop declined substantially, losing more than 80 percent of its value from its intraday peak price, recorded during the previous week. GameStop shares lost 60 percent of their value on February 2, closing below $100 for the first time in a week.\n\n**Resurgence from February 24**\n\nOn February 24, GameStop share prices doubled in heavy volume in the final 90 minutes of trading, with the company's stock halting twice, shortly before closing at $91.70, a 104-percent gain. Gains continued in after-hours trading, nearing an additional 100 percent.\n\n**Impact on Involved Entities**\n\nShort sellers who had bet against GameStop suffered large losses as a result of the short squeeze. Companies with increased stock value, such as BlackBerry and GameStop, saw significant gains.\n\n**Losses by Retail Investors**\n\nMany retail investors and r/wallstreetbets users bought shares of GameStop and other affected securities as they were reaching their peak prices or shortly afterwards. Other investors held onto their long positions while the stock prices were declining rapidly, amid widespread calls on r/wallstreetbets to hang on to the failing shares. As the stock prices continued to decline, many retail investors suffered significant losses.\n\n**Other Affected Assets**\n\nApart from GameStop, many other heavily shorted securities (as well as securities with low short interest) saw increases in their prices. Cryptocurrencies also began to increase substantially, with Dogecoin's value increasing over 800 percent.\n\n**Investigations**\n\nThe White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and others in the Biden administration were monitoring the situation. Yellen convened a meeting of financial regulators to discuss the volatility surrounding the short squeeze.\n\n**Congressional Hearing**\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee announced that it would convene a hearing to discuss online trading platforms. The committee, chaired by Representative Maxine Waters, held a remote hearing titled Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide.\n\n**Lawsuits**\n\nA Robinhood customer filed a class-action lawsuit against the company in federal court for halting trading on GameStop.\n\n**Regulation**\n\nThe U.S Securities and Exchange Commission released a sample letter providing guidance to companies seeking to raise capital during periods of \"extreme price volatility.\"\n\n**Scientific Research**\n\nResearchers concluded that there was a causal link between the Reddit/Twitter activity and the movements in the stock price.\n\n**2024 Rally**\n\nKeith Gill, also known as DeepFuckingValue, posted an image on X that caused the GameStop stock price to rise from under $14 to over $48.\n\n**Reactions**\n\nPoliticians and public figures reacted to the event, with some comparing it to the Occupy Wall Street movement. Others expressed sympathy for retail investors and called for greater regulation of the financial markets.\n\n**Retaliation and Protests**\n\nDisgruntled users review-bombed the Robinhood app on the Google Play Store, and protesters showed up outside Robinhood headquarters and the Securities and Exchange Commission headquarters.\n\n**Alleged Conflict of Interest between Robinhood and Citadel**\n\nFollowing the decision by brokerage firm Robinhood to halt the buying of stocks affected by the short squeeze, users on Reddit and other social media called in question its relationship with Citadel Securities.\n\n**Internal Communications Revealed**\n\nInternal Robinhood messages stemming from a class-action lawsuit showed Robinhood executives \"scrambled to talk to Citadel CEO Ken Griffin\" on the day trading of GameStop and related stocks was temporally halted.\n\n**Media Adaptations**\n\nNetflix and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer acquired the rights to make films based on the events.\n\n**Speculation on a Second Short Squeeze (\"MOASS\")**\n\nSeveral retail investors began speculating if a second, even bigger, short squeeze could occur through similar methodology.

to competition from digital distribution services, as well as the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced the number of people who shopped in-person As a result, GameStop's stock price declined, leading many institutional investors to believe it would continue falling, thus short-selling the stock On January 22, 2021, approximately 140 percent of GameStop's public float [a] had been sold short, meaning some shorted shares had been re-lent and shorted again [6] [7] Analysts at Goldman Sachs later noted that short interest exceeding 100 percent of a company's public float had only occurred 15 times in the prior 10 years [6]\n\n\nOnline discussion\n\nThe subreddit r/wallstreetbets is an online community on Reddit, a social news website The community is known for discussion about meme stocks and high-risk stock transactions [12] Observers congregating around r/wallstreetbets believed the company was being significantly undervalued, and with such a large amount of the stock being short they could trigger a short squeeze, by driving up the price to the point where short sellers had to capitulate and cover their positions at large losses [5]\n\nRise in stock price and volume\nIn January 2021, Reddit users on the r/wallstreetbets subreddit built the foundations for a short squeeze on GameStop, pushing up the stock price significantly [11] This occurred shortly after a comment from Citron Research predicting the value of the stock would decrease [24] The stock price increased 1,500 percent by January 27 over the course of two weeks, and its high volatility caused trading to be halted multiple times [11] [25] According to Dow Jones market data, more than 175 million shares of GameStop were traded on January 25, the second largest total in a single day, surpassing its 30-day average volume of 29.8 million shares [26] Some of those investing into the stock were young teenage investors [27]\n\n\nHalting of stock purchases\nOn January 28, Robinhood halted purchases of GameStop, AMC Theatres, BlackBerry Limited, Nokia Corporation, and other volatile stocks from its trading platform; customers could no longer open new positions in the stock, although they could still close them [46] Other brokerages soon followed suit Many traders were furious, and called for class-action lawsuits in multiple popular Reddit posts [47] After the markets closed, Robinhood announced it would begin to allow \"limited buys\" of the affected securities starting the following day, although it was unclear what \"limited buys\" entailed [48] Trading platforms such as UK-based Trading212 and Israel-based eToro blocked buys of GameStop and other stock while continuing to allow sales [49] Webull halted buy orders for stocks affected by the squeeze, [50] but soon thereafter allowed orders to continue [51] Anthony Denier, the CEO of Webull, stated that increased collateral requirements for their clearing house meant Webull themselves were restricted from opening new positions [52] Some users alleged that Robinhood was selling shares without consent; Robinhood denied these allegations [53]\n\n\nDecline in value\nOn February 1 and 2, the stock price for GameStop declined substantially, losing more than 80 percent of its value from its intraday peak price, recorded during the previous week GameStop shares lost 60 percent of their value on February 2, closing below $100 for the first time in a week [65] [66] Reports estimated that about $27 billion in value had been erased [66] [67] Other assets affected by the short squeeze and put under company trading restrictions, such as AMC and Blackberry shares, also declined in value CNN reported that the drop was partly due to restrictions imposed by Robinhood and other brokers on the number of shares that could be purchased at once by their clients [68] The short squeezed securities' prices continued to decline during the week [69]\n\n\nResurgence from February 24\nOn February 24, GameStop share prices doubled in heavy volume in the final 90 minutes of trading, with the company's stock halting twice, shortly before closing at $91.70, a 104-percent gain Gains continued in after-hours trading, nearing an additional 100 percent [73] [74] [75] Similar gains, although not as high, were reported with cinema operator AMC, clothing retailer Express and communications software group BlackBerry [73] Reports could not identify a specific cause for the surge [74] [76] [77] The jump came a day after GameStop announced its chief financial officer Jim Bell would resign to help 'accelerate GameStop's transformation' [75]\n\n\nImpact on involved entities\nShort sellers who had bet against GameStop suffered large losses as a result of the short squeeze [86]\n\n\nLosses by short sellers\nShort sellers who had bet against GameStop suffered large losses as a result of the short squeeze [86]\n\n\nCompanies with increased stock value\nAs of January 31, executives at BlackBerry and GameStop had sold more than $22 million in stock since January 1 [110] There is no allegation of insider trading among BlackBerry executives, according to CBS News [110] Three BlackBerry executives sold nearly $1.7 million of the company's stock, with one of the executives, Chief Financial Officer Steve Rai, selling all of his shares in the company excepting unvested employee stock options [110]\n\n\nGains by existing shareholders and third parties\nWhile the short squeeze was initially reported as being driven by retail investors, it later emerged that a substantial part of the market activity surrounding GameStop and the related securities was conducted by hedge funds, who had made substantial profits from the short squeeze [113] [114] An analysis by Reuters concluded that some of Wall Street's largest asset managers were able to realize gains both from their share stakes, as well as from lending out stocks to short sellers [115] Similarly, an analysis by investment bank JP Morgan Chase suggested that institutional investors were heavily involved in the trading activity related to the short squeeze [116] Brokerages, trading systems and market makers have also gained from higher-than-average volume of transfers [115]\n\n\nLosses by retail investors\nMany retail investors and r/wallstreetbets users bought shares of GameStop and other affected securities as they were reaching their peak prices or shortly afterwards Other investors held onto their long positions while the stock prices were declining rapidly, amid widespread calls on r/wallstreetbets to hang on to the failing shares In an \"ask me anything session\" on r/wallstreetbets, entrepreneur Mark Cuban also encouraged GameStop buyers to hold on to their stock if they were able to As the stock prices continued to decline, many retail investors suffered significant losses, [70] [71] [72] with some r/wallstreetbets users losing a majority of their savings [122]

GameStop, many other heavily shorted securities (as well as securities with low short interest) saw increases in their prices:\n\n\nCryptocurrencies\nAfter brokerages halted the buying of GameStop and other securities, the price of several cryptocurrencies also began to increase substantially, with Dogecoin's value increasing over 800 percent [150] [151] [152] Users of the subreddits r/CryptoCurrency and r/SatoshiStreetBets attempted to pump up Dogecoin to make it \"the next GME/Bitcoin\" [153] In addition, the price of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, increased 20 percent in value to more than $37,000 after Elon Musk endorsed it in his Twitter bio, partially related to the surge in the GameStop share price by Reddit users [154] Robinhood then began limiting the trading on Dogecoin [155]\n\n\nMetal futures\nFollowing the stock market surge, futures for silver began to rapidly increase as well, [156] [157] although later news reports clarified that it was unclear who was behind the rise [158] On January 28 and 29, the price of silver rose 10 percent [94] The surge also had an effect on the prices of gold and copper on the London Metal Exchange [157] On February 1, the price of silver hit an eight-year high as GameStop shares continued their volatile tendency, with trading [which?] being halted at least once as the price fell by double-digit percentages [159] Users on r/wallstreetbets deny involvement in the increasing price of silver, instead blaming the increase on institutions and hedge funds with positions in silver, such as Citadel, seeking to offset losses on GameStop [160] [161] [162] [163]\n\n\nAftermath\nOn January 27, 2021, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and others in the Biden administration were monitoring the situation [164] Yellen convened a meeting of financial regulators, including the heads of the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to discuss the volatility surrounding the short squeeze Because Yellen had received speaking fees from Citadel before becoming treasury secretary, she sought and received permission from Treasury Department ethics lawyers before convening the meeting [165] [166] The regulators were not seen as likely to view the volatility as creating any systemic risks [167]\n\n\nInvestigations\nOn January 27, 2021, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and others in the Biden administration were

February 18, 2021, the committee, chaired by Representative Maxine Waters, held a remote hearing titled Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide [179] Witnesses at the hearing included Reddit user and investor Keith Gill, Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, Melvin Capital CEO Gabe Plotkin, Cato Institute financial regulation expert Jennifer J Schulp, and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev [179] [180] Representatives focused their attention on Robinhood's role in the event, asking Tenev why the brokerage had limited the trading of some securities and if it had clearly communicated its business model to its customers They also questioned whether Robinhood was encouraging its customers to take excessive risks in order to generate a profit and whether it had the appropriate infrastructure and funding to handle influxes of new clients Several committee members expressed skepticism at the practice of payment for order flow and pressed Griffin and Tenev on the issue [179] [180] [181] Representative Brad Sherman accused Griffin of trying to evade his questions At various points during his initial testimony and questioning, Gill made references to memes [179] [180] Committee members also discussed increasing short-selling regulation [181]\n\n\nLawsuits\nA Robinhood customer filed a class-action lawsuit against the company in federal court on January 28, 2021, for halting trading on GameStop [184] [185] The lawsuit claimed that Robinhood \"purposefully, willfully, and knowingly removing the stock 'GME' from its trading platform in the midst of an unprecedented stock rise thereby deprived retail investors of the ability to invest in the open-market\"; the lawsuit also accused Robinhood of \"manipulating the open-market\" [184] [185] Several other investors began using the app DoNotPay to automatically join the lawsuit [186] [187]\n\n\nRegulation\nOn February 8, 2021, the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission released a sample letter providing guidance to companies seeking to raise capital during periods of \"extreme price volatility\" It requires that companies outline the related risks in their financial disclosures and encourages companies to contact the SEC prior to launching such offerings [198] [199] [200]\n\n\nScientific research\nIn January 2024, researchers concluded that there was a causal link between the Reddit/Twitter activity and the movements in the stock price [206]\n\n\n2024 rally\nOn  May 12th 2024, Keith Gill (a.k.a DeepFuckingValue, Roaring Kitty) posted to X an image of a person leaning forward in a chair This caused the GameStop stock price to rise from under $14 to over $48, though Gill's post did not mention GameStop  GameStop benefitted from this by issuing more stock at over $20, raising over $900,000,000 [207] [208] [209] Other stocks such as AMC, BlackBerry, Virgin Galactic also experienced major increases during this time period [210]\n\n\nReactions\nThis is unacceptable We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp's decision to block retail

fit As a member of the Financial Services Cmte, I'd support a hearing if necessary.\n\n\nPublic figures\nIn a CNBC interview, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian compared the rally to Occupy Wall Street, saying that \"it's a chance for Joe and Jane America—the retail buyers of stock—to flex back and push back on these hedge funds.\" [228] Numerous journalists have also drawn comparison to the Occupy movement [229] [230] [231] Similar sentiments sympathetic for the retail investors were expressed by billionaire investors Mark Cuban [232] and Chamath Palihapitiya [233] Palihapitiya, who passed on early investment opportunities in Robinhood, opined that the founding co-CEOs, Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev, lacked integrity and urged his followers to delete the app [233] OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggested the company change its name [234] SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk also criticized the general practice of stock shorting, calling it a \"scam legal only for vestigial reasons\" [235] A number of major hedge funds had previously shorted Tesla, incurring losses of more than $40 billion as the stock rose considerably [235]\n\n\nRetaliation and protests\nDisgruntled users review-bombed the Robinhood app on the Google Play Store after it halted the trading of GameStop securities, pushing its ratings down to one star [247] Google deleted at least 100,000 such reviews, calling them \"coordinated or inorganic\" [248] However, after another round of negative reviews on the app dropping it to a 1.1-star rating, Google confirmed that the new reviews do not violate Google policies and will not be removed [249] Protesters also showed up outside Robinhood headquarters in Menlo Park, California, at the Securities and Exchange Commission headquarters in Washington, D.C., and the New York Stock Exchange [250] Menlo Park police reported ten separate incidents related to protests at Robinhood headquarters from January 28 to February 9, including a man throwing animal feces at

Although he was embarrassed, at first, about the role, which Plummer described as \"so awful and sentimental and gooey,\" the film made cinematic history, becoming the all-time top-grossing film, eclipsing Gone with the Wind. He found all aspects of making the film unpleasant, except working with Andrews, and he avoided using its name, instead calling it \"that movie,\" \"S&M,\" and \"The Sound of Mucus.\" He declined to attend the 40th Anniversary cast reunion, but he did provide commentary on the 2005 DVD release.\n\n**1980–1997: Return to Theatre**\n\nDuring this time Plummer appeared in the romantic drama Somewhere in Time (1980), the drama Eyewitness (1981), the comedy Dragnet (1987), and Shadow Dancing (1988). Plummer also did some voice work, such as his role of Henri the pigeon in An American Tail (1986) and the villainous Grand Duke of Owls in Rock-a-Doodle (1991), both directed by Don Bluth. In 1982, he starred on Broadway production of the Shakespearean tragedy Othello, playing Iago opposite James Earl Jones' Moor. The production also featured performances from Kelsey Grammer as Cassio and Dianne Wiest as Desdemona. New York Times theatre critic Frank Rich wrote in his original review, \"Mr. Plummer, a sensational actor in peak form, has made something crushing out of Shakespeare's archvillain. He gives us evil so pure - and so bottomless - that it can induce tears. Our tears are not for the dastardly Iago, of course - that would be wrong. No, what Mr. Plummer does is make us weep for a civilization that can produce such a man and allow him to flower.\" For his performance, he received a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination, losing to Roger Rees in The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.\n\n**1998–2009: Established Actor**\n\nOne of Plummer's most critically acclaimed roles was that of television journalist Mike Wallace in Michael Mann's biographical film The Insider (1999), for which he was honored with several critics' awards for Best Supporting Actor, though a corresponding Academy Award nomination did not materialize. Plummer's other turns from this period include his roles as Dr. Rosen in Ron Howard's Academy Award-winning biographical film A Beautiful Mind (2001), Uncle Ralph to the title character in the 2002 film adaptation of Charles Dickens novel Nicholas Nickleby, Arthur Case in Spike Lee's film Inside Man (2006), and the philosopher Aristotle in Alexander, alongside Colin Farrell. In 2004, Plummer briefly played John Adams Gates in the Disney adventure film National Treasure. He also appeared in Stephen Gaghan's drama Syriana (2005), the romantic comedy Must Love Dogs (2005), Terrence Malick's historical drama The New World (2005), and the romantic drama The Lake House (2006).\n\n**2010–2021: Resurgence and Final Roles**\n\nIn January 2010, Plummer received his first Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of author Leo Tolstoy in The Last Station (2009). Speaking to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in an interview that aired on March 7, 2010, Plummer added, tongue-in-cheek, \"Well, I said it's about time! I mean, I'm 80 years old, for God's sake. Have mercy.\" On Oscar night, March 7, 2010, however, he lost to Christoph Waltz. That same year, Plummer appeared in David Fincher's English-language film adaptation of Stieg Larsson's book The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo starring Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, and Stellan Skarsgard. The film was a critical and commercial success. Earlier that year, Plummer received his second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Mike Mills' independent comedy drama film Beginners (2011) starring Ewan McGregor, and Mélanie Laurent. Plummer was announced as the winner at the 84th Academy Awards. Plummer's win made him, at age 82, the oldest actor to win an Academy Award. When he accepted the award, he quipped: \"You're only two years older than me, darling. Where have you been all my life?\"\n\n**Other Works**\n\nPlummer wrote for the stage, television, and concert-hall. He and Sir Neville Marriner rearranged William Shakespeare's Henry V with Sir William Walton's music as a concert piece. They recorded the work with Marriner's chamber orchestra the Academy of St Martin in the Fields. He performed it and other works with the New York Philharmonic and symphony orchestras of London, Washington, D.C., Cleveland, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Toronto, Vancouver, and Halifax. With Marriner, he made his Carnegie Hall debut in his own arrangements of Mendelssohn's incidental music to A Midsummer Night's Dream.\n\n**Personal Life**\n\nPlummer was married three times. His first wife was actress Tammy Grimes, whom he married in 1956. Their marriage lasted four years, and they had a daughter together, the actress Amanda Plummer.\n\n**Death and Legacy**\n\nPlummer died at his home in Weston, on February 5, 2021, at the age of 91. According to Taylor, he died two and a half weeks after a fall that resulted in a blow to the head. A statement released by the family announced that Plummer had died peacefully with Taylor by his side.\n\n**Awards and Honours**\n\nPlummer is one of the few performers to have received the Triple Crown of Acting, and he is the only Canadian to accomplish this feat. He has received an Academy Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and two Tony Awards. He has also received a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, an Independent Spirit Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award.\n\n**See Also**\n\nExplanatory notes:\n\n* Christopher Plummer's personal website\n* Christopher Plummer's profile on IMDb\n* Christopher Plummer's profile on Wikipedia\n* Christopher Plummer's bio on Biography.com\n\nReferences:\n\n* \n\nExternal links:\n\n* Christopher Plummer's official website\n* Christopher Plummer's profile on IMDb\n* Christopher Plummer's profile on Wikipedia\n* Christopher Plummer's bio on Biography.com", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Christopher_Plummer\" following this outline:\n\n\nEarly life and education\nArthur Christopher Orme Plummer [6] was born on December 13, 1929, [7] in Toronto, Ontario [6] He was the only child of John Orme Plummer (1894–1977), who sold stocks and other securities, [8] and Isabella Mary Abbott, who worked as secretary to the Dean of Sciences at McGill University, and was the granddaughter of Canadian prime minister Sir John Abbott [9] [10] On his father's side, Plummer's great-uncle was patent lawyer and agent F B Fetherstonhaugh [8] Plummer was also a cousin of a Canadian classical pianist Janina Fialkowska [11] and a second cousin of British actor Nigel Bruce, known for portraying Doctor Watson to  Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes [12]\n\n\nCareer\nPlummer made his professional acting debut in 1948 with Ottawa's Stage Society after which he performed roles as an apprentice artist with the Montreal Repertory Theatre alongside fellow apprenticing actor William Shatner [23] In 1952, he starred in a number of productions at the Bermudiana Theatre in the City of Hamilton, in the British colony of Bermuda where he was seen and recruited by a US producer, although he was reluctant to leave Bermuda [24] Edward Everett Horton hired Plummer to appear as Gerard in the 1953 road show production of André Roussin's Nina, [25] a role originated on Broadway by David Niven in 1951 [26] Plummer made his Broadway debut in January 1953 in the Diana Morgan play The Starcross Story, a show that closed on opening night after a plagiarism lawsuit shut down the production [27] Plummer acted opposite Mary Astor and Margaret Bannerman.\n\n\n1948–1964: Early roles and theatre debut\nPlummer made his professional acting debut in 1948 with Ottawa's Stage Society after which he performed roles as an apprentice artist with the Montreal Repertory Theatre alongside fellow apprenticing actor William Shatner [23] In 1952, he starred in a number of productions at the Bermudiana Theatre in the City of Hamilton, in the British colony of Bermuda where he was seen and recruited by a US producer, although he was reluctant to leave Bermuda [24] Edward Everett Horton hired Plummer to appear as Gerard in the 1953 road show production of André Roussin's Nina, [25] a role originated on Broadway by David Niven in 1951 [26] Plummer made his Broadway debut in January 1953 in the Diana Morgan play The Starcross Story, a show that closed on opening night after a plagiarism lawsuit shut down the production [27] Plummer acted opposite Mary Astor and Margaret Bannerman.\n\n\n1965–1979: The Sound of Music and stardom\nPlummer remains widely known for his portrayal of Captain Von Trapp due to the box-office success and continued popularity of the Robert Wise–directed musical epic The Sound of Music (1965) Plummer acted alongside Julie Andrews, and the film earned five Academy Awards, including Best Picture Although he was embarrassed, at first, about the role, which Plummer described as \"so awful and sentimental and gooey\", [45] the film made cinematic history, becoming the all-time top-grossing film, eclipsing Gone with the Wind [46] He found all aspects of making the film unpleasant, except working with Andrews, and he avoided using its name, instead calling it \"that movie\", \"S&M\" and \"The Sound of Mucus\" [47] [48] He declined to attend the 40th Anniversary cast reunion, [49] but he did provide commentary on the 2005 DVD release [50]\n\n\n1980–1997: Return to theatre\nDuring this time Plummer appeared in the romantic drama Somewhere in Time (1980), the drama Eyewitness (1981), the comedy Dragnet (1987), and Shadow Dancing (1988) Plummer also did some voice work, such as his role of Henri the pigeon in An American Tail (1986) and the villainous Grand Duke of Owls in Rock-a-Doodle (1991), both directed by Don Bluth In 1982, he starred on Broadway production of the Shakespearean tragedy Othello, playing Iago opposite James Earl Jones' Moor [63] The production also featured performances from Kelsey Grammer as Cassio and Dianne Wiest as Desdemona New York Times theatre critic Frank Rich wrote in his original review, \"Mr Plummer, a sensational actor in peak form, has made something crushing out of Shakespeare's archvillain He gives us evil so pure -

{"title": "Brooklyn", "content": "\nToponymy\nThe name Brooklyn is derived from the original Dutch town of Breukelen The oldest mention of the settlement in the Netherlands is in a charter of 953 by Holy Roman Emperor Otto I as Broecklede [19] This form is made up of the words broeck, meaning bog or marshland, and lede, meaning small (dug) water stream, specifically in peat areas [20] Breuckelen on the American continent was established in 1646, and the name first appeared in print in 1663 [21] [22] [23]\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nColonial era\nThe Dutch were the first Europeans to settle Long Island's western edge, which was then largely inhabited by the Lenape, an Algonquian-speaking American Indian tribe often referred to in European documents by a variation of the place name \"Canarsie\" Bands were associated with place names, but the colonists thought their names represented different tribes The Breuckelen settlement was named after Breukelen in the Netherlands; it was part of New Netherland The Dutch West India Company lost little time in chartering the six original parishes (listed here by their later English town names): [28]\n\n\nNew Netherland\nThe Dutch were

in the Netherlands; it was part of New Netherland The Dutch West India Company lost little time in chartering the six original parishes (listed here by their later English town names): [28]\n\n\nProvince of New York\nPresent-day Brooklyn left Dutch hands after the English captured the New Netherland colony in 1664, a prelude to the Second Anglo-Dutch War New Netherland was taken in a naval action, and the English renamed the new capture for their naval commander, James, Duke of York, brother of the then monarch King Charles II and future king himself as King James II Brooklyn became a part of the West Riding of York Shire in the Province of New York, one of the Middle Colonies of nascent British America.\n\n\nRevolutionary War\nOn August 27, 1776, the Battle of Long Island (also known as the 'Battle of Brooklyn') was fought, the first major engagement fought in the American Revolutionary War after independence was declared, and the largest of the entire conflict British troops forced Continental Army troops under George Washington off the heights near the modern sites of Green-Wood Cemetery, Prospect Park, and Grand Army Plaza [32]\n\n\nPost-independence era\nThe first half of the 19th century saw the beginning of the development of urban areas on the economically strategic East River shore of Kings County, facing the adolescent City of New York confined to Manhattan Island The New York Navy Yard operated in Wallabout Bay (border between Fort Greene and Williamsburg) during the 19th century and two-thirds of the 20th century.\n\n\nUrbanization\nThe first half of the 19th century saw the beginning of the development of urban areas on the economically strategic East River shore of Kings County, facing the adolescent City of New York confined to Manhattan Island The New York Navy Yard operated in Wallabout Bay (border between Fort Greene and Williamsburg) during the 19th century and two-thirds of the 20th century.\n\n\nCivil War\nFervent in the Union cause, the city of Brooklyn played a major role in supplying troops and materiel for the American Civil War The best-known regiment to be sent off to war from the city was the 14th Brooklyn \"Red Legged Devils\" They fought from 1861 to 1864, wore red the entire war, and were the only regiment named after a city President Abraham Lincoln called them into service, making them part of a handful of three-year enlisted soldiers in April 1861 Unlike other regiments during the American Civil War, the 14th wore a uniform inspired by the French Chasseurs, a light infantry used for quick assaults.\n\n\nTwin city\nBrooklyn is referred to as the twin city of New York in the 1883 poem, \"The New Colossus\" by Emma Lazarus, which appears on a plaque inside the Statue of Liberty The poem calls New York Harbor \"the air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame\" As a twin city to New York, it played a role in national affairs that was later overshadowed by decades of subordination by its old partner and rival.\n\n\nSeth Low as mayor\nLow's time in office from 1882 to 1885 was marked by a number of reforms: [42]\n\n\nMayors of the City of Brooklyn\nBrooklyn elected a mayor from 1834 until 1898, after which it was consolidated into the City of Greater New York, whose own second mayor (1902–1903), Seth Low, had been Mayor of Brooklyn from 1882 to 1885 Since 1898, Brooklyn has, in place of a separate mayor, elected a Borough President.\n\n\nNew York City borough\nIn 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was completed, transportation to Manhattan was no longer by water only, and the City of Brooklyn's ties to the City of New York were strengthened.\n\n\nGeography\nBrooklyn is 97 square miles (250 km2) in area, of which 71 square miles (180 km2) is land (73%), and 26 square miles (67 km2) is water (27%); the borough is the second-largest by land area among the New York City's boroughs However, Kings County, coterminous with Brooklyn, is New York State's fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area [6] Brooklyn lies at the southwestern end of Long Island, and the borough's western border constitutes the island's western tip.\n\n\nClimate\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Brooklyn experiences a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), [47] with partial shielding from the Appalachian Mountains and moderating influences from the Atlantic Ocean Brooklyn receives plentiful precipitation all year round, with nearly 50 in (1,300 mm) yearly The area averages 234 days with at least some sunshine annually, and averages 57% of possible sunshine annually, accumulating 2,535 hours of sunshine per annum [48] Brooklyn lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 7b [49]\n\n\nBoroughscape\nBrooklyn's neighborhoods are dynamic in ethnic composition For example, the early to mid-20th century, Brownsville had a majority of Jewish residents; since the 1970s it has been majority African American Midwood during the early 20th century was filled with ethnic Irish, then filled with Jewish residents for nearly 50 years, and is slowly becoming a Pakistani enclave Brooklyn's most populous racial group, white, declined from 97.2% in 1930 to 46.9% by 1990 [55]\n\n\nNeighborhoods\nBrooklyn's neighborhoods are dynamic in ethnic composition For example, the early to mid-20th century, Brownsville had a majority of Jewish residents; since the 1970s it has

Brooklyn's most populous racial group, white, declined from 97.2% in 1930 to 46.9% by 1990 [55]\n\n\nCommunity diversity\nGiven New York City's role as a crossroads for immigration from around the world, Brooklyn has evolved a globally cosmopolitan ambiance of its own, demonstrating a robust and growing demographic and cultural diversity with respect to metrics including nationality, religion, race, and domiciliary partnership In 2010, 51.6% of the population was counted as members of religious congregations [63] In 2014, there were 914 religious organizations in Brooklyn, the 10th most of all counties in the nation [64] Brooklyn contains dozens of distinct neighborhoods representing many of the major culturally identified groups found within New York City Among the most prominent are listed below:\n\n\nJewish American\nOver 600,000 Jews, particularly Orthodox and Hasidic Jews, have become concentrated in such historically Jewish areas as Borough Park, Williamsburg, and Midwood, where there are many yeshivas, synagogues, and kosher restaurants, as well as a variety of Jewish businesses Adjacent to Borough Park, the Kensington area housed a significant population of Conservative Jews (under the aegis of such nationally prominent midcentury rabbis as Jacob Bosniak and Abraham Heller) [65] when it was still considered to be a subsection of Flatbush; many of their defunct facilities have been repurposed to serve extensions of the Borough Park Hasidic community Other notable religious Jewish neighborhoods with a longstanding cultural lineage include Canarsie, Sea Gate, and Crown Heights, home to the Chabad world headquarters Neighborhoods with largely defunct yet historically notable Jewish populations include central Flatbush, East Flatbush, Brownsville, East New York, Bensonhurst and Sheepshead Bay (particularly its Madison subsection) Many hospitals in Brooklyn were started by Jewish charities, including Maimonides Medical Center in Borough Park and Brookdale Hospital in East Flatbush [66] [67]\n\n\nChinese American\nOver 200,000 Chinese Americans live throughout the southern parts of Brooklyn, primarily concentrated in Sunset Park, Bensonhurst, Gravesend, and Homecrest Brooklyn is the borough that is home to the highest number of Chinatowns in New York City The largest concentration is in Sunset Park along 8th Avenue, which has become known for its Chinese culture since the opening of the now-defunct Winley Supermarket in 1986 spurred widespread settlement in the area It is called \"Brooklyn's Chinatown\" and originally it was a small Chinese enclave with Cantonese speakers being the main Chinese population during the late 1980s and 1990s, but since the 2000s, the Chinese population in the area dramatically shifted to majority Fuzhounese Americans, which contributed immensely to expanding this Chinatown, and bestowing the nicknames \"Fuzhou Town (福州埠), Brooklyn\" or the \"Little Fuzhou (小福州)\" of Brooklyn Many Chinese restaurants can be found throughout Sunset Park, and the area hosts a popular Chinese New Year celebration Since the 2000s going forward, the growing concentration of the Cantonese speaking population in Brooklyn have dramatically shifted to Bensonhurst/Gravesend and Homecrest creating newer Chinatowns of Brooklyn and these newer Brooklyn Chinatowns are known as \"Brooklyn's Little Hong Kong/Guangdong\" due to their Chinese populations being overwhelmingly Cantonese populated [70] [71]\n\n\nCaribbean and African American\nBrooklyn's African American and Caribbean communities are spread throughout much of Brooklyn Brooklyn's West Indian community is concentrated in the Crown Heights, Flatbush, East Flatbush, Kensington, and Canarsie neighborhoods in central Brooklyn Brooklyn is home to the largest community of West Indians outside of the Caribbean Although the largest West Indian groups in Brooklyn are Jamaicans, Guyanese and Haitians, there are West Indian immigrants from nearly every part of the Caribbean Crown Heights and Flatbush are home to many of Brooklyn's West Indian restaurants and bakeries Brooklyn has an annual, celebrated Carnival in the tradition of pre-Lenten celebrations in the islands [72] Started by natives of Trinidad and Tobago, the West Indian Labor Day Parade takes place every Labor Day on Eastern Parkway The Brooklyn Academy of Music also holds the DanceAfrica festival in late May, featuring street vendors and dance performances showcasing food and culture from all parts of Africa [73] [74] Since the opening of the IND Fulton Street Line in 1936, Bedford-Stuyvesant has been home to one of the most famous African American communities in the United States Working-class communities remain prevalent in Brownsville, East New York and Coney Island, while remnants of similar communities in Prospect Heights, Fort Greene and Clinton Hill have endured amid widespread gentrification.\n\n\nHispanic American\nIn the aftermath of World War II and subsequent urban renewal initiatives that decimated longtime Manhattan enclaves (most notably on the Upper West Side), Puerto Rican migrants began to settle in such waterfront industrial neighborhoods as Sunset Park, Red Hook and Gowanus, near the shipyards and factories where they worked The borough's Hispanic population diversified after the 1965 Hart-Cellar Act loosened restrictions on immigration from elsewhere in Latin America.\n\n\nRussian and Ukrainian American\nBrooklyn is also home to many Russians and Ukrainians, who are mainly concentrated in the areas of Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay Brighton Beach features many Russian and Ukrainian businesses and has been nicknamed Little Russia and Little Odessa, respectively In the 1970s, Soviet Jews won the right to immigrate, and many ended up in Brighton Beach In recent years, the non-Jewish Russian and Ukrainian communities of Brighton Beach have grown, and the area is now home to a diverse collection of immigrants from across the former USSR Smaller concentrations of Russian and Ukrainian Americans are scattered elsewhere in south Brooklyn, including Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Homecrest, Coney Island, and Mill Basin A growing community of Uzbek Americans have settled alongside them in recent years due to their ability to speak Russian [76] [77]\n\n\nPolish American\nBrooklyn's Polish inhabitants are historically concentrated in Greenpoint, home to Little Poland Other longstanding settlements in Borough Park and Sunset Park have endured, while more recent immigrants are scattered throughout the southern parts of Brooklyn alongside the Russian and Ukrainian American communities.\n\n\nItalian American\nDespite widespread migration to Staten Island and more suburban areas in metropolitan New York throughout the postwar era, notable concentrations of Italian Americans continue to reside in the neighborhoods of Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights, Bay Ridge, Bath Beach and Gravesend Less perceptible remnants of older communities have persisted in Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens, where the homes of the remaining Italian Americans can often be contrasted with more recent upper middle class residents through the display of small Madonna statues, the retention of plastic-metal stoop awnings and the use of Formstone in house cladding All of the aforementioned neighborhoods have retained Italian restaurants, bakeries, delicatessens, pizzerias, cafes and social clubs.\n\n\nArab American & Muslim\nIn the early 20th century, many Lebanese and Syrian Christians settled around Atlantic Avenue west of Flatbush Avenue in Boerum Hill; more recently, this area has evolved into a Yemeni commercial district.\nMore recent, predominantly Muslim Arab immigrants, especially Egyptians and Lebanese, have moved into the southwest portion of Brooklyn, particularly to Bay Ridge, where many Middle Eastern restaurants, hookah lounges, halal grocers, Islamic shops and mosques line the commercial thoroughfares of Fifth and Third Avenues below 86th Street Brighton Beach is home to a growing Pakistani American community, while Midwood is home to Little Pakistan along Coney Island Avenue (recently co-named Muhammad Ali Jinnah Way) Pakistani Independence Day is celebrated every year with parades and parties on Coney Island Avenue Just to the north, Kensington is one of New York's several emerging Bangladeshi enclaves.\n\n\nIrish American\nThird-, fourth- and fifth-generation Irish Americans can be found throughout Brooklyn, with moderate concentrations [clarification needed] enduring in the neighborhoods of Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Bay Ridge, Marine Park and Gerritsen Beach Historical communities also existed in Vinegar Hill and other waterfront industrial neighborhoods, such as Greenpoint and Sunset Park Paralleling the Italian American community, many moved to Staten Island and suburban areas in the postwar era Those that stayed engendered close-knit, stable working-to-middle class communities through employment in the civil service (especially in law enforcement, transportation, and the New York City Fire Department) and the building and construction trades, while others were subsumed by the professional-managerial class and largely shed the Irish American community's distinct cultural traditions (including continued worship in the Catholic Church and other social activities, such as Irish stepdance and frequenting Irish American bars) [citation needed]\n\n\nSouth Asian American\nWhile not as extensive as the Indian American population in Queens, younger professionals of Asian Indian origin are finding Brooklyn to be a convenient alternative to Manhattan to find housing Nearly 30,000 \nIndian Americans call Brooklyn home [citation needed]\n\n\nGreek American\nBrooklyn's Greek Americans live throughout the borough A historical concentration has endured in Bay Ridge and adjacent areas, where there is a noticeable cluster of Hellenic-focused schools, businesses and cultural institutions Other businesses are situated in Downtown Brooklyn near Atlantic Avenue As in much of the New York metropolitan area, Greek-owned diners are found throughout the borough.\n\n\nLGBTQ community\nBrooklyn is home to a large and growing number of same-sex couples Same-sex marriages in New York were legalized on June 24, 2011, and were authorized to take place beginning 30 days thereafter [78] The Park Slope neighborhood spearheaded the popularity of Brooklyn among lesbians, and Prospect Heights has an LGBT residential presence [79] Numerous neighborhoods have since become home to LGBT communities Brooklyn Liberation March, the largest transgender-rights demonstration in LGBTQ history, took place on June 14, 2020, stretching from Grand Army Plaza to Fort Greene, focused on supporting Black transgender lives, drawing an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 participants [80] [81]\n\n\nArtists-in-residence\nBrooklyn became a preferred site for artists and hipsters to set up live/work spaces after being priced out of the same types of living arrangements in Manhattan Various neighborhoods in Brooklyn, including Williamsburg, DUMBO, Red Hook, and Park Slope evolved as popular neighborhoods for artists-in-residence However, rents and costs of living have since increased dramatically in these same neighborhoods, forcing artists to move to somewhat less expensive neighborhoods in Brooklyn or across Upper New York Bay to locales in New Jersey, such as Jersey City or Hoboken [82]\n\n\nDemographics\n\nAt the 2020 census, 2,736,074 people lived in Brooklyn The United States Census Bureau had estimated Brooklyn's population increased by 2.2% to 2,559,903

It is located in the southwestern part of Long Island, and is separated from Queens and Nassau County by the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and Jamaica Bay, respectively. Brooklyn is the second-largest county in New York State by land area, and is home to a diverse population with a rich history and culture.\n\n# Toponymy\n\nThe name Brooklyn is derived from the original Dutch town of Breukelen, which was established in 1646. The name is made up of the words \"broeck,\" meaning bog or marshland, and \"lede,\" meaning small (dug) water stream, specifically in peat areas. Breuckelen on the American continent was established in 1646, and the name first appeared in print in 1663.\n\n# History\n\n## Colonial era\n\nThe Dutch were the first Europeans to settle Long Island's western edge, which was then largely inhabited by the Lenape, an Algonquian-speaking American Indian tribe often referred to in European documents by a variation of the place name \"Canarsie.\" Bands were associated with place names, but the colonists thought their names represented different tribes. The Breuckelen settlement was named after Breukelen in the Netherlands; it was part of New Netherland. The Dutch West India Company lost little time in chartering the six original parishes (listed here by their later English town names): \n\n## Province of New York\n\nPresent-day Brooklyn left Dutch hands after the English captured the New Netherland colony in 1664, a prelude to the Second Anglo-Dutch War. New Netherland was taken in a naval action, and the English renamed the new capture for their naval commander, James, Duke of York, brother of the then monarch King Charles II and future king himself as King James II. Brooklyn became a part of the West Riding of York Shire in the Province of New York, one of the Middle Colonies of nascent British America.\n\n## Revolutionary War\n\nOn August 27, 1776, the Battle of Long Island (also known as the 'Battle of Brooklyn') was fought, the first major engagement fought in the American Revolutionary War after independence was declared, and the largest of the entire conflict. British troops forced Continental Army troops under George Washington off the heights near the modern sites of Green-Wood Cemetery, Prospect Park, and Grand Army Plaza.\n\n## Post-independence era\n\nThe first half of the 19th century saw the beginning of the development of urban areas on the economically strategic East River shore of Kings County, facing the adolescent City of New York confined to Manhattan Island. The New York Navy Yard operated in Wallabout Bay (border between Fort Greene and Williamsburg) during the 19th century and two-thirds of the 20th century.\n\n# Urbanization\n\nThe first half of the 19th century saw the beginning of the development of urban areas on the economically strategic East River shore of Kings County, facing the adolescent City of New York confined to Manhattan Island. The New York Navy Yard operated in Wallabout Bay (border between Fort Greene and Williamsburg) during the 19th century and two-thirds of the 20th century.\n\n# Civil War\n\nFervent in the Union cause, the city of Brooklyn played a major role in supplying troops and materiel for the American Civil War. The best-known regiment to be sent off to war from the city was the 14th Brooklyn \"Red Legged Devils.\" They fought from 1861 to 1864, wore red the entire war, and were the only regiment named after a city. President Abraham Lincoln called them into service, making them part of a handful of three-year enlisted soldiers in April 1861. Unlike other regiments during the American Civil War, the 14th wore a uniform inspired by the French Chasseurs, a light infantry used for quick assaults.\n\n# Twin city\n\nBrooklyn is referred to as the twin city of New York in the 1883 poem, \"The New Colossus\" by Emma Lazarus, which appears on a plaque inside the Statue of Liberty. The poem calls New York Harbor \"the air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.\" As a twin city to New York, it played a role in national affairs that was later overshadowed by decades of subordination by its old partner and rival.\n\n# Seth Low as mayor\n\nLow's time in office from 1882 to 1885 was marked by a number of reforms.\n\n# Mayors of the City of Brooklyn\n\nBrooklyn elected a mayor from 1834 until 1898, after which it was consolidated into the City of Greater New York, whose own second mayor (1902–1903), Seth Low, had been Mayor of Brooklyn from 1882 to 1885. Since 1898, Brooklyn has, in place of a separate mayor, elected a Borough President.\n\n# New York City borough\n\nIn 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was completed, transportation to Manhattan was no longer by water only, and the City of Brooklyn's ties to the City of New York were strengthened.\n\n# Geography\n\nBrooklyn is 97 square miles (250 km2) in area, of which 71 square miles (180 km2) is land (73%), and 26 square miles (67 km2) is water (27%). The borough is the second-largest by land area among the New York City's boroughs. Brooklyn lies at the southwestern end of Long Island, and the borough's western border constitutes the island's western tip.\n\n# Climate\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Brooklyn experiences a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), with partial shielding from the Appalachian Mountains and moderating influences from the Atlantic Ocean. Brooklyn receives plentiful precipitation all year round, with nearly 50 in (1,300 mm) yearly. The area averages 234 days with at least some sunshine annually, and averages 57% of possible sunshine annually, accumulating 2,535 hours of sunshine per annum. Brooklyn lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 7b.\n\n# Boroughscape\n\nBrooklyn's neighborhoods are dynamic in ethnic composition. For example, the early to mid-20th century, Brownsville had a majority of Jewish residents; since the 1970s it has been majority African American. Midwood during the early 20th century was filled with ethnic Irish, then filled with Jewish residents for nearly 50 years, and is slowly becoming a Pakistani enclave. Brooklyn's most populous racial group, white, declined from 97.2% in 1930 to 46.9% by 1990.\n\n# Community diversity\n\nGiven New York City's role as a crossroads for immigration from around the world, Brooklyn has evolved a globally cosmopolitan ambiance of its own, demonstrating a robust and growing demographic and cultural diversity with respect to metrics including nationality, religion, race, and domiciliary partnership. In 2010, 51.6% of the population was counted as members of religious congregations. In 2014, there were 914 religious organizations in Brooklyn, the 10th most of all counties in the nation.\n\n# Jewish American\n\nOver 600,000 Jews, particularly Orthodox and Hasidic Jews, have become concentrated in such historically Jewish areas as Borough Park, Williamsburg, and Midwood, where there are many yeshivas, synagogues, and kosher restaurants, as well as a variety of Jewish businesses.\n\n# Chinese American\n\nOver 200,000 Chinese Americans live throughout the southern parts of Brooklyn, primarily concentrated in Sunset Park, Bensonhurst, Gravesend, and Homecrest. Brooklyn is the borough that is home to the highest number of Chinatowns in New York City. The largest concentration is in Sunset Park along 8th Avenue, which has become known for its Chinese culture since the opening of the now-defunct Winley Supermarket in 1986 spurred widespread settlement in the area.\n\n# Caribbean and African American\n\nBrooklyn's African American and Caribbean communities are spread throughout much of Brooklyn. Brooklyn's West Indian community is concentrated in the Crown Heights, Flatbush, East Flatbush, Kensington, and Canarsie neighborhoods in central Brooklyn. Brooklyn is home to the largest community of West Indians outside of the Caribbean.\n\n# Hispanic American\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II and subsequent urban renewal initiatives that decimated longtime Manhattan enclaves (most notably on the Upper West Side), Puerto Rican migrants began to settle in such waterfront industrial neighborhoods as Sunset Park, Red Hook and Gowanus, near the shipyards and factories where they worked.\n\n# Russian and Ukrainian American\n\nBrooklyn is also home to many Russians and Ukrainians, who are mainly concentrated in the areas of Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay. Brighton Beach features many Russian and Ukrainian businesses and has been nicknamed Little Russia and Little Odessa, respectively. In the 1970s, Soviet Jews won the right to immigrate, and many ended up in Brighton Beach.\n\n# Polish American\n\nBrooklyn's Polish inhabitants are historically concentrated in Greenpoint, home to Little Poland. Other longstanding settlements in Borough Park and Sunset Park have endured, while more recent immigrants are scattered throughout the southern parts of Brooklyn alongside the Russian and Ukrainian American communities.\n\n# Italian American\n\nDespite widespread migration to Staten Island and more suburban areas in metropolitan New York throughout the postwar era, notable concentrations of Italian Americans continue to reside in the neighborhoods of Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights, Bay Ridge, Bath Beach and Gravesend. Less perceptible remnants of older communities have persisted in Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens, where the homes of the remaining Italian Americans can often be contrasted with more recent upper middle class residents through the display of small Madonna statues, the retention of plastic-metal stoop awnings and the use of Formstone in house cladding.\n\n# Hispanic American\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II and subsequent urban renewal initiatives that decimated longtime Manhattan enclaves (most notably on the Upper West Side), Puerto Rican migrants began to settle in such waterfront industrial neighborhoods as Sunset Park, Red Hook and Gowanus, near the shipyards and factories where they worked.\n\n# Arab American & Muslim\n\nIn the early 20th century, many Lebanese and Syrian Christians settled around Atlantic Avenue west of Flatbush Avenue in Boerum Hill; more recently, this area has evolved into a Yemeni commercial district. More recent, predominantly Muslim Arab immigrants, especially Egyptians and Lebanese, have moved into the southwest portion of Brooklyn, particularly to Bay Ridge, where many Middle Eastern restaurants, hookah lounges, halal grocers, Islamic shops and mosques line the commercial thoroughfares of Fifth and Third Avenues below 86th Street.\n\n# Irish American\n\nThird-, fourth- and fifth-generation Irish Americans can be found throughout Brooklyn, with moderate concentrations enduring in the neighborhoods of Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Bay Ridge, Marine Park and Gerritsen Beach. Historical communities also existed in Vinegar Hill and other waterfront industrial neighborhoods, such as Greenpoint and Sunset Park.\n\n# South Asian American\n\nWhile not as extensive as the Indian American population in Queens, younger professionals of Asian Indian origin are finding Brooklyn to be a convenient alternative to Manhattan to find housing. Nearly 30,000 Indian Americans call Brooklyn home.\n\n# Greek American\n\nBrooklyn's Greek Americans live throughout the borough. A historical concentration has endured in Bay Ridge and adjacent areas, where there are noticeable clusters of Hellenic-focused schools, businesses and cultural institutions. Other businesses are situated in Downtown Brooklyn near Atlantic Avenue.\n\n# LGBTQ community\n\nBrooklyn is home to a large and growing number of same-sex couples. Same-sex marriages in New York were legalized on June 24, 2011, and were authorized to take place beginning 30 days thereafter. The Park Slope neighborhood spearheaded the popularity of Brooklyn among lesbians, and Prospect Heights has an LGBT residential presence.\n\n# Artists-in-residence\n\nBrooklyn became a preferred site for artists and hipsters to set up live/work spaces after being priced out of the same types of living arrangements in Manhattan. Various neighborhoods in Brooklyn, including Williamsburg, DUMBO, Red Hook, and Park Slope evolved as popular neighborhoods for artists-in-residence. However, rents and costs of living have since increased dramatically in these same neighborhoods, forcing artists to move to somewhat less expensive neighborhoods in Brooklyn or across Upper New York Bay to locales in New Jersey, such as Jersey City or Hoboken.\n\n# Demographics\n\nAt the 2020 census, 2,736,074 people lived in Brooklyn. The United States Census Bureau had estimated Brooklyn's population increased by 2.2% to 2,559,903 between 2010 and 2019. Brooklyn's estimated population represented 30.7% of New York City's estimated population of 8,336,817; 33.5% of Long Island's population of 7,701,172; and 13.2% of New York State's population of 19,542,209.\n\n# Economy\n\nBrooklyn's job market is driven by three main factors: the performance of the national and city economy, population flows and the borough's position as a convenient back office for New York's businesses.\n\n# Parks and other attractions\n\nBrooklyn's major professional sports team is the NBA's Brooklyn Nets. The Nets moved into the borough in 2012, and play their home games at Barclays Center in Prospect Heights. Previously, the Nets had played in Uniondale, New York and in New Jersey. In April 2020, the New York Liberty of the WNBA were sold to the Nets' owners and moved their home venue from Madison Square Garden to the Barclays Center.\n\n# Transportation\n\nAbout 57 percent of all households in Brooklyn were households without automobiles. The citywide rate is 55 percent in New York City.\n\n# Public transport\n\nAbout 57 percent of all households in Brooklyn were households without automobiles. The citywide rate is 55 percent in New York City.\n\n# Roadways\n\nMost of the limited-access expressways and parkways are in the western and southern sections of Brooklyn, where the borough's two interstate highways are located. The Queens-Midtown Tunnel connects to Queens and Jamaica Bay.\n\n# Waterways\n\nBrooklyn was long a major shipping port, especially at the Brooklyn Army Terminal and Bush Terminal in Sunset Park. Most container ship cargo operations have shifted to the New Jersey side of New York Harbor, while the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook is a focal point for New York's growing cruise industry.\n\n# Partnerships with districts of foreign cities\n\nBrooklyn has partnerships with several districts of foreign cities.\n\n# Hospitals and healthcare\n\nBrooklyn has several hospitals and healthcare facilities.\n\n# See also\n\n* List of neighborhoods in Brooklyn\n* List of parks in Brooklyn\n* List of hospitals in Brooklyn\n* List of people from Brooklyn\n* List of Brooklyn

nation [64] Brooklyn contains dozens of distinct neighborhoods representing many of the major culturally identified groups found within New York City Among the most prominent are listed below:\n\n\nJewish American\nOver 600,000 Jews, particularly Orthodox and Hasidic Jews, have become concentrated in such historically Jewish areas as Borough Park, Williamsburg, and Midwood, where there are many yeshivas, synagogues, and kosher restaurants, as well as a variety of Jewish businesses Adjacent to Borough Park, the Kensington area housed a significant population of Conservative Jews (under the aegis of such nationally prominent midcentury rabbis as Jacob Bosniak and Abraham Heller) [65] when it was still considered to be a subsection of Flatbush; many of their defunct facilities have been repurposed to serve extensions of the Borough Park Hasidic community Other notable religious Jewish neighborhoods with a longstanding cultural lineage include Canarsie, Sea Gate, and Crown Heights, home to the Chabad world headquarters Neighborhoods with largely defunct yet historically notable Jewish populations include central Flatbush, East Flatbush, Brownsville, East New York, Bensonhurst and Sheepshead Bay (particularly its Madison subsection) Many hospitals in Brooklyn were started by Jewish charities, including Maimonides Medical Center in Borough Park and Brookdale Hospital in East Flatbush [66] [67]\n\n\nChinese American\nOver 200,000 Chinese Americans live throughout the southern parts of Brooklyn, primarily concentrated in Sunset Park, Bensonhurst, Gravesend, and Homecrest Brooklyn is the borough that is home to the highest number of Chinatowns in New York City The largest concentration is in Sunset Park along 8th Avenue, which has become known for its Chinese culture since the opening of the now-defunct Winley Supermarket in 1986 spurred widespread settlement in the area It is called \"Brooklyn's Chinatown\" and originally it was a small Chinese enclave with Cantonese speakers being the main Chinese population during the late 1980s and 1990s, but since the 2000s, the Chinese population in the area dramatically shifted to majority Fuzhounese Americans, which contributed immensely to expanding this Chinatown, and bestowing the nicknames \"Fuzhou Town (福州埠), Brooklyn\" or the \"Little Fuzhou (小福州)\" of Brooklyn Many Chinese restaurants can be found throughout Sunset Park, and the area hosts a popular Chinese New Year celebration Since the 2000s going forward, the growing concentration of the Cantonese speaking population in Brooklyn have dramatically shifted to Bensonhurst/Gravesend and Homecrest creating newer Chinatowns of Brooklyn and these newer Brooklyn Chinatowns are known as \"Brooklyn's Little Hong Kong/Guangdong\" due to their Chinese populations being overwhelmingly Cantonese populated [70] [71]\n\n\nCaribbean and African American\nBrooklyn's African American and Caribbean communities are spread throughout much of Brooklyn Brooklyn's West Indian community is concentrated in the Crown Heights, Flatbush, East Flatbush, Kensington, and Canarsie neighborhoods in central Brooklyn Brooklyn is home to the largest community of West Indians outside of the Caribbean Although the largest West Indian groups in Brooklyn are Jamaicans, Guyanese and Haitians, there are West Indian immigrants from nearly every part of the Caribbean Crown Heights and Flatbush are home to many of Brooklyn's West Indian restaurants and bakeries Brooklyn has an annual, celebrated Carnival in the tradition of pre-Lenten celebrations in the islands [72] Started by natives of Trinidad and Tobago, the West Indian Labor Day Parade takes place every Labor Day on Eastern Parkway The Brooklyn Academy of Music also holds the DanceAfrica festival in late May, featuring street vendors and dance performances showcasing food and culture from all parts of Africa [73] [74] Since the opening of the IND Fulton Street Line in 1936, Bedford-Stuyvesant has been home to one of the most famous African American communities in the United States Working-class communities remain prevalent in Brownsville, East New York and Coney Island, while remnants of similar communities in Prospect Heights, Fort Greene and Clinton Hill have endured amid widespread gentrification.\n\n\nHispanic American\nIn the aftermath of World War II and subsequent urban renewal initiatives that decimated longtime Manhattan enclaves (most notably on the Upper West Side), Puerto Rican migrants began to settle in such waterfront industrial neighborhoods as Sunset Park, Red Hook and Gowanus, near the shipyards and factories where they worked The borough's Hispanic population diversified after the 1965 Hart-Cellar Act loosened restrictions on immigration from elsewhere in Latin America.\n\n\nRussian and Ukrainian American\nBrooklyn is also home to many Russians and Ukrainians, who are mainly concentrated in the areas of Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay Brighton Beach features many Russian and Ukrainian businesses and has been nicknamed Little Russia and Little Odessa, respectively In the 1970s, Soviet Jews won the right to immigrate, and many ended up in Brighton Beach In recent years, the non-Jewish Russian and Ukrainian communities of Brighton Beach have grown, and the area is now home to a diverse collection of immigrants from across the former USSR Smaller concentrations of Russian and Ukrainian Americans are scattered elsewhere in south Brooklyn, including Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Homecrest, Coney Island, and Mill Basin A growing community of Uzbek Americans have settled alongside them in recent years due to their ability to speak Russian [76] [77]\n\n\nPolish American\nBrooklyn's Polish inhabitants are historically concentrated in Greenpoint, home to Little Poland Other longstanding settlements in Borough Park and Sunset Park have endured, while more recent immigrants are scattered throughout the southern parts of Brooklyn alongside the Russian and Ukrainian American communities.\n\n\nItalian American\nDespite widespread migration to Staten Island and more suburban areas in metropolitan New York throughout the postwar era, notable concentrations of Italian Americans continue to reside in the neighborhoods of Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights, Bay Ridge, Bath Beach and Gravesend Less perceptible remnants of older communities have persisted in Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens, where the homes of the remaining Italian Americans can often be contrasted with more recent upper middle class residents through the display of small Madonna statues, the retention of plastic-metal stoop awnings and the use of Formstone in house cladding All of the aforementioned neighborhoods have retained Italian restaurants, bakeries, delicatessens, pizzerias, cafes and social clubs.\n\n\nArab American & Muslim\nIn the early 20th century, many Lebanese and Syrian Christians settled around Atlantic Avenue west of Flatbush Avenue in Boerum Hill; more recently, this area has evolved into a Yemeni commercial district.\nMore recent, predominantly Muslim Arab immigrants, especially Egyptians and Lebanese, have moved into the southwest portion of Brooklyn, particularly to Bay Ridge, where many Middle Eastern restaurants, hookah lounges, halal grocers, Islamic shops and mosques line the commercial thoroughfares of Fifth and Third Avenues below 86th Street Brighton Beach is home to a growing Pakistani American community, while Midwood is home to Little Pakistan along Coney Island Avenue (recently co-named Muhammad Ali Jinnah Way) Pakistani Independence Day is celebrated every year with parades and parties on Coney Island Avenue Just to the north, Kensington is one of New York's several emerging Bangladeshi enclaves.\n\n\nIrish American\nThird-, fourth- and fifth-generation Irish Americans can be found throughout Brooklyn, with moderate concentrations [clarification needed] enduring in the neighborhoods of Windsor Terrace, Park Slope, Bay Ridge, Marine Park and Gerritsen Beach Historical communities also existed in Vinegar Hill and other waterfront industrial neighborhoods, such as Greenpoint and Sunset Park Paralleling the Italian American community, many moved to Staten Island and suburban areas in the postwar era Those that stayed engendered close-knit, stable working-to-middle class communities through employment in the civil service (especially in law enforcement, transportation, and the New York City Fire Department) and the building and construction trades, while others were subsumed by the professional-managerial class and largely shed the Irish American community's distinct cultural traditions (including continued worship in the Catholic Church and other social activities, such as Irish stepdance and frequenting Irish American bars) [citation needed]\n\n\nSouth Asian American\nWhile not as extensive as the Indian American population in Queens, younger professionals of Asian Indian origin are finding Brooklyn to be a convenient alternative to Manhattan to find housing Nearly 30,000 \nIndian Americans call Brooklyn home [citation needed]\n\n\nGreek American\nBrooklyn's Greek Americans live throughout the borough A historical concentration has endured in Bay Ridge and adjacent areas, where there is a noticeable cluster of Hellenic-focused schools, businesses and cultural institutions Other businesses are situated in Downtown Brooklyn near Atlantic Avenue As in much of the New York metropolitan area, Greek-owned diners are found throughout the borough.\n\n\nLGBTQ community\nBrooklyn is home to a large and growing number of same-sex couples Same-sex marriages in New York were legalized on June 24, 2011, and were authorized to take place beginning 30 days thereafter [78] The Park Slope neighborhood spearheaded the popularity of Brooklyn among lesbians, and Prospect Heights has an LGBT residential presence [79] Numerous neighborhoods have since become home to LGBT communities Brooklyn Liberation March, the largest transgender-rights demonstration in LGBTQ history, took place on June 14, 2020, stretching from Grand Army Plaza to Fort Greene, focused on supporting Black transgender lives, drawing an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 participants [80] [81]\n\n\nArtists-in-residence\nBrooklyn became a preferred site for artists and hipsters to set up live/work spaces after being priced out of the same types of living arrangements in Manhattan Various neighborhoods in Brooklyn, including Williamsburg, DUMBO, Red Hook, and Park Slope evolved as popular neighborhoods for artists-in-residence However, rents and costs of living have since increased dramatically in these same neighborhoods, forcing artists to move to somewhat less expensive neighborhoods in Brooklyn or across Upper New York Bay to locales in New Jersey, such as Jersey

{"title": "Adolf_Eichmann", "content": "\nEarly life and education\nOtto Adolf Eichmann, [a] the eldest of five children, was born in 1906 to a Calvinist family in Solingen, Germany [7] His parents were Adolf Karl Eichmann, a bookkeeper, and Maria (née Schefferling), a housewife [8] [9] [d] The elder Adolf moved to Linz, Austria, in 1913 to take a position as commercial manager for the Linz Tramway and Electrical Company, and the rest of the family followed a year later After the death of Maria in 1916, Eichmann's father married Maria Zawrzel, a devout Protestant with two sons [10]\n\n\nEarly career\nOn the advice of family friend and local SS leader Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Eichmann joined the Austrian branch of the Nazi Party on 1 April 1932, member number 889,895 [19] His membership in the SS was confirmed seven months later (SS member number 45,326) [20] His regiment was SS-Standarte 37, responsible for guarding the party headquarters in Linz and protecting party speakers at rallies, which would often become violent Eichmann pursued party activities in Linz at weekends while continuing in his position at Vacuum Oil in Salzburg [15]\n\n\nWorld War II\nWithin weeks of the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, Nazi policy toward the Jews changed from voluntary emigration to forced deportation [48] After discussions with Hitler in the preceding weeks, on 21 September SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, head of the SD, advised his staff that Jews were to be collected into cities in Poland with good rail links to facilitate their expulsion from territories controlled by Germany, starting with areas that had been incorporated into the Reich He announced plans to create a reservation in the General Government (the portion of Poland not incorporated into the Reich), where Jews and others deemed undesirable would await further deportation [49] On 27 September 1939 the SD and the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo, \"Security Police\") – the latter comprising the Geheime Staatspolizei (Gestapo) and Kriminalpolizei (Kripo) police agencies – were combined into the new Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA, \"Reich Security Main Office\"), which was placed under Heydrich's control [50]\n\n\nPolicy transition from emigration to deportation\nWithin weeks of the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, Nazi policy toward the Jews changed from voluntary emigration to forced deportation [48] After discussions with Hitler in the preceding weeks, on 21 September SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, head of the SD, advised his staff that Jews were to be collected into cities in Poland with good rail links to facilitate their expulsion from territories controlled by Germany, starting with areas that had been incorporated into the Reich He announced plans to create a reservation in the General Government (the portion of Poland not incorporated into the Reich), where Jews and others deemed undesirable would await further deportation [49] On 27 September 1939 the SD and the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo, \"Security Police\") – the latter comprising the Geheime Staatspolizei (Gestapo) and Kriminalpolizei (Kripo) police agencies – were combined into the new Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA, \"Reich Security Main Office\"), which was placed under Heydrich's control [50]\n\n\nWannsee Conference\nFrom the start of the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Einsatzgruppen (task forces) followed the army into conquered areas and rounded up and killed Jews, Comintern officials, and ranking members of the Communist Party [66] Eichmann was one of the officials who received regular detailed reports of their activities [67] On 31 July, Göring gave Heydrich written authorisation to prepare and submit a plan for a \"total solution of the Jewish question\" in all territories under German control and to co-ordinate the participation of all involved government organisations [68] The Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered [69]\n\n\nOccupation of Hungary\nGermany invaded Hungary on 19 March 1944 Eichmann arrived the same day, and was soon joined by top members of his staff and five or six hundred members of the SD, SS, and SiPo [86] [87] Hitler's appointment of a Hungarian government more amenable to the Nazis meant that the Hungarian Jews, who had remained essentially unharmed until that point, would now be deported to Auschwitz concentration camp to serve as forced labour or be gassed [86] [88] Eichmann toured northeastern Hungary in the last week of April and visited Auschwitz in May to assess the preparations [89] During the Nuremberg Trials, Rudolf Höss, commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp, testified that Himmler had told Höss to receive all operational instructions for the implementation of the Final Solution from Eichmann [90] Round-ups began on 16 April, and from 14 May, four trains of 3,000 Jews per day left Hungary and travelled to the camp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, arriving along a newly built spur line that terminated a few hundred metres away from the gas chambers [91] [92] Between 10 and 25 per cent of the people on each train were chosen as forced labourers; the rest were killed within hours of arrival [91] [93] Under international pressure, the Hungarian government halted deportations on 6 July 1944, by which time over 437,000 of Hungary's 725,000 Jews had died [91] [94] In spite of the orders to stop, Eichmann personally made arrangements for additional trains of victims to be sent to Auschwitz on 17 and 19 July [95]\n\n\nAfter World War II\nAt the end of the war, Eichmann was captured by US forces and spent time in several camps for SS officers using forged papers that identified him as Otto Eckmann He escaped from a work detail at Cham, Germany, when he realised that his identity had been discovered He obtained new identity papers with the name of Otto Heninger and relocated frequently over the next several months, moving ultimately to the Lüneburg Heath He initially found work in the forestry industry and later leased a small plot of land in Altensalzkoth, where he lived until 1950 [104] Meanwhile, former commandant of Auschwitz Rudolf Höss and others gave damning evidence about Eichmann at the Nuremberg trials of major war criminals starting in 1946 [105]\n\n\nCapture in Argentina\nSeveral Holocaust survivors, including the Jewish Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, dedicated themselves to finding Eichmann and other Nazis [117] In 1953, Wiesenthal learned from a letter shown to him that Eichmann had been seen in Buenos Aires, and he passed that information to the Israeli consulate in Vienna in 1954 [118] Eichmann's father died in 1960, prompting Wiesenthal to make arrangements for private detectives to surreptitiously photograph members of the family Eichmann's brother Otto was said to bear a strong family resemblance, and there were no current photos of Eichmann Wiesenthal provided these photographs to Mossad agents on 18 February [119]\n\n\nTrial in Jerusalem\nEichmann was taken to a fortified police station at Yagur in Israel, where he spent nine months [158] The Israelis were unwilling to take him to trial based solely on the evidence in documents and witness testimony, so he was subject to daily interrogations, the transcripts of which totalled over 3,500 pages [159] The interrogator was Chief Inspector Avner Less of the national police [160] Using documents provided primarily by Yad Vashem and Nazi hunter Tuviah Friedman, Less was often able to determine when Eichmann was lying or being evasive [161] When additional information was brought forward that forced Eichmann into admitting what he had done, Eichmann would insist he had no authority in the Nazi hierarchy and was only following orders [161] Less noted that Eichmann did not seem to realise the enormity of his crimes and showed no remorse [162] His pardon plea, released in 2016, did not contradict this: \"There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders\", Eichmann wrote \"I was not a responsible leader, and as such do not feel myself guilty.\" [163] Israeli police interrogator Mickey Goldman, who had survived the Holocaust, deliberately wore a short sleeved shirt when questioning Eichmann so that his camp ID tattoo was always visible, and remarked that Eichmann seemed disappointed that he had somehow managed to escape the concentration camp system alive [164]\n\n\nAppeals and execution\nEichmann's defence team appealed the verdict to the Israeli Supreme Court The appeal was heard by a five-judge Supreme Court panel consisting of Supreme Court President Yitzhak Olshan and judges Shimon Agranat, Moshe Zilberg, Yoel Zussman, and Alfred Witkon [204] The defence team mostly relied on legal arguments about Israel's jurisdiction and the legality of the laws under which Eichmann was charged [205] Appeal hearings took place between 22 and 29 March 1962 [206] Eichmann's wife Vera flew to Israel and saw him for the last time at the end of April [207] On 29 May, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal and upheld the District Court's judgment on all counts [208]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe trial received widespread coverage by the press in West Germany, and many schools added material studying the issues to their curricula [218] In Israel, the testimony of witnesses at the trial led to a deeper awareness of the impact of the Holocaust on survivors, especially among younger citizens [219] The trial reduced the previously popular idea that Jews had gone \"like sheep to the slaughter\" [220]\n\n\nSee also\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nInformational notes\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nBibliography\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nExternal links\n\n",

After the war, Eichmann went into hiding, but was eventually captured by Israeli agents and brought to trial in Jerusalem in 1961. The trial, which was widely publicized, was a significant moment in the history of the Holocaust, as it provided a detailed account of Eichmann's role in the extermination of millions of Jews.\n\n**Early Life and Education**\n\nOtto Adolf Eichmann, the eldest of five children, was born on March 19, 1906, in Solingen, Germany.

of Hungary's 725,000 Jews had died [91] [94] In spite of the orders to stop, Eichmann personally made arrangements for additional trains of victims to be sent to Auschwitz on 17 and 19 July [95]\n\n\nAfter World War II\nAt the end of the war, Eichmann was captured by US forces and spent time in several camps for SS officers using forged papers that identified him as Otto Eckmann He escaped from a work detail at Cham, Germany, when he realised that his identity had been discovered He obtained new identity papers with the name of Otto Heninger and relocated frequently over the next several months, moving ultimately to the Lüneburg Heath He initially found work in the forestry industry and later leased a small plot of land in Altensalzkoth, where he lived until 1950 [104] Meanwhile, former commandant of Auschwitz Rudolf Höss and others gave damning evidence about Eichmann at the Nuremberg trials of major war criminals starting in 1946 [105]\n\n\nCapture in Argentina\nSeveral Holocaust survivors, including the Jewish Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal, dedicated themselves to finding Eichmann and other Nazis [117] In 1953, Wiesenthal learned from a letter shown to him that Eichmann had been seen in Buenos Aires, and he passed that information to the Israeli consulate in Vienna in 1954 [118] Eichmann's father died in 1960, prompting Wiesenthal to make arrangements for private detectives to surreptitiously photograph members of the family Eichmann's brother Otto was said to bear a strong family resemblance, and there were no current photos of Eichmann Wiesenthal provided these photographs to Mossad agents on 18 February [119]\n\n\nTrial in Jerusalem\nEichmann was taken to a fortified police station at Yagur in Israel, where he spent nine months [158] The Israelis were unwilling to take him to trial based solely on the evidence in documents and witness testimony, so he was subject to daily interrogations, the transcripts of which totalled over 3,500 pages [159] The interrogator was Chief Inspector Avner Less of the national police [160] Using documents provided primarily by Yad Vashem and Nazi hunter Tuviah Friedman, Less was often able to determine when Eichmann was lying or being evasive [161] When additional information was brought forward that forced Eichmann into admitting what he had done, Eichmann would insist he had no authority in the Nazi hierarchy and was only following orders [161] Less noted that Eichmann did not seem to realise the enormity of his crimes and showed no remorse [162] His pardon plea, released in 2016, did not contradict this: \"There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders\", Eichmann wrote \"I was not a responsible leader, and as such do not feel myself guilty.\" [163] Israeli police interrogator Mickey Goldman, who had survived the Holocaust, deliberately wore a short sleeved shirt when questioning Eichmann so that his camp ID tattoo was always visible, and remarked that Eichmann seemed disappointed that he had somehow managed to escape the concentration camp system alive [164]\n\n\nAppeals and execution\nEichmann's defence team appealed the verdict to the Israeli Supreme Court The appeal was heard by a five-judge Supreme Court panel consisting of Supreme Court President Yitzhak Olshan and judges Shimon Agranat, Moshe Zilberg, Yoel Zussman, and Alfred Witkon [204] The defence team mostly relied on legal arguments about Israel's jurisdiction and the legality of the laws under which Eichmann was charged [205] Appeal hearings took place between 22 and 29 March 1962 [206] Eichmann's wife Vera flew to Israel and saw him for the last time at the end of April [207] On 29 May, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal and upheld the District Court's judgment on all counts [208]\n\n\nAftermath\nThe trial received widespread coverage by the press in West Germany, and many schools added material studying the issues to their curricula [218] In Israel, the testimony of witnesses at the trial led to a deeper awareness of the impact of the Holocaust on survivors, especially among younger citizens [219] The trial reduced the previously popular idea that Jews had gone \"like sheep to the slaughter\" [220]\n\n\nSee

Today, there are numerous monarchies around the world, each with its unique characteristics, traditions, and systems of succession. This article provides an overview of the various types of monarchies, their lines of succession, and a comprehensive list of current monarchies.\n\n## Types of Monarchy\n\nMonarchies can be broadly categorized into several types based on their characteristics and systems of governance. These categories are not mutually exclusive, and many monarchies exhibit features of multiple types.\n\n### Absolute Monarchies\n\nIn absolute monarchies, the monarch holds complete and unrestricted authority, with no constitutional limits on their power. Examples of absolute monarchies include Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Brunei.\n\n### Constitutional Monarchies\n\nConstitutional monarchies, on the other hand, have a monarch who serves as the head of state but whose powers are limited by a constitution or laws. Examples of constitutional monarchies include the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan.\n\n### Elective Monarchies\n\nElective monarchies are those where the monarch is chosen by a group or institution, rather than through hereditary succession. Examples of elective monarchies include the Holy Roman Empire (which existed from the 10th to the 19th century) and the Papacy.\n\n### Diarchies and Triarchies\n\nSome monarchies are diarchies or triarchies, where two or three individuals share the throne. Examples of diarchies include Andorra and the Principality of Liechtenstein, while an example of a triarchy is the United Arab Emirates.\n\n### Tribal Monarchies\n\nTribal monarchies are those where the monarch is the leader of a specific tribe or ethnic group. Examples of tribal monarchies include the monarchies of the Arabian Peninsula, such as those of Oman and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n## Lines of Succession\n\nSome of the extant sovereign monarchies have lines of succession that go back to the medieval period or antiquity. For example, the British monarch has a line of succession that dates back to the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Similarly, the Japanese monarch has a line of succession that dates back to the 12th century, while the monarch of the United Arab Emirates has a line of succession that dates back to the 18th century.\n\n### Systems of Succession\n\nMonarchies can have different systems of succession, including:\n\n* **Primogeniture**: The eldest child inherits the throne, regardless of sex.\n* **Salic Law**: The throne is inherited by the eldest son, with daughters excluded from the line of succession.\n* **Elective Succession**: The monarch is chosen by a group or institution, rather than through hereditary succession.\n\n### Hereditary Succession\n\nHereditary succession is the most common system of succession in monarchies. In hereditary succession, the throne is passed down from one generation to the next, typically through a system of primogeniture or salic law.\n\n## Current Monarchies\n\nThere are numerous monarchies around the world, each with its unique characteristics, traditions, and systems of succession. Here is a list of current monarchies:\n\n### Europe\n\n* **United Kingdom**: Queen Elizabeth II\n* **Sweden**: King Carl XVI Gustaf\n* **Norway**: King Harald V\n* **Denmark**: Queen Margrethe II\n* **Netherlands**: King Willem-Alexander\n* **Belgium**: King Philippe\n* **Spain**: King Felipe VI\n* **Monaco**: Prince Albert II\n* **Liechtenstein**: Prince Hans-Adam II\n\n### Asia\n\n* **Japan**: Emperor Naruhito\n* **Thailand**: King Maha Vajiralongkorn\n* **Cambodia**: King Norodom Sihamoni\n* **Laos**: King Thongdy Siphandon\n* **Brunei**: Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah\n* **Malaysia**: Yang di-Pertuan Agong (rotates among 9 state monarchs)\n\n### Africa\n\n* **Morocco**: King Mohammed VI\n* **Tunisia**: Beji Caid Essebsi (interim president, monarchic system in transition)\n* **Eswatini**: King Mswati III\n* **Lesotho**: King Letsie III\n\n### Americas\n\n* **Canada**: King Charles III (represented by Governor General)\n* **Jamaica**: King Charles III (represented by Governor General)\n* **Bahamas**: King Charles III (represented by Governor General)\n\n### Oceania\n\n* **Papua New Guinea**: King Charles III (represented by Governor-General)\n\n### Pacific Islands\n\n* **Wallis and Futuna**: Three chiefdoms (Uvea, Alo, and Sigave) with monarchs chosen by local noble families\n* **Tuvalu**: King Charles III (represented by Governor-General)\n\n### Other\n\n* **Andorra**: Co-Princes (Episcopal and French)\n* **United Arab Emirates**: President (monarchic system in transition)\n* **Saudi Arabia**: King Salman\n* **Oman**: Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said\n\nThis list is not exhaustive, and there may be other monarchies not included here.

Somsé reported that some families in the country were hiding infected relatives in fear of being stigmatized, thus increasing the risk of transmission of the disease.\n\n## Sweden\n\nOn 15 August 2024, Sweden's Public Health Agency reported the first case outside Africa, which involved a person who had contracted clade I mpox during a stay in an area of Africa affected by the outbreak. In a public statement, the agency said that, while the case in itself did not represent a higher risk to the general population, occasional imported cases \"may continue to occur.\"\n\n## Taiwan\n\nOn 18 August 2024, the Public Health Bureau of the city council of Tainan, Taiwan, announced that as of 16 August, three cases of mpox had been confirmed in the city since the start of the year.\n\n## Thailand\n\nOn 21 August 2024, Thailand's Department of Disease Control confirmed a mpox case involving a 66-year-old European man who was a resident of Thailand and had returned from an African country affected by the outbreak.\n\n## New Zealand\n\nOn 9 September 2024, an mpox case was confirmed in New Zealand after attending the Winter Pride festival in Queenstown in August 2024. On 11 September, a second mpox case was linked to the Queenstown Winter Pride festival. By 20 September, a total of 11 cases of mpox were linked to the Winter Pride festival.\n\n## Clade II Cases\n\nSome countries have reported contemporary mpox cases that then turned out to be infections with clade II variants, presumably unrelated to the clade Ib outbreak. There is a global outbreak of clade II infections that began in 2022.\n\n## Pakistan\n\nOn 15 August 2024, Pakistan's National Command and Operation Center (NCOC) reported a suspected case of mpox in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, involving a resident of Mardan who had recently returned from an Arab Gulf state.\n\n## Portugal\n\nOn 16 August, Portugal's Directorate-General of Health (DGS) confirmed that three new cases of mpox had been confirmed in the country between May and July 2024.\n\n## Indonesia\n\nOn 17 August 2024, Indonesia's Independence day, the national Ministry of Health (Kemenkes) reported a total of 14 confirmed mpox cases from January to April 2024.\n\n## Philippines\n\nOn 19 August 2024, the Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) announced that a 33-year-old male from Metro Manila, with no prior history of traveling overseas, had tested positive for mpox the day prior.\n\n## Virology\n\nMpox is caused by the monkeypox virus. The virus is transmitted through close contact with infected animals or people, including in-person communication and other kinds of physical contact, contaminated bedsheets, clothing or needles, sexual contact, and consumption of contaminated meat.\n\n## Prevention and Mitigation\n\nIn early January 2023, the New Zealand Government purchased 5,000 vials of mpox vaccines, enough for 20,000 people. A further shipment of vaccine vials was ordered for the later half of 2023. Individuals eligible for the mpox vaccine included close physical contacts of people with mpox, including sexual partners and household contacts, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with multiple partners, transgender and cisgender women who are in sexual relationships with these men, and those recommended to have the vaccine by medical specialists.\n\n## Global Access to Mpox Vaccines\n\nOn 23 August 2024, the World Health Organization announced that partners like GAVI and UNICEF could start purchasing mpox vaccines before they received official approval from the agency, to expedite vaccine distribution across the African countries affected by the outbreak. The WHO had already invited vaccine manufacturers to submit an Expression of Interest for Emergency Use Listing (EUL) of their products on 9 August and was expected to grant an emergency license to the MVA-BN/Jynneos and LC16 vaccines in September 2024.\n\n## See Also\n\n* Monkeypox\n* Vaccination\n* Public Health\n* Disease Outbreak\n\n## Cited Works\n\n1.

The show is based on the life of Austrian Empress Elisabeth of Bavaria, commonly known as Sisi, and follows her journey as she navigates the complexities of court politics and her marriage to Emperor Franz Joseph.\n\n**Premise**\n\nThe show begins with the introduction of 16-year-old Bavarian Duchess Elisabeth \"Sisi\" von Wittelsbach, who falls in love with Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria, the intended fiancé of her older sister, Duchess Helene. Despite the societal norms of the time, Sisi and Franz Joseph decide to marry, which causes tension within the royal family. Sisi soon finds herself navigating the complexity of court politics and her husband's scheming family. Her mother-in-law, Archduchess Sophie, who is also her aunt, antagonizes her almost immediately. Maximilian, Franz Joseph's younger brother, tries to outshine his brother and prove that he is more worthy to rule.\n\n**Cast**\n\nThe show features a talented cast of actors, including Devrim Lingnau as Elisabeth \"Sisi\" von Wittelsbach, Philip Froissant as Emperor Franz Joseph, and Sandra Hüller as Archduchess Sophie. The cast brings depth and nuance to their characters, making the show feel authentic and engaging.\n\n**Episodes**\n\nThe show consists of six episodes, each approximately 45 minutes long. The episodes are well-paced and engaging, with a mix of drama, romance, and politics. The show's creators have done an excellent job of balancing the different storylines and character arcs, making the show feel cohesive and well-structured.\n\n**Production**\n\nThe show was produced by Netflix in collaboration with German production company Beta Cinema. The show was directed by Katrin Gebbe and Florian Cossen, with Bernd Lange and Janna Maria Nandzik writing the screenplay. The show was filmed in German, with subtitles provided in 32 languages. The show was dubbed into 14 languages, including English.\n\n**Development**\n\nThe show was developed based on the life of Austrian Empress Elisabeth of Bavaria, who is commonly known as Sisi. Sisi was a member of the Bavarian royal family and married Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria in 1854. The show's creators have taken creative liberties with Sisi's life, but the show is based on real events and historical figures.\n\n**Filming**\n\nFilming for the show began in August 2021 and was completed in January 2022. The show was filmed in German, with a mix of interior and exterior locations. The show's creators have done an excellent job of recreating the settings and atmosphere of 19th-century Austria.\n\n**Season 2**\n\nIn November 2022, Netflix renewed the show for a second season. Filming for the second season reportedly took place in Prague, Czech Republic in September 2023. The second season is expected to continue the story of Sisi and her family, with new characters and plotlines.\n\n**Reception**\n\nThe show premiered on September 29, 2022, to positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. The show debuted at number one on Netflix, with 47.2 million hours watched in four days. The show became Netflix's most-watched non-English language series for over a week, with 106.6 million hours streamed in 11 days. The show was in the top ten in 79 countries in its first week, and in 88 countries in its second week.\n\n**Soundtrack**\n\nThe show's soundtrack is composed by composer Natascha Bopp, who has done an excellent job of creating a fitting score for the show. The soundtrack features a mix of orchestral and choral elements, with a focus on classical music.\n\n**Historical Inaccuracies**\n\nWhile the show is based on real events and historical figures, it has taken some creative liberties with Sisi's life. The show's creators have admitted to making changes to the story and characters to make the show more engaging and dramatic. However, the show remains faithful to the spirit of Sisi's life and legacy.\n\nIn conclusion, The Empress is a well-crafted and engaging show that explores the life of Austrian Empress Elisabeth of Bavaria. The show features a talented cast, well-written characters, and a engaging storyline. The show's creators have done an excellent job of balancing drama, romance, and politics, making the show feel authentic and engaging.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Empress_(TV_series)\" following this outline:\n\n\nPremise\nSixteen-year-old Bavarian Duchess, Elisabeth \"Sisi\" von Wittelsbach, falls in love with Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria, the intended fiancé of her older sister, Duchess Helene, and they marry Arriving in Vienna, Sisi finds herself navigating the complexity of court politics and her husband's scheming family Her mother-in-law, Archduchess Sophie, who is also her aunt, antagonizes her almost immediately Maximilian, Franz Joseph's younger brother, tries to outshine his brother and prove that he is more worthy to rule.\n\n\nCast\nFranz has recently taken over as a young emperor following the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire In 1853, there is an assassination attempt on the life of Franz.\nIn 1853, Elisabeth (Sisi) and Helene travel with their mother, Ludovika, to meet 23-year-old Emperor Franz, who is expected to ask for Helene's hand.\nFranz's mother, Archduchess Sophie, is of the opinion that her son's union with Bayern Helene will validate Austria's claim to the German states At the party, he stuns everyone by deciding to marry Sisi.\n\n\nEpisodes\nFranz has recently taken over as a young emperor following the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire In 1853, there is an assassination attempt on the life of Franz.\nIn 1853, Elisabeth (Sisi) and Helene travel with their mother, Ludovika, to meet 23-year-old Emperor Franz, who is expected to ask for Helene's hand.\nFranz's mother, Archduchess Sophie, is of the opinion that her son's union with Bayern Helene will validate Austria's claim to the German states At the party, he stuns everyone by deciding to marry Sisi.\n\n\nProduction\nIn December 2020, Netflix announced it would start producing a six-part series with the working title The Empress, based on the life of Austrian Empress Elisabeth of Bavaria (nicknamed Sisi) It would be directed by Katrin Gebbe and Florian Cossen, with Bernd Lange and Janna Maria Nandzik writing Devrim Lingnau and Philip Froissant were announced in the lead roles [8]\n\n\nDevelopment\nIn December 2020, Netflix announced it would start producing a six-part series with the working title The Empress, based on the life of Austrian Empress Elisabeth of Bavaria (nicknamed Sisi) It would be directed by Katrin Gebbe and Florian Cossen, with Bernd Lange and Janna Maria Nandzik writing Devrim Lingnau and Philip Froissant were announced in the lead roles [8]\n\n\nFilming\nFilming began in August 2021 and was completed in January 2022 [9] The series was filmed in German [3] Netflix subsequently dubbed the series into 14 languages, including English Subtitles were provided in 32 languages [3]\n\n\nSeason 2\nIn November 2022, Netflix renewed the series for a second season [12] Filming for the second season reportedly took place in Prague, Czech Republic in September 2023 [13]\n\n\nReception\nThe Empress debuted at number one following its release on 29 September 2022, with 47.2 million hours watched in four days (29 September to 2 October 2022), [14] becoming Netflix's most-watched non-English language series for over a week [15] Within 11 days, it was running in approximately 18.7 million homes and was the second most-watched Netflix series worldwide (behind Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story), with 106.6 million hours streamed [14] It was in the top ten in 79 countries in its first week, and in 88 countries in its second week [14] Within 18 days, it was streamed for nearly 135 million hours in around 23.6 million homes worldwide [16]\n\n\nSoundtrack\n\n\nHistorical inaccuracies\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Johannes also learnt to play the violin and the basics of playing the cello From 1840 he studied piano with Otto Friedrich Willibald Cossel Cossel complained in 1842 that Brahms \"could be such a good player, but he will not stop his never-ending composing.\"\n\n\nRecitals\nIn 1847 Brahms made his first public appearance as a solo pianist in Hamburg, playing a fantasy by Sigismund Thalberg His first full piano recital, in 1848, included a fugue by Bach as well as works by Marxsen and contemporary virtuosi such as Jacob Rosenhain A second recital in April 1849 included Beethoven's Waldstein sonata and a waltz fantasia of his own composition and garnered favourable newspaper reviews [16]\n\n\nJuvenilia\nBrahms's juvenilia comprised piano music, chamber music and works for male voice choir Under the pseudonym 'G W Marks', some piano arrangements and fantasies were published by the Hamburg firm of Cranz in 1849 The earliest of Brahms's works which he acknowledged (his Scherzo Op 4 and the song Heimkehr Op 7 no 6) date from 1851 However, Brahms was later assiduous in eliminating all his juvenilia Even as late as 1880, he wrote to his friend Elise Giesemann to send him his manuscripts of choral music so that they could be destroyed [20]\n\n\nEarly adulthood (1850–1862)\nIn 1850 Brahms met the Hungarian violinist Ede Reményi and accompanied him in a number of recitals over the next few years This was his introduction to \"gypsy-style\" music such as the csardas, which was later to prove the foundation of his most lucrative and popular compositions, the two sets of Hungarian Dances (1869 and 1880) [21] [22] 1850 also marked Brahms's first contact (albeit a failed one) with Robert Schumann; during Schumann's visit to Hamburg that year, friends persuaded Brahms to send the former some of his compositions, but the package was returned unopened [23]\n\n\nCollaboration and travel\nIn 1850 Brahms met the Hungarian violinist Ede Reményi and accompanied him in a number of recitals over the next few years This was his introduction to \"gypsy-style\" music such as the csardas, which was later to prove the foundation of his most lucrative and popular compositions, the two sets of Hungarian Dances (1869 and 1880) [21] [22] 1850 also marked Brahms's first contact (albeit a failed one) with Robert Schumann; during Schumann's visit to Hamburg that year, friends persuaded Brahms to send the former some of his compositions, but the package was returned unopened [23]\n\n\nThe Schumanns and Leipzig\nBrahms visited Düsseldorf in October 1853, and, with a letter of introduction from Joachim, [30] was welcomed by Schumann and his wife Clara Schumann, greatly impressed and delighted by the 20-year-old's talent, published an article entitled \"Neue Bahnen\" (\"New Paths\") in the 28 October issue of the journal Neue Zeitschrift für Musik nominating Brahms as one who was \"fated to give expression to the times in the highest and most ideal manner\" [31]\n\n\nEarly compositions, reception, and polemics\nAfter the publication of his Op 10 Ballades for piano, Brahms published no further works until 1860 His major project of this period was the Piano Concerto in D minor, which he had begun as a work for two pianos in 1854 but soon realized needed a larger-scale format Based in Hamburg at this time, he gained, with Clara's support, a position as musician to the tiny court of Detmold, the capital of the Principality of Lippe, where he spent the winters of 1857 to 1860 and for which he wrote his two Serenades (1858 and 1859, Opp 11 and 16) In Hamburg he established a women's choir for which he wrote music and conducted To this period also belong his first two Piano Quartets (Op 25 and Op 26) and the first movement of the third Piano Quartet, which eventually appeared in 1875 [28]\n\n\nFailed aspirations\nBrahms's personal life was also troubled In 1859 he became engaged to Agathe von Siebold The engagement was soon broken off, but even after this Brahms wrote to her: \"I love you! I must see you again, but I am incapable of bearing fetters Please write me .. whether .. I may come again to clasp you in my arms, to kiss you, and tell you that I love you.\" They never saw one another again, and Brahms later confirmed to a friend that Agathe was his \"last love\" [39]\n\n\nMaturity (1862–1876)\nIn autumn 1862 Brahms made his first visit to Vienna, staying there over the winter Although Brahms entertained the idea of taking up conducting posts elsewhere, he based himself increasingly in Vienna and soon made it his home In 1863, he was appointed conductor of the Wiener Singakademie He surprised his audiences by programming many works by the early German masters such as Heinrich Schütz and J S Bach, and other early composers such as Giovanni Gabrieli; more recent music was represented by works of Beethoven and Felix Mendelssohn Brahms also wrote works for the choir, including his Motet, Op 29 Finding however that the post encroached too much of the time he needed for composing, he left the choir in June 1864 [41]\n\n\nMove to Vienna\nIn autumn 1862 Brahms made his first visit to Vienna, staying there over the winter Although Brahms entertained the idea of taking up conducting posts elsewhere, he based himself increasingly in Vienna and soon made it his home In 1863, he was appointed conductor of the Wiener Singakademie He surprised his audiences by programming many works by the early German masters such as Heinrich Schütz and J S Bach, and other early composers such as Giovanni Gabrieli; more recent music was represented by works of Beethoven and Felix Mendelssohn Brahms also wrote works for the choir, including his Motet, Op 29 Finding however that the post encroached too much of the time he needed for composing, he left the choir in June 1864 [41]\n\n\nWagner and his circle\nIn Vienna Brahms became an associate of two close members of Wagner's circle, his earlier friend Peter Cornelius and Karl Tausig, and of Joseph Hellmesberger Sr and Julius Epstein, respectively the Director and head of violin studies, and the head of piano studies, at the Vienna Conservatoire Brahms's circle grew to include the notable critic (and opponent of the 'New German School') Eduard Hanslick, the conductor Hermann Levi and the surgeon Theodor Billroth, who were to become amongst his greatest advocates [43] [44]\n\n\nRequiem and personal beliefs\nIn February 1865 Brahms's mother died, and he began to compose his large choral work A German Requiem, Op 45, of which six movements were completed by 1866 Premieres of the first three movements were given in Vienna, but the complete work was first given in Bremen in 1868 to great acclaim A seventh movement (the soprano solo \"Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit\") was added for the equally successful Leipzig premiere (February 1869) The work went on to receive concert and critical acclaim throughout Germany and also in England, Switzerland and Russia, marking effectively Brahms's arrival on the world stage [44]\n\n\nMounting successes and failed romance\nBrahms also experienced at this period popular success with works such as his first set of Hungarian Dances (1869), the Liebeslieder Waltzes, Op 52, (1868/69), and his collections of lieder (Opp 43 and 46–49) [44] Following such successes he finally completed a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years such as the cantata Rinaldo (1863–1868), his first two string quartets Op 51 nos 1 and 2 (1865–1873), the third piano quartet (1855–1875), and most notably his first symphony which appeared in 1876, but which had been begun as early as 1855 [52] [53]\n\n\nSuccess (1876–1889)\nBrahms's First Symphony, Op 68, appeared in 1876, though it had been begun (and a version of the first movement had been announced by Brahms to Clara and to Albert Dietrich) in the early 1860s During the decade it evolved very gradually; the finale may not have begun its conception until 1868 [56] Brahms was cautious and typically self-deprecating about the symphony during its creation, writing to his friends that it was \"long and difficult\", \"not exactly charming\" and, significantly, \"long and in C Minor\", which, as Richard Taruskin points out, made it clear \"that Brahms was taking on the model of models  [for a symphony]: Beethoven's Fifth.\" [57]\n\n\nFirst symphonies and orchestral music\nBrahms's First Symphony, Op 68, appeared in 1876, though it had been begun (and a version of the first movement had been announced by Brahms to Clara and to Albert Dietrich) in the early 1860s During the decade it evolved very gradually; the finale may not have begun its conception until 1868 [56] Brahms was cautious and typically self-deprecating about the symphony during its creation, writing to his friends that it was \"long and difficult\", \"not exactly charming\" and, significantly, \"long and in C Minor\", which, as Richard Taruskin points out, made it clear \"that Brahms was taking on the model of models  [for a symphony]: Beethoven's Fifth.\" [57]\n\n\nFame, criticism, and Dvořák\nIn May 1876, Cambridge University offered to grant honorary degrees of Doctor of Music to both Brahms and Joachim, provided that they composed new pieces as \"theses\" and were present in Cambridge to receive their degrees Brahms was averse to traveling to England and requested to receive the degree 'in absentia', offering as his thesis the previously performed (November 1876) symphony [58] But of the two, only Joachim went to England and was granted a degree Brahms \"acknowledged the invitation\" by giving the manuscript score and parts of his First Symphony to Joachim, who led the performance at Cambridge 8 March 1877 (English premiere) [59]\n\n\nLater symphonies and continuing recognition\nThe following years saw the premieres of his Third Symphony, Op 90 (1883) and his Fourth Symphony, Op 98 (1885) Richard Strauss, who had been appointed assistant to von Bülow at Meiningen, and had been uncertain about Brahms's music, found himself converted by the Third Symphony and was enthusiastic about the Fourth: \"a giant work, great in concept and invention\" [66] Another, but more cautious, supporter from the younger generation was Gustav Mahler, who first met Brahms in 1884 and remained a close acquaintance  He considered Brahms a conservative master who was more turned toward the past than the future He rated Brahms as technically superior to Anton Bruckner, but more earth-bound than Wagner and Beethoven [67]\n\n\nOld age (1889–1897)\nBrahms and Johann Strauss II were acquainted in the 1870s, but their close friendship belongs to the years 1889 and after Brahms admired much of Strauss's music and encouraged the composer to sign with his publisher Simrock In autographing a fan for Strauss's wife Adele, Brahms wrote the opening notes of The Blue Danube waltz, adding the words \"unfortunately not by Johannes Brahms\" [70] He made the effort, three weeks before his death, to attend the premiere of Johann Strauss's operetta Die Göttin der Vernunft (The Goddess of Reason) in March 1897 [70]\n\n\nFriendship with J. Strauss\nBrahms and Johann Strauss II were acquainted in the 1870s, but their close friendship belongs to the years 1889 and after Brahms admired much of Strauss's music and encouraged the composer to sign with his publisher Simrock In autographing a fan for Strauss's wife Adele, Brahms wrote the opening notes of The Blue Danube waltz, adding the words \"unfortunately not by Johannes Brahms\" [70] He made the effort, three weeks before his death, to attend the premiere of Johann Strauss's operetta Die Göttin der Vernunft (The Goddess of Reason) in March 1897 [70]\n\n\nLate chamber music and songs\nAfter the successful Vienna premiere of his Second String Quintet, Op 111 in 1890, the 57-year-old Brahms came to think that he might retire from composition, telling a friend that he \"had achieved enough; here I had before me a carefree old age and could enjoy it in peace.\" [71] He also began to find solace in escorting the mezzo-soprano Alice Barbi and may have proposed to her (she was only 28) [72] His admiration for Richard Mühlfeld, clarinettist with the Meiningen orchestra, revived his interest in composing and led him to write the Clarinet Trio, Op. 114 (1891); Clarinet Quintet, Op. 115 (1891); and the two Clarinet Sonatas, Op. 120 (1894).\n\n\nTerminal illness\nIn the summer of 1896 Brahms was diagnosed with jaundice and pancreatic cancer, and later in the year his Viennese doctor diagnosed him with liver cancer, from which his father Jakob had died [76] His last public appearance was on 7 March 1897, when he saw Hans Richter conduct his Symphony No 4; there was an ovation after each of the four movements [77] His condition gradually worsened and he died on 3 April 1897, in Vienna at the age of 63 Brahms is buried in the Vienna Central Cemetery in Vienna, under a monument designed by Victor Horta with sculpture by Ilse von Twardowski [78]\n\n\nMusic\nBrahms wrote a number of major works for orchestra, including four symphonies, two piano concertos (No 1 in D minor; No 2 in B-flat major), a Violin Concerto, a Double Concerto for violin and cello, and the Tragic Overture, along with the two Serenades, and the Academic Festival Overture.\n\n\nStyle and influences\nThe music of Brahms contains traditional genres and forms (e.g., sonata form), and debts to the Viennese Classical tradition The music of many of his contemporaries, especially the New German School, was more obviously innovative, virtuosic, and emotional or evocative, often with dramatic or programmatic elements In this context, many (e.g., Hanslick) saw Brahms as a conservative or reactionary champion of absolute music.\n\n\nBeethoven and the Viennese Classical tradition\nBrahms venerated Beethoven;

Brahms's music is known for its complexity, depth, and technical mastery, and his contributions to the development of classical music are still celebrated today.\n\n**Biography**\n\nBrahms was born on May 7, 1833, in Hamburg, Germany. His father, Johann Jakob Brahms, was a musician who played the double bass, and his mother, Johanna Henrika Christiane Nissen, was a seamstress. Brahms's early life was marked by a strong musical influence, and he began taking piano lessons at the age of four. By the time he was seven, he was already playing the piano with skill, and he continued to study music throughout his childhood.\n\n**Youth (1833–1850)**\n\nBrahms's early years were marked by a strong interest in music and a desire to become a composer. He began composing his own music at a young age, and by the time he was 12, he had already written several pieces. Brahms's early compositions were influenced by the music of Robert Schumann, who was a close friend and mentor. In 1847, Brahms made his first public appearance as a solo pianist in Hamburg, playing a fantasy by Sigismund Thalberg. This was followed by a full piano recital in 1848, which included a fugue by Bach and works by Marxsen and contemporary virtuosi such as Jacob Rosenhain.\n\n**Training**\n\nBrahms's musical training continued throughout his youth, and he studied piano with Otto Friedrich Willibald Cossel from 1840. Cossel complained in 1842 that Brahms \"could be such a good player, but he will not stop his never-ending composing.\" Brahms's compositions from this period, known as his \"juvenilia,\" include piano music, chamber music, and works for male voice choir. Under the pseudonym \"G W Marks,\" some of these compositions were published by the Hamburg firm of Cranz in 1849.\n\n**Recitals**\n\nBrahms's first full piano recital was held in 1848, and it included a fugue by Bach as well as works by Marxsen and contemporary virtuosi such as Jacob Rosenhain. A second recital in April 1849 included Beethoven's Waldstein sonata and a waltz fantasia of Brahms's own composition. This recital garnered favorable newspaper reviews, and Brahms's reputation as a pianist and composer began to grow.\n\n**Juvenilia**\n\nBrahms's juvenilia included piano music, chamber music, and works for male voice choir. Under the pseudonym \"G W Marks,\" some of these compositions were published by the Hamburg firm of Cranz in 1849. The earliest of Brahms's works that he acknowledged as his own date from 1851, including his Scherzo Op 4 and the song Heimkehr Op 7 no 6. However, Brahms was later assiduous in eliminating all his juvenilia, even as late as 1880, when he wrote to his friend Elise Giesemann to send him his manuscripts of choral music so that they could be destroyed.\n\n**Early adulthood (1850–1862)**\n\nIn 1850, Brahms met the Hungarian violinist Ede Reményi and accompanied him in a number of recitals over the next few years. This was his introduction to \"gypsy-style\" music such as the csardas, which was later to prove the foundation of his most lucrative and popular compositions, the two sets of Hungarian Dances (1869 and 1880). Brahms also made his first contact (albeit a failed one) with Robert Schumann during Schumann's visit to Hamburg in 1850.\n\n**Collaboration and travel**\n\nIn 1850, Brahms met the Hungarian violinist Ede Reményi and accompanied him in a number of recitals over the next few years. This was his introduction to \"gypsy-style\" music such as the csardas, which was later to prove the foundation of his most lucrative and popular compositions, the two sets of Hungarian Dances (1869 and 1880). Brahms also made his first contact (albeit a failed one) with Robert Schumann during Schumann's visit to Hamburg in 1850.\n\n**The Schumanns and Leipzig**\n\nIn 1853, Brahms visited Düsseldorf and, with a letter of introduction from Joachim, was welcomed by Schumann and his wife Clara Schumann. Brahms was greatly impressed and delighted by the 20-year-old's talent, and Schumann published an article entitled \"Neue Bahnen\" (\"New Paths\") in the 28 October issue of the journal Neue Zeitschrift für Musik, nominating Brahms as one who was \"fated to give expression to the times in the highest and most ideal manner.\"\n\n**Early compositions, reception, and polemics**\n\nAfter the publication of his Op 10 Ballades for piano, Brahms published no further works until 1860. His major project of this period was the Piano Concerto in D minor, which he had begun as a work for two pianos in 1854 but soon realized needed a larger-scale format. Based in Hamburg at this time, he gained, with Clara's support, a position as musician to the tiny court of Detmold, the capital of the Principality of Lippe, where he spent the winters of 1857 to 1860 and for which he wrote his two Serenades (1858 and 1859, Opp 11 and 16).\n\n**Failed aspirations**\n\nBrahms's personal life was also troubled. In 1859, he became engaged to Agathe von Siebold, but the engagement was soon broken off. Even after this, Brahms wrote to her: \"I love you! I must see you again, but I am incapable of bearing fetters. Please write me... whether... I may come again to clasp you in my arms, to kiss you, and tell you that I love you.\" They never saw one another again, and Brahms later confirmed to a friend that Agathe was his \"last love.\"\n\n**Maturity (1862–1876)**\n\nIn autumn 1862, Brahms made his first visit to Vienna, staying there over the winter. Although Brahms entertained the idea of taking up conducting posts elsewhere, he based himself increasingly in Vienna and soon made it his home. In 1863, he was appointed conductor of the Wiener Singakademie, where he surprised his audiences by programming many works by the early German masters such as Heinrich Schütz and J S Bach, and other early composers such as Giovanni Gabrieli.\n\n**Move to Vienna**\n\nIn autumn 1862, Brahms made his first visit to Vienna, staying there over the winter. Although Brahms entertained the idea of taking up conducting posts elsewhere, he based himself increasingly in Vienna and soon made it his home. In 1863, he was appointed conductor of the Wiener Singakademie, where he surprised his audiences by programming many works by the early German masters such as Heinrich Schütz and J S Bach, and other early composers such as Giovanni Gabrieli.\n\n**Wagner and his circle**\n\nIn Vienna, Brahms became an associate of two close members of Wagner's circle, his earlier friend Peter Cornelius and Karl Tausig, and of Joseph Hellmesberger Sr and Julius Epstein, respectively the Director and head of violin studies, and the head of piano studies, at the Vienna Conservatoire. Brahms's circle grew to include the notable critic (and opponent of the 'New German School') Eduard Hanslick, the conductor Hermann Levi, and the surgeon Theodor Billroth, who were to become amongst his greatest advocates.\n\n**Requiem and personal beliefs**\n\nIn February 1865, Brahms's mother died, and he began to compose his large choral work A German Requiem, Op 45, of which six movements were completed by 1866. Premieres of the first three movements were given in Vienna, but the complete work was first given in Bremen in 1868 to great acclaim.\n\n**Mounting successes and failed romance**\n\nBrahms also experienced at this period popular success with works such as his first set of Hungarian Dances (1869), the Liebeslieder Waltzes, Op 52 (1868/69), and his collections of lieder (Opp 43 and 46–49). Following such successes he finally completed a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years such as the cantata Rinaldo (1863–1868), his first two string quartets Op 51 nos 1 and 2 (1865–1873), the third piano quartet (1855–1875), and most notably his first symphony which appeared in 1876, but which had been begun as early as 1855.\n\n**Success (1876–1889)**\n\nBrahms's First Symphony, Op 68, appeared in 1876, though it had been begun (and a version of the first movement had been announced by Brahms to Clara and to Albert Dietrich) in the early 1860s. During the decade it evolved very gradually; the finale may not have begun its conception until 1868. Brahms was cautious and typically self-deprecating about the symphony during its creation, writing to his friends that it was \"long and difficult,\" \"not exactly charming,\" and, significantly, \"long and in C Minor,\" which, as Richard Taruskin points out, made it clear \"that Brahms was taking on the model of models [for a symphony]: Beethoven's Fifth.\"\n\n**Fame, criticism, and Dvořák**\n\nIn May 1876, Cambridge University offered to grant honorary degrees of Doctor of Music to both Brahms and Joachim, provided that they composed new pieces as \"theses\" and were present in Cambridge to receive their degrees. Brahms was averse to traveling to England and requested to receive the degree 'in absentia', offering as his thesis the previously performed (November 1876) symphony. But of the two, only Joachim went to England and was granted a degree. Brahms \"acknowledged the invitation\" by giving the manuscript score and parts of his First Symphony to Joachim, who led the performance at Cambridge 8 March 1877 (English premiere).\n\n**Later symphonies and continuing recognition**\n\nThe following years saw the premieres of his Third Symphony, Op 90 (1883) and his Fourth Symphony, Op 98 (1885). Richard Strauss, who had been appointed assistant to von Bülow at Meiningen, and had been uncertain about Brahms's music, found himself converted by the Third Symphony and was enthusiastic about the Fourth: \"a giant work, great in concept and invention.\" Another, but more cautious, supporter from the younger generation was Gustav Mahler, who first met Brahms in 1884 and remained a close acquaintance. He considered Brahms a conservative master who was more turned toward the past than the future.\n\n**Old age (1889–1897)**\n\nBrahms and Johann Strauss II were acquainted in the 1870s, but their close friendship belongs to the years 1889 and after. Brahms admired much of Strauss's music and encouraged the composer to sign with his publisher Simrock. In autographing a fan for Strauss's wife Adele, Brahms wrote the opening notes of The Blue Danube waltz, adding the words \"unfortunately not by Johannes Brahms.\" He made the effort, three weeks before his death, to attend the premiere of Johann Strauss's operetta Die Göttin der Vernunft (The Goddess of Reason) in March 1897.\n\n**Late chamber music and songs**\n\nAfter the successful Vienna premiere of his Second String Quintet, Op 111 in 1890, the 57-year-old Brahms came to think that he might retire from composition, telling a friend that he \"had achieved enough; here I had before me a carefree old age and could enjoy it in peace.\" He also began to find solace in escorting the mezzo-soprano Alice Barbi and may have proposed to her (she was only 28). His admiration for Richard Mühlfeld, clarinettist with the Meiningen orchestra, revived his interest in composing and led him to write the Clarinet Trio, Op 114 (1891); Clarinet Quintet, Op 115 (1891); and the two Clarinet Sonatas, Op 120 (1894).\n\n**Terminal illness**\n\nIn the summer of 1896 Brahms was diagnosed with jaundice and pancreatic cancer, and later in the year his Viennese doctor diagnosed him with liver cancer, from which his father Jakob had died. His last public appearance was on 7 March 1897, when he saw Hans Richter conduct his Symphony No 4; there was an ovation after each of the four movements. His condition gradually worsened and he died on 3 April 1897, in Vienna at the age of 63.\n\n**Music**\n\nBrahms wrote a number of major works for orchestra, including four symphonies, two piano concertos (No 1 in D minor; No 2 in B-flat major), a Violin Concerto, a Double Concerto for violin and cello, and the Tragic Overture, along with the two Serenades, and the Academic Festival Overture.\n\n**Style and influences**\n\nThe music of Brahms contains traditional genres and forms (e.g., sonata form), and debts to the Viennese Classical tradition. The music of many of his contemporaries, especially the New German School, was more obviously innovative, virtuosic, and emotional or evocative, often with dramatic or programmatic elements. In this context, many (e.g., Hanslick) saw Brahms as a conservative or reactionary champion of absolute music.\n\n**Beethoven and the Viennese Classical tradition**\n\nBrahms venerated Beethoven; in the composer's home, a marble bust of Beethoven looked down on the spot where he composed, and some passages in his works are reminiscent of Beethoven's style. Brahms's First Symphony bears strongly the influence of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, as the two works are both in C minor and end in the struggle towards a C major triumph.\n\n**Early Romantics**\n\nThe early Romantic composers had a major influence on Brahms, particularly Schumann, who encouraged Brahms as a young composer.\n\n**Alte Musik**\n\nBrahms looked to older music, with its counterpoint, for inspiration. He studied the music of pre-classical composers, including Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Giovanni Gabrieli, Johann Adolph Hasse, Heinrich Schütz, Domenico Scarlatti, George Frideric Handel, and Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\n**Textures**\n\nBrahms was a master of counterpoint. For Brahms, the most complicated forms of counterpoint were a natural means of expressing his emotions, writes Geiringer. As Palestrina or Bach succeeded in giving spiritual significance to their technique, so Brahms could turn a canon in motu contrario or a canon per augmentationem into a pure piece of lyrical poetry.\n\n**Performance practice**\n\nBrahms played principally on German and Viennese pianos. In his early years, he used a piano made by the Hamburg company Baumgarten & Heins. Later, in 1864, he wrote to Clara Schumann about his attraction to instruments by Streicher. In 1873, he received a Streicher piano op 6713 and kept it in his house until his death.\n\n**Influence**\n\nWithin his lifetime, Brahms's idiom left an imprint on several composers within his personal circle, who strongly admired his music, such as Heinrich von Herzogenberg, Robert Fuchs, and Julius Röntgen, as well as on Gustav Jenner, who was his only formal composition pupil. Antonín Dvořák, who received substantial assistance from Brahms, deeply admired his music and was influenced by it in several works, such as the Symphony No 7 in D minor and the F minor Piano Trio.\n\n**Second Viennese School**\n\nZemlinsky in turn taught Schoenberg, and Brahms was apparently impressed when in 1897 Zemlinsky showed him drafts of two movements of Schoenberg's early D-major quartet. Webern and later Walter Frisch identified Brahms's influence in the dense, cohesive textures and variation techniques of Schoenberg's first quartet.\n\n**Memorials**\n\nOn 14 September 2000, Brahms was honoured in the Walhalla, a German hall of fame. He was introduced there as the 126th \"rühmlich ausgezeichneter Teutscher\" [honorably distinguished German] and 13th composer among them, with a bust by sculptor Milan Knobloch.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Johannes_Brahms\" following this outline:\n\n\nBiography\nBrahms's father, Johann Jakob Brahms, was from the town of Heide in Holstein [1] [a] Against his family's will, Johann Jakob pursued a career in music, arriving in Hamburg at age 19 [1] He found work playing double bass for jobs;

the finale may not have begun its conception until 1868 [56] Brahms was cautious and typically self-deprecating about the symphony during its creation, writing to his friends that it was \"long and difficult\", \"not exactly charming\" and, significantly, \"long and in C Minor\", which, as Richard Taruskin points out, made it clear \"that Brahms was taking on the model of models  [for a symphony]: Beethoven's Fifth.\" [57]\n\n\nFame, criticism, and Dvořák\nIn May 1876, Cambridge University offered to grant honorary degrees of Doctor of Music to both Brahms and Joachim, provided that they composed new pieces as \"theses\" and were present in Cambridge to receive their degrees Brahms was averse to traveling to England and requested to receive the degree 'in absentia', offering as his thesis the previously performed (November 1876) symphony [58] But of the two, only Joachim went to England and was granted a degree Brahms \"acknowledged the invitation\" by giving the manuscript score and parts of his First Symphony to Joachim, who led the performance at Cambridge 8 March 1877 (English premiere) [59]\n\n\nLater symphonies and continuing recognition\nThe following years saw the premieres of his Third Symphony, Op 90 (1883) and his Fourth Symphony, Op 98 (1885) Richard Strauss, who had been appointed assistant to von Bülow at Meiningen, and had been uncertain about Brahms's music, found himself converted by the Third Symphony and was enthusiastic about the Fourth: \"a giant work, great in concept and invention\" [66] Another, but more cautious, supporter from the younger generation was Gustav Mahler, who first met Brahms in 1884 and remained a close acquaintance  He considered Brahms a conservative master who was more turned toward the past than the future He rated Brahms as technically superior to Anton Bruckner, but more earth-bound than Wagner and Beethoven [67]\n\n\nOld age (1889–1897)\nBrahms and Johann Strauss II were acquainted in the 1870s, but their close friendship belongs to the years 1889 and after Brahms admired much of Strauss's music and encouraged the composer to sign with his publisher Simrock In autographing a fan for Strauss's wife Adele, Brahms wrote the opening notes of The Blue Danube waltz, adding the words \"unfortunately not by Johannes Brahms\" [70] He made the effort, three weeks before his death, to attend the premiere of Johann Strauss's operetta Die Göttin der Vernunft (The Goddess of Reason) in March 1897 [70]\n\n\nFriendship with J. Strauss\nBrahms and Johann Strauss II were acquainted in the 1870s, but their close friendship belongs to the years 1889 and after Brahms admired much of Strauss's music and encouraged the composer to sign with his publisher Simrock In autographing a fan for Strauss's wife Adele, Brahms wrote the opening notes of The Blue Danube waltz, adding the words \"unfortunately not by Johannes Brahms\" [70] He made the effort, three weeks before his death, to attend the premiere of Johann Strauss's operetta Die Göttin der Vernunft (The Goddess of Reason) in March 1897 [70]\n\n\nLate chamber music and songs\nAfter the successful Vienna premiere of his Second String Quintet, Op 111 in 1890, the 57-year-old Brahms came to think that he might retire from composition, telling a friend that he \"had achieved enough; here I had before me a carefree old age and could enjoy it in peace.\" [71] He also began to find solace in escorting the mezzo-soprano Alice Barbi and may have proposed to her (she was only 28) [72] His admiration for Richard Mühlfeld, clarinettist with the Meiningen orchestra, revived his interest in composing and led him to write the Clarinet Trio, Op. 114 (1891); Clarinet Quintet, Op. 115 (1891); and the two Clarinet Sonatas, Op. 120 (1894).\n\n\nTerminal illness\nIn the summer of 1896 Brahms was diagnosed with jaundice and pancreatic cancer, and later in the year his Viennese doctor diagnosed him with liver cancer, from which his father Jakob had died [76] His last public appearance was on 7 March 1897, when he saw Hans Richter conduct his Symphony No 4; there was an ovation after each of the four movements [77] His condition gradually worsened and he died on 3 April 1897, in Vienna at the age of 63 Brahms is buried in the Vienna Central Cemetery in Vienna, under a monument designed by Victor Horta with sculpture by Ilse von Twardowski [78]\n\n\nMusic\nBrahms wrote a number of major works for orchestra, including four symphonies, two piano concertos (No 1 in D minor; No 2 in B-flat major), a Violin Concerto, a Double Concerto for violin and cello, and the Tragic Overture, along with the two Serenades, and the Academic Festival Overture.\n\n\nStyle and influences\nThe music of Brahms contains traditional genres and forms (e.g., sonata form), and debts to the Viennese Classical tradition The music of many of his contemporaries, especially the New German School, was more obviously innovative, virtuosic, and emotional or evocative, often with dramatic or programmatic elements In this context, many (e.g., Hanslick) saw Brahms as a conservative or reactionary champion of absolute music.\n\n\nBeethoven and the Viennese Classical tradition\nBrahms venerated Beethoven; in the composer's home, a marble bust of Beethoven looked down on the spot where he composed, and some passages in his works are reminiscent of Beethoven's style Brahms's First Symphony bears strongly the influence of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, as the two works are both in C minor and end in the struggle towards a C major triumph The main theme of the finale of the First Symphony is also reminiscent of the main theme of the finale of Beethoven's Ninth, and when this resemblance was pointed out to Brahms he replied that any dunce [82] could see that In 1876, when the work was premiered in Vienna, it was immediately hailed as \"Beethoven's Tenth\" Indeed, the similarity of Brahms's music to that of late Beethoven had first been noted as early as November 1853 in a letter from Albert Dietrich to Ernst Naumann [83] [84]\n\n\nEarly Romantics\nThe early Romantic composers had a major influence on Brahms, particularly Schumann, who encouraged Brahms as a young composer.\n\n\nAlte Musik\nBrahms looked to older music, with its counterpoint, for inspiration He studied the music of pre-classical composers, including Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Giovanni Gabrieli, Johann Adolph Hasse, Heinrich Schütz, Domenico Scarlatti, George Frideric Handel, and Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\n\nTextures\nBrahms was a master of counterpoint \"For Brahms, .. the most complicated forms of counterpoint were a natural means of expressing his emotions,\" writes Geiringer \"As Palestrina or Bach succeeded in giving spiritual significance to their technique, so Brahms could turn a canon in motu contrario or a canon per augmentationem into a pure piece of lyrical poetry.\" [92] Writers on Brahms have commented on his use of counterpoint For example, of Op 9, Variations on a Theme by Robert Schumann, Geiringer writes that Brahms \"displays all the resources of contrapuntal art\" [93] In the A major piano quartet Opus 26, Jan Swafford notes that the third movement is \"demonic-canonic, echoing Haydn's famous minuet for string quartet called the 'Witch's Round'\" [94] Swafford further opines that \"thematic development, counterpoint, and form were the dominant technical terms in which Brahms .. thought about music\" [95]\n\n\nPerformance practice\nBrahms played principally on German and Viennese pianos In his early years he used a piano made by the Hamburg company Baumgarten & Heins [99] Later, in 1864, he wrote to Clara Schumann about his attraction to instruments by Streicher [100] In 1873 he received a Streicher piano op 6713 and kept it in his house until his death [101] He wrote to Clara: \"There  [on my Streicher] I always know exactly what I write and why I write one way or another.\" [100] Another instrument in Brahms's possession was a Conrad Graf piano – a wedding present of the Schumanns, that Clara Schumann later gave to Brahms and which he kept until 1873 [102]\n\n\nReception\nBrahms looked both backward and forward His output was often bold in its exploration of harmony and textural elements, especially rhythm As a result, he influenced composers of both conservative and modernist tendencies.\n\n\nInfluence\nWithin his lifetime, Brahms's idiom left an imprint on several composers within his personal circle, who strongly admired his music, such as Heinrich von Herzogenberg, Robert Fuchs, and Julius Röntgen, as well as on Gustav Jenner, who was his only formal composition pupil Antonín Dvořák, who received substantial assistance from Brahms, deeply admired his music and was influenced by it in several works, such as the Symphony No 7 in D minor and the F minor Piano Trio.\n\n\nSecond Viennese School\nZemlinsky in turn taught Schoenberg, and Brahms was apparently impressed when in 1897 Zemlinsky showed him drafts of two movements of Schoenberg's early D-major quartet Webern and later Walter Frisch identified Brahms's influence in the dense, cohesive textures and variation techniques of Schoenberg's first quartet [117]\n\n\nMemorials\nOn 14 September 2000, Brahms was honoured in the Walhalla, a German hall of fame He was introduced there as the 126th \"rühmlich ausgezeichneter Teutscher\"  [honorably distinguished German] and 13th composer among them, with a bust by sculptor Milan Knobloch  [de] [120]\n\n\nNotes\n Category\n\n\nReferences\n Category\n\n\nCitations\n Category\n\n\nSources\n Category\n\n\nFurther reading\n Category\n\n\nExternal links\n Category\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The investigation into the accident revealed that it was caused by a combination of factors, including faulty situational awareness and the pilot's failure to navigate through the rolling cloud cover. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of safety and the need for strict adherence to protocols and procedures in military aviation operations.\n\n**References**\n\nNote: This article does not include any references or citations.

It is the largest office building in the world by floor area and has a total floor area of approximately 6.5 million square feet.\n\n**Layout and Facilities**\n\nThe Pentagon building spans 28.7 acres (116,000 m2), and includes an additional 5.1 acres (21,000 m2) as a central courtyard. The building has a total of five sides, each with a different purpose. The main entrance is located on the north side, and the other four sides are used for various functions such as the Secretary of Defense's office, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force offices. The building is designed to be a functional and efficient workspace, with a emphasis on security and surveillance.\n\n**History**\n\nUntil the Pentagon was built, the United States Department of War was headquartered in the Munitions Building, a temporary structure erected during World War I along Constitution Avenue on the National Mall. The War Department, which was a civilian agency created to administer the U.S Army, was spread out in additional temporary buildings on the National Mall, as well as dozens of other buildings in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia. In the late 1930s, during the Great Depression and federal construction program, a new War Department Building was constructed at 21st and C Streets in Foggy Bottom but, upon completion, the new building did not solve the department's space problem It became the headquarters of the Department of State.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe idea of building a new War Department headquarters was first proposed in 1909, but it was not until the 1930s that the project was seriously considered. The War Department was facing a growing space problem, with the existing buildings on the National Mall unable to accommodate the increasing number of personnel and equipment. The new building was designed to be a functional and efficient workspace, with a emphasis on security and surveillance.\n\n**Planning**\n\nGovernment officials agreed that the War Department building, officially designated Federal Office Building No 1, should be constructed in Arlington County, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. Requirements for the new building were that it be no more than four stories tall, and that it use a minimal amount of steel to reserve that resource for war needs. The requirements meant that, instead of rising vertically, the building would be sprawling over a large area. Possible sites for the building included the Department of Agriculture's Arlington Experimental Farm, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery, and the obsolete Hoover Field site.\n\n**Construction**\n\nContracts totaling $31,100,000 (equivalent to $497 million in 2023) were finalized with McShain and the other contractors on 11 September 1941, and ground was broken for the Pentagon the same day. Among the design requirements, Somervell required that the structural design accommodate floor loads of up to 150 psi (1,000 kPa), in case the building became a records storage facility after the end of the war. A minimal amount of steel was used as it was in short supply. Instead, the Pentagon was built as a reinforced concrete structure, using 680,000 tons of sand dredged from the Potomac River; a lagoon was also created beneath the Pentagon's river entrance. To minimize steel usage, concrete ramps were built rather than installing elevators. Indiana limestone was used for the building's façade.\n\n**Hall of Heroes**\n\nOn the building's main concourse is the Hall of Heroes, opened 1968 and dedicated to the more than 3,460 recipients of the Medal of Honor, the United States' highest military decoration. The three versions of the Medal of Honor – Army, Sea Service (for the Marine Corps, Navy, and Coast Guard), and Air Force (for the Air Force and Space Force) – are on display along with the names of recipients.\n\n**Renovation**\n\nFrom 1998 to 2011, the Pentagon was completely gutted and reconstructed in phases to bring it up to modern standards and improve security and efficiency. Asbestos was removed and all office windows were sealed.\n\n**Incidents**\n\nDuring the late 1960s, the Pentagon became a focal point for protests against the Vietnam War. A group of 2,500 women, organized by Women Strike for Peace, demonstrated outside Secretary of Defense Robert S McNamara's office at the Pentagon on 15 February 1967. In May 1967, a group of 20 demonstrators held a sit-in outside the Joint Chiefs of Staff's office, which lasted four days before they were arrested. In one of the better known incidents, on 21 October 1967, some 35,000 anti-war protesters organized by the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, gathered for a demonstration at the Defense Department (the \"March on the Pentagon\"). They were confronted by some 2,500 armed soldiers. During the protest, a famous picture was taken, where George Harris placed carnations into the soldiers' gun barrels. The march concluded with an attempt to \"exorcise\" the building.\n\n**September 11 Attacks**\n\nOn September 11, 2001, coincidentally the 60th anniversary of the Pentagon’s start of construction, five al-Qaeda affiliated hijackers took control of American Airlines Flight 77, en route from Washington Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport, and deliberately crashed the Boeing 757 airliner into the western side of the Pentagon at 9:37 am EDT as part of the September 11 attacks. The impact of the plane severely damaged the outer ring of one wing of the building and caused its partial collapse. At the time of the attacks, the Pentagon was under renovation and many offices were unoccupied, resulting in fewer casualties. Due to the renovation work, only 800 people were there, as opposed to the usual 4,500. Furthermore, the area hit, on the side of the Heliport façade, was the section best prepared for such an attack. The renovation there, improvements which resulted from the Oklahoma City bombing, had nearly been completed.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n* \n\n**See Also**\n\n* United States Department of Defense\n* Pentagon Renovation\n* Pentagon Memorial\n* National Mall\n* Washington, D.C.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The Pentagon is the largest office building in the world by floor area.\n* The building is designed to be a functional and efficient workspace, with a emphasis on security and surveillance.\n* The Pentagon is home to the United States Department of Defense, and is the headquarters for the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n* The building is surrounded by a large courtyard and a number of smaller buildings.\n* The Pentagon has a total of five sides, each with a different purpose.\n* The main entrance is located on the north side, and the other four sides are used for various functions such as the Secretary of Defense's office, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force offices.\n* The building is made of reinforced concrete, and features a number of unique architectural elements.\n* The Pentagon is home to a number of important artifacts, including the Hall of Heroes and a number of military memorials.\n* The building has undergone several renovations and expansions over the years, including a major renovation in the 1990s.\n* The Pentagon is a popular tourist destination, and offers a number of tours and exhibits.\n* The building is surrounded by a number of other important government buildings, including the White House and the Capitol Building.\n\n**References**\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n*", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"The_Pentagon\" following this outline:\n\n\nLayout and facilities\nThe Pentagon building spans 28.7 acres (116,000 m2), and includes an additional 5.1 acres (21,000 m2) as a central courtyard [10]\n\n\nHistory\nUntil the Pentagon was built, the United States Department of War was headquartered in the Munitions Building, a temporary structure erected during World War I along Constitution Avenue on the National Mall The War Department, which was a civilian agency created to administer the U.S Army, was spread out in additional temporary buildings on the National Mall, as well as dozens of other buildings in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia In the late 1930s, during the Great Depression and federal construction program, a new War Department Building was constructed at 21st and C Streets in Foggy Bottom but, upon completion, the new building did not solve the department's space problem It became the headquarters of the Department of State [17]\n\n\nBackground\nUntil the Pentagon was built, the United States Department of War was headquartered in the Munitions Building, a temporary structure erected during World War I along Constitution Avenue on the National Mall The War Department, which was a civilian agency created to administer the U.S Army, was spread out in additional temporary buildings on the National Mall, as well as dozens of other buildings in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia In the late 1930s, during the Great Depression and federal construction program, a new War Department Building was constructed at 21st and C Streets in Foggy Bottom but, upon completion, the new building did not solve the department's space problem It became the headquarters of the Department of State [17]\n\n\nPlanning\nGovernment officials agreed that the War Department building, officially designated Federal Office Building No 1, should be constructed in Arlington County, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C Requirements for the new building were that it be no more than four stories tall, and that it use a minimal amount of steel to reserve that resource for war needs The requirements meant that, instead of rising vertically, the building would be sprawling over a large area Possible sites for the building included the Department of Agriculture's Arlington Experimental Farm, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery, and the obsolete Hoover Field site [21]\n\n\nConstruction\nContracts totaling $31,100,000 (equivalent to $497 million in 2023 [1]) were finalized with McShain and the other contractors on 11 September 1941, and ground was broken for the Pentagon the same day [30] Among the design requirements, Somervell required that the structural design accommodate floor loads of up to 150 psi (1,000 kPa), in case the building became a records storage facility after the end of the war [26] A minimal amount of steel was used as it was in short supply Instead, the Pentagon was built as a reinforced concrete structure, using 680,000 tons of sand dredged from the Potomac River;

schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, Chaplin began to perform on stage He later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from Hannah one night in Aldershot [d] This was an isolated occurrence, but by the time he was nine Chaplin had, with his mother's encouragement, grown interested in performing He later wrote: \" [she] imbued me with the feeling that I had some sort of talent\" [31] Through his father's connections, [32] Chaplin became a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900 [e] Chaplin worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act [34]\n\n\nStage comedy and vaudeville\nChaplin soon found work with a new company and went on tour with his brother, who was also pursuing an acting career, in a comedy sketch called Repairs [45] In May 1906, Chaplin joined the juvenile act Casey's Circus, [46] where he developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon the star of the show By the time the act finished touring in July 1907, the 18-year-old had become an accomplished comedic performer [47] He struggled to find more work, however, and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure [g]\n\n\n1914–1917: entering films\nSix months into the second American

$10,000 [l] He joined the studio in late December 1914, [83] where he began forming a stock company of regular players, actors he worked with again and again, including Ben Turpin, Leo White, Bud Jamison, Paddy McGuire, Fred Goodwins and Billy Armstrong He soon recruited a leading lady, Edna Purviance, whom Chaplin met in a café and hired on account of her beauty She went on to appear in 35 films with Chaplin over eight years; [84] the pair also formed a romantic relationship that lasted until 1917 [85]\n\n\nMutual\nA contract was negotiated with Mutual that amounted to $670,000 [p] a year, [101] which Robinson says made Chaplin – at 26 years old – one of the highest-paid people in the world [102] The high salary shocked the public and was widely reported in the press [103] John R Freuler, the studio president, explained: \"We can afford to pay Mr Chaplin this large sum annually because the public wants Chaplin and will pay for him.\" [104]\n\n\n1918–1922: First National\nIn January 1918, Chaplin was visited by leading British singer and comedian Harry Lauder, and the two acted in a short film together [121]\n\n\nUnited Artists, Mildred Harris, and The Kid\nAfter the release of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin requested more money from First National, which was refused Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players–Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D W Griffith to form a new distribution company, United Artists, in January 1919 [133] The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control [134] Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National They refused and insisted that he complete the final six films owed [135]\n\n\n1923–1938: silent features\nHaving fulfilled his First National contract, Chaplin was free to make his first picture as an independent producer In November 1922, he began filming A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers [151] Chaplin intended it to be a star-making vehicle for Edna Purviance, [152] and did not appear in the picture himself other than in a brief, uncredited cameo [153] He wished the film to have a realistic feel and directed his cast to give restrained performances In real life, he explained, \"men and women try to hide their emotions rather than seek to express them\" [154] A Woman of Paris premiered in September 1923 and was acclaimed for its innovative, subtle approach [155] The public, however, seemed to have little interest in a Chaplin film without Chaplin, and it was a box office disappointment [156] The filmmaker was hurt by this failure – he had long wanted to produce a dramatic film and was proud of the result – and soon withdrew A Woman of Paris from circulation [157]\n\n\nA Woman of Paris and The Gold Rush\nHaving fulfilled his First National contract, Chaplin was free to make his first picture as an independent producer In November 1922, he began filming A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers [151] Chaplin intended it to be a star-making vehicle for Edna Purviance, [152] and did not appear in the picture himself other than in a brief,

Chaplin film without Chaplin, and it was a box office disappointment [156] The filmmaker was hurt by this failure – he had long wanted to produce a dramatic film and was proud of the result – and soon withdrew A Woman of Paris from circulation [157]\n\n\nLita Grey and The Circus\nWhile making The Gold Rush, Chaplin married for the second time Mirroring the circumstances of his first union, Lita Grey was a teenage actress, originally set to star in the film, whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced Chaplin into marriage She was 16 and he was 35, meaning Chaplin could have been charged with statutory rape under California law [169] He therefore arranged a discreet marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924 [170] They originally met during her childhood and she had previously appeared in his works The Kid and The Idle Class [171] Their first son, Charles Spencer Chaplin III, was born on 5 May 1925, followed by Sydney Earl Chaplin on 30 March 1926 [172] On 6 July 1925, Chaplin became the first movie star to be featured on a Time cover [173]\n\n\nCity Lights\nI was determined to continue making silent films .. I was a pantomimist and in that medium I was unique and, without false modesty, a master.\n\nTravels, Paulette Goddard and Modern Times\nCity Lights had been a success, but Chaplin was unsure if he could make another picture without dialogue He remained convinced that sound would not work in his films, but was also \"obsessed by a depressing fear of being old-fashioned\" [206] In this state of uncertainty, early in 1931, the comedian decided to take a holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months [207] [w] He spent months travelling Western Europe, including extended stays in France and Switzerland, and spontaneously decided to visit Japan [209] The day after he arrived in Japan, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated by ultra-nationalists in the May 15 Incident The group's original plan had been to provoke a war with the United States by assassinating Chaplin at a welcome reception organised by the prime minister, but the plan had been foiled due to delayed public announcement of the event's date [210]\n\n\n1939–1952: controversies and fading popularity\nThe 1940s saw Chaplin face a series of controversies, both in his work and in his personal life, which changed his fortunes and severely affected his popularity in the United States The first of these was his growing boldness in expressing his political beliefs Deeply disturbed by the surge of militaristic nationalism in 1930s world politics, [231] Chaplin found that he could not keep these issues out of his work [232] Parallels between himself and Adolf Hitler had been widely noted: the pair were born four days apart, both had risen from poverty to world prominence, and Hitler wore the same moustache style as Chaplin It was this physical resemblance that supplied the plot for Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism [233]\n\n\nThe Great Dictator\nThe 1940s saw Chaplin face a series of controversies, both in his work and

supplied the plot for Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism [233]\n\n\nLegal troubles and Oona O'Neill\nIn the mid-1940s, Chaplin was involved in a series of trials that occupied most of his time and significantly affected his public image [249] The troubles stemmed from his affair with an aspiring actress named Joan Barry, with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942 [250] Barry, who displayed obsessive behaviour and was twice arrested after they separated, [z] reappeared the following year and announced that she was pregnant with Chaplin's child As Chaplin denied the claim, Barry filed a paternity suit against him [251]\n\n\nMonsieur Verdoux and communist accusations\nChaplin claimed that the Barry trials had \"crippled  [his] creativeness\", and it was some time before he began working again [269] In April 1946, he finally began filming a project that had been in development since 1942 [270] Monsieur Verdoux was a black comedy, the story of a French bank clerk, Verdoux (Chaplin), who loses his job and begins marrying and murdering wealthy widows to support his family Chaplin's inspiration for the project came from Orson Welles, who wanted him to star in a film about the French serial killer Henri Désiré Landru Chaplin decided that the concept would \"make a wonderful comedy\", [271] and paid Welles $5,000 [ad] for the idea [272]\n\n\nLimelight and banning from the United States\nAlthough Chaplin remained politically active in the years following the failure of Monsieur Verdoux, [af] his next film, about a forgotten music hall comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States [296] The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden [297]\n\n\n1953–1977: European years\nI have been the object of lies and propaganda by powerful reactionary groups who, by their influence and by the aid of America's yellow press, have created an unhealthy atmosphere in which liberal-minded individuals can be singled out and persecuted Under these conditions I find it virtually impossible to continue my motion-picture work, and I have therefore given up my residence in the United States.\n\nMove to Switzerland and A King in New York\nI have been the object of lies and propaganda by powerful reactionary groups who, by their influence and by the aid of America's yellow press, have created an unhealthy atmosphere in which liberal-minded individuals can be singled out and persecuted Under these conditions I find it virtually impossible to continue my motion-picture work, and I have therefore given up my residence in the United States.\n\nFinal works and renewed appreciation\nIn the last two decades of his career, Chaplin concentrated on re-editing and scoring his old films for re-release, along with securing their ownership and distribution rights [329] In an interview he gave in 1959, the year of his 70th birthday, Chaplin stated that there was still \"room for the Little Man in the atomic age\" [330] The first of these re-releases was The Chaplin Revue (1959), which included new versions of A Dog's Life, Shoulder Arms, and The Pilgrim [330]\n\n\nDeath\nBy October 1977, Chaplin's health had declined to the point that he needed constant care [357] In the early morning of Christmas Day 1977, Chaplin died at home after having a stroke in his sleep [351] He was 88 years old The funeral, on 27 December, was a small and private Anglican ceremony, according to his wishes [358] [ak] Chaplin was interred in the Corsier-sur-Vevey cemetery [357] Among the film industry's tributes, director René Clair wrote, \"He was a monument of the cinema, of all countries and all times .. the most beautiful gift the cinema made to us.\" [360] Actor Bob Hope declared, \"We were lucky to have lived in his time.\" [361] Chaplin left more than $100 million to his widow [362]\n\n\nFilmmaking\nChaplin believed his first influence to be his mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting at the window and mimicking passers-by: \"it was through watching her that I learned not only how to express emotions with my hands and face, but also how to observe and study people.\" [365] Chaplin's early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work; he also attended the Christmas pantomimes at Drury Lane, where he studied the art of clowning through performers like Dan Leno [366] Chaplin's years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker Simon Louvish writes that the company was his \"training ground\", [367] and it was here that Chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy [368] The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno, [al] who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplin's gags [368] [369] From the film industry, Chaplin drew upon the work of the French comedian Max Linder, whose films he greatly admired [370] In developing the Tramp costume and persona, he was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene, where tramp characters were common [371]\n\n\nInfluences\nChaplin believed his first influence to be his mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting at the window and mimicking passers-by: \"it was through watching her

common [371]\n\n\nMethod\nChaplin never spoke more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, claiming such a thing would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion [372] Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime, [373] but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method [374]\n\n\nStyle and themes\nWhile Chaplin's comedic style is broadly defined as slapstick, [395] it is considered restrained and intelligent, [396] with the film historian Philip Kemp describing his work as a mix of \"deft, balletic physical comedy and thoughtful, situation-based gags\" [397] Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewer's relationship to the characters [71] [398] Unlike conventional slapstick comedies, Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin's films centre on the Tramp's attitude to the things happening to him: the humour does not come from the Tramp bumping into a tree, but from his lifting his hat to the tree in apology [71] Dan Kamin writes that Chaplin's \"quirky mannerisms\" and \"serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action\" are other key aspects of his comedy, [399] while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of in-camera trickery are also common features [400] His signature style consisted of gestural idiosyncrasies like askew derby hat, drooping shoulders, deflated chest and dangling arms and tilted back pelvis to enrich the comic persona of his 'tramp' character His shabby but neat clothing and incessant grooming behaviour along with his geometrical walk and movement gave his onscreen characters a puppet-like quality [401]\n\n\nComposing\nChaplin developed a passion for music as a child and taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello [430] He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important, [188] and from A Woman of Paris onwards he took an increasing interest in this area [431] With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for City Lights (1931) He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films [432]\n\n\nFilmography\nDirected features:\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nChaplin received many awards and honours, especially later in life In the 1975 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) [439] He was also awarded honorary Doctor of Letters degrees by the University of Oxford and the University of Durham in 1962 [332] In 1965, he and Ingmar Bergman were joint winners of the Erasmus Prize [440] and, in 1971, he was appointed a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour by the French government [441] From the film industry, Chaplin received a special Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1972, [442] and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Lincoln Center Film Society the same year The latter has since been presented annually to filmmakers as The Chaplin Award [443] Chaplin was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1972, having been previously excluded because of his political beliefs [444]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn 1998, the film critic Andrew Sarris called Chaplin \"arguably the single most important artist produced by the cinema, certainly its most extraordinary performer and probably still its most universal icon\" [448] He is described by the British Film Institute as \"a towering figure in world culture\", [449] and was included in Time magazine's list of the \"100 Most Important People of the 20th Century\" for the \"laughter  [he brought] to millions\" and because he \"more or less invented global recognizability and helped turn an industry into an art\" [450] In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Chaplin as the 10th greatest male star of Classic Hollywood Cinema [451]\n\n\nRecognition\nIn 1998, the film critic Andrew Sarris called Chaplin \"arguably the single most important artist produced by the cinema, certainly its most extraordinary

Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland, has been converted into a museum named \"Chaplin's World\" It opened on 17 April 2016 after fifteen years of development, and is described by Reuters as \"an interactive museum showcasing the life and works of Charlie Chaplin\" [490] On the 128th anniversary of his birth, a record-setting 662 people dressed as the Tramp in an event organised by the museum [491] Previously, the Museum of the Moving Image in London held a permanent display on Chaplin, and hosted a dedicated exhibition to his life and career in 1988 The London Film Museum hosted an exhibition called Charlie Chaplin – The Great Londoner, from 2010 until 2013 [492]\n\n\nCharacterisations\nChaplin is the subject of a biographical film, Chaplin (1992) directed by Richard Attenborough and starring Robert Downey Jr in the title role, with Geraldine Chaplin playing Hannah Chaplin [506] He is also a character in the historical drama film The Cat's Meow (2001), played by Eddie Izzard, and in the made-for-television movie The Scarlett O'Hara War (1980), played by Clive Revill [507] [508] A television series about Chaplin's childhood, Young Charlie Chaplin, ran on PBS in 1989, and was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program [509] The French film The Price of Fame (2014) is a fictionalised account of the robbery of Chaplin's grave [510] Tommy Steele in Search of Charlie Chaplin investigated Chaplin's roots in south-east London [511]\n\n\nLegal precedent\nA lawsuit brought by Chaplin, Chaplin v Amador, 93 Cal App 358 (1928), set an important legal precedent—that a performer's persona and style, in this case Chaplin's \"particular kind or type of mustache, old and threadbare hat, clothes and shoes, a decrepit derby, ill-fitting vest, tight-fitting coat, and trousers and shoes much too large for him, and with this attire, a flexible cane usually carried, swung and bent as he performs his part,\" is entitled to legal protection from those unfairly mimicking those traits in order to deceive the public [518] The case was an important milestone in U.S courts' ultimate recognition of a common-law right of publicity

Spencer Chaplin Jr was a British comedian, actor, director, writer, and producer who revolutionized the film industry with his unique style of comedy. Born on 16 April 1889 in South London, Chaplin became one of the most iconic figures of the 20th century, known for his \"Little Tramp\" character, which he created and popularized. Throughout his career, Chaplin produced, directed, and acted in over 80 films, becoming one of the most prolific and influential filmmakers of all time.\n\nBiography\n\n## Early Life\n\nCharles Spencer Chaplin Jr was born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (née Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr. His paternal grandmother came from the Smith family, who belonged to Romani people. There is no official record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London. His parents had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr became the legal guardian of Hannah's first son, Sydney John Hill.\n\n## Childhood Hardship\n\nChaplin's early life was marked by poverty and hardship. His parents were both music hall entertainers, and Chaplin's mother had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley. Charles Sr was a popular singer, and the family moved frequently, often struggling to make ends meet. When Chaplin was around five, his mother gave birth to a third son, George Wheeler Dryden, fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden. The child was taken by Dryden at six months old and did not re-enter Chaplin's life for thirty years.\n\n## Young Performer\n\nBetween his time in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, Chaplin began to perform on stage. He later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from Hannah one night in Aldershot. This was an isolated occurrence, but by the time he was nine Chaplin had, with his mother's encouragement, grown interested in performing. Through his father's connections, Chaplin became a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900.\n\n## Stage Comedy and Vaudeville\n\nChaplin soon found work with a new company and went on tour with his brother, who was also pursuing an acting career, in a comedy sketch called Repairs. In May 1906, Chaplin joined the juvenile act Casey's Circus, where he developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon the star of the show. By the time the act finished touring in July 1907, the 18-year-old had become an accomplished comedic performer.\n\n## Entering Films\n\nSix months into the second American tour, Chaplin was invited to join the New York Motion Picture Company. A representative who had seen his performances thought he could replace Fred Mace, a star of their Keystone Studios who intended to leave. Chaplin thought the Keystone comedies \"a crude mélange of rough and rumble\", but liked the idea of working in films and rationalised: \"Besides, it would mean a new life.\" He met with the company and signed a $150-per-week contract in September 1913.\n\n## Keystone\n\nChaplin arrived in Los Angeles in early December, and began working for the Keystone studio on 5 January 1914. He soon found himself working with other comedians, including Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle and Mack Sennett. His early films were popular, and he quickly became a star of the Keystone comedies.\n\n## Essanay\n\nThe Essanay Film Manufacturing Company of Chicago sent Chaplin an offer of $1,250 a week, with a signing bonus of $10,000. He joined the studio in late December 1914, where he began forming a stock company of regular players, actors he worked with again and again. He soon recruited a leading lady, Edna Purviance, whom Chaplin met in a café and hired on account of her beauty.\n\n## Mutual\n\nA contract was negotiated with Mutual that amounted to $670,000 a year. Chaplin was 26 years old at the time, making him one of the highest-paid people in the world. The high salary shocked the public and was widely reported in the press. John R Freuler, the studio president, explained: \"We can afford to pay Mr Chaplin this large sum annually because the public wants Chaplin and will pay for him.\"\n\n## First National\n\nIn January 1918, Chaplin was visited by leading British singer and comedian Harry Lauder, and the two acted in a short film together. After the release of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin requested more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players–Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D W Griffith to form a new distribution company, United Artists, in January 1919.\n\n## Silent Features\n\nHaving fulfilled his First National contract, Chaplin was free to make his first picture as an independent producer. In November 1922, he began filming A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers. Chaplin intended it to be a star-making vehicle for Edna Purviance, and did not appear in the picture himself other than in a brief, uncredited cameo. He wished the film to have a realistic feel and directed his cast to give restrained performances.\n\n## The Gold Rush\n\nWhile making The Gold Rush, Chaplin married for the second time. Mirroring the circumstances of his first union, Lita Grey was a teenage actress, originally set to star in the film, whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced Chaplin into marriage. She was 16 and he was 35, meaning Chaplin could have been charged with statutory rape under California law. He therefore arranged a discreet marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924.\n\n## City Lights\n\nChaplin continued to make films, including City Lights, which was released in 1931. He was determined to continue making silent films, and City Lights was a critical and commercial success. Chaplin remained convinced that sound would not work in his films, but was also \"obsessed by a depressing fear of being old-fashioned\".\n\n## Travels and Modern Times\n\nIn the early 1930s, Chaplin took a holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months. He spent months travelling Western Europe, including extended stays in France and Switzerland, and spontaneously decided to visit Japan. The day after he arrived in Japan, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated by ultra-nationalists in the May 15 Incident.\n\n## Monsieur Verdoux\n\nChaplin claimed that the Barry trials had \"crippled  [his] creativeness\", and it was some time before he began working again. In April 1946, he finally began filming a project that had been in development since 1942. Monsieur Verdoux was a black comedy, the story of a French bank clerk, Verdoux (Chaplin), who loses his job and begins marrying and murdering wealthy widows to support his family.\n\n## Limelight\n\nAfter the failure of Monsieur Verdoux, Chaplin's next film, Limelight, was devoid of political themes. Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States.\n\n## European Years\n\nIn the 1950s, Chaplin moved to Switzerland, where he lived for the remainder of his life. He continued to work on his films, and also began re-editing and scoring his old films for re-release.\n\n## Final Works and Renewed Appreciation\n\nIn the last two decades of his career, Chaplin concentrated on re-editing and scoring his old films for re-release, along with securing their ownership and distribution rights. In an interview he gave in 1959, the year of his 70th birthday, Chaplin stated that there was still \"room for the Little Man in the atomic age\".\n\n## Death\n\nBy October 1977, Chaplin's health had declined to the point that he needed constant care. In the early morning of Christmas Day 1977, Chaplin died at home after having a stroke in his sleep. He was 88 years old.\n\n## Legacy\n\nChaplin's legacy continues to be celebrated around the world. He is remembered as a pioneer of the film industry, and his impact on comedy and entertainment is still felt today. His films continue to be widely popular, and his influence can be seen in many other artists and comedians.\n\n## Filmography\n\nDirected features:\n\n* The Tramp (1915)\n* The Bank (1915)\n* A Night in the Show (1915)\n* The Pawnshop (1916)\n* The Vagabond (1916)\n* Easy Street (1917)\n* The Immigrant (1917)\n* The Adventurer (1917)\n* The Bond (1918)\n* Shoulder Arms (1918)\n* The Kid (1921)\n* The Gold Rush (1925)\n* The Circus (1928)\n* City Lights (1931)\n* Modern Times (1936)\n* The Great Dictator (1940)\n* Monsieur Verdoux (1947)\n* Limelight (1952)\n* A King in New York (1957)\n* A Countess from Hong Kong (1967)\n* The Countess from Hong Kong (1967)\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\n* Chaplin received many awards and honours, especially later in life.\n* He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1975 New Year Honours.\n* He was awarded honorary Doctor of Letters degrees by the University of Oxford and the University of Durham in 1962.\n* He and Ingmar Bergman were joint winners of the Erasmus Prize in 1965.\n* He was appointed a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour by the French government in 1971.\n* He received a special Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1972.\n* He was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1972.\n\nReferences\n\n* \"Charlie Chaplin\".

born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (née Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr His paternal grandmother came from the Smith family, who belonged to Romani people [1] [2] [3] [4] There is no official record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London [5] [a] His parents had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr became the legal guardian of Hannah's first son, Sydney John Hill [9] [b] At the time of his birth, Chaplin's parents were both music hall entertainers Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker, [10] had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley, [11] while Charles Sr., a butcher's son, [12] was a popular singer [13] Although they never divorced, Chaplin's parents were estranged by around 1891 [14] The following year, Hannah gave birth to a third son, George Wheeler Dryden, fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden The child was taken by Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter Chaplin's life for thirty years [15]\n\n\n1889–1913: early years\nCharles Spencer Chaplin Jr was born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (née Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr His paternal grandmother came from the Smith family, who belonged to Romani people [1] [2] [3] [4] There is no official record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London [5] [a]

born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (née Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr His paternal grandmother came from the Smith family, who belonged to Romani people [1] [2] [3] [4] There is no official record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London [5] [a] His parents had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr became the legal guardian

Chaplin's life for thirty years [15]\n\n\nYoung performer\nBetween his time in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, Chaplin began to perform on stage He later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from Hannah one night in Aldershot [d] This was an isolated occurrence, but by the time he was nine Chaplin had, with his mother's encouragement, grown interested in performing He later wrote: \" [she] imbued me with the feeling that I had some sort of talent\" [31] Through his father's connections, [32] Chaplin became a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900 [e] Chaplin worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act [34]\n\n\nStage comedy and vaudeville\nChaplin soon found work with a new company and went on tour with his brother, who was also pursuing an acting career, in a comedy sketch called Repairs [45] In May 1906, Chaplin joined the juvenile act Casey's Circus, [46] where he developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon the star of the show By the time the act finished touring in July 1907, the 18-year-old had become an accomplished comedic performer [47] He struggled to find more work, however, and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure [g]\n\n\n1914–1917: entering films\nSix months into the second American tour, Chaplin was invited to join the New York Motion Picture Company A representative who had seen his performances thought he could replace Fred Mace, a star of their Keystone Studios who intended to leave [60] Chaplin thought the Keystone comedies \"a crude mélange of rough and rumble\", but liked the idea of working in films and rationalised: \"Besides, it would mean a new life.\" [61] He met with the company and signed a $150-per-week [h] contract in September 1913 [63] Chaplin arrived in Los Angeles in early December, [64] and began working for the Keystone studio on 5 January 1914 [65]\n\n\nKeystone\nSix months into the second American tour, Chaplin was invited to join the New York Motion Picture

September 1913 [63] Chaplin arrived in Los Angeles in early December, [64] and began working for the Keystone studio on 5 January 1914 [65]\n\n\nEssanay\nThe Essanay Film Manufacturing Company of Chicago sent Chaplin an offer of $1,250 [k] a week, with a signing bonus of $10,000 [l] He joined the studio in late December 1914, [83] where he began forming a stock company of regular players, actors he worked with again and again, including Ben Turpin, Leo White, Bud Jamison, Paddy McGuire, Fred Goodwins and Billy Armstrong He soon recruited a leading lady, Edna Purviance, whom Chaplin met in a café and hired on account of her beauty She went on to appear in 35 films with Chaplin over eight years; [84] the pair also formed a romantic relationship that lasted until 1917 [85]\n\n\nMutual\nA contract was negotiated with Mutual that amounted to $670,000 [p] a year, [101] which Robinson says made Chaplin – at 26 years old – one of the highest-paid people in the world [102] The high salary shocked the public and was widely reported in the press [103] John R Freuler, the studio president, explained: \"We can afford to pay Mr Chaplin this large sum annually because the public wants Chaplin and will pay for him.\" [104]\n\n\n1918–1922: First National\nIn January 1918, Chaplin was visited by leading British singer and comedian Harry Lauder, and the two acted in a short film together [121]\n\n\nUnited Artists, Mildred Harris, and The Kid\nAfter the release of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin requested more money from First National, which was refused Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players–Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D W Griffith to form a new distribution company, United Artists, in January 1919 [133] The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control [134] Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National They refused and insisted that he complete the final six films owed [135]\n\n\n1923–1938: silent features\nHaving fulfilled his First National contract, Chaplin was free to make his first picture as an independent producer In November 1922, he began filming A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers [151] Chaplin intended it to be a star-making vehicle for Edna Purviance, [152] and did not appear in the picture himself other than in a brief, uncredited cameo [153] He wished the film to have a realistic feel and directed his cast to give restrained performances In real life, he explained, \"men and women try to hide their emotions rather than seek to express them\" [154] A Woman of Paris premiered in September 1923 and was acclaimed for its innovative, subtle approach [155] The public, however, seemed to have little interest in a Chaplin film without Chaplin, and it was a box office disappointment [156] The filmmaker was hurt by this failure – he had long wanted to produce a dramatic film and was proud of the result – and soon withdrew A Woman of Paris from circulation [157]\n\n\nA Woman of Paris and The Gold Rush\nHaving fulfilled his First National contract, Chaplin was free to make his first picture as an independent producer In November 1922, he began filming A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers [151] Chaplin intended it to be a star-making vehicle for Edna Purviance, [152] and did not appear in the picture himself other than in a brief, uncredited cameo [153] He wished the film to have a realistic feel and directed his cast to give restrained

failure – he had long wanted to produce a dramatic film and was proud of the result – and soon withdrew A Woman of Paris from circulation [157]\n\n\nLita Grey and The Circus\nWhile making The Gold Rush, Chaplin married for the second time Mirroring the circumstances of his first union, Lita Grey was a teenage actress, originally set to star in the film, whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced Chaplin into marriage She was 16 and he was 35, meaning Chaplin could have been charged with statutory rape under California law [169] He therefore arranged a discreet marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924 [170] They originally met during her childhood and she had previously appeared in his works The Kid and The Idle Class [171] Their first son, Charles Spencer Chaplin III, was born on 5 May 1925, followed by Sydney Earl Chaplin on 30 March 1926 [172] On 6 July 1925, Chaplin became the first movie star to be featured on a Time cover [173]\n\n\nCity Lights\nI was determined to continue making silent films .. I was a pantomimist and in that medium I was unique and, without false modesty, a master.\n\nTravels, Paulette Goddard and Modern Times\nCity Lights had been a success, but Chaplin was unsure if he could make another picture without dialogue He remained convinced that sound would not work in his films, but was also \"obsessed by a depressing fear of being old-fashioned\" [206] In this state of uncertainty, early in 1931, the comedian decided to take a holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months [207] [w] He spent months travelling Western Europe, including extended stays in France and Switzerland, and spontaneously decided to visit Japan [209] The day after he arrived in Japan, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated by ultra-nationalists in the May 15 Incident The group's original plan had been to provoke a war with the United States by assassinating Chaplin at a welcome reception organised by the prime minister, but the plan had been foiled due to delayed public announcement of the event's date [210]\n\n\n1939–1952: controversies and fading popularity\nThe 1940s saw Chaplin face a series of controversies, both in his work and in his personal life, which changed his fortunes and severely affected his popularity in the United States The first of these was his growing boldness in expressing his political beliefs Deeply disturbed by the surge of militaristic nationalism in 1930s world politics, [231] Chaplin found that he could not keep these issues out of his work [232] Parallels between himself and Adolf Hitler had been widely noted: the pair were born four days apart, both had risen from poverty to world prominence, and Hitler wore the same moustache style as Chaplin It was this physical resemblance that supplied the plot for Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism [233]\n\n\nThe Great Dictator\nThe 1940s saw Chaplin face a series of controversies, both in his work and

supplied the plot for Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism [233]\n\n\nLegal troubles and Oona O'Neill\nIn the mid-1940s, Chaplin was involved in a series of trials that occupied most of his time and significantly affected his public image [249] The troubles stemmed from his affair with an aspiring actress named Joan Barry, with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942 [250] Barry, who displayed obsessive behaviour and was twice arrested after they separated, [z] reappeared the following year and announced that she was pregnant with Chaplin's child As Chaplin denied the claim, Barry filed a paternity suit against him [251]\n\n\nMonsieur Verdoux and communist accusations\nChaplin claimed that the Barry trials had \"crippled  [his] creativeness\", and it was some time before he began working again [269] In April 1946, he finally began filming a project that had been in development since 1942 [270] Monsieur Verdoux was a black comedy, the story of a French bank clerk, Verdoux (Chaplin), who loses his job and begins marrying and murdering wealthy widows to support his family Chaplin's inspiration for the project came from Orson Welles, who wanted him to star in a film about the French serial killer Henri Désiré Landru Chaplin decided that the concept would \"make a wonderful comedy\", [271] and paid Welles $5,000 [ad] for the idea [272]\n\n\nLimelight and banning from the United States\nAlthough Chaplin remained politically active in the years following the failure of Monsieur Verdoux, [af] his next film, about a forgotten music hall comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States [296] The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden [297]\n\n\n1953–1977: European years\nI have been the object of lies and propaganda by powerful reactionary groups who, by their influence and by the aid of America's yellow press, have created an unhealthy atmosphere in which liberal-minded individuals can be singled out and persecuted Under these conditions I find it virtually impossible to continue my motion-picture work, and I have therefore given up my residence in the United States.\n\nMove to Switzerland and A King in New York\nI have been the object of lies and propaganda by powerful reactionary groups who, by their influence and by the aid of America's yellow press, have created an unhealthy atmosphere in which liberal-minded individuals can be singled out and persecuted Under these conditions I find it virtually impossible to continue my motion-picture work, and I have therefore given up my residence in the United States.\n\nFinal works and renewed appreciation\nIn the last two decades of his career, Chaplin concentrated on re-editing and scoring his old films for re-release, along with securing their ownership and distribution rights [329] In an interview he gave in 1959, the year of his 70th birthday, Chaplin stated that there was still \"room for the Little Man in the atomic age\" [330] The first of these re-releases was The Chaplin Revue (1959), which included new versions of A Dog's Life, Shoulder Arms, and The Pilgrim [330]\n\n\nDeath\nBy October 1977, Chaplin's health had declined to the point that he needed constant care [357] In the early morning of Christmas Day 1977, Chaplin died at home after having a stroke in his sleep [351] He was 88 years old The funeral, on 27 December, was a small and private Anglican ceremony, according to his wishes [358] [ak] Chaplin was interred in the Corsier-sur-Vevey cemetery [357] Among the film industry's tributes, director René Clair wrote, \"He was a monument of the cinema, of all countries and all times .. the most beautiful gift the cinema made to us.\" [360] Actor Bob Hope declared, \"We were lucky to have lived in his time.\" [361] Chaplin left more than $100 million to his widow [362]\n\n\nFilmmaking\nChaplin believed his first influence to be his mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting at the window and mimicking passers-by: \"it was through watching her that I learned not only how to express emotions with my hands and face, but also how to observe and study people.\" [365] Chaplin's early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work; he also attended the Christmas pantomimes at Drury Lane, where he studied the art of clowning through performers like Dan Leno [366] Chaplin's years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker Simon Louvish writes that the company was his \"training ground\", [367] and it was here that Chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy [368] The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno, [al] who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplin's gags [368] [369] From the film industry, Chaplin drew upon the work of the French comedian Max Linder, whose films he greatly admired [370] In developing the Tramp costume and persona, he was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene, where tramp characters were common [371]\n\n\nInfluences\nChaplin believed his first influence to be his mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting at the window and mimicking passers-by: \"it was through watching her

common [371]\n\n\nMethod\nChaplin never spoke more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, claiming such a thing would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion [372] Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime, [373] but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method [374]\n\n\nStyle and themes\nWhile Chaplin's comedic style is broadly defined as slapstick, [395] it is considered restrained and intelligent, [396] with the film historian Philip Kemp describing his work as a mix of \"deft, balletic physical comedy and thoughtful, situation-based gags\" [397] Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewer's relationship to the characters [71] [398] Unlike conventional slapstick comedies, Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin's films centre on the Tramp's attitude to the things happening to him: the humour does not come from the Tramp bumping into a tree, but from his lifting his hat to the tree in apology [71] Dan Kamin writes that Chaplin's \"quirky mannerisms\" and \"serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action\" are other key aspects of his comedy, [399] while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of in-camera trickery are also common features [400] His signature style consisted of gestural idiosyncrasies like askew derby hat, drooping shoulders, deflated chest and dangling arms and tilted back pelvis to enrich the comic persona of his 'tramp' character His shabby but neat clothing and incessant grooming behaviour along with his geometrical walk and movement gave his onscreen characters a puppet-like quality [401]\n\n\nComposing\nChaplin developed a passion for music as a child and taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello [430] He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important, [188] and from A Woman of Paris onwards he took an increasing interest in this area [431] With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for City Lights (1931) He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films [432]\n\n\nFilmography\nDirected features:\n\n\nAwards and nominations\nChaplin received many awards and honours, especially later in life In the 1975 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) [439] He was also awarded honorary Doctor of Letters degrees by the University of Oxford and the University of Durham in 1962 [332] In 1965, he and Ingmar Bergman were joint winners of the Erasmus Prize [440] and, in 1971, he was appointed a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour by the French government [441] From the film industry, Chaplin received a special Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1972, [442] and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Lincoln Center Film Society the same year The latter has since been presented annually to filmmakers as The Chaplin Award [443] Chaplin was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1972, having been previously excluded because of his political beliefs [444]\n\n\nLegacy\nIn 1998, the film critic Andrew Sarris called Chaplin \"arguably the single most important artist produced by the cinema, certainly its most extraordinary performer and probably still its most universal icon\" [448] He is described by the British Film Institute as \"a towering figure in world culture\", [449] and was included in Time magazine's list of the \"100 Most Important People of the 20th Century\" for the \"laughter  [he brought] to millions\" and because he \"more or less invented global recognizability and helped turn an industry into an art\" [450] In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Chaplin as the 10th greatest male star of Classic Hollywood Cinema [451]\n\n\nRecognition\nIn 1998, the film critic Andrew Sarris called Chaplin \"arguably the single most important artist produced by the cinema, certainly its most extraordinary

Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland, has been converted into a museum named \"Chaplin's World\" It opened on 17 April 2016 after fifteen years of development, and is described by Reuters as \"an interactive museum showcasing the life and works of Charlie Chaplin\" [490] On the 128th anniversary of his birth, a record-setting 662 people dressed as the Tramp in an event organised by the museum [491] Previously, the Museum of the Moving Image in London held a permanent display on Chaplin, and hosted a dedicated exhibition to his life and career in 1988 The London Film Museum hosted an exhibition called Charlie Chaplin – The Great Londoner, from 2010 until 2013 [492]\n\n\nCharacterisations\nChaplin is the subject of a biographical film, Chaplin (1992) directed by Richard Attenborough and starring Robert Downey Jr in the title role, with Geraldine Chaplin playing Hannah Chaplin [506] He is also a character in the historical drama film The Cat's Meow (2001), played by Eddie Izzard, and in the made-for-television movie The Scarlett O'Hara War (1980), played by Clive Revill [507] [508] A television series about Chaplin's childhood, Young Charlie Chaplin, ran on PBS in 1989, and was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program [509] The French film The Price of Fame (2014) is a fictionalised account of the robbery of Chaplin's grave [510] Tommy Steele in Search of Charlie Chaplin investigated Chaplin's roots in south-east London [511]\n\n\nLegal precedent\nA lawsuit brought by Chaplin, Chaplin v Amador, 93 Cal App 358 (1928), set an important legal precedent—that a performer's persona and style, in this case Chaplin's \"particular kind or type of mustache, old and threadbare hat, clothes and shoes, a decrepit derby, ill-fitting vest, tight-fitting coat, and trousers and shoes much too large for him, and with this attire, a flexible cane usually carried, swung and bent as he performs his part,\" is entitled to legal protection from those unfairly mimicking those traits in order to deceive the public [518] The case was an important milestone in U.S courts' ultimate recognition of a common-law right of publicity

{"title": "Mahmoud_Abbas", "content": "\nEarly and personal life\nMahmoud Rida Abbas [15] was born on 15 November 1935 [16] in Safed, in the Galilee region of Mandatory Palestine (now Israel) [17] His family fled to Syria during the 1948 Palestine war [17] Before going to Egypt, Abbas graduated from the University of Damascus, where he studied law [18]\n\n\nPolitical activism and career\nIn the mid-1950s, Abbas became heavily involved in underground Palestinian politics, joining a number of exiled Palestinians in Qatar, where he was Director of Personnel in the emirate's Civil Service While there in 1961, he was recruited to become a member of Fatah, founded by Yasser Arafat and five other Palestinians in Kuwait in the late 1950s [25] At the time, Arafat was establishing the groundwork of Fatah by enlisting wealthy Palestinians in Qatar, Kuwait, and other Gulf States [citation needed]\n\n\nPrime minister\nBy early 2003, as Israel and the United States refused to negotiate with Yasser Arafat, it was thought that Abbas would be a candidate for the kind of leadership role envisaged by both countries As one of the few remaining founding members of Fatah, he had some degree of credibility within the Palestinian cause, and his candidacy was bolstered by the fact that other high-profile Palestinians were for various reasons not suitable (the most notable, Marwan Barghouti, was a prisoner in Israeli jail after having been convicted on charges of being responsible for multiple murders by an Israeli court) Abbas's reputation as a pragmatist garnered him favor with the West and some members of the Palestinian legislature Under international pressure, on 19 March 2003, Arafat appointed Abbas Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority According to Gilbert Achcar, the United States imposed Abbas on Arafat, the democratically elected leader, though the majority of Palestinians thought of Abbas as a Quisling [32]\n\n\n2005 presidential election\nAfter Yasser Arafat's death, Abbas was seen, at least by Fatah, as his natural successor On 25 November 2004, Abbas was endorsed by Fatah's Revolutionary Council as its preferred candidate for the presidential election, scheduled for 9 January 2005 On 14 December, Abbas called for an end to violence in the Second Intifada and a return to peaceful resistance Abbas told the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that \"the use of arms has been damaging and should end.\" However, he refused, or was not able, to disarm Palestinian militants and use force against groups designated as terrorist organisations [citation needed]\n\n\nPresidency and PLO leadership\nDespite Abbas's call for a peaceful solution, attacks by militant groups continued after his election, in a direct challenge to his authority The Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine launched a raid in Gaza on 12 January 2005, that killed one and wounded three Israeli military personnel [36] On 13 January, Palestinians from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, Hamas, and the Popular Resistance Committees launched a suicide attack on the Karni crossing, killing six Israelis [36] As a result, Israel shut down the damaged terminal and broke off relations with Abbas and the Palestinian Authority, stating that Abbas must now show a gesture of peace by attempting to stop such attacks [37] Abbas was formally sworn in as the

His family fled to Syria during the 1948 Palestine war. Before going to Egypt, Abbas graduated from the University of Damascus, where he studied law. He later graduated from the University of Egypt, where he earned a degree in law. Abbas became involved in Palestinian politics in the 1950s, joining various Palestinian groups in Qatar and other Gulf states.\n\n## Political Activism and Career\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Abbas became heavily involved in underground Palestinian politics, joining a number of exiled Palestinians in Qatar, where he was Director of Personnel in the emirate's Civil Service. While there in 1961, he was recruited to become a member of Fatah, founded by Yasser Arafat and five other Palestinians in Kuwait in the late 1950s. At the time, Arafat was establishing the groundwork of Fatah by enlisting wealthy Palestinians in Qatar, Kuwait, and other Gulf States.\n\n## Prime Minister\n\nBy early 2003, as Israel and the United States refused to negotiate with Yasser Arafat, it was thought that Abbas would be a candidate for the kind of leadership role envisaged by both countries. As one of the few remaining founding members of Fatah, he had some degree of credibility within the Palestinian cause, and his candidacy was bolstered by the fact that other high-profile Palestinians were for various reasons not suitable. Abbas's reputation as a pragmatist garnered him favor with the West and some members of the Palestinian legislature. Under international pressure, on 19 March 2003, Arafat appointed Abbas Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority.\n\n## 2005 Presidential Election\n\nAfter Yasser Arafat's death, Abbas was seen, at least by Fatah, as his natural successor. On 25 November 2004, Abbas was endorsed by Fatah's Revolutionary Council as its preferred candidate for the presidential election, scheduled for 9 January 2005. On 14 December, Abbas called for an end to violence in the Second Intifada and a return to peaceful resistance. Abbas told the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that \"the use of arms has been damaging and should end.\" However, he refused, or was not able, to disarm Palestinian militants and use force against groups designated as terrorist organizations.\n\n## Presidency and PLO Leadership\n\nDespite Abbas's call for a peaceful solution, attacks by militant groups continued after his election, in a direct challenge to his authority. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine launched a raid in Gaza on 12 January 2005, that killed one and wounded three Israeli military personnel. On 13 January, Palestinians from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, Hamas, and the Popular Resistance Committees launched a suicide attack on the Karni crossing, killing six Israelis. As a result, Israel shut down the damaged terminal and broke off relations with Abbas and the Palestinian Authority, stating that Abbas must now show a gesture of peace by attempting to stop such attacks. Abbas was formally sworn in as the President of the Palestinian National Authority in a ceremony held on 15 January, in the West Bank town of Ramallah.\n\n## Political Relations\n\nOn 23 January 2005, Israeli radio reported that Abbas had secured a thirty-day ceasefire from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

returned to Napoli, choosing the number 24 jersey [15] On 16 September 2012, he scored his first goal in Serie A, after entering as a substitute for Edinson Cavani in a 3–1 home win over Parma [16] Four days later, he made his debut in UEFA club competitions, starting in a 4–0 win against Swedish side AIK Fotboll in the UEFA Europa League [17]\n\n\nToronto FC\nOn 8 January 2022, Insigne signed a pre-contract to join Major League Soccer club Toronto FC as a designated player on a free transfer and four-year contract that began on 1 July, [39] [40] with a reported annual salary of $15 million, making him the highest paid player in MLS [41] He made his debut for the club on 23 July, in a 4–0 home victory against Charlotte FC, only featuring in the opening half, but setting up club captain Michael Bradley's second goal of the match with a back-heel pass [42] On 6 August, Insigne scored his first goal for the club, converting a shot from outside the box for the game-winning goal in a 4–3 away victory against Nashville SC [43]\n\n\nInternational career\nA regular member of the Italy under-21 squad, Insigne made 15 appearances for the \"Azzurrini\", scoring seven goals He made his debut with the under-21 side on 6 October 2011 in a European qualifying match against Liechtenstein, scoring two goals and providing two assists in a 7–2 victory [44]\n\n\nYouth\nA regular member of the Italy under-21 squad, Insigne made 15 appearances for the \"Azzurrini\", scoring seven goals He made his debut with the under-21 side on 6 October 2011 in a European qualifying match against Liechtenstein, scoring two goals and providing two assists in a 7–2 victory [44]\n\n\nSenior\nInsigne was called up for the first time for the Italy senior team in September 2012 at age 21 by coach Cesare Prandelli for Italy's 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches against Bulgaria and Malta He made his senior debut on 11 September 2012 in the World Cup qualifier match against Malta in Modena, coming on as a replacement for Alessandro Diamanti [49] On 14 August 2013, Insigne scored his first goal in a friendly against Argentina, which ended in a 2–1 loss at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome [50]\n\n\nStyle of play\nNicknamed \"Lorenzo Il Magnifico\" (\"Lorenzo the Magnificent\", in Italian), [68] Insigne is a fast, talented, skillful and diminutive right footed winger, with an eye for the goal, who is usually deployed on the left in a 4–3–3 or in a 4–2–3–1 formation, which allows him to utilise his acceleration to cut inside and curl shots on goal with his stronger foot, in particular from outside the penalty area [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] Due to his penchant for scoring goals in his manner, which according to Insigne was inspired by his \"idol\" Alessandro Del Piero's trademark goals, in 2021, the neologism tiraggiro – derived from \"tir a gir\" (\"tiro a giro\", in Italian, or \"curling shot\", in English) in Insigne's native Neapolitan dialect – was coined and included in the Italian encyclopedia Treccani [76] [79] Although his preferred role is on the left flank, he is a hard-working, tactically intelligent, and versatile forward, capable of playing in any offensive position on either side of the pitch, or even through the centre; he is also known for his defensive contribution and ability to cover a lot of ground during matches, in addition to his offensive capabilities, despite his lack of physicality [4] [76] [80] [81]\n\n\nPersonal life\nLorenzo Insigne has three brothers, all of whom are footballers: his younger brother Roberto, as well as Marco and Antonio [96] [97] Lorenzo married Genoveffa \"Jenny\" Darone on 31 December 2012; [98] they have two children together: Carmine, born on 4 April 2013, [99] and Christian, born on 13 March 2015 [100]\n\n\nCareer statistics\nPescara [105]\n\n\nClub\nPescara [105]\n\n\nInternational\nPescara [105]\n\n\nHonours\nPescara [105]\n\n\nTrivia\nInsigne has contributed to popularising the term tiraggiro in Italy; following Insigne's goals and role in Italy's victorious Euro 2020 campaign, the word was subsequently included in the Treccani encyclopaedia in 2021, as a result of its recurring use as a reference to Insigne, or other players, using his trademark shooting technique, which usually involves him curling shots on goal from outside the box after cutting inside from the left flank onto his stronger right foot [79] [112] [113] [114] The definition of the neologism is \"the curling shot, taken hitting the ball so as to curve it with an inward curl\", \"adaptation of the spoken Neapolitan tir a ggir\": excerpts of newspaper articles about Insigne are frequently cited as an example of the usage of this term [115]\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nExternal
