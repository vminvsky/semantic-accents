His contributions to mathematics and physics had a profound impact on the development of modern science and influenced many other mathematicians and scientists. Gauss was a child prodigy who made significant contributions to number theory, algebra, analysis, geometry, and astronomy, among other fields.\n\n**Youth and Education**\n\nGauss was born in Braunschweig, Germany, to a working-class family. His father, Gebhard Dietrich Gauss, was a gardener and a musician, and his mother, Dorothea Benze, was a devout woman who encouraged Gauss's early interest in mathematics and science. Gauss's parents were not formally educated, but they valued education and encouraged their son to learn. At the age of three, Gauss began to attend school, where he quickly demonstrated his exceptional abilities in mathematics and reading. By the age of six, Gauss had already mastered arithmetic and was able to perform complex mathematical calculations.\n\n**Private Scholar**\n\nGauss's parents recognized their son's exceptional abilities and provided him with a private tutor to accelerate his education. Gauss's tutor, Johann Friedrich Benze, was a mathematician who had studied under the famous mathematician, Leonhard Euler. Under Benze's guidance, Gauss made rapid progress in mathematics and was able to learn advanced topics such as algebra and geometry. By the age of 12, Gauss had already begun to make significant contributions to mathematics, including the discovery of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.\n\n**Professor in Göttingen**\n\nIn 1795, Gauss enrolled at the University of Göttingen, where he studied mathematics and physics under the guidance of renowned mathematicians and scientists. Gauss's talent and dedication quickly earned him recognition, and in 1798, he was appointed as a professor of mathematics at the University of Göttingen.

The league was founded in 1930 and has undergone several name changes and reorganizations over the years.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe first football league in Indonesia was established in 1930, with the formation of the Perserikatan, a league of clubs from Java and Sumatra. The league was founded by the Dutch colonial authorities, who saw football as a way to promote physical education and sports among the local population.\n\n## Foundation\n\nThe Perserikatan was initially a amateur league, with teams competing in a round-robin format. The league was divided into two groups, with the winners of each group meeting in a final match to determine the champion. The Perserikatan was a relatively small league, with only a handful of teams participating in the early years.\n\n## Dualism\n\nIn the 1950s, the Indonesian football league system underwent a significant transformation. The Perserikatan was split into two separate leagues, the Liga Indonesia and the Perserikatan. The Liga Indonesia was a professional league, while the Perserikatan remained an amateur league. This dualism led to a period of instability and competition for players and fans.\n\n## Government intervention and FIFA suspension\n\nIn the 1990s, the Indonesian government intervened in the football league system, establishing a new governing body, the Indonesian Football Federation (PSSI). The PSSI took control of the Liga Indonesia, which was renamed the Liga Prima Indonesia. However, the league was plagued by corruption and financial problems, leading to a suspension by FIFA in 2015.\n\n## Name change\n\nIn 2017, the Liga Prima Indonesia was rebranded as Liga 1, a name that reflects the league's status as the top tier of Indonesian football. The name change was part of a broader effort to rebrand and reorganize the Indonesian football league system.\n\n# Competition format\n\n## Competition\n\nLiga 1 is a professional league, with 18 teams competing in a double round-robin format. The league season typically runs from April to December, with the top team earning promotion to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Champions League. The bottom team is relegated to the second tier, Liga 2.\n\n## Promotion and relegation\n\nTeams earn promotion and relegation based on their performance in the league. The top team in Liga 1 is promoted to the AFC Champions League, while the bottom team is relegated to Liga 2. The top teams in Liga 2 earn promotion to Liga 1, while the bottom teams are relegated to lower divisions.\n\n## Video assistant referee\n\nIn 2020, Liga 1 introduced video assistant referee (VAR) technology to improve the accuracy of refereeing decisions. The VAR system uses a team of officials to review and advise the referee on key decisions, such as goals, penalties, and red cards.\n\n# Clubs\n\n## Champions\n\nThe following teams have won the Liga 1 championship:\n\n* 1930: PSMS Medan\n* 1931: PSMS Medan\n* 1932: PSMS Medan\n* 1933: PSMS Medan\n* 1934: PSMS Medan\n* 1935: PSMS Medan\n* 1936: PSMS Medan\n* 1937: PSMS Medan\n* 1938: PSMS Medan\n* 1939: PSMS Medan\n* 1940: PSMS Medan\n* 1941: PSMS Medan\n* 1942: PSMS Medan\n* 1943: PSMS Medan\n* 1944: PSMS Medan\n* 1945: PSMS Medan\n* 1947: PSMS Medan\n* 1948: PSMS Medan\n* 1949: PSMS Medan\n* 1950: PSMS Medan\n* 1951: PSMS Medan\n* 1952: PSMS Medan\n* 1953: PSMS Medan\n* 1954: PSMS Medan\n* 1955: PSMS Medan\n* 1956: PSMS Medan\n* 1957: PSMS Medan\n* 1958: PSMS Medan\n* 1959: PSMS Medan\n* 1960: PSMS Medan\n* 1961: PSMS Medan\n* 1962: PSMS Medan\n* 1963: PSMS Medan\n* 1964: PSMS Medan\n* 1965: PSMS Medan\n* 1966: PSMS Medan\n* 1967: PSMS Medan\n* 1968: PSMS Medan\n* 1969: PSMS Medan\n* 1970: PSMS Medan\n* 1971: PSMS Medan\n* 1972: PSMS Medan\n* 1973: PSMS Medan\n* 1974: PSMS Medan\n* 1975: PSMS Medan\n* 1976: PSMS Medan\n* 1977: PSMS Medan\n* 1978: PSMS Medan\n* 1979: PSMS Medan\n* 1980: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1981: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1982: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1983: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1984: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1985: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1986: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1987: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1988: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1989: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1990: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1991: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1992: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1993: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1994: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1995: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1996: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1997: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1998: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 1999: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 2000: Persebaya Surabaya\n* 2001: Persita Tangerang\n* 2002: Persita Tangerang\n* 2003: Arema Malang\n* 2004: Arema Malang\n* 2005: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2006: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2007: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2008: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2009: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2010: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2011: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2012: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2013: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2014: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2015: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2016: Persipura Jayapura\n* 2017: Bhayangkara FC\n* 2018: Bali United\n* 2019: Bali United\n* 2020: Bali United\n* 2021: Bali United\n* 2022: Bali United\n* 2023: Arema FC\n\n## Performance by clubs\n\nThe following table shows the performance of clubs in the Liga 1 championship:\n\n| Club | Titles | Runner-up | Third place |\n| Persipura Jayapura | 12 | 3 | 2 |\n| Persebaya Surabaya | 11 | 5 | 3 |\n| PSMS Medan | 10 | 3 | 2 |\n| Arema FC | 3 | 4 | 3 |\n| Persita Tangerang | 2 | 0 | 0 |\n| Bhayangkara FC | 1 | 2 | 1 |\n| Bali United | 5 | 2 | 0 |\n| Persela Lamongan | 0 | 3 | 2 |\n\n## 2024–25 season\n\nThe 2024–25 Liga 1 season is scheduled to begin in August 2024.\n\n# Foreign players\n\nLiga 1 has a limit on the number of foreign players that can be registered by each club.

This approach allows developers to collaborate, modify, and distribute the game's source code, creating a community-driven and dynamic ecosystem. Open-source video games have gained popularity in recent years, offering players and developers a unique alternative to traditional, proprietary game development.\n\n**Definition and differentiation**\n\nOpen-source video games can be differentiated from other types of video games in several ways. Firstly, open-source games are developed using open-source software development methodologies, which prioritize community involvement, transparency, and collaboration. This approach allows developers to work together, contributing to the game's source code and creating a shared, communal product. In contrast, proprietary games are developed using closed-source methodologies, where the source code is proprietary and not publicly available.\n\nSecondly, open-source games often prioritize moddability and community engagement. Moddability refers to the ability of players to create and distribute custom content for the game, such as mods, levels, or characters. This allows players to extend the game's lifespan, create new gameplay experiences, and contribute to the game's development. In contrast, proprietary games often limit or restrict moddability, prioritizing their own content and intellectual property.\n\nLastly, open-source games often have a more democratic and inclusive approach to game development. Developers can contribute to the game's development, propose new features, and vote on game-related decisions. This approach allows the community to shape the game's direction and ensure that it meets the needs and desires of its players.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe concept of open-source software development dates back to the 1980s, when the Free Software Foundation (FSF) was founded by Richard Stallman. Stallman's goal was to promote software freedom, allowing users to modify, distribute, and use software freely. The open-source movement gained momentum in the 1990s and 2000s, with the development of open-source operating systems, such as Linux and GNU.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the open-source movement expanded to the game development industry. Developers began to apply open-source principles to game development, creating games that were free, community-driven, and moddable. This approach allowed developers to collaborate, create new games, and distribute them freely.\n\n**History**\n\n### Beginnings and early games\n\nThe first open-source video games emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s. One of the earliest open-source games was DOOM, which was released in 1993 by id Software. However, the game's source code was not publicly available until 1997, when it was released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Other early open-source games included Quake, which was released by id Software in 1996, and Wolfenstein 3D, which was released by id Software in 1992.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the open-source movement gained momentum, with the development of games such as Torcs, a racing game, and Sauerbraten, a first-person shooter. These games were developed using open-source software development methodologies and were freely available for download.\n\n### 3D games and source releases\n\nIn the mid-2000s, the open-source movement gained further momentum, with the release of 3D games such as Neverball, a 3D platformer, and Xonotic, a first-person shooter. These games were developed using open-source software development methodologies and were freely available for download.\n\nThe release of 3D games marked a significant milestone for the open-source movement, as it demonstrated the feasibility of open-source game development on a large scale.

It was the 19th Italian general election since the country's transition to democracy in 1948. The election was marked by a highly contested campaign, with the ruling centre-left coalition, led by the Democratic Party (PD), facing a strong challenge from the centre-right coalition, led by the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe election was called in July 2022, following the collapse of the previous government, which was led by Prime Minister Mario Draghi. The Draghi government had been in office since February 2021, but it lost its parliamentary majority in July 2022, after a confidence vote. The election was seen as an opportunity for the Italian people to express their views on the country's economic and social policies, as well as its relationship with the European Union.\n\n**Electoral campaign**\n\nThe electoral campaign was highly polarized, with the two main coalitions, the centre-left and the centre-right, engaging in a fierce battle for power. The centre-left coalition, led by the PD, campaigned on a platform of social and economic reform, promising to increase public spending on healthcare and education, and to reduce poverty and inequality. The centre-right coalition, led by the FdI, campaigned on a platform of law and order, promising to crack down on crime and immigration, and to promote economic growth and job creation.\n\n### Main parties' slogans\n\nThe main parties' slogans for the election were:\n\n* Centre-left: \"Un futuro migliore per tutti\" (A better future for all)\n* Centre-right: \"Sicurezza, lavoro, futuro\" (Security, work, future)\n* Five Star Movement (M5S): \"Riformare il Paese\" (Reform the country)\n\n### Electoral debates\n\nThe electoral debates were broadcast on television and online, and were watched by millions of Italians. The debates were moderated by well-known journalists and politicians, and were seen as an opportunity for the candidates to present their policies and vision for the country.\n\nThe first debate was held on 1 September 2022, and was moderated by the journalist Massimo Giletti. The debate focused on the economy, healthcare, and education, and saw the centre-left and centre-right coalitions engage in a heated exchange over policy.\n\nThe second debate was held on 8 September 2022, and was moderated by the journalist Lilli Gruber. The debate focused on immigration, crime, and security, and saw the FdI and PD engage in a fierce argument over policy.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe Italian electoral system is based on a proportional representation system, with 400 members of the Chamber of Deputies elected by proportional representation, and 200 members of the Senate of the Republic elected by a combination of proportional representation and first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting.\n\n**Electoral lists**\n\nThe electoral lists were submitted by the parties and coalitions, and were based on the electoral system.

It is characterized by its emphasis on the unity and interconnectedness of all things, and its vision of the universe as a hierarchical, interconnected system.\n\n**Origins of the term**\n\nThe term \"Neoplatonism\" was coined in the 18th century by scholars to distinguish the philosophical system of Plotinus and his followers from the original teachings of Plato. However, the movement itself predates the term, and its roots can be traced back to the 3rd century CE.\n\n**Origins and history of classical Neoplatonism**\n\n### Hellenism\n\nNeoplatonism emerged in the midst of the Hellenistic period, when Greek culture and philosophy were experiencing a period of great transformation. The Hellenistic world was characterized by a growing sense of cosmopolitanism, and a renewed interest in the spiritual and philosophical traditions of the ancient Greeks.\n\n### Ammonius Saccas\n\nOne of the key figures in the development of Neoplatonism was the Egyptian philosopher Ammonius Saccas, who is believed to have founded the school of Neoplatonism. Little is known about Saccas' life, but his teachings are said to have emphasized the importance of spiritual purification and the attainment of gnosis, or spiritual knowledge.\n\n### Plotinus\n\nThe most influential figure in the development of Neoplatonism was the philosopher Plotinus (205-270 CE), who is considered the founder of the school. Plotinus was born in Egypt, but spent most of his life in Rome, where he founded a philosophical school that attracted many students. His teachings emphasized the importance of spiritual ascension and the attainment of gnosis, and were characterized by their emphasis on the unity and interconnectedness of all things.\n\n### Porphyry\n\nPorphyry (234-305 CE) was a student of Plotinus and a prominent Neoplatonist in his own right. He is best known for his work \"Isagoge,\" a philosophical introduction to the principles of Neoplatonism. Porphyry's teachings emphasized the importance of theurgy, or spiritual practice, and the attainment of gnosis through spiritual ascension.\n\n### Iamblichus\n\nIamblichus (245-325 CE) was a Neoplatonist philosopher who is known for his emphasis on the importance of theurgy and spiritual practice. His teachings were characterized by their emphasis on the importance of ritual and the attainment of gnosis through spiritual ascension.\n\n### Academies\n\nThe Neoplatonist schools were known as \"academies,\" and were modeled after the Academy of Plato. The academies were places of philosophical study and debate, where students could engage with the teachings of Neoplatonism and develop their own philosophical perspectives.\n\n### Hypatia\n\nHypatia (c. 350-415 CE) was a Neoplatonist philosopher and mathematician who was known for her wisdom and her teachings on the principles of Neoplatonism. She was a prominent figure in the intellectual life of Alexandria, and her teachings emphasized the importance of spiritual ascension and the attainment of gnosis.\n\n### Proclus\n\nProclus (412-485 CE) was a Neoplatonist philosopher who is known for his emphasis on the importance of theurgy and spiritual practice. His teachings were characterized by their emphasis on the importance of ritual and the attainment of gnosis through spiritual ascension.\n\n**Ideas**\n\n### The One\n\nThe central idea of Neoplatonism is the concept of the One, or the ultimate reality that underlies all things. The One is considered to be the source of all existence, and is often depicted as a unified, undivided whole.\n\n### Emanations\n\nNeoplatonists believed that the One emanated a series of intermediate beings, or emanations, which served as a bridge between the One and the material world. These emanations were considered to be less perfect than the One, but were still connected to it through their shared essence.\n\n### Demiurge or nous\n\nThe first emanation from the One is often referred to as the Demiurge, or the creator of the universe. The Demiurge is considered to be a divine being who is responsible for the creation of the material world.\n\n### World-soul\n\nThe second emanation from the One is often referred to as the world-soul, or the animating principle of the universe. The world-soul is considered to be a divine being who is responsible for the creation and maintenance of the material world.\n\n### Phenomenal world\n\nThe final emanation from the One is the phenomenal world, or the material world that we experience through our senses. The phenomenal world is considered to be a shadow or reflection of the higher world, and is seen as imperfect and ephemeral in comparison to the higher world.\n\n### Celestial hierarchy\n\nNeoplatonists believed in a celestial hierarchy, or a series of levels of being that correspond to different degrees of reality. The celestial hierarchy was seen as a hierarchical system, with the One at the top and the material world at the bottom.\n\n### Evil\n\nNeoplatonists believed that evil was a manifestation of the imperfection and disorder of the material world. Evil was seen as a deviation from the perfect order of the universe, and was considered to be an illusion or a shadow of the higher world.\n\n### Return to the One\n\nThe ultimate goal of the Neoplatonist was to return to the One, or to become one with the ultimate reality. This return was seen as a process of spiritual ascension, in which the individual soul would leave behind the imperfections of the material world and become one with the higher world.\n\n**Influence**\n\nNeoplatonism had a profound influence on the development of Western philosophical and spiritual thought. Its ideas and principles were adopted and adapted by many different cultures and traditions, including early Christianity, Gnosticism, Byzantine education, Islamic neoplatonism, Jewish thought, medieval Christian thought, and the Western Renaissance.\n\n### Early Christianity\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on the development of early Christianity, particularly in the areas of theology and cosmology. Many early Christian theologians, including Augustine and Origen, drew on Neoplatonist ideas and principles in their writings.\n\n### Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n\nOrigen (c. 185-254 CE) and Pseudo-Dionysius (c. 500 CE) were two prominent figures in the early Christian tradition who drew heavily on Neoplatonist ideas and principles in their writings. Origen's teachings on the nature of the soul and the universe were influenced by Neoplatonism, while Pseudo-Dionysius' writings on the mystical experience and the nature of God were also influenced by Neoplatonist ideas.\n\n### Gnosticism\n\nGnosticism was a spiritual movement that emerged in the 1st century CE, and was influenced by Neoplatonist ideas and principles. Gnostics believed in the existence of a higher, spiritual world that was separate from the material world, and that the ultimate goal of the individual was to return to this higher world through spiritual ascension.\n\n### Byzantine education\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on the development of Byzantine education, particularly in the areas of philosophy and theology. Many Byzantine scholars and philosophers, including Proclus and John Philoponus, drew on Neoplatonist ideas and principles in their writings.\n\n### Islamic neoplatonism\n\nIslamic neoplatonism was a philosophical movement that emerged in the 9th century CE, and was influenced by Neoplatonist ideas and principles. Islamic neoplatonists, such as Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd, drew on Neoplatonist ideas and principles in their writings on philosophy and theology.\n\n### Jewish thought\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on the development of Jewish thought, particularly in the areas of philosophy and mysticism. Many Jewish philosophers and mystics, including Maimonides and Isaac Luria, drew on Neoplatonist ideas and principles in their writings.\n\n### Medieval Christian Thought\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on the development of medieval Christian thought, particularly in the areas of theology and cosmology. Many medieval Christian theologians, including Thomas Aquinas, drew on Neoplatonist ideas and principles in their writings.\n\n### Western Renaissance\n\nNeoplatonism had a significant influence on the development of the Western Renaissance, particularly in the areas of philosophy and art. Many Renaissance artists and thinkers, including Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola, drew on Neoplatonist ideas and principles in their writings.\n\n### Cambridge Platonists (17th century)\n\nThe Cambridge Platonists were a group of philosophers who emerged in the 17th century CE, and were influenced by Neoplatonist ideas and principles. They emphasized the importance of reason and the role of the imagination in the attainment of knowledge.\n\n### Modern neoplatonism\n\nModern neoplatonism is a philosophical movement that emerged in the 20th century CE, and is influenced by Neoplatonist ideas and principles. Modern neoplatonists, such as Aldous Huxley and Alan Watts, have drawn on Neoplatonist ideas and principles in their writings on philosophy, spirituality, and the human condition.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Neopythagoreanism\n* Hermeticism\n* Gnosticism\n* Christianity\n* Islam\n* Judaism\n* Platonism\n* Stoicism\n* Epicureanism\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The term \"Neoplatonism\" was coined in the 18th century CE to distinguish the philosophical system of Plotinus and his followers from the original teachings of Plato.\n* Neoplatonism emerged in the midst of the Hellenistic period, when Greek culture and philosophy were experiencing a period of great transformation.\n* The Neoplatonist schools were known as \"academies,\" and were modeled after the Academy of Plato.\n* Neoplatonism had a profound influence on the development of Western philosophical and spiritual thought.\n* Many different cultures and traditions have been influenced by Neoplatonist ideas and principles, including early Christianity, Gnosticism, Byzantine education, Islamic neoplatonism, Jewish thought, medieval Christian thought, and the Western Renaissance.\n\n**References**\n\n* Plotinus, \"The Enneads\"\n* Porphyry, \"Isagoge\"\n* Iamblichus, \"On the Mysteries\"\n* Hypatia, \"Commentaries on the Republic\"\n* Proclus, \"The Elements of Theology\"\n* Origen, \"Against Celsus\"\n* Pseudo-Dionysius, \"The Divine Names\"\n* Maimonides, \"The Guide for the Perplexed\"\n* Ibn Sina, \"The Book of Healing\"\n* Ibn Rushd, \"The Incoherence of the Incoherence\"\n* Thomas Aquinas, \"Summa Theologica\"\n* Marsilio Ficino, \"The Three Books on Life\"\n* Pico della Mirandola, \"Oration on the Dignity of Man\"\n\n**Further reading**\n\n* Fowden, Garth, \"The Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind\" (Princeton University Press, 1993)\n* Lateiner, Donald, \"The Roman Epic and the Greek Novel\" (Princeton University Press, 1992)\n* Shaw, Gregory, \"Theurgy and the Soul: The Neoplatonism of Iamblichus\" (Penn State Press, 1995)\n* Siorvanes, Lawrence, \"Proclus: The Proclusian System of the History of the Universe\" ( Brill, 1996)\n* Sorabji, Richard, \"The Philosophy of the Commentators, 200-600 AD: A Sourcebook\" (Cornell University Press, 2005)\n* Tarnas, Richard, \"The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas That Have Shaped Our World View\" (HarperOne, 1991)\n* Watts, Alan, \"The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are\" (Vintage Books, 1966)\n\n**External links**\n\n* The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Neoplatonism\n* The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Neoplatonism\n* The Encyclopedia Britannica: Neoplatonism\n* The Catholic Encyclopedia: Neoplatonism", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Neoplatonism\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins of the term\n#Origins and history of classical Neoplatonism\n##Hellenism\n##Ammonius Saccas\n##Plotinus\n##Porphyry\n##Iamblichus\n##Academies\n##Hypatia\n##Proclus\n#Ideas\n##The One\n##Emanations\n###Demiurge or nous\n###World-soul\n###Phenomenal world\n##Celestial hierarchy\n##Evil\n##Return to the One\n#Influence\n##Early Christianity\n###Augustine\n###Origen and Pseudo-Dionysius\n###Gnosticism\n##Byzantine education\n##Islamic neoplatonism\n##Jewish thought\n##Medieval Christian Thought\n##Western Renaissance\n##Cambridge Platonists (17th century)\n##Modern neoplatonism\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

From its humble beginnings in the 19th century to the present day, Ukrainian opera has evolved and adapted to the changing cultural and political landscape of the country.\n\n**Origins**\n\nUkrainian opera has its roots in the Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas) of the 19th century. These amateur theatrical performances, which were often organized by students and teachers, provided a platform for young artists to showcase their talents and experiment with different forms of expression. The Shkilʹna dramy laid the groundwork for the development of Ukrainian opera, which would later become a key aspect of the country's cultural identity.\n\nAnother important influence on the development of Ukrainian opera was the tradition of Vertepy (nativity scenes). These elaborate, handmade tableaux, which depicted scenes from the Nativity story, were a popular form of folk art in Ukraine. The Vertepy tradition emphasized the importance of visual storytelling and the use of music and drama to convey emotions and ideas. These elements would later become essential components of Ukrainian opera.\n\nVaudeville, a form of popular entertainment that emerged in the late 19th century, also played a significant role in the development of Ukrainian opera. Vaudeville shows, which often featured a mix of music, dance, and comedy, provided a platform for Ukrainian artists to showcase their talents and experiment with different forms of expression. The popularity of vaudeville in Ukraine helped to lay the groundwork for the development of Ukrainian opera, which would later become a key aspect of the country's cultural identity.\n\n**Operetta**\n\nOperetta, a form of musical theater that emerged in the late 19th century, was another important influence on the development of Ukrainian opera. Operetta, which combined elements of opera and musical comedy, was a popular form of entertainment in Ukraine. Operetta shows often featured a mix of music, dance, and comedy, and were known for their lighthearted and humorous tone. The operetta tradition helped to establish the importance of music and drama in Ukrainian entertainment, and laid the groundwork for the development of Ukrainian opera.\n\n**Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera**\n\nDespite the popularity of operetta and other forms of musical theater in Ukraine, the development of Ukrainian-language opera was hindered by several obstacles. One major obstacle was the lack of a native Ukrainian opera tradition. Unlike many other European countries, Ukraine did not have a long history of opera production, and the country's cultural and artistic leaders were often more focused on promoting Russian culture and language.\n\nAnother obstacle to the development of Ukrainian-language opera was the lack of support from the government and other official institutions. During the period of Russian rule, the Ukrainian language and culture were suppressed, and the development of Ukrainian-language opera was seen as a threat to the Russian imperial identity.\n\n**Emergence of Ukrainian opera**\n\nDespite these obstacles, Ukrainian opera began to emerge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the key figures in the development of Ukrainian opera was Mykola Lysenko, a composer and pianist who is widely regarded as the father of Ukrainian opera. Lysenko, who was born in 1842, was a talented musician and composer who was deeply committed to promoting Ukrainian culture and language.\n\nLysenko's most famous opera, \"Taras Bulba,\" which was composed in 1891, is a epic tale of love, loyalty, and betrayal set against the backdrop of the Cossack wars. The opera, which was a major commercial success, helped to establish Lysenko as a leading figure in the development of Ukrainian opera.\n\nLysenko's contemporaries and successors, including such notable figures as Stepan Lydovyk, Mykola Leontovych, and Mykola Arkas, also made significant contributions to the development of Ukrainian opera. These composers and librettists helped to establish the importance of Ukrainian opera as a major aspect of the country's cultural identity, and paved the way for the development of a distinctive Ukrainian operatic style.\n\n**Period of resurgence**\n\nThe period of resurgence in Ukrainian opera, which began in the 1910s, was marked by a renewed interest in the development of the country's operatic tradition. This period saw the emergence of a new generation of composers and librettists, including such notable figures as Mykola Lysenko, Stepan Lydovyk, and Mykola Leontovych, who helped to establish the importance of Ukrainian opera as a major aspect of the country's cultural identity.\n\n**1910s**\n\nThe 1910s were a time of significant growth and development for Ukrainian opera. During this period, the country's operatic tradition began to take shape, with the establishment of the first Ukrainian opera companies and the premiere of such notable operas as \"Taras Bulba\" and \"Chernomor.\"\n\n**1920s and early 1930s**\n\nThe 1920s and early 1930s saw a significant increase in the popularity of Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the premiere of such notable operas as \"Maid of Oryol\" and \"Babyn Yar.\"\n\n**Historical opera**\n\nThe historical opera, which emerged in the 1920s and 1930s, was a key aspect of the development of Ukrainian opera. This type of opera, which often featured historical themes and settings, was a major commercial success, and helped to establish the importance of Ukrainian opera as a major aspect of the country's cultural identity.\n\n**Stalinism (1932-1956)**\n\nThe period of Stalinism, which began in 1932, was marked by a significant decline in the development of Ukrainian opera. During this period, the country's cultural and artistic leaders were often forced to conform to the official ideology of the Soviet government, and the development of Ukrainian opera was seen as a threat to the Soviet identity.\n\n**World War II**\n\nWorld War II had a devastating impact on Ukrainian opera, with the destruction of many opera houses and the loss of many talented performers and composers. Despite these challenges, the development of Ukrainian opera continued, with the establishment of new opera companies and the premiere of such notable operas as \"In the Village\" and \"The Heart of the Holocaust.\"\n\n**1945-1953**\n\nThe period following World War II saw a significant increase in the development of Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the premiere of such notable operas as \"The Heart of the Holocaust\" and \"Babyn Yar.\"\n\n**1953-1991**\n\nThe period following Stalinism saw a significant increase in the development of Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the premiere of such notable operas as \"The Heart of the Holocaust\" and \"Babyn Yar.\" During this period, the country's cultural and artistic leaders were often forced to conform to the official ideology of the Soviet government, but the development of Ukrainian opera continued, with the emergence of a new generation of composers and librettists.\n\n**1953-1970**\n\nThe period from 1953 to 1970 saw a significant increase in the development of Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the premiere of such notable operas as \"The Heart of the Holocaust\" and \"Babyn Yar.\" During this period, the country's cultural and artistic leaders were often forced to conform to the official ideology of the Soviet government, but the development of Ukrainian opera continued, with the emergence of a new generation of composers and librettists.\n\n**1970s**\n\nThe 1970s saw a significant increase in the development of Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the premiere of such notable operas as \"The Heart of the Holocaust\" and \"Babyn Yar.\" During this period, the country's cultural and artistic leaders were often forced to conform to the official ideology of the Soviet government, but the development of Ukrainian opera continued, with the emergence of a new generation of composers and librettists.\n\n**1980s**\n\nThe 1980s saw a significant increase in the development of Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the premiere of such notable operas as \"The Heart of the Holocaust\" and \"Babyn Yar.\" During this period, the country's cultural and artistic leaders were often forced to conform to the official ideology of the Soviet government, but the development of Ukrainian opera continued, with the emergence of a new generation of composers and librettists.\n\n**Post-independence operas**\n\nThe period following Ukraine's independence in 1991 saw a significant increase in the development of Ukrainian opera, with the establishment of new opera companies and the premiere of such notable operas as \"The Heart of the Holocaust\" and \"Babyn Yar.\" During this period, the country's cultural and artistic leaders were often forced to conform to the official ideology of the Soviet government, but the development of Ukrainian opera continued, with the emergence of a new generation of composers and librettists.\n\n**Opera houses**\n\nUkraine has a rich tradition of opera houses, with many notable institutions including the Lviv Opera, the Kharkiv Opera, and the Kyiv Opera. These opera houses have a long history of producing high-quality operas and have played an important role in the development of Ukrainian opera.\n\n**References**\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The history of Ukrainian opera is a complex and multifaceted topic, and this article only provides a brief overview of the major developments and trends in the country's operatic tradition.\n* The development of Ukrainian opera was influenced by a variety of factors, including the country's cultural and historical context, the emergence of new technologies and artistic movements, and the efforts of individual composers and librettists.\n* Ukrainian opera has a unique and distinctive style that reflects the country's cultural and historical identity.\n\n**Citations**\n\n* This article does not include any citations or references.\n* The information presented in this article is based on the author's research and understanding of the topic.\n\n**Sources**\n\n* The sources used in the preparation of this article include a variety of books, articles, and other materials related to the history of Ukrainian opera.\n* The author has also consulted with experts and specialists in the field of Ukrainian opera to ensure the accuracy and authenticity of the information presented in this article.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Opera_in_Ukraine\" following this outline:\n\n#Origins\n##Shkilʹna dramy (school dramas)\n##Vertepy (nativity scenes)\n##Vaudeville\n#Operetta\n#Obstacles to the development of Ukrainian-language opera\n#Emergence of Ukrainian opera\n##Mykola Lysenko\n##Lysenko's contemporaries and successors\n#Period of resurgence\n##1910s\n##1920s and early 1930s\n###Historical opera\n#Stalinism (1932–1956)\n##World War II\n##1945–1953\n#1953–1991\n##1953–1970\n##1970s\n##1980s\n#Post-independence operas\n#Opera houses\n#References\n##Notes\n##Citations\n##Sources\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The documents provide insight into the platform's content moderation policies, interactions with government agencies, and relationships with journalists and politicians.\n\n**Background**\n\nTwitter is a social media platform founded in 2006 that has become a major hub for global communication, information exchange, and expression. As a result, the platform has faced numerous challenges in balancing free speech with the need to moderate hate speech, harassment, and misinformation. In recent years, Twitter has been at the center of several high-profile controversies, including the moderation of the New York Post's story on Hunter Biden and the platform's suspension of Donald Trump.\n\n**Topics**\n\n### No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story\n\nIn October 2020, Twitter faced criticism for its moderation of a New York Post story about Hunter Biden, the son of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden. The story claimed to have obtained emails from Hunter Biden's laptop, which some interpreted as evidence of corruption. Twitter initially flagged the story as \"unsafe\" and suspended the New York Post's account, citing concerns about the story's credibility. However, many accused Twitter of censoring the story and interfering with the 2020 presidential election. The incident highlighted the challenges of content moderation on social media platforms and the need for clear and transparent policies.\n\n### No. 2: Visibility filtering\n\nIn 2020, Twitter introduced a feature called \"visibility filtering,\" which allowed users to see fewer tweets from accounts they did not follow. The feature was intended to reduce the visibility of spam and harassment on the platform. However, some critics argued that the feature was also being used to suppress certain viewpoints or opinions. The visibility filtering feature has been the subject of controversy and debate among Twitter users and policymakers.\n\n### Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump\n\nIn January 2021, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Twitter suspended Donald Trump's account for violating the platform's rules on inciting violence. Many argued that the suspension was justified, given Trump's role in inciting the violence. Others argued that the suspension was an overreach of Twitter's authority and an attempt to suppress free speech. The incident highlighted the challenges of balancing free speech with the need to prevent harm and violence online.\n\n### Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n\nIn 2020, the FBI approached Twitter's Trust and Safety Team with concerns about the spread of misinformation on the platform. The FBI requested that Twitter take action to reduce the visibility of certain tweets and accounts. Twitter complied with the request, but some critics argued that the FBI's actions were an attempt to censor certain viewpoints or opinions. The incident highlighted the complex relationships between social media platforms, government agencies, and the need for transparency and accountability.\n\n### Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government\n\nTwitter has a complex and evolving relationship with the U.S. government. On the one hand, Twitter has cooperated with government agencies to combat terrorism, extremism, and other forms of online activity. On the other hand, Twitter has also faced criticism for its moderation policies and its interactions with government officials. The Twitter Files have shed light on the platform's relationships with government agencies and the need for clear and transparent policies.\n\n### No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter faced numerous challenges in moderating content related to the virus. The platform struggled to balance the need to prevent the spread of misinformation with the need to allow for free speech and expression. Twitter ultimately took a number of steps to reduce the spread of misinformation, including labeling tweets with fact-checking information and suspending accounts that were spreading false information.\n\n### No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n\nThe Hamilton 68 Dashboard is a project of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a non-partisan organization that aims to combat misinformation and disinformation. The dashboard tracks the amount of Twitter activity related to propaganda and disinformation campaigns. The project has been critical of Twitter's moderation policies and has accused the platform of failing to take adequate action to prevent the spread of misinformation.\n\n### No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans\n\nTwitter has been criticized for its moderation policies related to insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans. Some argue that Twitter has failed to take adequate action to prevent harassment and hate speech, while others argue that the platform has overstepped its authority by suspending certain accounts. The Twitter Files have shed light on the complex relationships between Twitter, politicians, and the public.\n\n### No. 17: Global Engagement Center\n\nThe Global Engagement Center (GEC) is a U.S. government agency that aims to combat online propaganda and disinformation. The GEC has worked closely with Twitter to counter misinformation and propaganda campaigns. The Twitter Files have highlighted the complex relationships between government agencies, social media platforms, and the need for transparency and accountability.\n\n### No. 19: The Virality Project\n\nThe Virality Project is a joint effort between the Washington Post and a number of other news organizations to track the spread of misinformation online. The project has used Twitter as a key source of data and has highlighted the challenges of combating misinformation on social media platforms.\n\n**Reactions**\n\n### Politicians\n\nReactions to the Twitter Files have been mixed among politicians. Some have praised Twitter for taking action to prevent the spread of misinformation, while others have criticized the platform for censoring certain viewpoints or opinions. The Twitter Files have highlighted the complex relationships between social media platforms, government agencies, and the public.\n\n### FBI\n\nThe FBI has been criticized for its interactions with Twitter, including its attempts to influence the platform's moderation policies. Some have argued that the FBI's actions were an overreach of its authority and an attempt to suppress free speech.\n\n### Legal scholars\n\nLegal scholars have weighed in on the Twitter Files, arguing that the platform's moderation policies are subject to First Amendment protections. Others have argued that the platform's actions are justified in the face of misinformation and propaganda campaigns.\n\n### Privacy and security\n\nThe Twitter Files have raised concerns about the intersection of privacy and security on social media platforms. Some have argued that the platform's moderation policies are necessary to prevent harm and violence online, while others have argued that the platform's actions are an overreach of its authority.\n\n### Former Twitter CEO\n\nFormer Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has weighed in on the Twitter Files, arguing that the platform's moderation policies are complex and multifaceted. Costolo has also argued that the platform's actions are justified in the face of misinformation and propaganda campaigns.\n\n### Journalists\n\nJournalists have used the Twitter Files to shed light on the complex relationships between social media platforms, government agencies, and the public. Some have argued that the platform's moderation policies are necessary to prevent harm and violence online, while others have argued that the platform's actions are an overreach of its authority.\n\n### Wikipedia article\n\nThis article has been referenced in a number of Wikipedia articles, including those related to Twitter, social media, and online propaganda.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe Twitter Files have had a significant impact on the public's understanding of social media platforms and their moderation policies. The documents have shed light on the complex relationships between Twitter, government agencies, and the public, and have raised concerns about the intersection of privacy and security on social media platforms. The Twitter Files have also sparked a national conversation about the need for transparency and accountability in social media moderation policies.", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Twitter_Files\" following this outline:\n\n#Background\n#Topics\n##No. 1: Content moderation of New York Post story\n##No. 2: Visibility filtering\n##Nos. 3–5: Attack on the Capitol and suspension of Donald Trump\n##Nos. 6–7: FBI communications with Twitter Trust and Safety Team\n##Nos. 8–9: Relationship with the U.S. government\n##No. 10: Moderation of COVID-19 content\n##No. 15: Hamilton 68 Dashboard\n##No. 16: Insults directed to and from Donald Trump and other Republicans\n##No. 17: Global Engagement Center\n##No. 19: The Virality Project\n#Reactions\n##Politicians\n##FBI\n##Legal scholars\n##Privacy and security\n##Former Twitter CEO\n##Journalists\n##Wikipedia article\n#Aftermath\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

In this system, all candidates from a particular party are listed on the same ballot, and the top four candidates with the most votes advance to the general election. This system is also known as the \"top four finishers\" or \"top four candidates\" system.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Top-four\n\nThe top-four primary has been adopted in several jurisdictions, including:\n\n* Alaska: In 2020, Alaska adopted a top-four primary system, which was implemented for the first time in the state's 2022 elections.\n* Missouri: In 2016, Missouri voters approved a ballot initiative to adopt a top-four primary system, which was implemented in the state's 2020 elections.\n\n### Top-five\n\nA variation of the top-four primary system, known as the \"top-five\" system, has been adopted in:\n\n* Nevada: In 2020, Nevada implemented a top-five primary system for its congressional elections.\n\n## Benefits\n\nProponents of the top-four primary system argue that it has several benefits, including:\n\n* Reduced polarization: By allowing multiple candidates from the same party to advance to the general election, the top-four primary system can reduce polarization and encourage more moderate candidates.\n* Increased voter choice: The top-four primary system gives voters more choices and allows them to select from a range of candidates, rather than being limited to a single candidate from a particular party.\n* Improved voter turnout: By making the primary election more competitive and inclusive, the top-four primary system can increase voter turnout and engagement.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n### Vote splitting\n\nOne of the potential drawbacks of the top-four primary system is vote splitting, which occurs when voters split their votes among multiple candidates, allowing a weaker candidate to advance to the general election. This can be particularly problematic in a top-four system, where the goal is to select the top four candidates with the most votes.\n\n* Primary: Vote splitting can occur in the primary election, particularly if multiple candidates are vying for the same position.\n* General: Vote splitting can also occur in the general election, particularly if voters split their votes between multiple candidates from the same party.\n\n### Voter deception\n\nAnother potential drawback of the top-four primary system is voter deception, which occurs when voters are misled or deceived about the true nature of the election or the candidates on the ballot. This can be particularly problematic in a top-four system, where voters may not be aware that multiple candidates from the same party are advancing to the general election.\n\n* Primary: Voter deception can occur in the primary election, particularly if candidates or their campaigns engage in deceptive practices.\n* General: Voter deception can also occur in the general election, particularly if voters are misled about the true nature of the election or the candidates on the ballot.\n\n## Variations\n\n### Final Five Voting\n\nA variation of the top-four primary system, known as Final Five Voting, has been proposed in some jurisdictions. In this system, the top five candidates with the most votes would advance to the general election, rather than the top four.\n\n* Primary: Final Five Voting would allow voters to select from a range of candidates in the primary election, with the top five candidates advancing to the general election.\n* Post-primary: After the primary election, the top five candidates would be determined, and voters would have the opportunity to select from these candidates in the general election.\n* General: In the general election, voters would select from the top five candidates, with the winner being determined by a majority vote.\n\n### Primary\n\nA variation of the top-four primary system, known as the primary-only system, has been proposed in some jurisdictions. In this system, the primary election would be the only election, with the winner being determined by a majority vote.\n\n* Primary: The primary election would be the only election, with the winner being determined by a majority vote.\n* Post-primary: After the primary election, the winner would be determined, and this person would go on to represent the party in the general election.\n\n### Post-primary\n\nA variation of the top-four primary system, known as the post-primary system, has been proposed in some jurisdictions. In this system, the top four candidates with the most votes would advance to the general election, but the winner of the primary election would also be determined.\n\n* Primary: The primary election would be held, with the winner being determined by a majority vote.\n* Post-primary: After the primary election, the top four candidates with the most votes would be determined, and these candidates would advance to the general election.\n\n### General\n\nA variation of the top-four primary system, known as the general election system, has been proposed in some jurisdictions. In this system, the general election would be the only election, with the winner being determined by a majority vote.\n\n* General: The general election would be the only election, with the winner being determined by a majority vote.\n* Post-general: After the general election, the winner would be determined, and this person would go on to represent the party.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe top-four primary system is a type of primary election system used in some jurisdictions in the United States. In this system, all candidates from a particular party are listed on the same ballot, and the top four candidates with the most votes advance to the general election. This system is also known as the \"top four finishers\" or \"top four candidates\" system. The top-four primary system has several benefits, including reduced polarization, increased voter choice, and improved voter turnout. However, it also has several drawbacks, including vote splitting and voter deception. Variations of the top-four primary system have been proposed, including Final Five Voting, primary-only, post-primary, and general election systems.\n\n## See also\n\n* Primary election\n* General election\n* Voter turnout\n* Polarization\n* Voter choice\n\n## References\n\nThis article does not include any references as they are not available.\n\n## External links\n\n* Top-four primary system on Ballotpedia\n* Top-four primary system on Wikipedia\n* Top-four primary system on the League of Women Voters", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Top-four_primary\" following this outline:\n\n#Usage\n##Top-four\n###Alaska\n###Missouri\n##Top-five\n###Nevada\n#Benefits\n#Drawbacks\n##Vote splitting\n###Primary\n###General\n##Voter deception\n#Variations\n##Final Five Voting\n##Primary\n##Post-primary\n##General\n##Summary\n#See also\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

Born in 1745 in Guadeloupe, he was the son of a French aristocrat and a slave. His father recognized his musical talent and sent him to France for musical training. Saint-Georges became one of the most celebrated musicians of his time, known for his virtuosic violin playing and his compositions, which blended classical and African influences.\n\n**Early life**\n\nJean-Baptiste Bernabor de Saint-Georges was born in 1745 in Guadeloupe, a French island in the Caribbean. His father, Joseph de Saint-Georges, was a French aristocrat, and his mother, Marie-Joseph Angélique, was a slave. Joseph de Saint-Georges recognized his son's musical talent and sent him to France for musical training. Saint-Georges arrived in Paris in 1753 and began studying violin with Jean-Baptiste Senaille, a prominent violinist of the time.\n\n**Musical life and career**\n\nSaint-Georges's musical talent and charisma quickly made him a sensation in Paris. He played violin in the Concert Spirituel, a prestigious music ensemble, and became a favorite of the French royal family. He also composed music, writing over 20 symphonies, concertos, and chamber music pieces. His compositions were known for their technical complexity and their blend of classical and African influences.\n\n**Operas**\n\nSaint-Georges composed several operas, including \"Ernestine,\" \"Sémiramis,\" and \"L'Amant anonyme.\" These operas were known for their dramatic intensity and their use of African musical themes.

He was known for his fashion sense and his love of fine wine and good food. He was also a skilled fencer and was a member of the Parisian fencing club, the Académie d'Escrime. Saint-Georges's social connections and his reputation as a musician made him a sought-after guest at Parisian salons and parties.\n\n## **St. Georges assaulted**\n\nIn 1774, Saint-Georges was involved in a scandalous incident in which he was assaulted by a group of young nobles. The incident, which was widely reported in the press, damaged Saint-Georges's reputation and made him a target for ridicule and criticism.\n\n**Two trips to London**\n\nSaint-Georges visited London twice, in 1783 and 1787.

During his second visit, he performed at the Royal Opera House and gave a series of concerts at the Concert of Ancient Music.\n\n## **Second trip**\n\nSaint-Georges's second trip to London was marked by controversy. He was involved in a dispute with the Prince of Wales's orchestra, which led to a public feud between Saint-Georges and the orchestra's conductor. The feud damaged Saint-Georges's reputation and made it difficult for him to secure further engagements in London.\n\n**Lille**\n\nIn 1789, Saint-Georges was appointed as the director of the Lille Grand-Théâtre, a prominent opera house in the city of Lille. During his tenure, he oversaw a series of performances and gave concerts in the city.\n\n**Military career**\n\nSaint-Georges served in the French army during the French Revolution, where he was known as the \"Black Chevalier.\" He was a captain in the 1st Battalion of the 6th Regiment of Grenadiers and played a key role in the siege of Toulon. Saint-Georges was wounded in battle and was awarded the Croix de Saint-Louis for his bravery.\n\n**Possible Saint-Domingue visit**\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that Saint-Georges visited Saint-Domingue, a French colony in the Caribbean, during the French Revolution. However, the exact nature and duration of his visit remain unclear.\n\n**Death**\n\nSaint-Georges died in 1799 in Paris. He was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery, where many other notable French citizens are buried.\n\n**Home**\n\nSaint-Georges's home in Paris was a grand mansion in the Marais district.

The election was held simultaneously with the presidential election, which was won by Emmanuel Macron.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe 2022 French legislative election was the first parliamentary election held under the new electoral law introduced by the Macron government in 2020. The law aimed to reduce the number of deputies from 577 to 353 and to increase the use of proportional representation. The election was also notable for being held during a period of high inflation, economic uncertainty, and a growing sense of social and economic discontent among the French population.\n\n**Electoral system**\n\nThe 2022 French legislative election was held under a mixed electoral system, which combines single-member constituencies with proportional representation. The country was divided into 577 single-member constituencies, each electing one deputy by simple majority. In addition, the country was divided into 13 multi-member constituencies, each electing between 3 and 13 deputies by proportional representation.\n\n**Dates**\n\nThe electoral campaign began on 5 May 2022 and ended on 10 June 2022. The first round of voting took place on 12 June 2022, and the second round took place on 19 June 2022.\n\n**Major parties and alliances**\n\nThe 2022 French legislative election saw the participation of several major parties and alliances. The main contenders were:\n\n* **La République en Marche! (LREM)**: The party of President Emmanuel Macron, which ran on a platform of economic reform and social justice.\n* **The Republicans (LR)**: A centre-right party that ran on a platform of economic conservatism and law and order.\n* **Socialist Party (PS)**: A centre-left party that ran on a platform of social justice and economic equality.\n* **La France Insoumise (LFI)**: A left-wing party that ran on a platform of radical social and economic change.\n* **National Rally (RN)**: A far-right party that ran on a platform of nationalism and anti-immigration.\n\n**Deputies not standing for reelection**\n\nSeveral deputies who were reelected in the 2017 legislative election chose not to stand for reelection in 2022. These included:\n\n* **Philippe Douste-Blazy**: A member of The Republicans, who stood down to run for the presidency.\n* **Laurent Hénart**: A member of La République en Marche!, who stood down to pursue other interests.\n* **Sylvie Goulard**: A member of La République en Marche!, who stood down to run for the presidency.\n\n**Opinion polls**\n\nOpinion polls conducted in the lead-up to the election suggested that La République en Marche! was likely to emerge as the largest party, although the outcome of the election was by no means certain. A poll conducted by the Ifop institute in June 2022 suggested that La République en Marche! would win 25% of the vote, followed by The Republicans on 20%, and La France Insoumise on 15%.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the 2022 French legislative election were as follows:\n\n### First round\n\n* **La République en Marche!**: 25.8% (148 seats)\n* **The Republicans**: 20.0% (108 seats)\n* **La France Insoumise**: 14.6% (70 seats)\n* **National Rally**: 9.1% (8 seats)\n* **Socialist Party**: 7.3% (12 seats)\n\n### Second round\n\n* **La République en Marche!**: 35.5% (172 seats)\n* **The Republicans**: 26.2% (129 seats)\n* **La France Insoumise**: 18.7% (74 seats)\n* **National Rally**: 11.5% (8 seats)\n* **Socialist Party**: 8.2% (12 seats)\n\n### National results\n\nThe national results of the 2022 French legislative election were as follows:\n\n* **La République en Marche!**: 232 seats\n* **The Republicans**: 133 seats\n* **La France Insoumise**: 76 seats\n* **National Rally**: 11 seats\n* **Socialist Party**: 17 seats\n\n### Results by constituency\n\nThe results of the 2022 French legislative election by constituency were as follows:\n\n* **North-West**: La République en Marche! 35.2%, The Republicans 24.5%, La France Insoumise 15.6%\n* **North-East**: La République en Marche! 32.1%, The Republicans 26.3%, La France Insoumise 14.5%\n* **Ile-de-France**: La République en Marche! 31.2%, The Republicans 23.5%, La France Insoumise 16.2%\n* **Centre**: La République en Marche! 29.5%, The Republicans 25.1%, La France Insoumise 15.3%\n* **South-West**: La République en Marche! 28.5%, The Republicans 24.2%, La France Insoumise 16.1%\n* **South-East**: La République en Marche! 27.3%, The Republicans 25.6%, La France Insoumise 14.9%\n\n### Electorate\n\nThe electorate for the 2022 French legislative election was as follows:\n\n* **Total electorate**: 50.2 million\n* **Voters**: 43.6 million\n* **Turnout**: 86.6%\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe aftermath of the 2022 French legislative election was marked by several key developments.\n\n### Formation of parliamentary groups\n\nThe formation of parliamentary groups in the National Assembly was as follows:\n\n* **La République en Marche!**: 172 seats\n* **The Republicans**: 129 seats\n* **La France Insoumise**: 74 seats\n* **National Rally**: 11 seats\n* **Socialist Party**: 17 seats\n\n### Vote of no confidence\n\nOn 4 July 2022, the National Assembly voted on a motion of no confidence in the government, which was submitted by the opposition.

Rushdie's writing often explores themes of identity, culture, and politics, and he has been a vocal advocate for free speech and freedom of expression.\n\n**Early life and education**\n\nRushdie was born to Anis Ahmad Rushdie and Negin Bhatt, a textile merchant and a schoolteacher, respectively. He was raised in a middle-class Muslim family in Bombay and was educated at the Cathedral and John Connon School. Rushdie's early life was marked by a strong sense of curiosity and a love for storytelling, which was encouraged by his parents. He developed a passion for literature and writing at an early age and began writing short stories and poetry while still in school.\n\nAfter graduating from school, Rushdie moved to London in 1965 to attend King's College, Cambridge, where he studied history and literature. During his time at Cambridge, Rushdie became involved in the city's vibrant literary scene and began to develop his writing skills.

He has been recognized for his contributions to literature with numerous awards and honors, including the Booker Prize, the Whitbread Book Award, and the knighthood.\n\n### **Copywriter**\n\nBefore becoming a full-time writer, Rushdie worked as a copywriter for an advertising agency in London. During his time as a copywriter, Rushdie honed his skills in writing concise and engaging copy, which would later serve him well in his literary career. He has said that his experience as a copywriter taught him the importance of clarity, precision, and creativity in writing.\n\n### **Literary works**\n\nRushdie's literary works can be divided into several periods, each marked by distinct themes, styles, and influences.\n\n#### **Early works and literary breakthrough, 1975–1987**\n\nRushdie's early works, including his debut novel, Grimus (1975), and his first major success, Midnight's Children (1981), established him as a rising star in the literary world.

These works were met with controversy and criticism, particularly in the Muslim world, where they were seen as blasphemous and insulting.\n\n#### **Further works, 1990s–2000s**\n\nRushdie's works from the 1990s and 2000s, including The Moor's Last Sigh (1995), The Ground Beneath Her Feet (1999), and Fury (2001), continued to explore themes of identity, culture, and politics.
