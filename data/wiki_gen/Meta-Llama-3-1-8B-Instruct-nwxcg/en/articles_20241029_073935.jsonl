The election was held in 2022, following the resignation of Erin O'Toole as leader in February 2022.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Conservative Party of Canada is one of the two major political parties in Canada, along with the Liberal Party of Canada. The party has a long history of electing leaders through a leadership election process. The leadership election is typically held every 2-3 years, and is open to all members of the party who are in good standing.\n\nThe leadership election process typically involves several rounds of voting, with the candidate who receives the most votes in each round advancing to the next round. The winner of the final round is declared the winner of the leadership election.\n\n# Timeline\n\n## 2020\n\nIn 2020, the Conservative Party of Canada was led by Erin O'Toole, who had been elected as leader in August 2020. O'Toole had promised to unite the party and to focus on issues such as the economy and national unity.\n\n## 2021\n\nIn 2021, the Conservative Party of Canada began to consider the possibility of a leadership election. O'Toole had faced criticism from some party members and supporters for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there were concerns that he was not doing enough to unite the party.\n\n## 2022\n\nIn February 2022, Erin O'Toole resigned as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, citing a lack of support from party members. This led to the announcement of a leadership election, which was scheduled to take place in the spring of 2022.\n\n# Rules and procedures\n\nThe leadership election was held under the rules of the Conservative Party of Canada. All eligible members of the party were entitled to vote, and the candidate who received the most votes in each round would advance to the next round.\n\nThe leadership election was held over several rounds, with the winner being determined by a simple majority of the votes cast. The winner of the leadership election would be announced at the end of the final round.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe leadership election campaign was marked by a number of controversies and debates. One of the main issues was the role of party members in the leadership election process. Some party members argued that the party should be more open and inclusive, while others argued that the party should be more exclusive and focused on its core supporters.\n\nThere were also concerns about the role of money in the leadership election. Some candidates were accused of using their personal wealth to fund their campaigns, which raised questions about the fairness and integrity of the process.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nThe leadership election campaign was marked by a number of controversies and debates. The winner of the leadership election was Scott Aitchison, who was elected as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada in June 2022.\n\nAitchison's victory was seen as a surprise by some, as he was not considered to be a front-runner in the leadership election. However, he won the support of many party members who were looking for a new direction for the party.\n\n# Results\n\nThe results of the leadership election were as follows:\n\n## Provincial summary\n\nThe results of the leadership election were as follows:\n\n| Province | Scott Aitchison | Jean Charest | Pierre Poilievre | Leslyn Lewis | Roman Baber | Leslyn Lewis | Scott Aitchison |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alberta | 36.9% | 22.1% | 30.5% | 3.5% | 1.5% | 4.5% | 1.5% |\n| British Columbia | 41.9% | 26.3% | 24.5% | 3.5% | 1.5% | 2.5% | 0.5% |\n| Manitoba | 45.9% | 28.5% | 19.5% | 2.5% | 1.5% | 2.5% | 0.5% |\n| New Brunswick | 38.5% | 29.5% | 24.5% | 3.5% | 1.5% | 3.5% | 0.5% |\n| Newfoundland and Labrador | 42.5% | 31.5% | 20.5% | 2.5% | 1.5% | 2.5% | 0.5% |\n| Nova Scotia | 40.5% | 33.5% | 20.5% | 2.5% | 1.5% | 2.5% | 0.5% |\n| Ontario | 44.5% | 30.5% | 20.5% | 2.5% | 1.5% | 2.5% | 0.5% |\n| Prince Edward Island | 41.5% | 32.5% | 20.5% | 2.5% | 1.5% | 2.5% | 0.5% |\n| Saskatchewan | 48.5% | 25.5% | 20.5% | 2.5% | 1.5% | 2.5% | 0.5% |\n\n# Debates\n\nThe leadership election campaign included several debates between the candidates.

He is one of the most influential and innovative filmmakers of the 20th century, known for his contributions to the French New Wave movement and his exploration of politics, philosophy, and aesthetics in his films.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nGodard was born on December 3, 1930, in Paris, France. His father, Paul Godard, was a 1st Lieutenant in the French army, and his mother, Odile Lucie Madeleine Tramon, was a socialite. Godard grew up in a middle-class family and was raised in the Latin Quarter of Paris. He studied philosophy at the Sorbonne University, where he became interested in Marxist theory and existentialism.\n\n**Early Career (1950–1959)**\n\n### Film Criticism\n\nGodard began his career as a film critic for the French film magazine _Cahiers du Cinéma_. He quickly established himself as a leading critic of French cinema, advocating for the importance of auteur theory and the potential of film as an art form. His writing was heavily influenced by the ideas of André Bazin, a prominent film critic and theorist.\n\n### Filmmaking\n\nGodard's early forays into filmmaking were marked by a series of short films and documentaries. His first feature film, _Breathless_ (1960), was a critical and commercial success, and it established Godard as a major talent in French cinema.\n\n**New Wave Period (1960–1967)**\n\nThe French New Wave movement, also known as the _Nouvelle Vague_, was a collective of young filmmakers who sought to challenge traditional narrative structures and aesthetic conventions in cinema. Godard was a key figure in this movement, and his films during this period reflect his commitment to innovation and experimentation.\n\n### Breathless\n\n_Breathless_ (1960) was Godard's first feature film, and it was a critical and commercial success. The film tells the story of a young car thief, Michel, who abducts an American tourist, Mary, and embarks on a series of adventures with her. The film's innovative cinematography, editing, and narrative structure established Godard as a major talent in French cinema.\n\n### Early Work with Anna Karina\n\nGodard's second feature film, _Vivre sa vie_ (1962), was a critical success, and it marked the beginning of a long-term collaboration with actress Anna Karina. The film tells the story of a young woman, Nana, who becomes a prostitute in order to support her husband and daughter. The film's exploration of themes such as alienation, desire, and social inequality established Godard as a major filmmaker.\n\n### Vivre sa vie\n\n_Vivre sa vie_ (1962) was a critical success, and it marked the beginning of a long-term collaboration with actress Anna Karina. The film tells the story of a young woman, Nana, who becomes a prostitute in order to support her husband and daughter. The film's exploration of themes such as alienation, desire, and social inequality established Godard as a major filmmaker.\n\n### Le petit soldat and Les Carabiniers\n\nGodard's next two films, _Le petit soldat_ (1960) and _Les Carabiniers_ (1963), were both critical and commercial successes. _Le petit soldat_ was a thriller about a young man who becomes embroiled in a plot to assassinate a politician, while _Les Carabiniers_ was a satirical comedy about two young men who join the army to fight in a war.\n\n### Contempt\n\nGodard's next film, _Contempt_ (1963), was a critical and commercial success. The film tells the story of a screenwriter, Paul, who is hired to write a script for a film about a Roman general. However, the film becomes a personal and artistic failure, reflecting the tension between art and commerce.\n\n### Anouchka Films\n\nIn 1964, Godard founded Anouchka Films, a production company that would go on to produce many of his films. The company was named after his daughter, Anouchka.\n\n### Week End\n\nGodard's next film, _Week End_ (1967), was a critical and commercial success. The film tells the story of a young couple, Corinne and Roland, who embark on a road trip through the French countryside. However, their relationship begins to unravel as they encounter a series of surreal and absurd situations.\n\n**Political Period (1968–1979)**\n\nThe late 1960s and early 1970s were a period of great social and political upheaval in France.

Godard, who had long been critical of Western imperialism, became increasingly involved in anti-war activism during this period.\n\n### Bertolt Brecht\n\nGodard was heavily influenced by the ideas of Bertolt Brecht, a German playwright and poet. Brecht's ideas about the importance of alienation and the need for a critical perspective on art and society had a major impact on Godard's filmmaking style.\n\n### Marxism\n\nGodard's views on Marxism were complex and nuanced. He was critical of the Soviet Union and the idea of a centralized state, but he also saw Marxism as a powerful critique of capitalism and imperialism.\n\n### Revolutionary period (1968–1979)\n\nThe late 1960s and early 1970s were a period of great social and political upheaval in France. Godard, who had long been interested in Marxist theory and politics, became increasingly involved in radical politics during this period.\n\n### Films\n\nGodard's films during this period reflect his commitment to politics and social critique. _La Chinoise_ (1967), _British Sounds_ (1969), and _Vent d'est_ (1970) are just a few examples of films that reflect his interest in politics and social change.\n\n### Sonimage\n\nIn 1971, Godard founded Sonimage, a production company that would go on to produce many of his films. The company was based in Rolle, Switzerland, and it allowed Godard to work on a wide range of projects, including films, television shows, and commercials.\n\n### Jean-Pierre Gorin\n\nGodard collaborated with Jean-Pierre Gorin on several films during this period, including _Vent d'est_ (1970) and _Letter to Jane_ (1972).

The group was named after the Soviet filmmaker Dziga Vertov, and it was dedicated to creating experimental and avant-garde films. The group produced several films, including _Letter to Jane_ (1972) and _Tout va bien_ (1972).\n\n**Return to commercial films and Histoire(s) du cinéma (1980–2000)**\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s were a period of great change for Godard. He began to return to commercial filmmaking, and he also started to work on a series of projects that would become known as his _Histoire(s) du cinéma_.\n\n### Histoire(s) du cinéma\n\nThe _Histoire(s) du cinéma_ is a series of 10 films that Godard made between 1985 and 1998. The films are a critique of the history of cinema, and they reflect Godard's interest in the relationship between art and history.\n\n**Late period films (2001–2022)**\n\nIn the 21st century, Godard continued to work on a wide range of projects, including films, television shows, and documentaries. His late period films reflect his continued interest in politics, art, and history.\n\n### Film Socialisme\n\nGodard's 2010 film, _Film Socialisme_, was a critical and commercial success.

The film is a critique of language and meaning, and it reflects Godard's continued interest in the relationship between art and language.\n\n**Personal Life and Death**\n\nGodard married Anne-Marie Miéville in 1961, and they had three children together. He also had a long-term relationship with actress Anna Karina, and the two worked together on several films.\n\nGodard died on September 13, 2022, at the age of 91, in Rolle, Switzerland.\n\n**Legacy**\n\nGodard's legacy is complex and multifaceted.

He was a key member of the team during the period of Australian dominance in international cricket in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n**Early life**\n\nShane Warne was born on September 30, 1969, in Upper Ferntree Gully, Victoria, Australia.

He was captain of the school's cricket team and represented the school in several state-level competitions.\n\n**Early career**\n\nWarne's early cricket career was marked by a series of impressive performances at the junior level. He made his debut for Victoria at the age of 17 and quickly established himself as a talented young cricketer. In 1990, Warne was named the Victorian Young Cricketer of the Year, and in 1991, he was selected to represent Australia in the World Cup.

This collaboration took many forms, including military, economic, and ideological support, and was motivated by a range of factors, including a desire for self-preservation, a sense of nationalism, and ideological alignment with the Axis powers. This article provides an overview of the collaboration with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in different regions of Europe and beyond.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe term \"collaboration\" is often used to describe the relationships between the Axis powers and those who supported them during World War II. However, it is essential to note that the extent and nature of this collaboration varied widely across different countries and contexts. Some individuals and organizations provided overt and enthusiastic support for the Axis powers, while others offered more subtle or reluctant cooperation. In some cases, collaboration was forced or coerced, while in others it was voluntary.\n\n**Collaboration in Western Europe**\n\n**Belgium**\n\nBelgium was occupied by Germany in May 1940, and a collaborationist government was established under the leadership of Léon Degrelle. The Belgian Rexist Party, a fascist organization, played a significant role in promoting collaboration with Germany. Many Belgians participated in the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz, a German-led militia that targeted perceived enemies of the occupation. Collaborationist forces also participated in the Holocaust, with an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 Jews deported to concentration camps.\n\n**British Channel Islands**\n\nThe British Channel Islands, including Jersey and Guernsey, were occupied by Germany from 1940 to 1945. A collaborationist government was established, and many islanders participated in the occupation, including serving in the German military. The islands were used as a base for German naval and air operations, and the local population was subject to strict controls and repression.\n\n**Denmark**\n\nDenmark was occupied by Germany in April 1940, and a collaborationist government was established under the leadership of Erik Scavenius. The Danish Social Democratic Party played a significant role in promoting collaboration with Germany, and many Danes participated in the occupation, including serving in the German military. However, a significant number of Danes also resisted the occupation, and an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 Jews were saved from deportation to concentration camps.\n\n**France**\n\n**Vichy France**\n\nFrance was occupied by Germany in June 1940, and a collaborationist government was established in Vichy under the leadership of Marshal Philippe Pétain. The Vichy government implemented a range of anti-Semitic and repressive policies, including the forced internment of Jewish citizens and the suppression of trade unions. Many French citizens participated in the French military, which fought alongside the Germans in several campaigns, including the invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\n**Collaborationist movements**\n\nSeveral collaborationist movements emerged in France during the occupation, including the Milice française, a paramilitary organization that served as a police force for the Vichy government. The Milice was responsible for rounding up and deporting Jewish citizens to concentration camps. Other collaborationist movements, such as the Parti populaire français and the Rassemblement national populaire, promoted fascist and nationalist ideologies.\n\n**Uniformed collaboration**\n\nMany French citizens served in uniformed collaborationist forces, including the French military, the Milice française, and the Legion of French Volunteers against Bolshevism. These forces participated in a range of military campaigns, including the invasion of the Soviet Union and the suppression of the French Resistance.\n\n**Communist party**\n\nThe French Communist Party played a significant role in the Resistance, and many of its members were arrested and deported to concentration camps by the Vichy government. However, a smaller group of communist leaders collaborated with the Vichy government, serving as members of the Milice française and other collaborationist organizations.\n\n**French workers for Germany**\n\nAn estimated 400,000 French workers were sent to Germany to work in factories and farms during the occupation. Many of these workers were subjected to poor conditions and treatment, and some were forced to participate in the Holocaust.\n\n**Vichy collaboration in the Holocaust**\n\nThe Vichy government played a significant role in the Holocaust, with an estimated 76,000 t", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"Collaboration_with_Nazi_Germany_and_Fascist_Italy\" following this outline:\n\n#Terminology\n#Collaboration in Western Europe\n##Belgium\n##British Channel Islands\n##Denmark\n##France\n###Vichy France\n###Collaborationist movements\n###Uniformed collaboration\n###Communist party\n###French workers for Germany\n###Vichy collaboration in the Holocaust\n###Aftermath\n##Luxembourg\n##Monaco\n##Netherlands\n##Norway\n#Collaboration in Eastern Europe\n##Albania\n##Baltic states\n###Estonia\n###Latvia\n###Lithuania\n##Bulgaria\n##Czecho-Slovakia\n###Sudetenland\n###Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (the Czech lands)\n###Slovak Republic\n##Greece\n##Hungary\n##Poland\n##Romania\n##Yugoslavia\n###Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia\n####Serbian units\n####Ethnic Russian units\n####Banat\n###Montenegro\n###Kosovo\n###Macedonia\n###Slovene Lands\n###Independent State of Croatia\n###Bosnia\n#Soviet Union\n##Hiwis\n##Eastern Legions\n##Russia\n###Kalmykians\n##Belarus\n##Transcaucasia\n#Collaboration beyond Europe with the European Axis powers\n##Egypt and the Palestine mandate\n##French colonial empire\n###French North Africa\n####Morocco\n####Tunisia\n###French Equatorial Africa\n###Syria and the Lebanon (League of Nations mandates)\n#Foreign volunteers\n##French military volunteers\n##Volunteers from British India\n##Non-German units of the Waffen-SS\n#Business collaboration\n#See also\n#Notes\n#References\n##Bibliography\n#Further reading\n##Estonia\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

This phenomenon, also known as the \"flying saucer craze,\" captivated the public imagination and sparked widespread media attention.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze began in June and continued through the summer months, with reports of sightings and alleged landings of strange aerial objects coming from across the United States. The phenomenon was characterized by a mix of excitement, curiosity, and speculation, as people struggled to explain the nature and origin of these mysterious objects. The craze was fueled by a combination of media coverage, public fascination, and the lack of authoritative explanations.\n\n**Events of Summer 1947**\n\n### Initial Reports\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze began on June 24, 1947, when a private pilot named Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine disk-shaped objects flying in formation over Mount Rainier, Washington. Arnold's sighting was widely publicized and is often credited with popularizing the term \"flying saucer.\"\n\n### Additional Reports\n\nIn the days following Arnold's sighting, reports of similar aerial phenomena began to flood in from across the United States. On June 25, 1947, a group of people in Idaho reported seeing a flying saucer-like object in the sky. Other reports came from Oregon, Washington, and California.\n\n### Pacific Northwest Reports Amid Jet Speculation\n\nThe Pacific Northwest region of the United States was particularly active during the early days of the flying disc craze. On June 26, 1947, a group of people in Seattle, Washington reported seeing a flying saucer-like object in the sky. Some speculated that the objects might be experimental jet aircraft being tested by the military.\n\n### Reports Throughout the West\n\nAs the days passed, reports of flying saucer sightings began to spread throughout the western United States. On June 28, 1947, a group of people in Los Angeles, California reported seeing a flying saucer-like object in the sky. Other reports came from Arizona, Nevada, and Utah.\n\n### Potential Explanations Offered\n\nAs the number of reports grew, experts and officials began to offer explanations for the sightings. Some speculated that the objects might be experimental aircraft or balloons, while others suggested that they might be natural phenomena, such as meteors or clouds.\n\n### Increasing Prominence\n\nAs the flying disc craze continued to grow, it began to attract the attention of officials and politicians. On June 30, 1947, the Lieutenant Governor of Washington State, Victor A. Meyers, reported seeing a flying saucer-like object in the sky. This sighting was followed by an official investigation, which was unable to provide a conclusive explanation.\n\n### San Francisco Fireworks and Stories of Landings\n\nOn July 1, 1947, a group of people in San Francisco reported seeing a flying saucer-like object in the sky. Some speculated that the object might have landed in the city, but these claims were never verified.\n\n### July 4 Press Reports\n\nAs the 4th of July approached, the flying disc craze reached new heights. On July 4, 1947, a group of newspapers reported on the sightings and alleged landings of flying saucers. Some of these reports were sensationalized, with claims of alien encounters and government cover-ups.\n\n### Flight 105\n\nOn July 5, 1947, a group of people reported seeing a flying saucer-like object near Flight 105, a commercial airliner that was flying over the United States. This sighting was widely publicized and raised questions about the safety of commercial air travel.\n\n### Group Sightings\n\nAs the flying disc craze continued, group sightings became more common. On July 6, 1947, a group of people in Arizona reported seeing a flying saucer-like object in the sky. Other group sightings were reported in California, Nevada, and Utah.\n\n### Atomic Link Claimed\n\nSome people began to speculate that the flying saucers might be connected to the atomic bomb. On July 7, 1947, a group of people in Los Angeles reported seeing a flying saucer-like object in the sky, which they believed might be a military aircraft testing the effects of atomic radiation.\n\n### Reports Peak\n\nBy July 8, 1947, the flying disc craze had reached its peak, with reports of sightings and alleged landings coming from across the United States. The phenomenon was characterized by a mix of excitement, curiosity, and speculation, as people struggled to explain the nature and origin of these mysterious objects.\n\n### Weather Balloons, Pranks, and Hoaxes\n\nAs the flying disc craze continued, it became clear that many of the reports were exaggerated or entirely fictional. On July 9, 1947, a group of people in Hollywood, California claimed to have recovered a flying saucer, but their claims were later debunked as a hoax.\n\n### Roswell Debris\n\nOn July 8, 1947, a group of people in Roswell, New Mexico reported finding debris from a crashed flying saucer. This report was widely publicized and sparked a wave of speculation about the nature and origin of the debris.\n\n### Reports Diminish\n\nAs the days passed, the number of flying saucer sightings and alleged landings began to diminish. On July 12, 1947, a group of people in Detroit, Michigan claimed to have recovered a flying saucer, but their claims were later debunked as a hoax.\n\n### Balloons\n\nSome experts suggested that the flying saucers might be weather balloons or other types of aerial objects. On July 13, 1947, a group of people in California reported seeing a flying saucer-like object in the sky, which was later identified as a weather balloon.\n\n### Twin Falls Recovered Disc Hoax\n\nOn July 14, 1947, a group of people in Twin Falls, Idaho claimed to have recovered a flying saucer, but their claims were later debunked as a hoax.\n\n### Reports Subside\n\nBy July 15, 1947, the flying disc craze had largely subsided, with only a few scattered reports of sightings and alleged landings remaining.\n\n### Crash at Kelso\n\nOn July 16, 1947, a group of people in Kelso, Washington reported seeing a flying saucer-like object in the sky, which crashed to the ground. This report was widely publicized and sparked a wave of speculation about the nature and origin of the object.\n\n### Public Awareness\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze raised public awareness of the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the existence of unidentified flying objects. The phenomenon sparked a wave of interest in astronomy and space exploration, and paved the way for future research into the subject.\n\n### Maps and Table of Reports\n\nA map of the United States showing the locations of reported flying saucer sightings and alleged landings during the summer of 1947 can be found below. A table of reports can also be found below:\n\n**Maps and Table of Reports**\n\n[Insert map and table of reports]\n\n**Contemporary Interpretations**\n\n### Technological\n\nSome people interpreted the flying saucers as advanced technological devices, possibly developed by the military or other organizations. This interpretation was fueled by reports of alleged landings and recoveries of flying saucers.\n\n### Conventional\n\nOthers interpreted the flying saucers as conventional aircraft or balloons, which were mistaken for something more exotic.\n\n### Behavioral\n\nSome people interpreted the flying saucers as a manifestation of psychological or behavioral phenomena, such as mass hysteria or folie à plusieurs.\n\n### Interplanetary\n\nMany people interpreted the flying saucers as evidence of extraterrestrial life and the existence of other intelligent beings in the universe.\n\n### Biological\n\nSome people interpreted the flying saucers as living organisms, which were capable of flight and other forms of movement.\n\n### Eschatological\n\nSome people interpreted the flying saucers as signs of the end of the world or other apocalyptic events.\n\n### Occult\n\nSome people interpreted the flying saucers as evidence of occult or supernatural phenomena, such as spirits or demons.\n\n### Esoteric\n\nSome people interpreted the flying saucers as evidence of esoteric or mystical knowledge, which was beyond the understanding of conventional science.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n### Flying Saucer Conspiracy Theories\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze sparked a wave of conspiracy theories about the nature and origin of the flying saucers. Some people believed that the government or other organizations were covering up evidence of extraterrestrial life or advanced technology.\n\n### Roswell Conspiracy Theory\n\nThe Roswell incident, in which a group of people claimed to have recovered a flying saucer, sparked a wave of speculation about the nature and origin of the object. Some people believed that the government was covering up evidence of extraterrestrial life or advanced technology.\n\n### Project Mogul and Skyhook\n\nThe 1947 flying disc craze also sparked interest in Project Mogul, a secret military project that was testing the use of balloons and other aerial devices for surveillance and reconnaissance. Some people believed that the flying saucers were connected to Project Mogul or other military projects.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Flying Saucer\n* Roswell Incident\n* Project Mogul\n* Skyhook\n* UFO\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n* \"The Flying Saucer Era\" by Richard B.

The party has its roots in the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a prominent regional party in Tamil Nadu. The AIADMK was formed in 1972 by M. G. Ramachandran (MGR), a popular actor and film producer, who was a key figure in the DMK.\n\n**Ideology and policies**\n\n### Culture\n\nThe AIADMK's ideology is centered around the principles of Dravidian movement, which emphasizes the distinct cultural and linguistic identity of the Dravidian-speaking people of South India. The party advocates for the promotion of Tamil language, culture, and traditions. The AIADMK has been a strong supporter of the Tamil language and has implemented several schemes to promote its use in government and public institutions.\n\n### Economy\n\nThe AIADMK's economic policies focus on promoting industrial development, particularly in the fields of textiles, food processing, and IT. The party has been instrumental in attracting investments to Tamil Nadu and has implemented several initiatives to improve the business environment in the state. The AIADMK has also been a strong advocate for the development of infrastructure, including roads, ports, and airports.\n\n### Social justice\n\nThe AIADMK has a strong commitment to social justice and has implemented several schemes to benefit the marginalized sections of society, including the poor, women, and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The party has also been a strong advocate for the rights of the Dalit community and has implemented several initiatives to promote their empowerment.\n\n### State water policy\n\nThe AIADMK has been a strong advocate for the development of water resources in Tamil Nadu. The party has implemented several initiatives to improve water management and has invested heavily in the construction of dams, canals, and other water infrastructure projects. The AIADMK has also been a strong supporter of the Thirumayam project, a major irrigation project in the state.\n\n### Environment and nature\n\nThe AIADMK has been a strong advocate for environmental protection and has implemented several initiatives to promote conservation and sustainable development. The party has been instrumental in the establishment of several national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in Tamil Nadu and has implemented several schemes to promote eco-tourism.\n\n**History**\n\n### M. G. Ramachandran era (1972–87)\n\nThe AIADMK was formed in 1972 by M. G. Ramachandran, a popular actor and film producer. Ramachandran was a key figure in the DMK, but he had a falling out with the party's leader, C. N. Annadurai, and decided to form his own party. The AIADMK quickly gained popularity and won the 1977 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, with Ramachandran becoming the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.\n\n### Succession conflict between the Janaki and Jayalalithaa factions\n\nAfter Ramachandran's death in 1987, the AIADMK was plunged into a succession crisis. Two factions emerged, one led by Janaki Ramachandran, Ramachandran's wife, and the other led by Jayalalithaa, a popular actress and Ramachandran's close associate. The Janaki faction was supported by the DMK, while the Jayalalithaa faction was supported by several other parties, including the Communist Party of India (Marxist).\n\n### J. Jayalalithaa era (1989–2016)\n\nJayalalithaa emerged as the leader of the AIADMK in 1989 and went on to become the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in 1991. She was a highly popular leader and implemented several initiatives to promote economic development, social justice, and environmental protection. Jayalalithaa also expanded the AIADMK's reach beyond Tamil Nadu, contesting elections in other states, including Puducherry.\n\n### Expansion beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry\n\nDuring her tenure, Jayalalithaa expanded the AIADMK's reach beyond Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The party contested elections in several other states, including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala. Jayalalithaa also established a strong presence in the Indian Parliament, with several AIADMK members winning seats in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.\n\n**V. K. Sasikala and T. T. V. Dhinakaran era (2016–17)**\n\nAfter Jayalalithaa's death in 2016, V. K. Sasikala, Jayalalithaa's close associate, emerged as the leader of the AIADMK. Sasikala was supported by T. T. V. Dhinakaran, Jayalalithaa's nephew. However, the Sasikala-Dhinakaran faction was soon expelled from the AIADMK by the party's general council.\n\n**O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami era (2017–22)**\n\nAfter the Sasikala-Dhinakaran faction was expelled, O. Panneerselvam, a veteran AIADMK leader, emerged as the interim leader of the party. Panneerselvam was later replaced by Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in 2017. Palaniswami's government implemented several initiatives to promote economic development, social justice, and environmental protection.\n\n**Edappadi K. Palaniswami era (2022–present)**\n\nIn 2022, Edappadi K. Palaniswami was replaced as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu by M. K. Stalin, the leader of the DMK. However, Palaniswami remains the leader of the AIADMK.\n\n**Electoral performance**\n\n### Indian general elections\n\nThe AIADMK has contested several Indian general elections, with varying degrees of success. In the 2019 Indian general election, the party won 1 seat in the Lok Sabha.\n\n### State legislative assembly elections\n\nThe AIADMK has won several state legislative assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, including the 1977, 1980, 1984, 1991, 2001, 2006, and 2011 elections. In the 2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, the party won 66 seats.\n\n**Current office bearers and prominent members**\n\nThe AIADMK has several prominent members, including Edappadi K. Palaniswami, O. Panneerselvam, and Annapa Kumari.\n\n**List of party leaders**\n\n### General Secretaries\n\n* M. G. Ramachandran (1972–87)\n* Jayalalithaa (1989–2016)\n* V. K.

The movement's ideology and policies have been shaped by various conceptions of Jewish identity, including racial ones. This article explores the evolution of racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism, from its early stages to the present day.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe relationship between Zionism and Jewish identity has been complex and multifaceted. Zionism has been characterized by a range of ideologies, from liberal to radical, and has often been seen as a response to anti-Semitism and the persecution of Jews in Europe. However, Zionism has also been criticized for its racial and exclusionary conceptions of Jewish identity, which have been used to justify the displacement of non-Jews and the suppression of Palestinian national identity. This article examines the development of racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism, including their historical context, impact, and ongoing significance.\n\n**Literature Review**\n\nThe literature on Zionism and Jewish identity is extensive and diverse, reflecting a range of perspectives and debates. Some scholars have argued that Zionism is a form of Jewish nationalism that emphasizes the importance of a Jewish homeland and the rights of Jews to self-determination. Others have seen Zionism as a form of imperialism that has imposed its will on the Palestinian people and suppressed their national identity (Pappé, 2006). The concept of Jewish identity has been the subject of intense debate, with some scholars arguing that it is a fluid and dynamic concept that has evolved over time (Shenhav, 2006), while others have seen it as a fixed and essentialized concept that is tied to a common Jewish ancestry (Ezrahi, 2012).\n\n**History**\n\n### Background\n\nThe modern concept of Jewish identity emerged in the late 19th century, during the period of Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) in Europe. This movement emphasized the importance of education, culture, and self-improvement among Jews, and sought to integrate them into European society (Biale, 1992). However, the Haskalah also had a darker side, as it often emphasized the idea of a universal Jewish mission and the need for Jews to return to their ancestral homeland (Halpern, 2000). This idea of a Jewish mission and the need for a homeland would later become a central theme in Zionist ideology.\n\n### Early Zionism\n\nThe early Zionist movement, which emerged in the late 19th century, was characterized by a range of ideologies and conceptions of Jewish identity. The movement's founder, Theodor Herzl, saw Zionism as a form of Jewish nationalism that would allow Jews to escape anti-Semitism and establish a homeland in Palestine (Herzl, 1896). However, Herzl's Zionism was also marked by a racial and exclusionary conception of Jewish identity, which emphasized the idea of a common Jewish ancestry and the need for Jews to be separate from non-Jews (Herzl, 1896). This conception of Jewish identity would later become a central theme in Zionist ideology.\n\n### 1948–1960s\n\nThe establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 marked a significant turning point in the history of Zionism. The new state was established on the basis of a Jewish and democratic constitution, which emphasized the importance of Jewish identity and the rights of Jews to self-determination (Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1948). However, the establishment of Israel also led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, who were forced to flee their homes and live as refugees in neighboring countries (Pappé, 2006). This displacement, which became known as the Nakba or \"catastrophe\" in Arabic, was a traumatic event that had a profound impact on the Palestinian people and their national identity.\n\n### 1960s–2000\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a significant shift in the politics of Zionism, as the movement became increasingly focused on the issue of Jewish settlement in the occupied territories (Pappé, 2006). The Israeli government, which had initially seen the occupied territories as a temporary measure, began to view them as a permanent part of the Jewish homeland (Shapira, 2006). This view was reflected in the construction of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, which were seen as a way of asserting Jewish control over the land (Pappé, 2006). However, the construction of settlements also led to the displacement of Palestinian communities and the suppression of their national identity.\n\n### The Genome Era: 2000 to the Present\n\nThe 2000s saw a significant shift in the science of genetics, as the discovery of the human genome and the development of DNA testing technology allowed for the identification of genetic markers and the tracing of ancestry (Reardon, 2005). This technology has been used in a number of contexts, including the study of Jewish identity and the tracing of Jewish ancestry (Reardon, 2005). However, the use of genetic testing to identify Jewish identity has also been criticized, as it has been seen as a form of essentialism that reduces Jewish identity to a set of genetic markers (Shenhav, 2006).\n\n### Race and Non-Jews\n\nThe concept of Jewish identity has often been seen as a racial or ethnic concept, which emphasizes the idea of a common Jewish ancestry and the need for Jews to be separate from non-Jews (Ezrahi, 2012). However, this concept of Jewish identity has also been criticized, as it has been seen as exclusionary and racist (Pappé, 2006). The concept of Jewish identity has also been used to justify the displacement of non-Jews and the suppression of Palestinian national identity (Pappé, 2006). This has led to a range of criticisms and debates about the nature of Jewish identity and its relationship to Zionism.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism have had a profound impact on the Palestinian people and their national identity. The displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in 1948, and the ongoing construction of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, have led to the suppression of Palestinian identity and the erasure of their history (Pappé, 2006). The use of genetic testing to identify Jewish identity has also been criticized, as it has been seen as a form of essentialism that reduces Jewish identity to a set of genetic markers (Shenhav, 2006). This has led to a range of debates and criticisms about the nature of Jewish identity and its relationship to Zionism.\n\n**See Also**\n\n* Zionism\n* Jewish identity\n* Palestinian nationalism\n* Nakba\n* Jewish settlements\n* Genetic testing\n* Essentialism\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis article is intended to provide a neutral and informative overview of the racial conceptions of Jewish identity in Zionism.

It is celebrated on March 8th of every year and has a history dating back to the early 20th century.\n\n# History\n\n## Origins\n\nThe origins of International Women's Day are closely tied to the women's suffrage movement in the United States and Europe. The first Women's Day was held in 1908 in New York City, where 15,000 women marched through the streets to demand better wages, shorter working hours, and voting rights. The event was organized by the Socialist Party of America and was a significant milestone in the fight for women's rights.\n\n## The Russian Revolution and Communist countries\n\nIn 1910, Clara Zetkin, a German socialist and women's rights activist, proposed the idea of an International Women's Day at the Second International Conference of Socialist Women in Copenhagen. The proposal was adopted, and the first International Women's Day was celebrated in 1911 in Austria, Denmark, and Switzerland. The event gained momentum in the following years, with more countries participating in 1913 and 1914. In 1917, the Russian Revolution led to the establishment of the Soviet Union, and International Women's Day became a national holiday in the country. The Soviet Union played a significant role in promoting International Women's Day, and it became a celebration of women's achievements and contributions to society.\n\n## Other countries, 1920s to 1960s\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, International Women's Day gained popularity in countries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The event was used as a platform to promote women's rights, including voting rights, equal pay, and access to education and employment opportunities. In the 1960s, International Women's Day became a focal point for the feminist movement, with women around the world demanding greater equality and representation.\n\n## Second–wave feminism\n\nThe second-wave feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s saw a significant increase in participation and activism around International Women's Day. Women's groups and organizations used the event to raise awareness about issues such as reproductive rights, domestic violence, and equal pay. The event also became a platform for women's voices and experiences to be heard, with many women sharing their stories and struggles with the world.\n\n## Adoption by United Nations\n\nIn 1975, the United Nations (UN) recognized International Women's Day as an official holiday, and in 1977, the General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. The UN has since used International Women's Day as a platform to promote women's rights and gender equality. In 2000, the UN adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which included a goal to promote gender equality and empower women.\n\n## Adoption by corporations\n\nIn recent years, International Women's Day has been adopted by corporations and businesses around the world. Many companies use the event as an opportunity to promote women's rights and gender equality, and to celebrate the achievements of women in their organizations. Some companies also use the event as a platform to launch new initiatives and programs aimed at promoting women's empowerment and development.\n\n# International Women's Day by year\n\n## 1995\n\nIn 1995, the Fourth World Conference on Women was held in Beijing, China, marking a significant milestone in the fight for women's rights and gender equality.

It emerged as a response to perceived corruption, abuse of power, and theological issues within the Catholic Church, leading to a significant split within Christianity.\n\n**Terminology**\n\nThe term \"Reformation\" comes from the Latin \"reforma,\" meaning \"reform\" or \"to make anew.\" It refers to the movement's goal of reforming the Christian Church, rather than establishing a new church. The movement is also known as the Protestant Reformation, as it led to the emergence of Protestant branches within Christianity.\n\n**Background**\n\n### Calamities\n\nThe 14th century was marked by a series of calamities, including the Black Death, which devastated Europe and led to significant social, economic, and cultural changes. The plague caused widespread panic, leading to increased suspicion and hostility towards the Catholic Church, which was seen as unable or unwilling to prevent the disaster.\n\n### Late Medieval Christianity\n\n#### Institutions\n\nThe Catholic Church was a powerful institution, owning vast lands, controlling education, and wielding significant influence over politics and society. However, its institutions, such as the monasteries and the Papal States, were often corrupt and inefficient.\n\n#### Clergy\n\nThe clergy, including bishops and priests, were seen as detached from the common people and more concerned with their own material wealth and power than with serving the faithful. Many clergy were also accused of simony, nepotism, and other abuses.\n\n#### Papacy\n\nThe Papacy was criticized for its centralized power, nepotism, and corruption. The Popes were seen as more concerned with their own power and wealth than with guiding the Church towards spiritual renewal.\n\n#### Partial and failed institutional reforms\n\nIn the 14th century, the Catholic Church attempted to reform itself through the Conciliar Movement, which sought to limit the power of the Papacy and promote council-based decision-making. However, this movement ultimately failed to achieve its goals, and the Papacy continued to exert its authority.\n\n### Humanism and lay religion\n\nHumanism, a cultural and intellectual movement that emphasized the study of classical texts and individualism, emerged in the 14th century. This led to a growing interest in lay piety and the development of devotional literature, which emphasized personal spiritual experience and the importance of individual faith.\n\n### Dissidents\n\nDissident groups, such as the Flagellants and the Brethren of the Free Spirit, emerged in the 14th century, criticizing the Catholic Church and its institutions. These groups often advocated for a more radical form of Christianity, emphasizing individual spiritual experience and the rejection of ecclesiastical authority.\n\n**Beginnings**\n\n### Luther and the Ninety-five Theses\n\nIn 1517, Martin Luther, a German theologian and Augustinian monk, published his Ninety-five Theses, criticizing the Catholic Church's practice of selling indulgences. This marked the beginning of the Reformation, as Luther's ideas spread rapidly throughout Europe.\n\n### New theology\n\nLuther's theology emphasized justification by faith alone, the authority of Scripture, and the priesthood of all believers. This new theology challenged the traditional Catholic understanding of salvation and the role of the Church.\n\n### Spread\n\nLuther's ideas spread quickly throughout Europe, and other reformers, such as Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin, emerged to promote similar ideas. The Reformation movement gained momentum, as more and more people began to question the authority of the Catholic Church.\n\n### Resistance and oppression\n\nThe Catholic Church responded to the Reformation with resistance and oppression, condemning reformers and their ideas as heretical.

It is owned and operated by Arena Operating, LLC, and has been a prominent venue for various events, including professional wrestling, boxing, mixed martial arts, and concerts.\n\n**History**\n\n### 1920–1985: Freight house\n\nThe 2300 Arena has its origins as a freight house, constructed in the 1920s as part of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad. The building was originally designed to store and transfer freight, serving as a critical hub for the railroad network.\n\n### 1986–2002: South Philly Vikings management\n\nIn the late 1980s, the building was converted into a sports venue, hosting various events, including professional wrestling and boxing matches. The South Philly Vikings, a regional sports promotion, managed the venue during this period, bringing in notable acts such as the WWF (now WWE) and ECW.\n\n#### Extreme Championship Wrestling residency, 1993–2001\n\nIn 1993, Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) signed a lease with the South Philly Vikings to become the primary tenant of the arena. ECW held numerous events at the venue, featuring notable wrestlers such as Tommy Dreamer, Rob Van Dam, and The Sandman. The ECW Arena, as it was known, became synonymous with the promotion's hard-hitting, in-your-face style of professional wrestling.\n\n### 2002–2003: Xtreme Pro Wrestling management\n\nAfter ECW's departure, the Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW) promotion took over the management of the arena. XPW hosted several events at the venue, showcasing its own roster of wrestlers, including Rob Black and Corporal Robinson.\n\n### 2004–2012: Roger Artigiani management\n\nIn 2004, Roger Artigiani, a local businessman, acquired the management rights to the arena. Artigiani, a long-time fan of professional wrestling, oversaw a range of events, including concerts, boxing matches, and mixed martial arts events.\n\n#### Peltz and Hand residency, 2004–2009\n\nDuring Artigiani's tenure, the arena became a regular venue for the Peltz and Hand promotion, which featured a mix of boxing and mixed martial arts events. The partnership with Peltz and Hand helped to establish the 2300 Arena as a premier destination for combat sports in the Philadelphia area.\n\n#### Asylum Fight League naming rights, 2010–2012\n\nIn 2010, the arena's management secured a naming rights deal with the Asylum Fight League (AFL), a regional mixed martial arts promotion. The partnership saw the arena rebranded as the Asylum Arena, and the AFL became the primary tenant of the venue.\n\n### 2012–2013: Arena Operating, LLC management\n\nIn 2012, the management rights to the arena changed hands once again, this time to Arena Operating, LLC, a company owned by Roger Artigiani. Artigiani's company oversaw a range of events, including concerts, boxing matches, and mixed martial arts events.\n\n### 2013–present: Roger Artigiani management\n\nIn 2013, Roger Artigiani's company, Arena Operating, LLC, regained management of the 2300 Arena. Artigiani continues to oversee a range of events at the venue, including concerts, boxing matches, and mixed martial arts events.\n\n**Notable events**\n\n### Professional wrestling\n\nThe 2300 Arena has hosted numerous professional wrestling events, including:\n\n* ECW's Hardcore Homecoming series (2005-2007)\n* ROH's Philadelphia events (2005-2012)\n* TNA's Impact! tapings (2009-2010)\n* WWE's NXT TakeOver: Philadelphia (2018)\n\n### Professional boxing\n\nThe arena has hosted several notable boxing events, including:\n\n* The 2010 bout between Yoel Judah and Ron Brown\n* The 2011 bout between Brandon Rios and Richard Abril\n* The 2012 bout between Marco Antonio Rubio and Joel Dahi\n\n### Cultural\n\nThe 2300 Arena has also played host to various cultural events, including:\n\n* Concerts by artists such as Boyz II Men and TLC\n* Comedy shows featuring comedians such as Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock\n* Fashion shows and charity events\n\n**Records**\n\n### Professional wrestling\n\n* Most matches held at the 2300 Arena: ECW (over 100 events)\n* Most consecutive sold-out shows: WWE's NXT TakeOver: Philadelphia (2018) - 3 shows\n* Highest attendance: ECW's Hardcore Homecoming (2006) - 2,500 fans\n\n### Professional boxing\n\n* Most bouts held at the 2300 Arena: 2010 - 12 bouts\n* Most consecutive undefeated fighters: 5 (2010-2011)\n* Highest gate: $250,000 (2011)\n\n### Mixed martial arts\n\n* Most events held at the 2300 Arena: Asylum Fight League (over 20 events)\n* Most consecutive sold-out shows: Asylum Fight League (2010-2011) - 5 shows\n* Highest attendance: Asylum Fight League (2011) - 2,200 fans\n\n**Promotional history**\n\n### Professional wrestling\n\n* ECW (1993-2001)\n* ROH (2005-2012)\n* TNA (2009-2010)\n* WWE (2018)\n\n### Professional boxing\n\n* 2010 - 12 bouts\n* 2011 - 8 bouts\n* 2012 - 10 bouts\n\n### Mixed martial arts\n\n* Asylum Fight League (2010-2012)\n* Ring of Honor MMA (2012-2013)\n\n### Concerts\n\n* Boyz II Men (2005)\n* TLC (2006)\n* Eddie Murphy (2007)\n* Chris Rock (2008)\n\n### Training\n\n* The 2300 Arena offers training facilities for various martial arts disciplines, including boxing, wrestling, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.\n\n**Special features**\n\n### Hardcore Hall of Fame\n\nThe 2300 Arena features a Hardcore Hall of Fame, dedicated to the history and legacy of hardcore professional wrestling.\n\n### Bar 2300\n\nThe arena has a on-site bar, Bar 2300, which offers a range of drinks and snacks to patrons.\n\n**Transportation access**\n\nThe 2300 Arena is conveniently located near several public transportation options, including:\n\n* SEPTA buses ( Routes 17, 23, 39, and 48)\n* SEPTA Market-Frankford Line (at 10th Street Station)\n* PATCO Speedline (at 8th Street Station)\n\n**References**\n\nThis article has been written based on publicly available information and does not include any citations or references.\n\n**External links**\n\n* Official website of the 2300 Arena\n* Official website of Arena Operating, LLC", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"2300_Arena\" following this outline:\n\n#History\n##1920–1985: Freight house\n##1986–2002: South Philly Vikings management\n###Extreme Championship Wrestling residency, 1993–2001\n##2002–2003: Xtreme Pro Wrestling management\n##2004–2012: Roger Artigiani management\n###Peltz and Hand residency, 2004–2009\n###Asylum Fight League naming rights, 2010–2012\n##2012–2013: Arena Operating, LLC management\n##2013–present: Roger Artigiani management\n#Notable events\n##Professional wrestling\n##Professional boxing\n##Cultural\n#Records\n##Professional wrestling\n##Professional boxing\n##Mixed martial arts\n#Promotional history\n##Professional wrestling\n##Professional boxing\n##Mixed martial arts\n##Concerts\n##Training\n#Special features\n##Hardcore Hall of Fame\n##Bar 2300\n#Transportation access\n#References\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

They were a significant power in the region from the 4th to the 1st centuries BC, playing a crucial role in the history of ancient Italy.\n\n**Etymology**\n\nThe name \"Samnites\" is derived from the ancient Oscan word \"Sammnit\", which is thought to be related to the root \"samm\", meaning \"mountain\". This name likely refers to the mountainous terrain of the region where the Samnites lived.\n\n**History**\n\n### Origins and early history\n\nThe origins of the Samnites are unclear, but it is believed that they emerged as a distinct people in the 4th century BC. They were likely descended from the ancient Italic peoples who inhabited the region before the arrival of the Osci. The Samnites were initially a nomadic people, living in small villages and subsisting on agriculture, herding, and hunting. As their numbers grew, they began to settle in larger towns and cities, eventually forming a complex society with a strong warrior culture.\n\n### Samnite Wars\n\nThe Samnites were a major power in ancient Italy, and their wars with other peoples are well-documented. The Samnite Wars, fought from 326 to 290 BC, were a series of conflicts between the Samnites and the Romans. The wars were sparked by a combination of factors, including border disputes, economic rivalries, and a desire for expansion. The Samnites were ultimately defeated by the Romans, but their wars had a significant impact on the development of the Roman Republic.\n\nThe Samnites also fought wars with other peoples, including the Osci, the Greeks, and the Etruscans. These conflicts were often sparked by border disputes, trade rivalries, and a desire for expansion. The Samnites were known for their bravery and military prowess, and they played a significant role in shaping the history of ancient Italy.\n\n### Later history\n\nAfter the Samnite Wars, the Samnites continued to play a significant role in ancient Italian politics. They were a major power in the region during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, and they often found themselves at odds with the Romans. In the 1st century BC, the Samnites were absorbed into the Roman Empire, and they became a subject people. Despite this, the Samnites continued to maintain their cultural identity and traditions, and they played a significant role in shaping the history of the Roman Empire.\n\n**Society**\n\n### Economy\n\nThe Samnites were a largely agricultural society, with a strong emphasis on farming, herding, and hunting. They were known for their expertise in metallurgy, particularly in the production of copper, bronze, and iron. The Samnites also traded extensively with other peoples, exchanging goods such as wine, olive oil, and grains for metals, textiles, and other luxury items.\n\n### Government\n\nThe Samnites were a federal republic, with a system of government that was divided into smaller city-states and tribal units. Each city-state and tribal unit had its own government, with a council of elders and a chief magistrate. The Samnites also had a system of laws, known as the \"Lex Samnitia\", which governed the behavior of citizens and the relationship between the city-states and the tribal units.\n\n### Military\n\nThe Samnites were known for their bravery and military prowess, and they were one of the most feared armies in ancient Italy. They were equipped with a range of armor and weaponry, including swords, spears, and shields. The Samnites were particularly known for their use of the \"gladius\", a short sword that was designed for close combat.\n\n#### Armor\n\nThe Samnites wore a range of armor, including helmets, breastplates, and greaves. Their helmets were often decorated with intricate designs and patterns, and were designed to protect the head and neck from injury. The Samnites also wore a type of armor known as the \"lorica\", which was a quilted garment made from leather or fabric.\n\n#### Weaponry\n\nThe Samnites were skilled in the production of a range of weapons, including swords, spears, and shields. Their swords were known for their sharpness and durability, and were often decorated with intricate designs and patterns. The Samnites also used a type of spear known as the \"pilum\", which was designed for throwing and had a long, heavy shaft.\n\n**Culture**\n\n### Religion\n\nThe Samnites were a polytheistic people, with a range of gods and goddesses that were associated with different aspects of life and nature. Their main gods and goddesses included Jupiter, Mars, and Minerva, who were associated with the sky, war, and wisdom, respectively. The Samnites also had a number of festivals and rituals, including the \"Festival of the Gods\", which was a major celebration of the harvest season.\n\n### Gender roles\n\nIn Samnite society, men and women had distinct roles and responsibilities. Men were expected to be strong and brave, and were often involved in military and economic activities. Women, on the other hand, were expected to be domestic and nurturing, and were often involved in household and childcare duties. However, women also played a significant role in Samnite society, and were often involved in trade and commerce.\n\n### Art\n\nThe Samnites were skilled in a range of artistic traditions, including pottery, sculpture, and metalwork. Their art often featured intricate designs and patterns, and was often decorated with symbols and motifs that were associated with their gods and goddesses. The Samnites also produced a range of ceramics, including vessels and figurines, which were often decorated with colorful designs and patterns.\n\n### Clothing\n\nThe Samnites wore a range of clothing, including tunics, cloaks, and hats. Their clothing was often made from wool or linen, and was often decorated with intricate designs and patterns. The Samnites also wore a type of footwear known as the \"calceus\", which was a type of sandal or slipper.\n\n### Recreation\n\nThe Samnites enjoyed a range of recreational activities, including sports, games, and festivals. They were particularly known for their love of chariot racing, which was a popular sport throughout ancient Italy. The Samnites also enjoyed playing games such as dice and board games, which were often played in public spaces and taverns.\n\n### Cities and engineering\n\nThe Samnites built a range of cities and infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and aqueducts. Their cities were often built on hills or mountains, and were designed to take advantage of the natural terrain. The Samnites also developed a range of engineering techniques, including the use of arches and vaults, which allowed them to build complex structures such as aqueducts and bridges.\n\n**Notable Samnites**\n\n### Leaders of the Samnites\n\nThe Samnites had a number of notable leaders throughout their history, including:\n\n* Papirius Cursor, who was a key leader in the Samnite Wars and was known for his bravery and military prowess.\n* Gaius Pontius, who was a leader of the Samnites during the 3rd century BC and was known for his diplomacy and strategic thinking.\n* Lucius Porcius Licinus, who was a leader of the Samnites during the 2nd century BC and was known for his bravery and military skill.\n\n### Social War leaders\n\nThe Samnites also had a number of notable leaders during the Social War, including:\n\n* Gaius Papius Mutilus, who was a leader of the rebels and was known for his bravery and military skill.\n* Gaius Pontius Telesinus, who was a leader of the rebels and was known for his diplomacy and strategic thinking.\n\n### Romans of Samnite origin\n\nA number of notable Romans were of Samnite origin, including:\n\n* Tiberius Gracchus, who was a Roman general and statesman who was of Samnite origin.\n* Gaius Marius, who was a Roman general and statesman who was of Samnite origin.\n* Marcus Furius Camillus, who was a Roman statesman and general who was of Samnite origin.\n\n### Catholic Popes\n\nA number of Catholic Popes were of Samnite origin, including:\n\n* Pope Felix I, who was a Pope of Samnite origin and was known for his role in the development of the Catholic Church.\n* Pope Marcellus I, who was a Pope of Samnite origin and was known for his role in the development of the Catholic Church.\n* Pope Felix III, who was a Pope of Samnite origin and was known for his role in the development of the Catholic Church.\n\n**See also**\n\n* Samnite Wars\n* Roman Republic\n* Italic peoples\n* Osci\n* Greeks\n* Etruscans\n* Social War\n* Catholic Church\n\n**References**\n\n* Livy, Ab Urbe Condita\n* Plutarch, Life of Camillus\n* Strabo, Geographica\n* Polybius, Histories\n* Cato the Elder, Origines\n\n**Bibliography**\n\n* Cornell, T.

The search was authorized by a federal court warrant and was related to an ongoing investigation into the handling of classified documents.\n\n**Handling, storage, and disposition of U.S. government records**\n\nIn the United States, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is responsible for the handling, storage, and disposition of federal government records.

The order requires that declassification decisions be made in writing and that the decision be documented in the agency's files.\n\n**Protocols for loss or compromise of classified material**\n\nIn the event of a loss or compromise of classified material, government agencies are required to follow specific protocols to mitigate the damage.

The documents revealed that the FBI had seized 11 sets of documents and other materials from Trump's team.\n\n**Seized materials**\n\nThe seized materials included:\n\n* 11 sets of documents with classification markings\n* 1 set of documents without classification markings\n* 1 empty folder with a red \"top secret\" sticker\n* 1 folder with a \"top secret\" sticker\n* 1 folder with a \"confidential\" sticker\n* 1 USB drive\n\n**Missing materials**\n\nThe search warrant and property receipt revealed that some materials were missing from the boxes seized by the FBI.\n\n**Motions to release search warrant affidavit**\n\nIn September 2022, Trump's team filed a motion to release the search warrant affidavit, which detailed the reasons for the search.\n\n**Release of redacted search warrant affidavit**\n\nIn October 2022, the Department of Justice released a redacted version of the search warrant affidavit.\n\n**Release of detailed property list**\n\nIn November 2022, the Department of Justice released a detailed property list of the materials seized by the FBI.\n\n**Trump v.

Established in the early 17th century, the fort changed hands multiple times, serving as a key military outpost, administrative center, and commercial hub for various European powers and American colonists.\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nThe history of Fort Amsterdam is inextricably linked with the development of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, which was established in the early 17th century. The fort's strategic location on the southern tip of Manhattan Island made it an ideal location for trade, commerce, and military operations. Throughout its history, Fort Amsterdam was an important symbol of power, influence, and control in the region.\n\nEstablishment (1621–1660)\n-------------------------\n\nFort Amsterdam was established in 1626 by the Dutch West India Company, which had been granted a charter by the Dutch government to trade and settle in the region. The fort was built on the southern tip of Manhattan Island, near the present-day location of the Battery Park City. Initially, the fort was a small wooden structure, but it was later expanded and fortified with earthworks and stone walls. The fort served as the administrative center of the Dutch colony, and its establishment marked the beginning of European settlement in the region.\n\nDuring this period, the Dutch West India Company established trade relationships with the local Lenape Native American tribe, and the fort became an important center for the fur trade. The Dutch also established a system of governance, with a director and councilors appointed to oversee the colony's affairs.\n\nEnglish rule (1664–1673)\n------------------------\n\nIn 1664, the English, under the leadership of King Charles II, sent a fleet of ships to New Netherland to assert their claim to the region. The English took control of the fort, and the Dutch colonists were forced to surrender. The English renamed the fort \"New York,\" after the Duke of York, who later became King James II. During this period, the English imposed their own system of governance, laws, and taxation on the colony.\n\nHowever, the English rule was not without its challenges. The Dutch colonists, who had established a thriving agricultural and commercial economy, were resistant to English rule and continued to maintain their own system of governance. The English also faced opposition from the local Native American tribes, who were unhappy with the loss of their land and the imposition of English rule.\n\nDutch rule (1673–1674)\n------------------------\n\nIn 1673, the Dutch recaptured the fort and the surrounding region, restoring Dutch rule to the colony. The Dutch re-established their system of governance, laws, and trade relationships with the local Native American tribes. However, the English were not willing to give up their claim to the region, and the Dutch were eventually forced to return control to the English in 1674.\n\nEnglish rule (1674–1689)\n-------------------------\n\nDuring this period, the English re-established their system of governance, laws, and taxation on the colony. However, the English also faced opposition from the local Native American tribes, who were unhappy with the loss of their land and the imposition of English rule. The English also established a system of administrative centers, including the establishment of the colony's first court of law.\n\nColonist rule (1689–1691)\n---------------------------\n\nIn 1689, a group of English colonists, led by Jacob Leisler, seized control of the colony and established a new system of governance. Leisler and his followers established a council of 12 men, who were elected to govern the colony. However, the English government refused to recognize the council and instead sent a military force to restore English rule. Leisler was eventually captured and executed, and the English re-established their control over the colony.\n\nBritish rule (1691–1775)\n--------------------------\n\nDuring this period, the British re-established their system of governance, laws, and taxation on the colony. The British also established a system of administrative centers, including the establishment of the colony's first general assembly. The British also imposed their own system of commerce and trade, including the establishment of a monopoly on the fur trade.\n\nPrelude to the revolution\n-------------------------\n\nAs the 18th century progressed, tensions between the British government and the American colonists grew. The British imposed a series of taxes on the colonists, including the Sugar Act, the Stamp Act, and the Townshend Acts. The colonists, who had grown increasingly resentful of British rule, opposed the taxes and established a series of boycotts and protests.\n\nColonist rule (1775–1776)\n---------------------------\n\nIn 1775, a group of American colonists, led by George Washington, seized control of the colony and established a new system of governance. The Continental Congress, which had been established earlier in the year, declared independence from Great Britain and established the United States of America. The Continental Army, led by Washington, was established to defend the new nation against the British.\n\nBritish rule (1776–1783)\n-------------------------\n\nDuring this period, the British re-established their control over the colony, but the American colonists were determined to maintain their independence. The Continental Army, led by Washington, fought a series of battles against the British, including the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Battle of Long Island, and the Battle of Saratoga.\n\nAmerican rule (1783–1790)\n-------------------------\n\nIn 1783, the British signed the Treaty of Paris, which recognized American independence. The United States of America was officially established, and the American people were finally free from British rule.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* New York City\n* New Netherland\n* Lenape Native American tribe\n* Dutch West India Company\n* British rule in the American colonies\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* The history of Fort Amsterdam is complex and multifaceted, and this article has attempted to provide a brief overview of the key events and developments in the fort's history.\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n* Further reading:\n\n* \"A History of New York City\" by Kenneth T.

It was the fifth election to be held in four years, and the first to be held under a new electoral system. The election was called after the Knesset was dissolved in August 2022, following the collapse of the previous government.\n\n# Background\n\nThe 2022 election was preceded by a period of political instability in Israel, with several governments forming and collapsing in quick succession. The previous government, led by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, had been formed in June 2021 and had been in power for just over a year when it collapsed in June 2022. The government had been a national unity government, comprising several parties from across the Israeli political spectrum, including the Likud, Blue and White, and the United Arab List. However, the parties were unable to agree on a budget, and the government ultimately collapsed.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the government, President Isaac Herzog dissolved the Knesset and called for new elections. The election was scheduled to be held on 1 November 2022, with the new Knesset to be sworn in on 15 November.\n\n# Campaign\n\nThe campaign for the 2022 election was highly competitive, with several parties vying for seats in the new Knesset. The Likud, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, was seen as a strong contender for the election, having won the most seats in the previous election. However, Netanyahu faced opposition from several other parties, including the Blue and White, led by Benny Gantz, and the Yamina party, led by Naftali Bennett.\n\nThe campaign was also marked by controversy, with several parties engaging in negative advertising and personal attacks on their opponents. The Likud was accused of running a particularly aggressive campaign, with several of its candidates facing criticism for their comments on social media.\n\n# Timeline\n\n* 23 August 2022: The Knesset is dissolved, and new elections are called for 1 November 2022.\n* 1 September 2022: The Central Election Committee announces that the election will be held using a new electoral system, in which voters will have the option to vote for a party or a candidate.\n* 16 October 2022: The campaign for the election begins, with parties launching their campaigns and releasing their candidate lists.\n* 26 October 2022: The first of several debates is held, with candidates from several parties participating.\n* 30 October 2022: The campaign ends, with parties launching their final appeals to voters.\n* 1 November 2022: The election is held, with voters going to the polls to cast their ballots.\n* 2 November 2022: The results of the election are announced, with the Likud emerging as the largest party.\n* 15 November 2022: The new Knesset is sworn in, with the Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu being re-elected as Prime Minister.\n\n# Electoral system\n\nThe 2022 election was held under a new electoral system, in which voters had the option to vote for a party or a candidate.

The incident occurred in April 2021, during the tenure of Keir Starmer as the party's leader. The event drew comparisons to **Partygate**, a scandal involving the UK Conservative government's handling of lockdown restrictions.\n\n**#Durham event**\n\nThe controversy began on April 30, 2021, when the **Daily Mirror** published photographs of Labour Party officials, including Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner, drinking beer and eating food in Durham, northeast England. The event took place in the garden of a private residence, where the party officials had gathered for a social event.\n\nAt the time, the UK was under strict COVID-19 lockdown rules, which prohibited social gatherings and restricted social interaction. The photographs sparked outrage and accusations that Labour Party officials had breached these rules.\n\n**##Video footage**\n\nFurther evidence emerged in the form of video footage, which showed Labour Party officials, including Starmer and Rayner, consuming food and drink in a garden setting. The footage was obtained by the **Daily Mirror** and published in the following days.\n\nThe video footage and photographs sparked widespread criticism of the Labour Party's handling of lockdown restrictions. Many accused the party officials of hypocrisy, given their repeated calls for the government to adhere to lockdown rules.\n\n**#Response to Partygate**\n\nThe Labour Party's response to the controversy drew parallels with the **Partygate** scandal, which had engulfed the Conservative government in recent weeks. The Conservative government had been criticized for hosting social events and gatherings in Downing Street, despite the lockdown restrictions.\n\nIn a statement, the Labour Party acknowledged that the event had taken place, but denied any wrongdoing. The party claimed that the gathering was a \"work event\" and that the officials had adhered to the necessary safety protocols.\n\nThe response drew criticism from opposition MPs and the media, who accused the Labour Party of hypocrisy and double standards. The party's response was seen as inadequate, given the gravity of the situation.\n\n**#Initial police review**\n\nThe police launched an initial review of the matter, which concluded that no further action would be taken. The decision was widely criticized, with many accusing the police of a lack of thoroughness in their investigation.\n\nThe review was seen as a missed opportunity to hold the Labour Party officials accountable for their actions. The lack of transparency and accountability in the review process only fueled the controversy.\n\n**##Calls for further investigation**\n\nIn response to the initial review, many called for a further investigation into the matter. Opposition MPs and the media demanded that the police reopen the case and conduct a more thorough investigation.\n\nThe calls for a further investigation were largely ignored by the police, who maintained that no further action was necessary. The decision was seen as a failure to hold the Labour Party officials accountable for their actions.\n\n**#Police investigation**\n\nThe police eventually launched a full-scale investigation into the matter, following weeks of pressure from opposition MPs and the media.\n\nThe investigation was led by the Durham Police, which had been accused of a lack of thoroughness in their initial review. The police issued questionnaires to the key figures involved in the event, including Starmer and Rayner.\n\nThe investigation was seen as a significant development in the controversy, as it marked a shift in the police's approach to the matter. The police were now taking the allegations seriously and were committed to getting to the bottom of the story.\n\n**##Start of investigation**\n\nThe police investigation began in earnest, with the police issuing questionnaires to the key figures involved in the event. The questionnaires were designed to gather information and evidence about the event, and to establish whether any wrongdoing had taken place.\n\nThe start of the investigation marked a significant turning point in the controversy, as it marked a shift in the police's approach to the matter. The police were now taking the allegations seriously and were committed to getting to the bottom of the story.\n\n**##New allegations**\n\nAs the investigation progressed, new allegations emerged about the Labour Party's handling of lockdown restrictions. The allegations included claims of further breaches of the rules and allegations of a cover-up.\n\nThe new allegations were met with widespread criticism, as they added to the sense of scandal and outrage surrounding the Labour Party. The party's leadership was under increasing pressure to come clean about their handling of the crisis.\n\n**##Starmer's and Rayner's resignation pledges**\n\nIn a bid to defuse the crisis, Starmer and Rayner pledged to resign if the police investigation found that they had breached lockdown rules. The pledge was seen as a significant development in the controversy, as it marked a shift in the Labour Party's approach to the crisis.\n\nThe pledge was met with skepticism, as many questioned whether the Labour Party's leadership was genuinely committed to accountability and transparency. The move was seen as a PR stunt, designed to deflect criticism and avoid accountability.\n\n**##Responses to pledges**\n\nThe response to the pledges was mixed, with some welcoming the move and others expressing skepticism. The Labour Party's leadership was accused of trying to spin the situation and avoid accountability.\n\nThe response to the pledges highlighted the deep divisions within the Labour Party, as some members and supporters expressed support for the leadership's efforts to defuse the crisis. Others, however, were more critical, accusing the party of hypocrisy and double standards.\n\n**##Police questionnaires**\n\nThe police issued questionnaires to the key figures involved in the event, including Starmer and Rayner. The questionnaires were designed to gather information and evidence about the event, and to establish whether any wrongdoing had taken place.\n\nThe issuance of questionnaires marked a significant development in the investigation, as it marked a shift in the police's approach to the matter. The police were now taking the allegations seriously and were committed to getting to the bottom of the story.\n\n**##Outcome**\n\nThe outcome of the investigation was widely anticipated, as it marked the culmination of a long and complex controversy. The police ultimately concluded that Starmer and Rayner had breached lockdown rules, but that they had not done so intentionally.\n\nThe outcome was met with widespread criticism, as it was seen as a watered-down verdict that failed to hold the Labour Party's leadership accountable for their actions. The decision was seen as a failure to uphold the law and to maintain public trust in the police.\n\n**##Responses to the outcome**\n\nThe response to the outcome was mixed, with some welcoming the decision and others expressing outrage. The Labour Party's leadership was accused of trying to spin the situation and avoid accountability.\n\nThe response to the outcome highlighted the deep divisions within the Labour Party, as some members and supporters expressed support for the leadership's efforts to defuse the crisis.

The two scandals shared many similarities, including allegations of hypocrisy and double standards.\n\nThe Beergate controversy also drew parallels with other scandals involving Labour Party officials, including the **Waggate** scandal, which had emerged in 2016.

The city of Sievierodonetsk, the administrative center of Luhansk Oblast, was a strategic location due to its proximity to the Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts, and its control was crucial for the Russian military to advance further into the Donbas region.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn early 2022, tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated, leading to a full-scale invasion by Russian forces on February 24, 2022. The Russian military had been building up its forces along the Ukraine-Russia border for weeks, and the invasion was carried out with a massive display of military might. The city of Sievierodonetsk, with a pre-war population of around 140,000, was an important stronghold for the Ukrainian military in the Luhansk Oblast.\n\nThe Russian military aimed to capture the city and secure a foothold in the region, while the Ukrainian forces fought to defend their territory and prevent the Russian advance. The battle was part of a larger conflict between the two armies, with multiple fronts and battles taking place throughout Ukraine.\n\n**Battle**\n\nThe battle for Sievierodonetsk began on February 24, 2022, when Russian forces launched a massive artillery bombardment of the city. The shelling was intense, with reports of heavy artillery, rockets, and even cluster munitions being used. The Ukrainian military responded with their own artillery and rocket fire, but the Russian forces had a significant advantage in terms of firepower and numbers.\n\n#### Encirclement attempts\n\nThe Russian military attempted to encircle the city, cutting off escape routes and supply lines for the Ukrainian forces. They established a ring of control around Sievierodonetsk, making it difficult for the Ukrainian military to receive aid or evacuate civilians. The encirclement was partially successful, but the Ukrainian forces managed to hold out and maintain a connection to the outside world.\n\n#### Attack on the city\n\nAs the battle raged on, Russian forces launched a series of attacks on the city, trying to capture key infrastructure and strongpoints. The Ukrainian military fought fiercely, but they were outnumbered and outgunned. The Russian forces slowly but steadily pushed deeper into the city, capturing key buildings and areas.\n\n#### Ukraine rejects surrender ultimatum\n\nOn April 25, 2022, the Russian military issued an ultimatum to the Ukrainian forces, demanding that they surrender within 24 hours. The ultimatum was rejected by the Ukrainian military, who vowed to continue fighting to defend their city. The rejection was seen as a significant boost to Ukrainian morale, and it stiffened the resolve of the Ukrainian forces to resist the Russian advance.\n\n#### Fall of Sievierodonetsk\n\nOn June 24, 2022, the Russian forces finally captured the city of Sievierodonetsk, marking a significant victory for the Russian military. The city was left in ruins, with widespread destruction and a significant loss of life. The fall of Sievierodonetsk marked a turning point in the battle for the Donbas region, with the Russian forces gaining a strategic foothold in the area.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe battle for Sievierodonetsk was one of the bloodiest and most intense conflicts of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The city was left in ruins, with widespread destruction and a significant loss of life. The battle marked a significant turning point in the conflict, with the Russian forces gaining a strategic foothold in the Donbas region.\n\nThe battle had significant humanitarian implications, with thousands of civilians displaced and many more trapped in the besieged city. The conflict also had significant economic implications, with the destruction of infrastructure and industry in the region.\n\n**Casualties**\n\nThe exact number of casualties in the battle for Sievierodonetsk is difficult to determine, but it is estimated that thousands of people were killed or wounded in the conflict. The majority of the casualties were civilians, who were caught in the crossfire and trapped in the besieged city.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe battle for Sievierodonetsk was a significant conflict in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

It was a significant seismic event that caused widespread destruction and loss of life in the country.\n\n## Tectonic setting\n\nAfghanistan is located in a seismically active region, where the Indian tectonic plate is colliding with the Eurasian plate. This collision has created a complex geological structure, with numerous faults and folds that have formed over millions of years. The Khost Province, where the earthquake occurred, is situated in the eastern part of the country, near the boundary between the Indian and Eurasian plates. The region is characterized by a high level of seismic activity, with numerous earthquakes occurring in the area over the years.\n\n## Characteristics\n\nThe June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake was a shallow earthquake, with a focal depth of approximately 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.2 on the Richter scale, with a maximum intensity of VIII (severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The earthquake's epicenter was located in the Khost Province, approximately 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) southwest of the city of Khost.\n\n## Intensity\n\nThe earthquake's intensity was felt across a wide area, with reports of damage and casualties reported in several provinces, including Khost, Paktia, Paktika, and Logar. The maximum intensity was reported in the Khost Province, where the earthquake's epicenter was located. The earthquake's intensity decreased with distance from the epicenter, with reports of moderate damage and shaking reported in the neighboring provinces.\n\n## Aftershocks\n\nThe June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake was followed by a series of aftershocks, with over 50 earthquakes occurring in the days following the main event. The largest aftershock occurred on June 23, 2022, with a magnitude of 5.1 on the Richter scale. The aftershocks caused further damage and disruption to the affected areas, making it difficult for rescue teams to access the area.\n\nImpact\n\n## Afghanistan\n\nThe June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake caused widespread destruction and loss of life in the country. The earthquake's impact was most severe in the Khost Province, where the earthquake's epicenter was located. The earthquake damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, schools, and other infrastructure, leaving many people homeless. The earthquake also caused significant damage to roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure, making it difficult for rescue teams to access the affected areas.\n\nAccording to reports, over 1,000 people were killed in the earthquake, with over 3,000 injured. Many more people were left homeless, with thousands of families displaced by the disaster. The earthquake's impact was exacerbated by the country's fragile economic and humanitarian situation, which has been worsened by decades of conflict and poverty.\n\n## Pakistan\n\nThe June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake also had an impact on neighboring Pakistan. The earthquake's intensity was felt in several provinces of Pakistan, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. Reports of damage and casualties were limited, but the earthquake caused significant disruption to trade and commerce in the region.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe aftermath of the June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake was marked by a significant response from the international community. The United Nations and other international organizations, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, mobilized resources and personnel to support the affected areas.\n\nDomestic response\n\nThe domestic response to the June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake was led by the Government of Afghanistan, which declared a state of emergency in the affected provinces. The government deployed troops and emergency responders to the affected areas, where they worked to rescue those trapped, provide medical care, and distribute food and shelter to those in need.\n\nInternational response\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States was one of the first countries to respond to the June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake. The US Department of State issued a statement expressing condolences to the people of Afghanistan and announcing a $3 million donation to support humanitarian efforts in the country. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) also dispatched a team of humanitarian experts to the affected areas to assess the situation and provide support.\n\n## International organizations\n\nThe June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake was also met with a significant response from international organizations. The United Nations launched an appeal for $45 million to support humanitarian efforts in the country, which was met with a rapid response from donors. The Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement also mobilized resources and personnel to support the affected areas, working closely with local authorities and other humanitarian agencies.\n\nSee also\n\n* List of earthquakes in Afghanistan\n* List of earthquakes in 2022\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n* Afghanistan Earthquake Response Situation Report\n* United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)\n* Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement\n* USAID Humanitarian Assistance for Afghanistan\n\nExternal links\n\n* United States Agency for International Development (USAID)\n* United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\n* European Union Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO)\n* International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)", "prompt": "Write a complete Wikipedia-style article in English about \"June_2022_Afghanistan_earthquake\" following this outline:\n\n#Earthquake\n##Tectonic setting\n##Characteristics\n##Intensity\n##Aftershocks\n#Impact\n##Afghanistan\n##Pakistan\n#Aftermath\n#Domestic response\n#International response\n##United States\n##International organizations\n#See also\n#References\n#Further reading\n#External links\n\n\nRequirements:\n1.

The memoir has sparked widespread interest and debate, with many readers and commentators weighing in on its content and implications.\n\n**Background and writing**\n\nPrince Harry began working on the memoir in 2020, reportedly with the help of a ghostwriter. The process was said to be grueling, with the prince pouring over his memories and experiences to craft a narrative that would accurately reflect his life. In a series of interviews, Harry described the writing process as \"therapeutic\" and \"cathartic,\" allowing him to process and come to terms with the challenges and traumas he had faced.\n\nThe memoir took nearly two years to complete, with Harry reportedly working on it for several hours a day while also attending to his royal duties and family life. The book's title, Spare, is a reference to Harry's place in the line of succession, as well as his own feelings of being \"spare\" or overlooked by his family.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nThe memoir is divided into several sections, each covering a different period of Harry's life.

The prince describes how he struggled to come to terms with his father's infidelity and his decision to marry Camilla, particularly in the aftermath of his mother's death.\n\nThe book also covers Harry's relationship with his brother, William, including the tensions and rivalries that emerged between them as they grew older. The prince recalls the stress and pressure he felt in the lead-up to William's wedding to Kate Middleton, as well as the disappointment and hurt he felt when William and Kate chose not to have him walk them down the aisle.\n\nThe memoir also touches on Harry's relationship with Caroline Flack, the British television presenter and model. The prince describes how he and Flack had a brief romantic relationship, but ultimately parted ways due to their differing priorities and values.\n\n### Relationship with Meghan and fatherhood\n\nThe memoir covers Harry's meeting and romance with Meghan Markle, as well as their decision to get married and start a family.

The prince recalls the joy and wonder he felt when he met Archie, his son with Meghan, and the love and devotion he has for his family.\n\n### Stepping back from royal role\n\nThe memoir concludes with Harry's decision to step back from his royal role and pursue a more private life with his family. The prince describes how he and Meghan made this decision after a series of disagreements and conflicts with the royal family, particularly his father and brother.\n\nThe book explores the tensions and challenges that emerged between Harry and his family as he pursued his new path, including the stress and pressure he felt as a result of the media scrutiny and public attention. The prince also describes how he and Meghan have worked to build a new life for themselves, free from the constraints and expectations of the royal family.\n\n**Release**\n\nSpare was published on January 10, 2023, by Penguin Random House.

Union of India**\n\nThe Supreme Court of India's landmark judgment in Supriyo v. Union of India (2021) was a significant development in the country's LGBTQ+ rights movement. The case revolved around the issue of same-sex marriage and the recognition of ancillary rights for same-sex couples.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Indian Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to all citizens, including the right to equality, freedom of expression, and the right to life and personal liberty. However, the country's laws and social norms have often been at odds with these constitutional guarantees, particularly when it comes to LGBTQ+ individuals. The Supriyo v. Union of India case was a crucial step towards recognizing the rights of same-sex couples and challenging the country's heteronormative framework.\n\n**Case Summary**\n\nThe case involved a petition filed by Supriyo, a trans man, and his partner, seeking recognition of their marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The petitioners argued that their marriage was valid and should be recognized by the state, despite the fact that the Hindu Marriage Act does not explicitly permit same-sex marriages.\n\n**Intervenors**\n\n### Government\n\nThe central government intervened in the case, arguing that the Hindu Marriage Act did not permit same-sex marriages and that any such recognition would be a violation of the Constitution. The government also argued that the issue was a matter of personal law and that the court should not interfere with the religious traditions of the Hindu community.\n\n### Religious Organisation\n\nThe All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind (JUH) intervened in the case, arguing that the court should not recognize same-sex marriages as they were contrary to Islamic law and tradition. The AIMPLB and JUH also argued that the court's decision would have far-reaching consequences for the Muslim community and would undermine the authority of Islamic law.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe case highlights the complexities and challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in India. Despite the country's progress in recognizing the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, same-sex couples continue to face significant barriers in accessing marriage and other ancillary rights.

The team is controlled by the Croatian Football Federation, the governing body of football in Croatia. Croatia has participated in several international tournaments, including the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship.\n\n**History**\n\n### Official formation\n\nThe Croatia national team was formed in 1990, after Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia. The team made its debut in 1990 against Bulgaria, losing 4-0.\n\n### Blažević period (1994–1999)\n\nThe first manager of the team was Miroslav Blažević, who led the team from 1994 to 1999. During his tenure, Croatia qualified for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, but lost in the quarterfinals to France. Blažević also led the team to a third-place finish in the 1996 European Championship qualifying campaign.\n\n### Jozić, Barić and Kranjčar period (2000–2006)\n\nIn 2000, the team was managed by Vlado Milinić, who was replaced by Otto Barić in 2002. Barić led the team to a second-place finish in the 2004 European Championship qualifying campaign, but was sacked after a poor performance in the 2006 World Cup qualifying campaign. Tomislav Ivić's assistant, Krunoslav Jurčić, took over as caretaker manager, but was replaced by Slaven Bilić in 2006.\n\n### Bilić period (2006–2012)\n\nBilić led the team to a second-place finish in the 2008 European Championship qualifying campaign, but was sacked in 2012 after a poor performance in the 2012 European Championship. Bilić's tenure was marked by a significant improvement in the team's performance, with a 4-1 victory over England in a friendly match and a 2-1 victory over Turkey in the 2012 European Championship.\n\n### Štimac, Kovač and Čačić period (2012–2017)\n\nAfter Bilić's departure, the team was managed by Slaven Bilić's assistant, Ante Čačić, who was replaced by Niko Kovač in 2013. Kovač led the team to a second-place finish in the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign, but was sacked after a poor performance in the 2016 European Championship qualifying campaign. Ante Čačić returned as caretaker manager, but was replaced by Igor Štimac in 2017.\n\n### Dalić period (since 2017)\n\nŠtimac was sacked in 2017 after a poor performance in the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign, and was replaced by Zlatko Dalić. Dalić led the team to a third-place finish in the 2018 World Cup, and has since led the team to a second-place finish in the 2020 European Championship qualifying campaign.\n\n**Image**\n\n### Kits\n\nThe team's home kit is a red shirt with white shorts, while the away kit is a white shirt with red shorts.\n\n### Supporters\n\nThe team has a significant following in Croatia, with the team's matches often being played in front of a full stadium.\n\n### Charity\n\nThe team has been involved in several charity initiatives, including a campaign to raise money for the victims of the 2020 Zagreb earthquake.\n\n**Stadiums**\n\nThe team plays its home matches at the Stadion Maksimir in Zagreb, which has a capacity of over 37,000.\n\n**Results and fixtures**\n\n### 2023\n\nThe team began its 2023 campaign with a 2-1 victory over Turkey in a friendly match. The team has since played several matches in the UEFA Nations League, including a 1-0 victory over Slovenia and a 2-2 draw with Slovenia.\n\n### 2024\n\nThe team will begin its 2024 campaign with a friendly match against Argentina in March 2024.\n\n**Management**\n\n### Manager history\n\n* Miroslav Blažević (1994-1999)\n* Vlado Milinić (2000)\n* Otto Barić (2002-2006)\n* Slaven Bilić (2006-2012)\n* Ante Čačić (2012-2013)\n* Niko Kovač (2013-2016)\n* Ante Čačić (2016-2017)\n* Igor Štimac (2017-2017)\n* Zlatko Dalić (2017-present)\n\n**Players**\n\n### Current squad\n\n* Goalkeepers:\n\t+ Lovre Kalinić\n\t+ Danijel Subašić\n\t+ Dominik Livaković\n* Defenders:\n\t+ Dejan Lovren\n\t+ Domagoj Vida\n\t+ Josip Juranović\n\t+ Tin Jedvaj\n\t+ Duje Ćaleta-Car\n\t+ Matej Gonćar\n* Midfielders:\n\t+ Ivan Perišić\n\t+ Marcelo Brozović\n\t+ Luka Modrić\n\t+ Mateo Kovačić\n\t+ Nikola Vlašić\n\t+ Kristijan Jakić\n* Forwards:\n\t+ Ivan Perišić\n\t+ Bruno Petković\n\t+ Ante Rebić\n\n### Recent call-ups\n\n* Goalkeepers:\n\t+ Dominik Livaković\n\t+ Lovre Kalinić\n\t+ Adrian Šemper\n* Defenders:\n\t+ Tin Jedvaj\n\t+ Dejan Lovren\n\t+ Duje Ćaleta-Car\n* Midfielders:\n\t+ Luka Modrić\n\t+ Mateo Kovačić\n\t+ Nikola Vlašić\n\t+ Kristijan Jakić\n* Forwards:\n\t+ Ivan Perišić\n\t+ Bruno Petković\n\t+ Ante Rebić\n\n**Individual statistics**\n\n### Most appearances\n\n* Luka Modrić (154 appearances)\n* Darijo Srna (134 appearances)\n* Stipe Pletikosa (114 appearances)\n* Josip Šimunić (104 appearances)\n* Niko Kovač (94 appearances)\n\n### Top goalscorers\n\n* Davor Šuker (45 goals)\n* Ivan Perišić (33 goals)\n* Bruno Petković (26 goals)\n* Ante Rebić (24 goals)\n* Ivan Klasnić (23 goals)\n\n### Most clean sheets\n\n* Stipe Pletikosa (54 clean sheets)\n* Lovre Kalinić (24 clean sheets)\n* Danijel Subašić (22 clean sheets)\n* Dominik Livaković (20 clean sheets)\n* Vedran Runje (17 clean sheets)\n\n**Competitive record**\n\n### FIFA World Cup\n\n* 2018 World Cup: 3rd place\n\n### UEFA European Championship\n\n* 1996 European Championship: Quarterfinals\n* 2004 European Championship: Round of 16\n* 2008 European Championship: Round of 16\n* 2012 European Championship: Quarterfinals\n* 2016 European Championship: Round of 16\n* 2020 European Championship: Group stage\n\n### UEFA Nations League\n\n* 2018-19 UEFA Nations League: Group stage\n* 2020-21 UEFA Nations League: Group stage\n* 2022-23 UEFA Nations League: Group stage\n\n### Other\n\n* Mediterranean Games: 3rd place (2009)\n* UEFA European Under-21 Championship: Runner-up (2000)\n\n**Head-to-head record**\n\n* vs. Albania: 5-1 (5)\n* vs. Andorra: 5-0 (3)\n* vs. Armenia: 4-1 (3)\n* vs. Austria: 2-2 (12)\n* vs. Azerbaijan: 4-0 (2)\n* vs. Belgium: 2-1 (5)\n* vs. Bosnia and Herzegovina: 2-2 (10)\n* vs. Bulgaria: 2-1 (8)\n* vs. Czech Republic: 2-2 (13)\n* vs. Denmark: 0-0 (5)\n* vs. England: 0-1 (11)\n* vs. Estonia: 1-0 (5)\n* vs. Faroe Islands: 2-0 (5)\n* vs. Finland: 2-0 (10)\n* vs. France: 0-2 (15)\n* vs. Germany: 2-1 (13)\n* vs. Greece: 0-2 (14)\n* vs. Hungary: 0-0 (10)\n* vs. Iceland: 2-1 (7)\n* vs. Israel: 2-0 (7)\n* vs. Italy: 2-1 (13)\n* vs. Kazakhstan: 2-1 (3)\n* vs. Kosovo: 2-1 (1)\n* vs. Latvia: 7-0 (2)\n* vs. Liechtenstein: 5-0 (2)\n* vs. Lithuania: 3-0 (2)\n* vs. Luxembourg: 2-0 (5)\n* vs. Malta: 4-1 (5)\n* vs. Netherlands: 1-0 (8)\n* vs. Northern Ireland: 1-1 (7)\n* vs. Norway: 1-1 (12)\n* vs. Poland: 2-2 (8)\n* vs. Portugal: 0-1 (11)\n* vs. Republic of Ireland: 0-1 (9)\n* vs. Romania: 4-1 (5)\n* vs. Russia: 1-0 (9)\n* vs. San Marino: 7-0 (1)\n* vs. Scotland: 2-1 (7)\n* vs. Serbia: 2-2 (9)\n* vs. Slovakia: 3-2 (7)\n* vs. Slovenia: 2-0 (6)\n* vs. Spain: 2-2 (12)\n* vs. Sweden: 1-1 (8)\n* vs. Switzerland: 2-0 (12)\n* vs. Turkey: 3-3 (8)\n* vs. Ukraine: 0-0 (6)\n* vs. Wales: 2-1 (7)\n\n**FIFA ranking history**\n\n* Highest ranking: 7 (June 1996)\n* Lowest ranking: 125 (August 1994)\n* Current ranking: 12 (January 2023)\n\n**Honours**\n\n### Major competitions\n\n* 2018 World Cup: Third place\n* 2020 European Championship: Runner-up\n\n### Friendly\n\n* 2012 friendly match against Serbia: 2-0\n* 2013 friendly match against Chile: 1-0\n* 2014 friendly match against Argentina: 2-1\n* 2015 friendly match against Luxembourg: 4-0\n* 2016 friendly match against San Marino: 10-0\n* 2017 friendly match against Greece: 4-1\n* 2018 friendly match against Senegal: 2-1\n* 2019 friendly match against Georgia: 2-1\n* 2020 friendly match against Norway: 1-1\n\n**See also**\n\n* Croatia national under-21 football team\n* Croatia national under-20 football team\n* Croatia national under-19 football team\n* Croatia national under-18 football team\n* Croatia national under-17 football team\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The team's home stadium is the Stadion Maksimir in Zagreb.\n* The team's head coach is Zlatko Dalić.\n* The team's captain is Luka Modrić.\n\n**References**\n\n* Croatian Football Federation.
